32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,040
If the Yangtze River is used
for grain transport,

33
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,480
these ten points are the most important

34
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,430
as they are controlled
by four water gangs.

35
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,030
Among the four water gangs,

36
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,160
Weng Dayou of Hanshui Gang

37
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,830
on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River
is the most relevant.

38
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,670
Well…

39
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,390
Some days ago,

40
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,920
our master saved Weng Dayou

41
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,280
right at a station of Longzhu Gang.

42
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,640
This guy has been really picky

43
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,030
since he boarded at Xiazhou.

44
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,870
He complained about
our searching in the darkness

45
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,400
and our taking the wrong river course.

46
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,520
He drank his own liquor

47
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,120
and fainted away in less than two hours.

48
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,720
He had to rush back
to the Silver City as soon as possible.

49
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,800
If he really died

50
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,950
on our boat,

51
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,070
it would be a bad omen indeed.

52
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,960
He was poisoned with lead

53
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,440
which had a very strong smell.

54
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,120
The victim should have noticed it.

55
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:16,950
So far as I know,

56
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,560
some rich people in the south

57
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,750
love to add leads in liquors

58
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,560
for longevity

59
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,840
and greater strength.

60
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,640
Greater strength?

61
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,200
This big guy is a real Lovelace.

62
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,150
How to clear the toxins for him?

63
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,310
Induce vomiting.

64
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,070
Dig some Houttuynia cordata thunbs.
The more the better.

65
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,400
Pound them, soak them in water
and feed him.

66
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,790
Xiaoqin, make some preparations!

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,840
Yes, master.

68
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:46,840
Master,

69
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,920
this guy’s identity is unknown.

70
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,950
The tattoos on his body look like

71
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,280
a sign of the water gang.

72
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,230
We should keep vigilant.

73
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,430
Forget his identity.
Saving life is the top priority.

74
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,760
Everything falls into place here.

75
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,000
How long does it take

76
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,870
for a round trip to Jia’ermu?

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,400
According to the map,

78
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,000
it will probably take half a month.

79
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,400
Half a month?

80
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,840
No, time isn’t enough.

81
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,070
We must finish the arrangement before

82
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,480
return to the Silver City from Jia’ermu.

83
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,640
I have an idea.

84
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,040
Yan Bin goes back to raise funds.

85
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,470
Weng Dayou once
left a message at the Silver City,

86
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,190
claiming he lives on the upper reaches
of the Tuojiang River.

87
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,560
You and I will set out right away

88
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,520
to meet him.

89
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,000
If Yan Bin goes back,

90
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:42,430
what should Longzhu Gang do then?

91
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,470
You can go back
to the Silver City secretly together.

92
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,310
One of you can rent the warehouse

93
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,560
and the other can watch out and contact.

94
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,710
What will you do then?

95
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,750
We will go on to Jia’ermu.

96
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,560
Master,

97
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,870
if you travel together,

98
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,750
and he is…

99
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,840
What are you thinking about? Take it easy.

100
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,310
Why are you looking at me that way?

101
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,580
= Prince Zhao’s Mansion =

102
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,430
Your Highness, Concubine De is coming.

103
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,150
Mother?

104
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,710
What is she coming here for?

105
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,000
I am not sure.

106
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,910
Her Highness invites you
to the front courtyard now.

107
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,560
Mr. Pang has also come here.

108
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,190
Mother, Uncle,

109
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,710
Take a seat.

110
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,590
Yes.

111
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,840
Liang Hongtu is the chief examiner

112
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,840
of the imperial examination this year.

113
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:56,680
His two sons

114
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,800
both succeeded in the examination

115
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,090
and ranked among the top three examinees.

116
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,240
Moreover,

117
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,520
except the top ten,

118
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,560
all the rest of rankings were sold
to children of rich merchants.

119
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,120
So, he obtained tons of money.

120
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,680
Who has impeached him?

121
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,280
Zhao Jin, vice minister of
the Ministry of Penalty.

122
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,240
Zhao…

123
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,360
Liang Hongtu is the prince’s people.

124
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:27,590
He has always had conflicts with us

125
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,710
at the royal court.

126
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,910
If Liang Hongtu

127
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,960
is convicted of

128
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,080
examination malpractice and bribery,

129
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,910
he

130
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,870
will never rise again.

131
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,510
It is good time to woo
the Ministry of Penalty

132
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:50,000
and eliminate our adversaries.

133
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,120
Mother,

134
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,190
if Liang Hongtu

135
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,310
really has examination malpractices,

136
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,510
he will be brought to justice.

137
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,430
But Zhao Jin…

138
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,310
How silly you are!

139
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,560
Every official knows that

140
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,190
Zhao Jin is loyal only to His Majesty and

141
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,510
has never involved in any party feud.

142
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,950
It means

143
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,630
his impeachment of Minister Liang

144
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,120
is an initial gift to us.

145
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,440
Tomorrow

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,920
is the sixtieth birthday of Mr. Zhao.

147
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,720
We shall offer him a gift in return

148
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,240
as a token of good faith

149
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,430
in order to win him over.

150
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,000
I will prepare the gift.

151
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,070
Tomorrow, you shall visit him early

152
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,190
to know about his idea.

153
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,950
If so,

154
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,720
I will talk to him further the other day.

155
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,160
I will leave first.

156
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,830
Take care, Uncle.

157
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,750
Zhao,

158
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,630
do you know why I invited you here?

159
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,430
Mother, I shouldn’t have cut in

160
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,310
your discussion with Uncle.

161
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,000
But I really don’t understand

162
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,120
why it is Zhao Jin.

163
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,240
Zhao,

164
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,600
don’t just look at the surface.

165
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,000
You should learn to go deeper,

166
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,000
understand?

167
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:13,630
Yes.

168
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,630
This is a water gang?

169
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,920
With the gang rule of benefiting

170
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,000
the people off the court,

171
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,720
the water gang maintains
the livelihood of the grassroots

172
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,750
and has certain conflicts of interests
with the government.

173
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,920
That is why its base is located

174
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,070
at a far and remote place.

175
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:37,480
Let’s go.

176
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,630
Make it harder.

177
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,160
You should have made it harder.

178
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,480
Sir,

179
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,600
I really appreciate your strength.

180
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,270
If you really mean it,

181
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,800
you need to

182
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,510
offer some trotters for us tonight.

183
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,750
Frankly,

184
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,070
- your eyebrows are really rare.
- There.

185
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,310
God

186
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,830
has cut them

187
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,430
in a perfect way.

188
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,720
Perfect?

189
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,360
Shit!

190
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,920
Who is that little girl?

191
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,600
I…

192
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,630
Call you big brother here.

193
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,340
= Loyalty and Brotherhood =

194
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:36,980
Master.

195
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,520
Great to see you here.

196
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,750
Good to see you, Mr. Weng.

197
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,870
Good to see you, Master Weng.

198
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,750
Master Long,

199
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,280
are you my savior?

200
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,870
Please send a message for me, girl.

201
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,750
I want to meet your master.

202
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,800
This is…

203
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,160
Our master is busy

204
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,960
and asks us to visit you.

205
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,670
What can we do for you, Mr. Weng?

206
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:09,920
I help you.

207
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,510
Take care.

208
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,070
What is the use of it?

209
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,040
Longzhu Gang saved my life.

210
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,870
I should say thank-you to your master.

211
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,160
What does your master mean?

212
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,560
Doesn’t I deserve
a meeting with your Master?

213
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:26,870
Our master said

214
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,800
Longzhu Gang is always ready
to offer a hand.

215
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,600
We are obligated to help anybody

216
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,000
in trouble on our boat.

217
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,310
But our master

218
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,950
is a righteous person.

219
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,870
The aphrodisiac liquor
that has intoxicated you

220
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,920
doesn’t seem to fit in with your identity.

221
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:40,920
Nonsense!

222
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,160
How dare you comment on me

223
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,630
as a messenger!

224
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,630
Calm down, Mr. Weng.

225
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,120
The most important thing now is

226
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,310
you take good care of yourself.

227
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,160
Our master has asked our brothers

228
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,240
to prepare your tonics.

229
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,630
We can discuss further after you recover.

230
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,030
Bye.

231
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,200
It is too late for me to recognize that

232
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,510
you saved me despite our prior conflicts.

233
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,000
I am sorry for that.

234
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,320
Come on, take a seat.

235
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,360
Thank you, sir.

236
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,550
What have you two

237
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,960
come to

238
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,960
this desolate wilderness for?

239
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,480
What can I do for you?

240
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,910
Frankly,

241
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,630
Master Li and I have come here

242
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,030
for a big deal with you.

243
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,080
Great.

244
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,200
I love a deal offered to me like this.

245
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,390
Many grain-producing areas
are attacked by disasters.

246
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,960
The loyal court will certainly increase

247
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,360
the grain transport by water.

248
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,440
The waterway grain transport

249
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,630
will certainly double in half a year.

250
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,630
We prepare to rent warehouses

251
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,840
at various big quays.

252
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,510
If your goods

253
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,440
can be stored at our warehouse,

254
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,670
we not only offer you commissions,

255
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,630
but also provide additional jobs

256
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,840
for your gang members.

257
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,120
It is a good deal for your gang indeed.

258
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,000
We are friends

259
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,510
and I have to be candid.

260
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,120
Your proposal is a good one.

261
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,390
Our people have gathered together

262
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,840
based on brotherhood.

263
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,200
Having a deal with a businessman

264
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,200
will be a subject of gossip for others.

265
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,910
I see.

266
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,790
Master Weng may have

267
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,550
some worries with businessmen like us.

268
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,360
Actually,

269
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,790
doing business reflects one’s integrity.

270
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,720
One’s personal integrity depends

271
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,600
on one’s practices instead of profession.

272
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,480
Like this teapot.

273
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,390
Tea Bowl Array?

274
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,390
Master Weng, please.

275
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,120
Drinking the middle one means loyalty.

276
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,670
I didn’t expect you know
the secret of Tea Bowl Array.

277
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,870
Yes.

278
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,360
We do the waterway grain

279
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,870
transport business also for our people

280
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,440
to make a living in lean years.

281
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,630
To be frank with you,

282
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,360
our water gang has always

283
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,600
been doing hard jobs in history.

284
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,240
My brothers follow me and work hard

285
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,000
with me just to make a living.

286
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,550
In the past years,

287
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,550
I have tried to diversify the means

288
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,870
of money-making and expand our gang.

289
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,870
It is just a test of your sincerity.

290
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,240
I didn’t expect

291
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,000
Master Li, the most successful
businessman of the Silver City,

292
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,910
is such a sincere person.

293
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,240
I am feeling

294
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,150
much more assured now.

295
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,720
Mr. Weng, thanks for your trust.

296
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,120
Somebody.
Take my Coiling Dragon Stick here.

297
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,360
Master…

298
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,870
The Coiling Dragon Stick

299
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,600
is a holy article of our gang.

300
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,550
It hasn’t been lent out in history.

301
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,510
With it, anybody can

302
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,600
command all canal gates nationwide

303
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,670
and travel smoothly along the way.

304
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,510
Thanks, Mr. Weng.

305
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,360
Master Long,

306
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,790
I have something between you and me.

307
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,030
Master Long,

308
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,030
you really have a good eye
on picking a lover.

309
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,750
Mr. Weng!

310
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,510
Call me brother.

311
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,120
Brother,

312
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,200
we are just ordinary business partners.

313
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,870
You are on the same boat anyway.

314
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,630
Not all people on the same boat

315
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,030
travel in the same direction.

316
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,320
And he has his beloved already.

317
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,480
Do you mean he is engaged or has a baby?

318
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:07,910
No.

319
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,670
What is your concern then?

320
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,150
Look!

321
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,270
He is looking at you lovingly.

322
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,270
What are you doing?

323
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,960
Keep away from me!

324
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,200
Or else,

325
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,030
I will slap on your face.

326
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,600
I will beat you.

327
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,120
What?

328
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,030
My fish.

329
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,480
Can you do anything other than robbing?

330
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,390
Robbing what?

331
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,120
Robbing a girl?

332
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,870
You are no longer

333
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,200
a silent person with stabbing words.

334
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,630
You have a glib tongue now.

335
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,120
Do you like me

336
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,910
as I am now?

337
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,080
This is my fish.

338
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,550
Go and catch by yourself.

339
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,670
Take care. It is hot.

340
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,270
Yummy!

341
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,000
Why are all businessmen of the city

342
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,670
gone in days of grain collection
and taxpaying each year?

343
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:45,490
Sir,

344
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,960
if we go too far…

345
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,670
If we don’t go far enough,

346
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,790
how can we get their money?

347

How can I go to Chang’an without gifts?

348
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,200
But,

349
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,150
Mr. Pang

350
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,030
hopes you can make it clean here.

351
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,480
Cleaning means

352
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,360
making all people black

353
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,870
instead of making myself white.

354
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,360
Register all businessmen

355
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,550
having no connection with us

356
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,030
and collect double taxes from them.

357
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,720
Arrest and punish all resisters.

358
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:21,840
Yes.

359
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
How about that issue?

360
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,440
Li Qingliu and his three companions

361
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,750
have been divided up
and are approaching the pass.

362
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:34,510
Divided up?

363
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,960
Their servants left on the way

364
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:39,200
and only two of them are left now.

365
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,440
Keep a close eye. Don’t make a mistake.

366
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:43,960
Just take it easy, sir.

367
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,200

Sir and madam, may I take your order?

380

We call you after a while.

381
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,550
Okay.

382
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,830
What do you want to eat?

383
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,680
We have eaten dried food for days.

384
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,960
It is a rare chance
to eat at a restaurant.

385
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,270
I must eat my fill today.

386
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,160
Eat your fill?

387
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,400
Come on, eat here.

388
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:39,830
Let me have a check.

389
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,640
Cut this way

390
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,680
or this way?

391
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:45,610
Steward Yan,

392
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,310
can’t you recognize me?

393
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,590
The owner of the Tao Shop
in the north of the Silver City.

394
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,000
What are you doing here?

395
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,880
Don’t you know the Silver City

396
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,920
is in chaos now?

397
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,680
How dare you have a meal here?

398
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,110
We have just returned.

399
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,400
What happened?

400
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,200
The commissioner arrested hundreds of

401
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,790
merchants in the Silver City.

402
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,920
Why did Du Changfeng do that?

403
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,400
They said it was to crack down
upon illegal businessmen.

404
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,400
No more chat.

405
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,310
I must escape from here right away.

406
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,720
See you!

407
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,590
See you!

408

It is really strange.

409
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,440
I think we must

410
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,070
tell our masters.

411
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,270
We are far away from them.

412
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,350
How to tell them?

413
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,350
Let’s hurry into the city now

414
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,030
and finish my master’s task right way.

415
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,310

Sir, please stop for a while.

419
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,270
We have traveled for a whole day.

420
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,590
Let’s take a rest here.

421
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,350
Okay.

422
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,440
Is the pass

423
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,480
right on the other side of the mountain?

424
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,590
After grazing horse, we will set out and

425
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,830
can reach there tonight.

426
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,400
Is there anybody else

427
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,790
other than soldiers there?

428
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,680
Is it a big place?

429
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,270
Are you wondering

430
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,830
if that place has any restaurant?

431
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,960
I am starving now. Answer me.

432
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,350
The pass is a strategic point.

433
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,160
How can there be any restaurant there?

434
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,760
Master, there is a horse thief.

435
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,200
Horse.

436
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,250
Go.

437
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:25,750
Go.

438
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:29,640
Go.

439
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,240
Wait for me.

440
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:33,920
Go.

441
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,730
Go.

442
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,790
Who is that thief?

443
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,680
Stand up!

444
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,960
You fall down so easily?

445
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,270
Don’t pretend to be dead.

446
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,590
You…

447
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,720
Calm down.

448
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,240
It isn’t appropriate for a man to cry.

449
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,400
I am Animu.

450
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,400
I escaped from my tribe.

451
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,030
For any crime?

452
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,790
To escape from marriage.

453
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,480
Escape from marriage?

454
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,830
A man escaping from marriage?

455
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,160
Do you think it is credible?

456
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,110
It may not be a big deal

457
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,030
for you.

458
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,830
But it is for me.

459
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,590
I had no choice

460
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,110
but to borrow your horse.

461
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,030
Please

462
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,550
just

463
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,750
forgive me.

464
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,680
He is there. Go and get him.

465
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,000
What shall we do then?

466
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,440
It is late.

467
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Find a place to stay firstly.

468
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,030
Are you dismantling home, Your Highness?

469
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:32,680
Answer me.

470
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,590
Where is my
Gold-coated Dragon-in-cloud Sword?

471
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:36,640
Isn’t that

472
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,920
your favorite treasure?

473
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,680
Yes, it was still here yesterday.

474
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,070
But it is gone today.

475
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,030
Yes, I remember.

476
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,480
The steward said

477
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,400
Her Highness gave it to…

478
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,350
Mr. Zhao.

479
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,400
Give it?

480
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,750
How can she…

481
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,590
Mother!

482
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,520
I asked the cook to cook some soup

483
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,030
for you to dissipate your heat inside.

484
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,510
I have no appetite.

485
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,790
You have much heat inside,

486
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:14,310
so, you are restless and have no appetite.

487
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,270
Mother,

488
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,590
did you ask somebody to

489
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,030
take away my sword?

490
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,680
Exactly!

491
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,030
Your uncle knew

492
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,110
Minister Zhao loved sword collection.

493
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,960
So, I gave it to him as a gift.

494
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,830
Do you know

495
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,960
it is my favorite?

496
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,750
It is only valuable

497
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,240
when Minister Zhao loves it.

498
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,640
Do you take everything

499
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,750
as a tool

500
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,640
tradable for powers?

501
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,960
It is just a sword.

502
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,550
If you like it,

503
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,350
I can ask them to make one for you.

504
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,200
Just forget it.

505
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,960
You only read these useless books

506
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,550
in the study every day.

507
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,000
They have deprived your ambitions.

508
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,640
Attend the birthday party

509
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,240
of Minister Zhao with your uncle tonight.

510
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,400
You must offer the gift to him personally.

511
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,350
Mother,

512
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,240
I just don’t understand

513
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,640
why you must ally with him instead of

514
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,440
many other senior officials at the court.

515
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,880
The Ministry of Penalty has always

516
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,750
been out of our control.

517
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:32,510
The Vice Minister of Penalty
has great powers in hand and

518
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,550
even the prince is trying to win him over.

519
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,400
We can’t miss this opportunity.

520
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,680
But that son of bitch is really…

521
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,240
Shut up!

522
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,200
You must be tolerant.

523
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,510
The personal hatred

524
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,440
is already the past.

525
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,110
If you really want to revenge,

526
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,480
we can do it

527
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,070
when our family

528
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,160
controls the imperial powers one day.

529
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,920
If you like the sword,

530
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,350
I can make one for you again.

531
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,510
It is too wet here.

532
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,600
The goods are all soaked.

533
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,360
Good, good, good.

534
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,950
- Get her down.
- Good.

535
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,230
- Where is here?
- Beautiful!

536
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:28,990
- Good.
- Go ahead.

537
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,310
Judging from the tribal flag,

538
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,600
it should be Zheluo Tribe

539
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,710
which was separated from Bailanqiang.

540
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,130
Good.

541
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,020
Good.

542
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,180
Good, good.

543
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,470
It is very boisterous there.

544
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,400
Let’s go and have a look.

545
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:47,470
Wait.

546
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,230
The tribe here seldom
has contact with the outside world.

547
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,440
Leave it to me

548
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,510
if any accident happens later.

549
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,030
Get her down.

550
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:53,750
I see.

551
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:54,250
Good.

552
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:54,790
Get her down.

553
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,280
Uncle Han, tie the horse.

554
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:04,100
Good.

555
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,280
Good.

556
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,330
Good.

557
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:11,740
Make it harder.

558
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,280
Get her down.

559
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:12,660
Go ahead.

560
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,590
Make it harder.

561
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:14,580
Go ahead.

562
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,180
Good.

563
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,520
Good.

564
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,480
Good.

565
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:20,970
Go ahead.

566
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,300
Make it harder.

567
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:25,830
Dabaru!

568
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:26,960
Make it harder.

569
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:29,080
Women’s wrestling, I love it.

570
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,400
- Look at that person.
- Make it harder.

571
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:36,980
Good.

572
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:37,640
Good.

573
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,240
Isn’t that buy the horse thief?

574
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,750
Why is he arrested?

575
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:47,810
Good, good, good.

576
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,880
Good.

577
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,510
Marvelous, really marvelous!

578
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:07,870
Get her down.

579
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,490
Get her down.

580
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,200
Good.

581
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,600
Good, good, good.

582
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,990
Dabaru, Dabaru, Dabaru.

583
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,920
The winner of this battle is

584
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,360
No. 1 Warrior,

585
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,950
Dabaru!

586
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,270
She will win the marriage with Animu.

587
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,260
Good.

588
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,920
I already have my beloved.

589
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,080
Why do you have to

590
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,920
force me to the corner?

591
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,200
Our Zheluo Tribe is a warlike tribe.

592
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,550
Women rule in our tribe

593
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,360
and even the man of our leader

594
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,600
has no right of speech.

595
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,360
Unless you are no longer a member,

596
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,360
you must obey the rule

597
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,030
without exception.

598
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,200
Any violator

599
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,240
will be expelled and

600
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,500
sent to Coyote Lake in exile.

601
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,410
Why?

602
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,170
- Who is that?
- Who is that?

603
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,820
Who is this young girl?

604
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,100
Madam,

605
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,690
I don’t think it is logical

606
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,580
and unfair.

607
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,210
Don’t make troubles.

608
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,780
He said he has his beloved.

609
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,450
Why do you have to separate them?

610
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,980
Because of your rules?

611
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:28,610
Somebody!

612
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,170
Tie up this alien sissy

613
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,410
who keeps talking nonsense here.

614
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:33,890
Wait a minute.

615
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:36,780
Our tribe respects martial arts

616
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,450
and advocates fairness.

617
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:41,340
Fairness is got on the wrestling field.

618
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,310
If you defeat Dabaru,

619
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,440
you will make the decision.

620
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,240
Who is that? She sounds very tough.

621
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,720
She is Yuwuaji, our leader’s daughter,

622
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,030
and our future leader.

623
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,350
You are a reasonable person.

624
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,440
I'll seek fairness on the wrestling field.

625
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,030
It is too dangerous. Don’t go there.

626
00:30:59,270 --> 00:30:59,920
Come on.

627
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,260
Dabaru.

628
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,630
Dabaru.

629
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:25,830
Dabaru.

630
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:38,170
Dabaru.

631
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,040
Let me do it.

632
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:39,650
Dabaru.

633
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,190
I don’t need your help.

634
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:40,730
Withdraw from here.

635
00:31:44,280 --> 00:32:02,040
Dabaru.

636
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:02,690
Shit!

637
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,130
This guy falls ill whenever

638
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,130
he is in close contact with a girl.

639
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,060
Take it.

640
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,080
Dabaru.

641
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:10,520
Dear all…

642
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,080
Dabaru!

643
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,210
It is a critical moment on the field.

644
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:15,100
Let me help you relax a little bit.

645
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,610
It is

646
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,930
a gift from the Silver City.

647
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,780
It is tea.

648
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,450
It can clear summer heat,

649
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:24,160
make you prettier and slim your figure.

650
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,340
Off the circle.

651
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,820
Li Qingliu, great job.

652
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,620
How is it possible?

653
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,410
Dabaru is defeated.

654
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:42,820
Sorry.

655
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,810
He defeats Dabaru.

656
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:44,980
Impossible!

657
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,260
Really powerful.

658
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,540
Didn’t you expect it today?

659
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:01,930
Young leader,

660
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,300
can you release him now?

661
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,890
The battle is over.

662
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:15,980
We have to leave now.

663
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,160
Wait a minute.

664
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,100
May I know your names?

665
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:22,890
Well…

666
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,060
Of course, you can.

667
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,210
We are both Li.

668
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,450
He is the elder Li
and I am the younger Li.

669
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:36,820
Heroes,

670
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,980
it is late today.

671
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,100
Please take a rest in our tribe.

672
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,340
Well…

673
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,130
Okay, why not?

674
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:46,300
Let’s go.

675
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:56,020
Go.

676
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:58,780
Go.

677
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,580
What good couples!

678
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,580
= Suyong Hall =

679
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:18,300
Sir,

680
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:20,410
the message from the pass says

681
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,610
they didn’t go through the pass tonight.

682
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,170
Instead, they entered a hunting tribe

683
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,300
called Zheluo.

684
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,130
What?

685
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:35,450
Go and make preparations.

686
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,580
I will set out for Zheluo right away.

687
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:38,130
Sir,

688
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,210
you are going to the capital city
for the new position soon.

689
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,610
I have handed it over
to the officers at the pass.

690
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:44,370
You don’t have to go there personally.

691
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,500
Nonsense!

692
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,130
We must catch them at the pass

693
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,410
so as to hold them responsible for
illegal transport of weapons.

694
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,820
It is already going off track.

695
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:53,980
We can’t wait any longer.

696
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:55,410
We shouldn’t allow them to escape.

697
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:20,170
Master Li is really cunning.

698
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,890
He has a hidden cargo hold.

699
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,850
Take care.

700
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,180
A crafty person has
more than one hideout.

701
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:29,650
We must learn it.

702
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,100
Hurry up, hurry up.

703
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:40,980
Shh!

704
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,980
Speak softly

705
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,890
or you will attract the soldiers here.

706
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,760
Let’s wait for your gang members
to carry them away.

707
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:01,100
Are you crazy for me?

708
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,020
Who is crazy for you?

709
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:05,500
I think

710
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,820
my master and Master Li

711
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,980
must have had a battle with each other.

712
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:10,780
No.

713
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:12,410
Your master

714
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:14,020
can never defeat my master.

715
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:15,780
Pardon me?

716
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:18,650
No, I mean…

717
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,060
I know

718
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,930
my master

719
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,650
can never defeat your master.

720
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:27,740
Why?

721
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:31,290
They may…

722
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,290
They may be doing ...

723
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:35,060
Doing what?

724
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:36,540
Doing…

725
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,330
Outside, outside, outside.

726
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:44,450
Shh!

727
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:46,330
There are soldiers outside.

Mr. Li!

00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,330
Mr. Li from the Silver City.

738
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:57,690
Are you still awake?

739
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,210
What can I do for you?

740
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,130
Mr. Li, open the door, please.

741
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,770
It is me, Dabaru.

742
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,460
I am sleeping now.

743
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,380
We can talk about it tomorrow.

744
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:11,580
Mr. Li,

745
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,980
it is the right time for a talk now.

746
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:18,230
Don’t you hear the songs around?

747
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,540
They are all singing for a proposal.

748
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,690
Proposal?

749
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,730
When night falls

750
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:31,770
and the Venus is high up in the sky,

751
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,330
a young girl of our tribe

752
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,860
will sing a song beside the residence
of her beloved man.

753
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,300
At the moment of deep love,

754
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,940
the man can invite the girl in

755
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:47,010
and have sex.

756
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,020
Madam, you make a mistake.

757
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:54,190
No, you are my Mr. Right.

758
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,170
I hadn’t found

759
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,610
any beloved in my tribe

760
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:01,460
until you defeated me.

761
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,810
My heart melted down for you utterly.

762
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,130
Sir, just open the door.

763
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,130
Don’t you love me?

764
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,100
I have my beloved.

765
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,860
It doesn’t matter.

766
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,810
We

767
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,540
can have momentary pleasures.

768
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,770
I don’t feel identified

769
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:25,690
with the customs of your tribe.

770
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,900
Madam, please return.

771
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:30,460
I don’t want to delay your marriage.

772
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:33,860
You…

773
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:03,260
= Cargo Hold =

774
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:14,130
Hurry up.

775
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,460
Hurry up.

776
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,980
- Take care.
- Take care.

777
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,420
Brothers,

778
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,500
the goods are reserved by our master
for emergency use.

779
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:22,730
Sell them as soon as possible.

780
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,060
Don’t make a mistake.

781
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,420
Okay, take it easy. Brother Bin.

782
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,810
Shuisheng,
how are things going on with you?

783
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:29,380
I have confirmed with both Master Weng
and Mr. Shen.

784
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,420
Master Shen agreed to advance
the money without interest for us.

785
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,500
The water gang takes the shipping space

786
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,650
not ordered by the government.

787
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:37,940
Listen,

788
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,540
Du Changfeng openly claims

789
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,290
to crack down upon illegal businessmen
in the city.

790
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:42,980
There must be complex causes behind it.

791
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,020
We must do it in a low profile
and avoid any trouble.

792
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,170
Finish the grain transport properly.
