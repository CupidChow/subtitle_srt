- That one. That one.
- We want to hear the story that

33
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,040
Master Long flattered
the master of Xinsilu

34
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,590
when he fell into coma.

35
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,560
Then what happened next?

36
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,720
Right. What happened next?

37
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,430
That is the best part of the story.

38
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,320
- Come on.
- Yeah!

39
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,190
Just go ahead.

40
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,350
Come on!

41
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,350
Just go ahead.

42
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,350
Go ahead.

43
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,190
Hey!

44
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,280
Go ahead.

45
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,640
Forgive me, Master Long.

46
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,760
- Master Long!
- You don’t want to live anymore, right?

47
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,070
It hurts.

48
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,800
Let’s go to have a look.

49
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,140
Master Long!

50
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:51,880
Master Long!

51
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,920
Tell me,

52
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,640
who asked you to tell that dirty story?

53
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,880
Mercy, Master Long.

54
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,000
Nobody asked me to do that.

55
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,390
It’s just that, that day,

56
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,030
after you two left the kiln,

57
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,790
many people treated me to liquor
to ask about it.

58
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,520
If I couldn’t tell something new,

59
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,350
they would

60
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,280
stop treating me, so…

61
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,000
I…

62
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,030
How dare you make things up!

63
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,670
I’m sorry, I’m sorry.

64
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,110
I won’t do that again.

65
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,790
I won’t tell anything about that kiln

66
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,110
to anybody from now on.

67
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,150
Why not tell it?

68
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,560
Just do it.

69
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,950
You need to tell everybody

70
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,760
about how panic

71
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,760
Li Qingliu was

72
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,560
and how brave Long Aoyi was.

73
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,790
If you dare

74
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,070
tell anything other than that,

75
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,710
I’ll cut your tongue off!

76
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,710
I wouldn’t dare. I wouldn’t dare.

77
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,590
Master Long is brave and heroic,

78
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,590
and Master Li

79
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,150
is a coward.

80
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,790
That’s more like it.

81
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,310
Xiaoqin, let’s go.

82
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,560
Wu Lin.

83
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,550
Who knows?

84
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,700
Let’s go.

85
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,870
As long as you tell it right,

86
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,000
your liquor

87
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,400
is on me.

88
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,070
I got it! I got it!

89
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,430
Wu Lin, let’s go.

90
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,430
Look.

91
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,740
= Chuang Tzu =

92
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,430
Chuang Tzu?

93
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,000
What?

94
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,360
You have turned

95
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,150
your Longzhu Gang into a school?

96
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,240
You can say that.

97
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,710
A book for each of us,

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,310
after reading it, we need to tell Miss

99
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,680
about what it’s about.

100
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,150
I think Master Long

101
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,190
was irritated at
the Double Seventh Festival night fair.

102
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,800
Who told you that?

103
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,470
My master of course.

104
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,560
Let me tell you…

105
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,630
Stop!

106
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,840
There is no need to expose
your weakness to the public.

107
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:05,630
You look down on me.

108
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,240
Double Seventh Festival my foot!

109
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,080
I’ve been with her for so many years.

110
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,680
I know her well.

111
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,190
She never gets angry for things

112
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,000
that she doesn’t care.

113
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,840
But after she met Master Li,

114
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,590
starting from Wanhua,

115
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,520
she has gotten angry for so many times.

116
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,150
Last time in the silk store,

117
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,470
I said that the rumor about

118
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,590
them loving each other was impossible

119
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,080
because of the big gap between them.

120
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,630
But she disapproved my opinion

121
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,310
with the case of you and me.

122
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,680
What does it have to do with us?

123
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,030
She said that

124
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,030
however big the gap is,

125
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,080
that should not stand in the way of love.

126
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,520
Those two…

127
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,280
Love each other.

128
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,360
But they don’t admit it.

129
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,360
Then…

130
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,080
How about us?

131
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,000
Forget about their love thingy.

132
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,520
Let’s just drink!

133
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,710
Cheers!

134
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:12,680
Cheers!

135
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:17,910
Eat up!

142
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,240
Here.

143
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,920
I’m not his wife, I’m his drinking buddy.

144
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,830
Take this.

145
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,070
Thank you, Ma’am.

146
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,510
Drinking buddy?

147
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,480
Then I’ll find a wife

148
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,920
and give her the cake.

00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,600
look what I brought back for you.

152
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,830
Oven-fresh crispy cake.

153
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,920
Try it.

154
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,750
It’s delicious.

155
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,920
Have a try.

156
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,040
How much did you drink?

157
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,950
Not much.

158
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,190
Yan Bin came to me

159
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,750
to discuss the thing about Hu Laosan.

160
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,830
And we made some modifications
on Chuang Tzu.

161
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,720
Yan Bin’s pretty good.

162
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,040
He has martial arts and he looks good.

163
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,120
But his heart…

164
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,510
Is it good?

165
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,000
Yes!

166
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,270
See?

167
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,680
You admitted it.

168
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:33,800
Tell me,

169
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,310
which stage are you in?

170
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,950
What stage?

171
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,360
We just drank together.

172
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,950
Am I so easy to get?

173
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,040
So…

174
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,510
Did he

175
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,630
tell you about somebody else?

176
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,040
Which somebody else?

177
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,750
You are still

178
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,870
thinking about that Li Qingliu?

179
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,000
I…

180
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,560
Do you want me to help you

181
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,630
ask about

182
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,390
what he eats and where he goes

183
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,680
every day,

184
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,000
and most importantly,

185
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,830
if he meets beautiful girls

186
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,160
every day or not?

187
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,920
What are you saying?

188
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,430
On the Double Seventh Festival night,

189
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,720
he despised our lower class.

190
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,070
Why do I care about him?

191
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,830
I agree with the thing

192
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,830
between you and Yan Bin.

193
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,270
But have you thought about it?

194
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,160
Will Li Qingliu agree too?

195
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,360
If he doesn’t agree with it,

196
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,600
don’t cry to me.

197
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,560
You really changed.

198
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,430
You learned how to beat around the bush.

199
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,270
Can’t you just ask me

200
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,240
to pay attention to Li Qingliu for you?

201
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,560
You wicked girl.

202
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,560
I let you keep an eye on Hu Laosan,

203
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,240
and you learned to slander from him?

204
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,040
I…

205
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,360
This is not over.

206
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,830
Yan Bin.

207
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:15,950
My head hurts.

208
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,830
You went to the brothel?

209
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,480
I…

210
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:33,680
Yes.

211
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,600
I called somebody out and talked with her.

212
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,600
No wonder I smell rouge.

213
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,120
It was Xiaoqin.

214
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,800
I know. Who else could it be?

215
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,920
Tomorrow, go to the warehouse

216
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,120
to pick some nice agilawood

217
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,390
and send it to her.

218
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,430
You agree with the thing between us?

219
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,360
What thing?

220
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,480
No, I mean,

221
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,560
what’s the gift for?

222
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,600
I want you to maintain

223
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,070
the relationship between you two.

224
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,560
If you are abandoned one day,

225
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,830
I’ll have to marry you
to Mr. Liu’s daughter.

226
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,870
I won’t be abandoned.

227
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,950
I heard that Liu Chunhua’s weight

228
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,240
has come to 175 kilograms.

229
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,630
I can’t stand that.

230
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:22,750
By the way,

231
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,040
since you met today,

232
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,000
did she say anything

233
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,160
about her?

234
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,750
Her?

235
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,920
Who?

236
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,630
Mr. Liu’s daughter.

237
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,190
Oh, Master Long.

238
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,240
I hear that

239
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,270
she’s still angry

240
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,000
about that rumor.

241
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,120
She ordered all members
of the gang to read

242
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,630
and then tell her about
what they read about.

243
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,800
I’m not against the relationship
between you and Xiaoqin,

244
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,360
but you should understand

245
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,870
how to get some useful information
from it.

246
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,510
But…

247
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,510
Information about whom?

248
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,510
Master Long! Master Long!

249
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,510
I got it.

250
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,080
We businessmen

251
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,360
should always maintain

252
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,000
good relationships with other people.

253
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,200
On the way back,

254
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,390
I heard that

255
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,000
Mr. Du is coming back to Silver City.

256
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,240
So soon?

257
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,120
Take it easy.

258
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,080
Why are they doing this? What happened?

259
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,790
Master Long,

260
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,790
it’s said that Mr. Commissioner
is coming back.

261
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,960
The county magistrate asked us

262
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,200
to be well prepared.

263
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,510
That old fox,

264
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,960
compared with when he just took office,

265
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,510
he’s becoming more
and more unscrupulous.

266
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,440
Master, you can go first.

267
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,870
I’ll go fetch the new sword sheath
I ordered.

268
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,440
I’ll go with you.

269
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,510
Which store did you order it?

270
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,120
I need a new belt.

271
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,550
This store is also new to me.

272
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,080
I don’t know if it’s good or not.

273
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,240
If the sword sheath is good,

274
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,120
I’ll recommend the store to you, Master.

275
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,480
Why are you standing on ceremony?

276
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,150
OK, Second Master, see you later.

277
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,510
He looks like in a hurry.

278
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,550
Do you think he’s going to his sweetheart

279
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,600
behind our back?

280
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,720
Your head

281
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,840
is full of those things like sweethearts.

282
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,510
You are my best sweetheart.

283
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,840
Is there a new order?

284
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,120
Up there, they are anxious.

285
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,510
We need a rubbing of the birthmark.

286
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,480
When do you want it?

287
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,670
As soon as possible.

288
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,150
Yes.

289
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,550
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

290
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,200
- Did anything happen when I was away?
- Hurry up.

291
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,320
Sir. Sir.

292
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,270
Please

293
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,720
forgive me for being late.

294
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,000
Sir,

295
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,480
you were summoned to Chang’an suddenly,

296
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,320
what did you get from it?

297
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,510
All commissioners were asked
to do a report.

298
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,720
The government is investigating
the financial

299
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,960
and military strength of each Dao.

300
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,480
Financial and military strength?

301
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,550
What’s to be afraid of?

302
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:18,080
The taxes our Jiannan Dao pays each year

303
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,150
is no less than any other Dao.

304
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,960
His Majesty

305
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,870
personally ordered Mr. Du to
go to Chang’an.

306
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,670
Mr. Du is getting a promotion.

307
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,030
Congratulations, Sir.

308
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,600
Sir,

309
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,390
please do not forget me,

310
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,750
a small county magistrate in Silver City.

311
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,960
Alright. That’s it.

312
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,630
Sir,

313
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,440
Li Qingliu is still as usual.

314
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,440
This time,

315
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,910
I won’t let them slip easily.

316
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,910
Anyone that’s not one of us

317
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,320
will be gotten rid of.

318
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,060
= Du’s Mansion =

319
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,960
Father, you want to see me?

320
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:11,750
Xiaoxian,

321
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,480
I was thinking on my way back that

322
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,390
I indulged you too much

323
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,390
and allowed you to be obsessed with

324
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,030
those useless things
after your mother died.

325
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,240
Now,

326
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,550
you need to gradually

327
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,200
withdraw from Xinsilu

328
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,550
to be a proper young lady.

329
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,120
Why are you asking me
to withdraw suddenly?

330
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,630
Did something happen in Chang’an?

331
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,360
In Jiannan Dao,

332
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,720
I’m free to do anything I want to.

333
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,550
But in Chang’an,

334
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,790
I’m just a nobody.

335
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,750
Officials with the same rank as me
are everywhere.

336
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,910
It’s just that

337
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,960
if somebody reports me

338
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,360
for having a daughter who does business,

339
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,200
that’ll be a trouble.

340
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,600
What’s more,

341
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,600
as the daughter of a commissioner,
doing business

342
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,240
and running around every day,

343
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,910
you’ll be judged by people.

344
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,790
Father,

345
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,960
is Xinsilu having a problem?

346
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,510
It is!

347
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,150
Otherwise you wouldn’t

348
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,440
have said those to me.

349
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,360
Sir, it’s time.

350
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,870
They are waiting already.

351
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,480
You may leave.

352
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,000
Xiaoxian, this time

353
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,240
you have to listen to me.

354
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,630
I know

355
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,870
you are a smart kid.

356
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:37,960
Father.

357
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,960
Mr. Du came back to Silver City yesterday

358
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,000
with a rich harvest.

359
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,000
Congratulations, Mr. Du.

360
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,630
- Congratulations, Mr. Du.
- Congratulations, Mr. Du.

361
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,360
Thank His Majesty.

362
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,080
This time,

363
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,360
I brought some good news.

364
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,030
Every year, Tang

365
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,720
sends out national gifts
to our vassal states.

366
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,840
This year,

367
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,840
the task of making national gift

368
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,320
for southwest Dongnyu State

369
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,480
is bestowed on our Jiannan Dao.

370
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,200
This is a perfect chance

371
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,520
to win glory and fame.

372
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,360
This national gift

373
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,910
is pretty special.

374
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,120
It is Nyuertu.

375
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,790
Nyuertu?

376
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,630
You mean

377
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,550
those obscene pictures?

378
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,740
Some people use it as dowry

379
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,630
but it’s not decent stuff after all.

380
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:37,200
How come it’s become a national gift?

381
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,120
The King of Dongnyu State asked for it.

382
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:43,790
It’ll be used as a dowry of the Princess
of Dongnyu State.

383
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,150
The Ministries of Works and Rites

384
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,670
gave me the production
and design requirements.

385
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:48,790
It should reflect

386
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,720
the technological level of Tang,

387
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,720
and it can’t be vulgar in style.

388
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,630
After thinking about it,

389
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,510
this mission should go to

390
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,000
the most experienced Xinsilu.

391
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,630
Let Li Qingliu

392
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,720
win glory and fame for us.

393
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,150
What do you think?

394
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,200
Sir,

395
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,080
Xinsilu is specialized for making clothes.

396
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,080
We never tried to make artware.

397
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,550
I’m afraid I can’t do this.

398
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,630
Master Li,

399
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,840
this is a rewarding task.

400
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,080
If you don’t want to do it,

401
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,360
I will then.

402
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,200
Your Highness,

403
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:36,240
this is the order issued
by the Ministry of Works.

404
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,240
They gave this task specially to Xinsilu.

405
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
Your Highness, I know you are interested,

406
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,150
= Act without fail =
but His Majesty

407
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,360
affixed his seal on it.

408
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,480
If Master Li refuses it,

409
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,480
I’m afraid his qualification
in weaving industry

410
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,600
will be deprived.

411
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,940
= Xinsilu =

412
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,840
Qingliu,

413
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,240
I heard my father ordered Xinsilu

414
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,840
to make the national gift.

415
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,150
That’s right.

416
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,150
But that’s

417
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,510
obscene pictures.

418
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,390
We are not good at it at all.

419
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,000
Why did my father force you?

420
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,390
I’ll go and ask him.

421
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,270
No need.

422
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,080
Now that we have received the order,

423
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,440
we’ll make it happen.

424
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,910
Xinsilu never goes back on our words.

425
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,600
But those

426
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,200
are indecent things.

427
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,000
Are you going to visit Master Long?

428
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,320
Forget it.

429
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:00,960
On that Double Seventh Festival night,

430
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,790
she was already mad.

431
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,720
And now the rumors are spreading.

432
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,670
She must be in a huff now.

433
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,030
I heard that

434
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,360
she’s been staying with Prince Zhao
every day.

435
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,440
I don’t think she has time to be angry.

436
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,910
Is it so?

437
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,000
Master,

438
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,200
it’s not hard to embroider Nyuertu,

439
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,350
as long as we have drafts.

440
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,030
But these…

441
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,310
Listen to yourself.

442
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,550
The drafts are just
what we are worrying about.

443
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,030
There are many in Goddess of Sexual Love.

444
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,400
Xiaowu,

445
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,960
you are pretty well-read.

446
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,400
The Ministry of Works

447
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,000
doesn’t want it to be vulgar.

448
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,920
But Nyuertu

449
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,310
is about those things
that couples do in bed.

450
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,200
To make it not vulgar,

451
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,590
that is

452
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,240
pretty tough.

453
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,070
That’s the main difficulty of this order.

454
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,880
Let’s make it simple.

455
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,960
Let’s go to the lower class’s streets

456
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,160
and look for some painters

457
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,640
who make Nyuertu secretly.

458
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,030
They are all close to Longzhu Gang.

459
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,110
With the relation between Master
and Long Aoyi,

460
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,550
finding some painters to help us

461
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,270
should be a piece of cake.

462
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,440
Look at you.

463
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,880
Master,

464
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,790
should I ask Xiaoqin to

465
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,200
ask Master Long?

466
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:57,030
The rumors about us are spreading,

467
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,310
if I go to look for her now,

468
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,240
new rumors may start.

469
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,270
But…

470
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,400
How about

471
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,240
let’s pay good money

472
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,960
to hire some painters.

473
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,240
OK.

474
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,620
= List of Painters =

475
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,550
All the painters said that?

476
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,030
All suitable painters are on the list.

477
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,160
I think they are trying
to stay away from us.

478
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,160
Once they hear the name “Xinsilu”,

479
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,110
they say no.

480
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,310
They say there’s no problem
in drawing pictures,

481
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,200
but they need Master Long’s consent.

482
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,480
Did you try to offer more money?

483
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,680
We offered 500 taels of silver
for each picture.

484
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,160
That’s already an impossible price.

485
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,550
Master, maybe you should…

486
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,400
I don’t believe

487
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,480
there’s something

488
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,550
that can’t be solved with money.

489
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,880
If there is, we’ll raise the offer.

490
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,480
The Nyuertu is a chance
Du Changfeng seized

491
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,310
to make trouble for us.

492
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,590
This is not the time to think
about the expense.

493
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,480
Tomorrow, take enough money

494
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,680
and go to the lower class with me.

495
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,680
I don’t believe they can

496
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,270
refuse all the money.

497
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:21,270
This is the bird I brought back
from abroad.

498
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,930
Steamed buns!

499
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,880
Little bird, I hear you can sing, come on.

500
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:33,000
Master, look. Look.

501
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,240
Sing.

502
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,150
Have a look.

503
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,550
It’s so lively.

504
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,350
Aoyi. Aoyi.

505
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,030
Let’s go.

506
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,480
It’s Master Li.

507
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,550
I’m Li Qingliu from Xinsilu.

508
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,750
I want to ask you

509
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,830
to help draw Nyuertu for us.

510
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,240
= One Thousand Taels =
Sir, please take this.

511
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,880
No, no way, please leave.

512
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,960
= Portrait =
Go away.

513
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,350
You are not welcomed here. Just go.

514
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,270
= Hu’s Silk Store =
This is the last one.

515
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,680
People call him Xu the Incredible.

516
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,030
He’s the best Nyuertu painter
in Silver City.

517
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,310
He has a strange character.

518
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,480
Not very easy to deal with.

519
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,240
Come on.

520
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,880
The Nyuertu circle in Silver City
is pretty small.

521
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:31,270
I’ve heard the news

522
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,070
about you hiring painters with high price.

523
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,160
Master Xu,

524
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,680
you must have also heard about

525
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,830
the price I’m offering.

526
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,240
The reason why I’m offering so much

527
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,270
is just to get real good pictures.

528
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,000
It means a lot to our Xinsilu.

529
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,350
You can save your breath.

530
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,480
Unless you have a meal with me.

531
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,920
A meal?

532
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,640
Master,

533
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,290
I think the breakthrough is
still Master Long.

534
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:32,640
So…

535
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:39,760
You were right.

536
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,720
I have to deal with it myself.

537
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,720
Send an invitation

538
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,350
to Long Aoyi tonight.

539
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:48,590
Tell her I’ll see her at Wanhua tomorrow.

540
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,240
Yes.

541
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,750
= Wuyun Pavilion =
I hear that Master Li is asking Aoyi out.

542
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,680
They are finally going on a date.

543
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,590
That Li is really stingy.

544
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,110
He didn’t even put a gold leaf

545
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,720
in the invitation.

546
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,310
That must be for business.

547
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,030
Why are you all so excited?

548
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,790
Come on, Miss,

549
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,680
try on these clothes.

550
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:16,680
Wait.

551
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,400
Here, try this on.

552
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:22,880
Turn your head over.

553
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,400
You should use this.

554
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,000
It makes you look rich.

555
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,070
This one.

556
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,550
Your neck can’t be left open.

557
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,960
Put this on.

558
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,070
This looks nice,

559
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,110
and it makes you look even richer.

560
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,480
Try this on.

561
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,590
- You look really rich.
- No way!

562
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,550
You are not a child now.

563
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,510
Don’t put everything in your mouth.

564
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,160
Your face looks a little pale.

565
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,160
Open your mouth.

566
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,960
Compress your lips.

567
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,750
Pout.

568
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,790
You look like a pig.

569
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,590
Can’t you do it like a girl?

570
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,000
Forget it, it’s ugly.

571
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,550
Come on.

572
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,030
It’s just a meeting.

573
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,440
Don’t make it complicated.

574
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,590
And why should I

575
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,830
doll up for Li Qingliu?

576
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,110
I…

577
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,360
I don’t like him anyway.

578
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,350
He has money.

579
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,400
Don’t be sloppy

580
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,790
like a poor kid.

581
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,880
I have brothers

582
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,960
and I’m experienced.

583
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,790
I at least have some know-le-dge.

584
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,110
You don’t feel right saying that, do you?

585
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,110
Come on, Master.

586
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:58,920
I’m just meeting him,

587
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,270
not dating him.

588
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,030
Just go back to have some rest.

589
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,200
Memorize some poems before going.

590
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:04,550
OK.

591
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,240
Don’t wipe the thing on your lips away.

592
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,030
Save it.

593
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,070
However well I dress up,

594
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,200
Li Qingliu will find some reason
to laugh at me.

595
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,310
He’s good at it.

596
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,880
What you wear is very important.

597
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,000
Moreover, he’s a dress maker.

598
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,240
Aoyi,

599
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,720
I think this time

600
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,110
Master Li is inviting you to the teahouse

601
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,550
not just for business.

602
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,270
Your little brain is thinking

603
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,480
something weird again.

604
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,830
Think about it.

605
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:38,960
Before, Master Li

606
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,720
often invited you out.

607
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,720
But since the Double Seventh Festival
night,

608
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,680
he never came again.

609
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:44,200
Why?

610
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,440
Because he’s up to some tricks.

611
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,480
But now he invites you again.

612
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,440
In my opinion,

613
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,240
he wants to either apologize to you

614
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,070
or

615
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:56,510
confess his feelings to you.

616
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,110
I dare him.

617
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,270
Well, your clothes are too colorful.

618
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,110
They don’t suit me.

619
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,720
I’ll borrow some nice ones for you.

620
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:32,500
= Zuixian Restaurant =

621
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,720
Wake up!

622
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:04,640
I’m so sleepy.

623
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,660
Come on.

624
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,510
Hurry up.

625
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:12,440
Here.

626
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,310
He sent the invitation at night this time.

627
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,160
This seems to be serious.

628
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,960
I wonder how Aoyi looks right now.

629
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:24,270
- She must be pretty in front of her man.
- That’s right.

630
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,110
I’m looking forward to it.

631
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,160
Are you all so idle?

632
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,720
What are you talking about?

633
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,920
If you like talking so much,

634
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,350
you can go be a storyteller.

635
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,270
Who do you think our Aoyi is?

636
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:37,830
Let’s take another way.

637
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,440
She’ll never suffer a loss.

638
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,680
Let’s go.

639
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:18,220
Roast chicken!

640
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,820
- Delicious roast chicken!
- Master Long.

641
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,310
Master Long is so beautiful today.

642
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,750
Master Long,

643
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,550
are you going on a date?

644
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,960
Of course not,

645
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,400
I’m just going to meet somebody.

646
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,030
You are lying!

647
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,350
You are so beautiful today.

648
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:38,030
They all know you are going on a date
with a millionaire.

649
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,000
That’s right.

650
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:43,790
Take it.

651
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,350
Thank you!

652
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,400
I am going to

653
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,200
turn into a beast and eat him.

654
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,680
What should I turn into?

655
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:52,000
A tiger? Or a leopard?

656
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,790
Miss Long is going to eat the millionaire!

657
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,400
Miss Long is going to eat the millionaire!

658
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,480
Miss Long is going to eat the millionaire!

659
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:11,060
= Zuixian Restaurant =

660
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,830
Master Long. Upstairs please.

661
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,070
Please.

662
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,480
Why such a secret place?

663
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,640
Are you looking for me

664
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,930
for what happened
on Double Seventh Festival…

665
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:33,520
Let’s not talk about
Double Seventh Festival again.

666
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,550
I mean, if

667
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,070
there are two ways in front of us,

668
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,270
one

669
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:49,000
is going to benefit both of us,

670
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,590
the other is going to break my heart.

671
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,550
He wants to either apologize to you

672
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,200
or

673
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,790
confess his feelings to you.

674
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:14,550
The first one is good indeed,

675
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,880
and the second one,

676
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,200
it won’t necessarily disappoint you.

677
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,400
You heard about that?

678
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,310
They are all talking about it outside.

679
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,480
OK then.

680
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,270
I’ll cut to the chase.

681
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,960
Can you help me with the Nyuertu?

682
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,480
The designers in Xinsilu

683
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,240
are not good at designing these se…

684
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,640
Secular patterns.

685
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,110
But many painters in Southern City

686
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,720
are drawing them secretly.

687
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,310
So I want you to help

688
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,200
ask Xu the Incredible to help us.

689
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:02,920
Of course,

690
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,480
you’ll get your part of benefits.

691
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,920
Benefits?

692
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:11,200
The interests of this order, I can…

693
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:11,750
Stop.

694
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,200
I’m not interested
in the interests of this order.

695
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,200
Alright then.

696
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,350
The shares of my properties?

697
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:23,550
Title deed?

698
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:26,920
Name your price then.

699
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,550
Let’s join hands and open a business

700
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,240
to make Nyuertu, I get forty,
you get sixty.

701
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,680
Don’t think I’m asking too much.

702
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,160
Although I only contribute painters

703
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,590
and you’ll be in charge of

704
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,960
materials and workers,

705
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,240
when I was in Xinsilu,

706
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,750
you told me that

707
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,200
design is the soul.

708
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,270
Have you seen a cheap soul?

709
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,160
Deal.

710
00:34:59,480 --> 00:34:59,880
Alright.

711
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,790
Let’s figure out a name for it.

712
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,350
How about Qinglong?

713
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,550
It’s simple but sounds good.

714
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,750
One character out of each of our names,

715
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,000
that’s a good way to bind us together.

716
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,350
You don’t understand?

717
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,590
Qing is from your name

718
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,960
and Long is from mine.

719
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,030
It means our interests are bound together.

720
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:20,960
That’s the deal.

721
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,510
Nothing is bigger than Long.

722
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:24,960
Good name.

723
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,510
It’s so bitter.

724
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,640
You thought he found a quiet place

725
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,240
to apologize or confess to you?

726
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,440
And you thought he was being shy?

727
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,200
Wake up! Long Aoyi!

728
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,270
That is Li Qingliu!

729
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,240
He just wants to take advantage

730
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,680
of your position.

731
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,750
- Master! What’s wrong?
- If I don’t slaughter you…

732
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,640
What happened to you?

733
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,720
I don’t deserve my surname Long!

734
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,270
Books aren’t of any help at all!

735
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,030
Playing with me!

736
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,200
Book! Book! Book!

737
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,110
That’s unbelievable!

738
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,510
Master.

739
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,200
Master, have some tea.

740
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,510
How did the day go with Li Qingliu…

741
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,000
What did you say? Tea?

742
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,160
If anybody dare to

743
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,350
bring up the word “tea” to me,

744
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,720
don’t blame me for turning against you!

745
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,590
All these books,

746
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,680
burn them!

747
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,720
Don’t let me see them again!

748
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,550
Burn them all?

749
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,670
Are you waiting for me to do it myself?

750
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:56,030
If you want to plead for Li Qingliu,

751
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,000
save it.

752
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,440
And I didn’t block all his ways.

753
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:03,000
They are already working on

754
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,320
the designs of the Nyuertu.

755
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,630
Qingliu is going to

756
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,630
join hands with Long Aoyi

757
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,400
to open up a business.

758
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,590
If you let it continue,

759
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,110
I’m afraid Qingliu

760
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,630
will be fooled by that girl.

761
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,110
Why do you have to be involved in them?

762
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:22,380
Moreover, that Nyuertu is just a trou…

763
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,510
Father,

764
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,440
I’m just afraid that Qingliu
might be fooled,

765
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,510
you can’t harm him.

766
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,000
I know what I’m doing.

767
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,840
As for the Nyuertu,

768
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:38,190
don’t get yourself involved too deeply.

769
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,840
All right, you may go now.

770
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,030
Today is the establishment
of Qinglong Firm.

771
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,360
= Quan =
Xinsilu’s men are coming with materials.

772
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:02,150
= Longzhu Gang =
We’ll be equal to them since now.

773
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,270
Come on! Drink!

774
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,440
The people from Xinsilu are here.

775
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,030
They are here.

776
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,710
Master Long.

777
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,360
Master.

778
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:20,880
Come on.

779
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,190
Where to put these?

780
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,320
Come with me.

781
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,800
Dapang! Erya!

782
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,880
Come here! Quickly!

783
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,370
Come here.

784
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,730
Come on.

785
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,880
Open it. Open it.

786
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,870
Settle it.

787
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,180
I told you it’s small.

788
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:40,960
Guys,

789
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,960
today is the day Xinsilu and Longzhu Gang

790
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,590
open up Qinglong Firm together.

791
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:48,400
I hereby make a toast to Master Long.

792
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,320
Let’s forget about those small talks.

793
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:55,110
I’m not such a righteous person at all.

794
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,150
I’m just doing it

795
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,950
because it’s profitable.

796
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,670
Today is the day

797
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,800
we form a big family.

798
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,030
Let’s drink to the big family!

799
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:09,550
- Yes!
- Let’s drink!

800
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,230
Come on, let’s drink!

801
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,150
That’s right! Bottoms up!

802
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:11,800
Come on!

803
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,400
- Cheers!
- Come on!

804
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,260
- Let’s drink!
- Cheers!

805
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,030
Cheers! Yeah!

806
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:14,840
Bottoms up!

807
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,110
- To family!
- Cheers!

808
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,800
Family?

809
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,320
