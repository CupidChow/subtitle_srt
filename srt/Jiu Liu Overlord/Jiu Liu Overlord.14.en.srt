A day and night.

Shunzi, do me a favor.

and let her come to see me.

Remember,

44
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,410
don’t tell anyone else.

what it says.

51
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,020
The order for arrest?

52
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,750
The reward increases.

54
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,910
So much!

55
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,290
Qingliu.

56
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,940
Yesterday at Wanhua...

57
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:44,690
When we entertain customers,

58
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,530
it isn’t just an occasion
to show ourselves,

59
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,660
but, in this seemingly most
intimate occasion,

60
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,290
we should discover the loopholes of
clients which can’t be found at usual times.

61
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,810
Yesterday I saw Yan Bin
gathering workers.

62
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,940
I asked him what he was doing there.

63
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,400
He didn’t say anything.

64
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,030
I asked him to do that.

65
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,470
So many people.

66
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,860
You intended to find Long Aoyi,
didn’t you?

67
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,420
Since you came out of prison

68
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,810
and took Long Aoyi into Silk Store,

69
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,300
I felt you were unusual to her.

70
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,580
You said you were afraid that
she would cause trouble,

71
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,700
and asked someone to watch her.

72
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,180
But even though she cut
your sample clothes,

73
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,300
you said nothing.

74
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,240
If it were someone else,

75
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,750
would you be like this?

76
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,340
Lady.

77
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:03,590
What’s wrong?

78
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,680
Why do you look so worried?

79
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,310
I just passed the study,

80
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,160
and saw a terrible person.

81
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,360
That person was wearing

82
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,430
a scary snake headgear.

83
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,400
A snake?

84
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,190
Why isn’t Mr. Du here yet?

85
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,870
I have been waiting for several hours.

86
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,680
Mr. Du is dealing with urgent business.

87
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,310
I have no choice.

88
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,520
Mr. Du refused to
fulfill his promise.

89
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,090
I want to find Mr. Du
and think about other ways.

90
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:31,800
Stop talking.

91
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,000
Please go back.

92
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,870
Father,

93
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,000
Xiaoxian.

94
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,140
Why did you come in
without knocking at the door?

95
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,060
= Letter =

96
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,170
I passed by the wing-room just now.

97
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,290
The wing-room?

98
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,100
I…

99
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,170
Xiaoxian.

100
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,100
Prince Zhao went to Qimen Temple
to pray.

101
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,490
The food in the temple must be
simple and tasteless.

102
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,580
When he returns,

103
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:11,820
take the initiative

104
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,700
and make something nutritious
to show your care for him.

105
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:15,900
These are...

106
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,930
I don’t have to teach you on these things.

107
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:18,930
Father,

108
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,460
I couldn’t understand.

109
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,660
All the time,

110
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,850
you allow me to go to the Silk Store
to help.

111
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,530
You should know my feelings for Qingliu.

112
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,240
But why do you

113
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,970
want me to be intimate with others?

114
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:32,930
Do you even think

115
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,220
I can’t be in romantic relations
with Qingliu?

116
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:40,730
Li Qingliu

117
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,490
is at best a businessman.

118
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,100
Prince Zhao is your best choice.

119
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,730
Besides, Li Qingliu

120
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,090
often hangs out with
the woman surnamed Long.

121
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,070
He doesn’t pay attention to you at all.

122
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,680
It started from the loss of the gold thread.

123
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,830
Since Dongzi died,

124
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,580
I always thought there was
something wrong.

125
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,190
I just saw

126
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,800
people from Snake Gang are waiting
for you in the wing-room.

127
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,750
Dad, tell me.

128
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,830
Why do you have connections
with this kind of rascals?

129
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,070
How can you talk to me this way?

130
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,920
Are you hiding something from me?

131
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,950
Are you and these rascals

132
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,950
colluding together?

133
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,160
Father,

134
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,070
you are a commissioner,

135
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,240
not an ordinary person.
Those people from Snake Gang...

136
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,310
How can you disregard your identity?

137
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,720
So shameless.

138
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,800
What?

139
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,070
More and more outrageous.

140
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:46,700
Master.

141
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,460
I can recall it.

142
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:49,490
Vendor Zhou

143
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:50,490
really came to Silk Store

144
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,490
on the day it was on fire.

145
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:52,460
And

146
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,220
someone saw him go to the smoke house.

147
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,660
The smoke house?

148
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:56,660
Right.

149
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,260
All the smoke houses in Silver City

150
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,490
are charged by Qiyan.

151
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:00,460
And Qiyan

152
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,970
was the gangster that

153
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,730
you offended at Wanhua.

154
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,370
There is really something strange.

155
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,170
Have you found where Long Aoyi is?

156
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,610
Master, we really didn’t care about
the money.

157
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,490
We spend so much money

158
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:13,730
and got some clues.

159
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:14,900
But every time,

160
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,490
we were disturbed by the patrol.

161
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:18,340
Plus,

162
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:19,970
people of Wuyun Pavilion are grounded.

163
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,610
People from Longzhu Gang
have also been looking for a few days.

164
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,660
But there is no news.

165
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,530
Will it be possible that

166
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,050
Master Long is out of Silver City?

167
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:27,820
Impossible.

168
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,530
The roads and waterways
heading out of Silver City

169
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,610
must have been guarded well

170
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,820
by the commissioner.

171
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,220
Well, I will go myself.

172
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,170
No way!

173
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,260
I have been looking for two days
with the workers.

174
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,700
I’m also familiar with the situation.

175
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,290
Familiar with the situation?

176
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,660
Have you searched the whole city?

177
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,050
Master Qiyan.

178
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,020
Be gentle.

179
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,020
Master, is it okay?

180
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,530
Shut up.

181
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,170
Hurry up.

182
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,530
Sell all the silkworms in your hand.

183
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,930
Well, Master Qiyan.

184
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,410
When I let you sell it, listen to me.

185
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,490
Don’t talk so much nonsense.

186
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,290
Remember, sell them at any price.

187
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,050
Master Qiyan,

188
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,900
we have kept these goods for so long.

189
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,900
But now we sell them in a haste.

190
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,290
When Commissioner Du asks,

191
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,530
we can’t afford to pay the price.

192
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,660
Now Long Aoyi ran away.

193
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,340
The entire Silver City is changing.

194
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,050
It’s better to rely on ourselves.

195
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,460
If you move more slowly,

196
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,290
when we as well as our goods
are blocked,

197
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,820
nine lives are not enough for us
to be beheaded.

198
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:39,140
By the way.

199
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,370
contact Third Brother quickly.

200
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,460
Why bother him?

201
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,930
Since the officials are unreliable,

202
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,100
I can only do it myself.

203
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,100
Who are you going to kill?

204
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,930
Who else?

205
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,180
Long Aoyi.

206
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,460
Only if she is dead,

207
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,130
can all the troubles

208
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,490
be solved.

209
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:04,700
Lady.

210
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,850
Don’t abandon yourself to emotions.

211
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,940
Master said so

212
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,180
because he was angry.

213
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,100
Lady.

214
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,100
Xiaoxian.

215
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:14,890
Lady.

216
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,100
Yes.

217
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,270
I come here

218
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
to apologize to you.

219
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,080
I shouldn’t have slapped your face.

220
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,780
Think about it.

221
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,460
When your mother was alive,

222
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,630
it was me who stopped her
from beating you.

223
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,670
You are the commissioner

224
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,910
with great power.

225
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,480
It is reasonable for you

226
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,320
to choose anyone to collude with.

227
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,510
Xiaoxian,

228
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,270
listen to my advice.

229
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,720
When the Great Way prevails,

230
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,600
who can free himself from
fame and power?

231
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,470
That’s why

232
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,470
many things aren’t simply
black-and-white.

233
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,710
After slapping you,

234
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,230
I stayed in your mother’s room
for a long time.

235
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,520
After your mother passed away,

236
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,520
I promised her

237
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,520
to be nice to you.

238
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,040
I definitely won’t remarry.

239
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,110
Although your father is a warrior,

240
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,750
I also know a truth:

241
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,010
A man who isn’t for himself
is a man in vain.

242
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,890
I have my plans.

243
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,730
What you should do

244
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,730
is to care about nothing.

245
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,220
As for Prince Zhao and Li Qingliu,

246
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,970
think about it yourself.

247
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,010
Aoyi, I have a piece of salt,

248
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,460
Let’s add it.

249
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:17,890
Silly boy.

250
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,850
The best of shrimps is their fresh taste.

251
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,890
If we add salt, they will only
taste salty.

252
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:23,420
Take it.

253
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:25,730
Take it.

254
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,130
Let me.

255
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,110
Aoyi, I waited in the archway today,

256
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,710
but didn’t see Xiaoqin.

257
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:32,960
But

258
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,480
when I took them to beg in the city,

259
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,550
in several streets and markets

260
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,440
we could see some

261
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,670
white-haired people asking about you.

262
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,630
White hair?

263
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,030
Their accent is a bit like ours here,

264
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,440
but not the same.

265
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,150
White hair, not local.

266
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:56,390
Are they from White Hair Gang
from northern Sichuan?

267
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,630
Shunzi,

268
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,750
can you mimic

269
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,670
the accent of those people?

270
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,910
They call “biting things”
“birding things”,

271
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,870
and call “wind blowing”
“wind booming”.

272
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,910
It’s the accent of Northwest Sichuan.

273
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,120
That’s it.

274
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,790
They are here for me.

275
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,150
Shunzi. It doesn’t matter.

276
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,670
You keep on looking for Xiaoqin.

277
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,200
Hmm.

278
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,440
You mentioned Master Long’s father?

279
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,870
My father said

280
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,720
Master Long’s father took her
to Silver City

281
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,840
when she was five or six.

282
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,390
I don’t know who they offended.

283
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,510
Her father was stabbed to death
in the street.

284
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,320
You asked the right person.

285
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,510
When she was a teenager,

286
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,840
she came here to buy meat.

287
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,720
I was very busy,

288
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,750
so I just threw her a knife.

289
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:45,960
It was Feng

290
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,510
who raised Master Long up.

291
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,270
Even the grumpy girl at her side,

292
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:50,870
it’s said

293
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,550
she was rescued from a trafficker.

294
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,910
But when she touched the hilt,

295
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,030
it was as if she were touching
a burning charcoal.

296
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,630
She threw it away so quickly.

297
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,750
What I want to ask is,

298
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,080
besides Tangkou Quay
of Longzhu Gang,

299
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,320
where else does Master Long often go?

300
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,360
Where else does she often go?

301
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,120
Master,

302
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,750
I couldn’t understand

303
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,550
what we are here for.

304
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,480
A five-feet woman

305
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,720
who can’t hold a knife

306
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,200
assassinated a seven-feet man.

307
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,030
Don’t you think it is strange?

308
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,840
What shall we do?

309
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:36,670
Don’t report it to the officials.

310
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,910
Keep looking for Long Aoyi.

311
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,960
When necessary, do at any cost.

312
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,480
If you can’t find her, don’t come back.

313
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:46,480
Yes.

314
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,040
Have a taste! Freshly made!

315
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,240
I waited so long,

316
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,150
but still didn’t see Xiaoqin.

317
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:58,870
Lantern!

318
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,870
Check it out!

319
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,150
Third brother, give me the green glass bead
Long Aoyi always takes with her

320
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,830
after catching her.
It’s very useful to me.

321
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,000
Aoyi, I’m back.

322
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,750
You’re back.

323
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,840
Do you want me to help you?

324
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,030
It’s okay, go inside.

325
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,120
Shunzi, help me twist it.

326
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,870
Go to the ruined temple
opposite our house.

327
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,600
Don’t wait for me.

328
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,200
Why?

329
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,000
Don’t ask. Just go quickly.

330
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,080
Don’t hide. Come out.

331
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:02,870
Master Long.

332
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,720
Even the White Hair Gang
from northern Sichuan is dispatched.

333
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,960
I feel so proud!

334
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,080
Will we drink tea or liquor?

335
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,120
Don’t talk nonsense!

336
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,000
Since we found you, give up
the idea of running away.

337
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,390
Take her away!

338
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,840
Commissioner, you are also here!

339
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,480
Go!

340
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:26,910
Stop!

341
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,260
= Du’s Mansion =

342
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,960
Why are you so late?

343
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,270
We almost missed the ideal time.

344
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,320
The dish must be served before noon.

345
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,360
Yue’er, watch the pot.

346
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,510
Remember to hold the dish
with a gold cup.

347
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,200
Be at ease, Miss.

348
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,320
The Nine Vegetables Soup

349
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,960
is a delicacy only served to
princesses in the former dynasty.

350
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,150
But you beat the bushes to get this recipe.

351
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,360
When Mr. Li tastes it,

352
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,150
he will be thankful
for your thoughtfulness.

353
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,590
These days,

354
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,710
because of Long,
we had estrangement.

355
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,340
But I can’t make Qingliu believe

356
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,250
that I was really angry with him.

357
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,850
The doorman said you have
something to tell me.

358
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,370
Someone asked me to take you a letter.

359
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:23,610
Who sent you?

360
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,540
This morning,

361
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,940
someone gave me one tael of silver

362
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,060
and said I must send this letter

363
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,220
to you.

364
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,940
Only Li Qingliu himself can
go to the kiln in the suburb

365
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,610
with the Customs Seal of Xinsilu.

366
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:35,850
You must go there on your own,

367
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,940
or Long Aoyi will die like a dog.

368
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,510
Whether to kill me or torture me,
make it quick!

369
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,480
Don’t waste time.

370
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,030
Please wait.

371
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,630
Your life is worthless.

372
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,030
I’m waiting for your man to come.

373
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,670
The man with the surname Li.

374
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,030
Li Qingliu.

375
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,320
Li Qingliu is such a great guy.

376
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,000
What am I in his heart?

377
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,120
Will he come to save me?

378
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,480
Get real!

379
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,480
Master Li.

380
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,360
Speak of the devil!

381
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,320
Let him come here.

382
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,790
Come and see your sweetheart first.

383
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,640
She has been waiting for you
for a long time.

384
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,030
Did you bring

385
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,030
what I asked you to take?

386
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,720
It is with me.

387
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:42,790
If you let her go,

388
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,440
I’ll give it to you.

389
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,480
Let me tell you,

390
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,720
you’d better not play tricks with me.

391
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,640
Li Qingliu,

392
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,480
who asked you to pretend to be a good man?

393
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,880
Go back quickly!

394
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,160
You freeloaded for
such a long time in my Silk Store.

395
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,680
I must leave you safe and sound

396
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,640
so that you can pay me the debt.

397
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,640
There’s nothing nutritious to eat.

398
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,350
I’m skinny now.

399
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,480
Where could I get the money?

400
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,750
If you have no money,
you can owe it.

401
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,070
But the interest must be paid.

402
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,590
I’m on the verge of death.

403
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,790
But you are talking about interests?

404
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,310
Both of you, shut up!

405
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,830
Are you playing double reeds here?

406
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,830
And you even play a bitter drama.

407
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,240
Listen up, you two.

408
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:16,960
Today,

409
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,160
give up the hope of leaving here alive!

410
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,400
= Customs Seal =
I brought the Customs Seal to you.

411
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:30,790
You make an offer.

412
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,070
How much should I pay
to take her away?

413
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,070
You kidnapped her

414
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,680
for just a one-off price.

415
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,270
I changed my mind.

416
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,830
There is no such a good thing in the world.

417
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,920
With only a piece of paper,

418
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,240
you want to save someone?

419
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,440
I

420
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,920
want her life.

421
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,000
Servants!

422
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,030
Throws this girl into the well
to feed turtles.

423
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,440
Wait!

424
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,060
= Sutra in Forty-Two Sections =

425
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,680
I heard that Master Qiyan
is mad at gambling.

426
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,790
Shall we have a bet?

427
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,880
Master Li,

428
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,070
you are in such a good mood!

429
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,550
Tell me

430
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,180
what are we betting?

431
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,680
Li Qingliu, are you addicted to
gambling?

432
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,200
Last time it was in public at Wanhua.

433
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,270
But it’s in his place today.

434
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,600
He absolutely will play tricks on you!

435
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,620
= Live =

436
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:48,340
= Die =

437
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,830
We’ll bet who will choose
the character “live”.

438
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,030
If you win, we are at your disposal.

439
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,680
If I win,

440
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:57,920
I’ll take her away.

441
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,480
OK.

442
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,960
Such a big bet.

443
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,000
I like it.

444
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,510
I’m in.

445
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,070
Li Qingliu is not a reckless person.

446
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,110
I think he can tell which is
the character of “live”.

447
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,680
I have to find a way to make
Li Qingliu choose first.

448
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,160
Can you hurry up?

449
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,520
Li Qingliu,

450
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,070
you are the chief of

451
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,830
the largest silk store in Silver City.

452
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,960
It is said that a gentleman
shall be courtesy.

453
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,480
What can he do if you let him
choose first?

454
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:12,350
Without knowing the truth of death,
how can one know that of life?

455
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,510
The fate is in the hands.

456
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:16,030
Shut up.

457
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,880
If you keep singing,
I’ll seal your mouth.

458
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,160
What’s wrong?

459
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,350
Master Qiyan,
do you dare not to choose?

460
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,440
Let me tell you.

461
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,200
In my eyes,

462
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,160
there is no such word as dare not.

463
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,030
OK.

464
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:33,030
Master Qiyan, please.

465
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,920
I won’t let you fool me.

466
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:35,960
Take the lead, please.

467
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,030
He took the bait.

468
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,640
I asked you to choose first,
but you refused.

469
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,750
Li Qingliu, wait a minute.
Let him choose first.

470
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,720
I let you choose first.

471
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,030
Then I’ll choose now.

472
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,020
= Die =

473
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,110
Qiyan just puts on an air of
being cultured.

474
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:18,640
= Live =

475
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,510
= Live =
He doesn’t know unprocessed Xuan paper

476
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,590
feels completely different
from the processed Xuan paper.

477
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:22,790
Impossible.

478
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:23,790
Qiyan,

479
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,270
since it’s doomed,
you’d better accept it.

480
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,240
If you turn yourself in,

481
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,000
maybe

482
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,440
I will say a few good words

483
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,590
for you in front of the officers.

484
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,960
Fine, I accept it.

485
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
Watch your back!

486
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,480
Qiyan, you shameless guy!

487
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,480
Don’t play if you can’t afford to lose.

488
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,440
Wait.

489
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,480
= Customs Seal =
Do you want it?

490
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:47,720
Give it to me.

491
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,680
Throw her down.

492
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,070
Qiyan,

493
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,750
you even bully

494
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,830
a defenseless woman.

495
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,510
You are even worse than a bastard.

496
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,550
Master Li,

497
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,480
do you want to be a hero?

498
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,260
OK.

499
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,790
I’ll fulfill your wish.

500
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:09,960
Take “good care” of him!

501
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,960
If you dare to resist,

502
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,900
I’ll kill her now.

503
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,350
Li Qingliu.

504
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,070
Get away!

505
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,400
I don’t want you to save me.

506
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,640
Come on!

507
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,590
Stop! Stop!

508
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,510
Li Qingliu, dare you fight back?

509
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,110
Aren’t you always very capable?

510
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,790
Fight back.

511
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,350
Fight back!

512
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:57,720
The legendary invincible Li Qingliu,

513
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,310
for only a grumpy girl

514
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,640
from the lower class,

515
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,200
is now eager to

516
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:06,110
lick my shoes?

517
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,320
♪ Let’s watch the secular world ♪

518
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,580

♪ Let’s watch the mountains and roads ♪

520
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,400
Li Qingliu.

521
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:19,920
How are you?

522
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:26,190
♪ Let’s watch blooming
and withering flowers ♪

523
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,200
What a lovey-dovey man!

524
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,140
♪ Let’s watch people missing each other ♪

525
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,310
Instead of investigating

526
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,160
the gold thread of your Silk Store,

527
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,270
you came to rescue this girl.

528
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,240
I knew that

529
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,440
you have much weight

530
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,200
in his heart.

531
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,350
It was you.

532
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,030
I should have thought of it.

533
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,480
Stealing the gold thread and
setting Longzhu Gang up,

534
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,160
are all done by you!

535
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,310
Yes...

536
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,350
I did them.

537
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,480
Dongzi went to steal the gold thread,

538
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,110
and Dachun went to sell the stolen goods.

539
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,350
I asked them to do that.

540
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,550
I just want to use your people

541
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,720
to ruin your own business.

542
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,400
Their death is also because of you.

543
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,750
The fire of Silk Store

544
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,160
set by Vendor Zhou was also
the order of you.

545
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,270
And you also killed him, didn’t you?

546
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,750
Exactly.

547
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,920
Why did you do that?

548
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,510
You dare to ask me why!

549
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,550
Snake Gang was the largest gang
in Silver City.

550
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,480
Who could deny the fact that

551
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,640
our business was everywhere
in Silver City?

552
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,510
But since you nasty girl

553
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,070
came out with your fellows,

554
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,350
forget about the gangster rules,

555
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:44,400
you even dared to invade our territory

556
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,160
and took away my fellows.

557
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,140
Bastard!

558
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,930
You are the villain,
but you complain first!

559
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,490
The so-called gangster rules

560
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:53,780
are only your own rules.

561
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,690
The reason why Snake Gang
didn’t develop well

562
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,300
is because you are selfish,

563
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,140
unfaithful,

564
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,410
you don’t share,
and you maltreat your fellows.

565
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,450
Servants!

566
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:05,480
Take them to the kiln.

567
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:05,830
Get up!

568
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,740
- Serve them well!
- Long Aoyi!

569
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:08,750
Long Aoyi!

570
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,070
Go.

571
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,240
- Li Qingliu!
- Long Aoyi!

572
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,480
Let me go!

573
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,030
= Xinsilu =

574
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:14,750
The four of you go to the south
of the city.

575
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,790
The two of you go to the north
of the city.

576
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,240
Go!

577
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,110
- Aye!
- Aye!

578
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,880
What’s happening?

579
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,240
You look so worried.

580
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,200
I can’t find Master.

581
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,640
The doorman said

582
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,030
someone came to see Master this morning,

583
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,160
and Master left without taking anyone.

584
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,790
So strange.

585
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:33,960
Did Qingliu

586
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,270
give you a message?

587
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,920
No, I asked all of them.

588
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,270
It’s over the lunch time.

589
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:40,640
Usually,

590
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,160
Master doesn’t go outside

591
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,400
to make do with his lunch.

592
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,350
There must be something strange.

593
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,830
Maybe something bad happened to Qingliu.

594
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,480
I’ll ask my father for help now.

595
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,640
If you get any news,

596
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,880
tell me as soon as possible.

597
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:51,880
We have reported it to the officials.

598
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:53,720
Thank you, Miss Du.

599
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,680
Mr. Yan.

600
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,100
= Heaven Lake =

601
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,830
Every place that Master
usually goes to

602
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:04,720
must be

603
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,030
investigated thoroughly.

604
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:06,750
Rest assured.

605
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,070
I’ll report to you as soon as
there is news.

606
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,480
OK.

607
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,170
Ask two more people to come with me.

608
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:10,790
Yeah.

609
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:15,460
= Xinsilu =

610
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,790
Mr. Yan,

611
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,000
Silver City is so big.
How can we find Master?

612
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,800
Let’s check it.

613
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,030
Does it really work?

614
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,070
We just follow the pointer on it.

615
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,920
This is called Silk Worm Compass.

616
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,640
There is a rare kind of silk worm

617
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,880
on Mount Taibai in the far north.

618
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,480
When it dies,
it becomes as hard as iron.

619
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,720
And it has attractive force

620
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,310
with a magnetic stone there.

621
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:35,960
Holding it,

622
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,550
you can find the direction
that the pointer is pointing.

623
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,920
So amazing.

624
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,750
Be quiet.

625
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,070
= North St. of Silver City =
Silk Store operates for so many years,

626
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,000
but we get only one.

627
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,880
Master always takes this sachet with him.

628
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,830
Take it, and maybe we can find him.

629
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,070
- Let’s go.
- OK.

630
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,070
Li Qingliu.

631
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,720
Li Qingliu. Wake up.

632
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,640
Li Qingliu. Wake up.

633
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,270
Li Qingliu!

634
00:29:59,110 --> 00:29:59,680
You’re awake!

635
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,960
He could have refused to come here.

636
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,550
He could have fought back.

637
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,680
He even handed in the Customs Seal for me.

638
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,310
Why do you look at me this way?

639
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,720
Why did you come to save me?

640
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,920
Who asked you to save me?

641
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,000
You don’t have to feel guilty.

642
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,070
I didn’t come to save you.

643
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,200
I just don’t like Qiyan.

644
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,590
Just now you said he was a bastard.

645
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,200
It was the first time
I heard this word from you.

646
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,110
If you lie down with dogs,
you will get up with fleas.

647
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,680
Didn’t you think about

648
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,790
who I’m with every day?

649
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,200
By the way,

650
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,590
where are we now?

651
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,070
A water chamber

652
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,310
in the kiln.

653
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,050
The kiln?

654
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,510
Your hands are hurt!

655
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,240
It’s fine.

656
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,920
Maybe it’s because I moved a lot just now

657
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:13,880
and the wound reopened.

658
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,590
Relax.

659
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,830
Probably Yan Bin will find us soon.

660
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:22,110
I’m not worried. Since childhood,

661
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,720
from the bottom of the bed
in the whore house

662
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,960
to the cell in government,

663
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,160
I have been to so many places.

664
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,000
It’s just another life experience.

665
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,750
I’m hungry too.

666
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,960
Look at these bowls.

667
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,000
They are made

668
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,350
to hold food.

669
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,030
Imagine

670
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,350
this bowl

671
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:53,750
holds bamboo shoots
and meat with apple sauce.

672
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,350
In this bowl

673
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,310
there are fried prawns.

674
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,680
In this bowl

675
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:03,070
there is grilled chicken
with cumin and lemon.

676
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,550
In this broken bowl,

677
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,680
there is your favorite food:

678
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,510
anglerfish soup with black truffle.

679
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,480
When we come out,

680
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,270
I’ll take you to Wanhua
and eat to our heart’s content.

681
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,590
Oh no. my sachet is gone.

682
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,740
Have a taste of my
steamed buns with stuffing!

683
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,480
Freshly cooked!

684
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,710
With thin skin and much stuffing!

685
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:36,510
- Kid.
- Sir, want some steamed buns?

686
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,030
- The thing in your hand...
- Steamed buns with stuffing!

687
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,240
Where did you get it?

688
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,270
Xiaobao was playing there just now

689
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,270
and found this.

690
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,640
Who is Xiaobao?

691
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,830
Here it is.

692
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:51,240
Xiaobao! Xiaobao!

693
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,160
That is the northwest
corner of Silver City.

694
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,440
Northwest of Silver City, the old blocks.

695
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,050
It’s deserted.

696
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,070
They must be there.

697
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,790
Little girl, I will give you
a night pearl.

698
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,720
Can you give me that thing in your hand

699
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,000
in return?

700
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,110
Thank you.

701
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,920
It is Master’s.

702
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,720
- It is Master’s.
- Is it?

703
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,640
Go.

704
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:34,480
Keep up.

705
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:38,880
Father,

706
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,200
Qingliu is missing.

707
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,010
Can you send people
to look for him in the city?

708
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,880
Li Qingliu is missing?

709
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,310
When did that happen?

710
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,800
According to reports from
the servants of Silk Store,

711
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,590
he went out at five a.m. today,
and never came back.

712
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,380
I told you not to pay attention to
Li Qingliu,

713
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,680
but communicate with the prince more.

714
00:33:58,050 --> 00:33:59,600
You didn’t even listen to a word of me.

715
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,400
Father,

716
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,510
it’s not the right time to talk about this.

717
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,350
Please send your men to look for him.

718
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,240
Or...

719
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,160
I’ll look for him by myself.

720
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,970
Go back.

721
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,240
If I have news, I’ll tell you.

722
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,400
Father, so you agreed?

723
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,400
Li Qingliu of Xinsilu
in the Silver City is missing.

724
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,680
It is no small business.

725
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,640
You are a woman. You’d better not
be involved into the searching work.

726
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,310
Thank you, Father. I know.

727
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,310
Servants!

728
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,510
Sir.

729
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,000
During these days,

730
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,030
don’t let Miss go out on her own.

731
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,270
Yes, Sir.

732
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,520
We made an agreement at that time.

733
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,880
I killed Vendor Zhou

734
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,440
and you convicted Long Aoyi of murder,

735
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,840
and sell all the silkworms in my hand.

736
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,680
What do you want now?

737
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,200
Do you want to quit?

738
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,920
You are such a rogue.

739
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,400
We made use of you
because we looked up to you.

740
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:06,750
But you didn’t do it well,

741
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,200
and you went to Commissioner Du.

742
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,880
Don’t you understand what I said,

743
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:13,880
or do you just want to go against
with the government?

744
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:14,890
Oh, I...

745
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,650
I don’t mean it.

746
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:19,340
You set fire on the Silk Store, and caused
people to investigate on the case.

747
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,410
You caught a nobody,

748
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,170
but people all over the city knew it.

749
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:24,850
You also kidnapped Li Qingliu.

750
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:26,690
Who is he?

751
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:28,690
How many eyes in Silver City
are staring at him?

752
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:31,650
Now can you get rid of all these things?

753
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,690
If it weren’t because Commissioner Du

754
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:34,690
refused us at first,

755
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,590
we shouldn’t have taken this step.

756
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:37,900
The plan was perfect at first,

757
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,010
but thanks to you, it is now full of flaws.

758
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,970
I come here today to tell you:

759
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,820
Deal with the aftermath caused
by yourself.

760
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:47,010
I have nothing to do with you from now on.

761
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,210
Zhu!

762
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:55,620
Master Qiyan,

763
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:57,380
the informant replied.

764
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,010
Someone is willing to buy the silkworms.

765
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,300
But the price of each silkworm
shall reduce by 100 wen.

766
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:02,900
The person is about to reach
outside the city.

767
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,340
You can trade in person immediately.

768
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,610
Zhu,

769
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,690
don’t think we can’t make it without you!

770
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,140
Inform my third brother immediately.

771
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:12,170
Ship the goods now.

772
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:12,850
Hurry.

773
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:13,690
Right.

774
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,060
We’ll see.

775
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,500
I took the item

776
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,540
as well as

777
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,210
your lives.

778
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,060
Undress him!

779
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:29,800
Right.

780
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,920
What do you want?

781
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:32,980
Go, go away!

782
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,420
Let me go!

783
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,770
Tomorrow at five,

784
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,380
the kiln will start running.

785
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,730
Wearing clothes

786
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,130
is more uncomfortable than not.

787
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,940
Aren’t you very capable?

788
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:47,900
- Let me see it.
- Get off of me!

789
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,410
How much else do you have?

790
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,650
Today I’ll let you know

791
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,060
how it feels to be a roast duck!

792
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,250
Why not roast a viper?

793
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,250
Remove the guts, peel the skin
and drink its blood.

794
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,380
Qiyan.

795
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,980
I’m asking you to go back.

796
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,250
Qiyan!

797
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,940
Seal the door.

798
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,020
This time they can’t escape
even with wings.

799
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:18,490
One, two, three, four.

800
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,940
A little closer.

801
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,330
Be gentle.

802
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,810
Don’t move. Hold on a little bit.

803
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:33,380
Come closer.

804
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,060
Hurry up.

805
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:37,580
Alright.

806
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,420
Good job. What trick did you use?

807
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:43,610
Help me untie it.

808
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,060
It’s just because I have been
dealing with silk thread for a long time.

809
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,170
I’ll teach you later.

810
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:49,690
Here.

811
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,440
The bastard Qiyan

812
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,880
sealed the entrance.

813
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,960
The north is the dark and cold side.

814
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,670
and the south is the bright
and warm side.

815
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:08,930
The door should be on the south side.

816
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,840
But according to the humidity of the soil,

817
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,670
this is the bright and warm side.

818
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,190
But the door isn’t here.

819
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:22,670
I guess there must be something strange.

820
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,360
You even know something

821
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,000
about fengshui?

822
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,440
The Book of Change, and the Eight Diagrams

823
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,550
are the study of the change
of the universe.

824
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,590
If you learn it, you can both see things

825
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,440
and know the mind.

826
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,880
Whose mind do you want to know now?

827
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,880
Find another way to get out first!

828
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,400
What is it? The stone is strange.

829
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,400
It’s the stone in the grave.

830
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,000
How come it is here?

831
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,230
No wonder the soil is tight here.

832
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,280
It seems that this kiln

833
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,670
used to be a graveyard with
ancient tombs in hard soil.

834
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,510
We can’t get out.

835
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,030
And now,

836
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,550
even the kiln isn’t a usual one.

837
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,550
Since I met you,

838
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,840
everything was out of my control.

839
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:22,740
♪ I embarked on the journey

840
