No, Sir.

I haven’t, Sir.

72
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,420

How come there are
soldiers everywhere?

81
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,850
If they came for Long Aoyi,

82
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,090
that’s a bit too much trouble.

83
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,810

You see, this.

85
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,580
Judging from their looks, they are
from the White Hair Gang.

Let’s go.

87

They are demons and devils.

91
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,400
But I would be

92
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,120
surprised if you’re correct.

93
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,520
I’m more surprised at your appearance.

94
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,870
You got bitten.

95
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,310
The wound is not big.

96
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,200
But it’s swollen.

97
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,360
It’s getting blue, too.

98
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,640
There’s toxin in it, let me suck it out.

99
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,960
It’s okay, I’ll be alright.

100
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,310
It was the Poecilotheria ornata
which bit you.

101
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,680
If the toxin can’t get out,

102
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,870
your muscle would be dead.

103
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,240
Do you really see yourself as a doctor?

104
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,430
Stop holding it up, it’s dangerous.

105

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,870
I’ll go and check.

172
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,480
Watch out.

173
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,800
Old drunkard.

174
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,750
Are you okay?

175
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,990
Don’t lose your life here.

176
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,160
A man has to be okay.

177
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,630
Old drunkard.

178
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,390
Manager Yan.

179
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,220
Old drunkard.

180
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,140
Are you okay?

181
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,020
Thanks.

182
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,090
Manager Yan, why are you here?

183
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:47,650
You,

184
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,050
you are from Wuyun Pavilion.

185
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,730
Can we talk?

186
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,410
Is everything okay?

187
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,460
No wonder there are so many

188
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,170
people patrolling on the streets.

189
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,900
The youngest son of Li’s
disappeared, too.

190
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,410
Did you say that Mr. Li disappeared

191
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,050
around the Northwest corner?

192
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:06,970
Any proof?

193
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,260
Please have a look.

194
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,620
Since we have the equipment,

195
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,260
how come we can’t find him?

196
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,080
You may not know, Feng.

197
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,820
Master carried this

198
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,330
with him all the time,

199
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:24,850
but we found it

200
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:25,940
in the steamed buns stand
around the corner.

201
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,410
Following the lead,

202
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,270
we found evidences of struggle
in Zuiweng Pavilion.

203
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,720
But nobody was there.

204
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,890
There’s a smell of cosan on it.

205
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,120
Only cement around the tomb stone

206
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:37,810
smells like this.

207
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,640
There used to be

208
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,760
some old tombs around the
Northwest corner of the city.

209
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,240
Right here.

210
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,630
The former Mansion of Liu’s.

211
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,610
Kiln workshop.

212
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,140
Thank you.

213
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,170
You should act now.

214
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:52,940
Let’s go.

215
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,460
I want to join you.

216
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,820
His disappearance

217
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,130
must have something to do
with Long Aoyi.

218
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,300
Let’s go and see.

219
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,230
Dad.

220
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,220
- Do you like the windmill?
- Yes.

221
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,940
Dad.

222
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,020
What’s wrong?

223
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,540
Dad.

224
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,340
Dad.

225
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,130
It’s too hot.

226
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,450
No.

227
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,730
How come you came this early?

228
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:38,380
Hu Laosan.

229
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,220
I miss the liquor,

230
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,090
so I came by early.

231
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,770
Wanting to have a drink.

232
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,890
See, this is something new.

233
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,370
Save some for me.

234
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,300
How are you?

235
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,340
Why is it so hot?

236
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,130
I want to ask.

237
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,770
There’s still toxin left in your body.

238
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,300
You got a fever last night.

239
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:24,700
You’ve been talking in your dream.

240
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,010
The workshop started to work.

241
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,540
The temperature is getting higher.

242
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,420
We should find our way out quickly.

243
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,660
Anyone out here?

244
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,610
We’re inside.

245
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,010
Help!

246
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,300
What are you looking at?

247
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,540
Okay, I’m coming.

248
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,770
Hey.

249
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:01,460
I can’t do it.

250
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,700
Anyone out there?

251
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,610
Why is it so hot here?

252
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,010
Help!

253
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,180
Hot.

254
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,580
Come, come to me.

255
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,090
It’s cooler here.

256
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:27,940
Here.

257
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,460
Do you feel better?

258
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,220
No.

259
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:35,660
I can’t

260
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,090
breathe.

261
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,090
Brother Zhansi.

262
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,460
Your liquor

263
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,660
is the best

264
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:47,940
not only in the Silver City,

265
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,130
but in the whole country.

266
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,660
If you open a liquor store.

267
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:51,730
I think

268
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:52,850
you can beat

269
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,700
Li Qingliu from Xinsilu

270
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,850
in the future.

271
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,340
Anyone out there?

272
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,540
Help!

273
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:03,850
Li Qingliu.

274
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,340
I can’t.

275
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,490
If I die,

276
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,420
can you help me?

277
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,820
Tell the Second Master

278
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,180
to take care of my fellows

279
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,610
in the Gang.

280
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,180
Tell my mentor

281
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,180
that I dug a hole under her bed last year.

282
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,090
All the money

283
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,370
I’ve earned

284
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,460
is in there.

285
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,090
Tell Xiaoqin,

286
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,460
though Yan Bin

287
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,660
is not good looking,

288
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,730
but he’s reliable.

289
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,340
I’ve prepared a dowry

290
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,160
for her,

291
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,200
it’s in

292
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,310
my room.

293
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,420
I won’t let you die.

294
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,180
Hang in there.

295
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,420
Nice, nice.

296
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,110
Here.

297
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,170
Very nice.

298
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:43,700
Excuse me.

299
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,850
Did you see a man and a woman?

300
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,730
The man is handsome
and the woman is a little weird?

301
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,420
Weird?

302
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,730
I think you’re weird.

303
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,820
There’s never a guy like you

304
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,460
coming here before.

305
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:01,130
I wonder what do you mean by weird.

306
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,420
What’s that place?

307
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,940
It’s the boiling room.

308
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,340
What’s in there?

309
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,460
Nothing normally.

310
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,220
It’s for filtering the vapor.

311
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,730
Aren’t you tired?

312
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,010
Put me down.

313
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,460
I’m becoming a roast duck.

314
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,060
I don’t want to die yet.

315
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,850
Hang in there for me.

316
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,300
It’s too hot, I’m so sleepy.

317
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,410
I want to sleep.

318
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,180
Don’t, don’t.

319
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,490
Last time,

320
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:49,540
last time

321
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,460
you sold pillows with Prince Zhao.

322
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,250
You lied down together in public.

323
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,220
Do you like him or what?

324
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,580
No, I’ve told you.

325
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,340
Lying down together,

326
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,660
what’s the difference

327
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,580
with me and Second Master?

328
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,660
Isn’t it normal?

329
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,580
Yeah, like this.

330
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:06,700
Don’t fall asleep.

331
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,090
Hang on.

332
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,890
Anyone out there?

333
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:15,940
Help! Anyone?

334
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:17,300
Open it.

335
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,460
What’s wrong? Well.

336
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:22,820
Put me down.

337
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,130
Long.

338
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,220
Mentor.

339
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,540
Long, you okay?

340
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,250
You’re hurt. Are you okay?

341
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,340
You scared me.

342
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,060
Where did you go for the past few days?

343
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,220
Where are your clothes?

344
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:51,010
You two stayed alone in the same room,

345
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,130
is it appropriate?

346
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,060
What did I teach you?

347
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,300
I’ve taught you to be

348
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,610
self-esteemed and self-valued.

349
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,130
Do you remember them at all?

350
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,340
You’ve misunderstood us.

351
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,460
Misunderstood?

352
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:03,820
Did he touch you?

353
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,220
How dare you!

354
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,940
- Madam. Madam.
- How dare you!

355
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,580
Did he kiss you?

356
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,250
Well...

357
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,370
How dare you!

358
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,790
Mentor.

359
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,710
Kiss!

360
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,770
Mentor.

361
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,010
- Madam.
- How dare you kiss her?

362
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:24,970
Mentor.

363
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,970
He didn’t do anything to me.

364
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,490
Didn’t do anything? He kissed you!

365
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,350
Here, come and hug.

366
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:34,770
You guys,

367
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,620
don’t talk, don’t ask, don’t laugh.

368
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,400
Fourth Master, you’ve been around.

369
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,010
Is it okay?

370
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,010
Well, what, what’s the matter?

371
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,770
- Stayed alone with mess dresses.
- Put your clothes on.

372
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:48,970
Guys.

373
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,490
Please keep a secret

374
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,660
of what you saw.

375
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,640
Secret.

376
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:55,810
What happened?

377
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:56,330
Okay, keep the secret.

378
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,570
Yan Bin.

379
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:02,700
Let’s

380
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:04,940
go out.

381
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,700
Stop laughing.

382
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,530
I’ll kill him for kissing you.

383
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,250
Too hard.

384
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,050
I earned a lot.

385
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,100
Let’s go have a drink.

386
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:22,900
= Xinsilu =

387
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,760
Are you done changing?

388
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,080
I’ve taken off the old ones.

389
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:34,910
What about Master Long?

390
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,230
She’s getting ready, too.

391
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,230
What do you

392
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,710
think of them came back together

393
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,390
and they were all wet?

394
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,910
Master’s

395
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,520
clothes were missing.

396
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,710
Plus.

397
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,760
He got a swollen lip when he’s back.

398
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,000
Seems like

399
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,670
someone bit him.

400
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,440
Wow.

401
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,940
Stop gossiping.

402
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,000
Are you crazy?

403
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,910
What if you got the toxin, too?

404
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,430
I’m so hot, I want to sleep.

405
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,120
Don’t sleep, don’t.

406
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,000
Master.

407
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,910
Are you okay? Let me see.

408
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,760
You’ve got thinner.

409
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,000
We looked for you for long.

410
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,670
Can’t you recognize me?

411
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,190
I ate and slept well.

412
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,230
But missed

413
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,670
your

414
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,560
steamed fish with garlic.

415
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,190
I’ll cook for you later when we’re back.

416
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,870
Master, I heard that your hand is injured.

417
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,840
Where is it?

418
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,320
It’s okay, I’ve handled it.

419
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,320
Where did you go?

420
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,000
I went to prepare horses for you.

421
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,560
Where’s mentor?

422
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:29,910
Feng and Carpenter Tan

423
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,360
set off earlier.

424
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,190
Qiyan is with the White Hair Gang.

425
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,520
They may go out and deliver the goods.

426
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,230
Why didn’t you say earlier?

427
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,190
They said that

428
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,470
you two are single.

429
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,280
Your clothes were messed up,
it was inappropriate.

430
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:46,800
So, you should get dressed first.

431
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,910
Let’s, let’s hurry.

432
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,150
They are no friendly people.

433
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,630
Yan Bin, get the horse.

434
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,150
- Yes.
- Let’s go together.

435
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,180
= Xinsilu =

436
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,760
Yan Bin said that

437
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,320
you were stuck with Master Li
in the workshop.

438
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:06,910
Also that you...

439
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,430
What did you hear? Don’t gossip.

440
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:09,910
Well.

441
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I’ll tell you later.

442
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,170
You’re wounded.

443
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,910
You can ride with me.

444
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,290
Master.

445
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,560
We’ve experienced things together,
right?

446
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:32,560
Go.

447
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:36,940
Well.

448
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,350
Go.

449
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,170
Where’s our horse?

450
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,560
We...

451
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,700
Master, wait for us.

452
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:43,900
Master.

453
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,220
Seems like Qiyan and the
White Hair Gang

454
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,420
are dealing.

455
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,050
Where are Feng and Carpenter Tan?

456
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:05,620
Let’s wait and see.

457
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,810
When the barbarian come,

458
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,180
hurry up and check the money.

459
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,940
It’s our last deal.

460
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,770
Anyone who comes in our way dies.

461
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,050
What’s with the trouble?

462
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:16,010
It’s in the middle of nowhere.

463
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,490
Just kill him.

464
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,640
Nobody will know.

465
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:20,640
They are your goods.

466
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,220
We won’t take more money.

467
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,770
Right now, it’s the critical time.

468
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,730
We have to be careful.

469
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:27,940
Don’t worry.

470
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,620
I will give

471
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,380
the money as I promised.

472
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,250
Xiaoqin, go and find mentor.

473
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,420
Master, take care of yourself.

474
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,530
Yan Bin, go with her.

475
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:40,260
Yes.

476
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:42,900
Master Qiyan.

477
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,250
Master Qiyan. They are coming.

478
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:46,050
Stop yelling.

479
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,810
People can hear you.

480
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,460
There is someone following
the barbarian.

481
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:52,700
Someone else?

482
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:54,900
Listen.

483
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,050
If anything happens,

484
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,730
show your weapon, run with the goods.

485
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:01,940
Yes.

486
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,670
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

487
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,710
We went out separately

488
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,870
which took some time.

489
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,190
Who’s he?

490
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,040
A dumb slave I just bought.

491
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,630
You don’t bring slaves normally.

492
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,390
It’s a big deal,

493
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,600
bringing someone

494
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,600
can help.

495
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,520
He’s indeed dumb.

496
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,360
I’d like to see the goods.

497
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,560
Then you

498
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,430
have to show us the money.

499
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:48,840
There are many of you.

500
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,760
If I want to set you up,

501
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,560
do I need to

502
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,040
come with all the trouble?

503
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,430
I asked for small bits of money,
not like these.

504
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,230
I didn’t have time to

505
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,800
go and change.

506
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,360
Master Qiyan.

507
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:18,560
It’s late.

508
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,800
Let’s go with the money.

509
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,080
Are you silly?

510
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,190
All the official money has marks.

511
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,080
The government will track us.

512
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,390
Forget it, so be it.

513
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,710
Don’t be afraid.

514
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,390
You can break them if you’re scared.

515
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:31,630
Pixiu.

516
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:32,190
Yes.

517
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,560
Count their money.

518
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,470
Yes.

519
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,150
Are you clear with the money?

520
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,470
Where are my goods?

521
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:42,190
And the pass?

522
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,120
There are five more on the carry.

523
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,630
Just be clear.

524
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,560
What about us?

525
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:00,840
Long Aoyi.

526
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,230
You’re really hunting us.

527
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,040
Qiyan, cut it out.

528
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,600
Just give up.

529
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,710
Qiyan, it’s time

530
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,080
to settle things out.

531
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,150
Sure.

532
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,760
But

533
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,760
you have to deal with it.

534
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,840
Guys,

535
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:32,950
drop the weapons.

536
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:38,840
Du Changfeng.

537
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:51,840
Mr. Du.

538
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,080
Now.

539
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,910
Take Qiyan and his fellows.

540
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:57,910
Mr. Du,

541
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,710
what are you doing?

542
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,190
Fine.

543
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,760
I’ll not go easy on you, either.

544
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,800
What are you waiting for?

545
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,840
Take him away!

546
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,320
What’s the move, did you see it?

547
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,390
I think it was knife hand,
he’s pretty good.

548
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,560
- Go.
- Go.

549
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,840
Mr. Du.

550
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,950
Qiyan is the main suspect involved
in many cases.

551
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:39,880
How could you...?

552
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:40,610
Qingliu,

553
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,470
I’ve been investigating him

554
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,870
for long.

555
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,280
I’ve surrounded the place.

556
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,910
Like what I’ve taught you,

557
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,600
don’t show signs that you’re arrested.

558
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,760
My people would follow you,

559
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,630
just say he’s your slave.

560
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,190
I warn you.

561
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,390
Later,

562
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,430
if we can arrest the people
with goods together,

563
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,080
you’d be the key witness.

564
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:02,870
Or else,

565
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,710
you’d be sentenced to death.

566
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,150
You saw it, too.

567
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,230
How dare he to assassinate me.

568
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,320
I had to

569
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,390
kill him.

570
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,760
Excuse me

571
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,670
for didn’t stop him.

572
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:21,840
Never mind.

573
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,230
Nice move, Commissioner.

574
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,800
But it’s

575
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,430
inappropriate to kill the key witness

576
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,670
at this critical time.

577
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,630
I’m sorry, Master Long.

578
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,950
So you’re planning to

579
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,840
kill me?

580
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,840
Not at all.

581
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,670
I’m just complimenting your move.

582
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,390
Bring the criminal

583
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:53,420
who set fire at the Silk Store.

584
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,230
Tell them what

585
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,600
Qiyan asked you to do.

586
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,470
Don’t let them think

587
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,430
that a commissioner like me

588
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,280
would haggle with

589
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,230
a hooligan.

590
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,800
Yes, Sir.

591
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,280
It was all Qiyan’s idea.

592
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,360
He stole the gold thread,

593
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,120
and set fire in the Silk Store.

594
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,610
He set up Master Long.

595
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:18,900
All for getting the Customs Pass

596
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,610
to smuggle the silkworm eggs abroad.

597
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:28,940
Take him.

598
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,530
Now Master Long has been
proved innocent.

599
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,020
I announce that

600
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,940
the order to arrest Long Aoyi
is officially dismissed.

601
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,470
What about Second Mater?

602
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,320
He

603
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,040
caused trouble during my work,
but it’s okay.

604
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,670
I’ll let him go.

605
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:51,280
Of course,

606
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,280
the office would continue

607
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,470
investigating the cases.

608
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,280
Bring back the Pass to Master Li.

609
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,630
Yes, Sir.

610
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,040
In the whole process,

611
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,280
Du Changfeng

612
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,910
was always here on time,

613
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,040
but he always let us go so easily.

614
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,440
There’s something wrong.

615
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,180
= Xinsilu =

616
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:24,150
Master.

617
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,390
Miss Du brought it to you.

618
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,190
Take it away.

619
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:33,710
Yes.

620
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:43,670
Qingliu.

621
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:45,230
Did you clean up at the front?

622
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,390
Take a rest.

623
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,150
I’ve prepared dinner for you as comfort.

624
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,190
Sir.

625
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,190
I’ve done everything you’ve asked.

626
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:01,230
I’ve killed Pixiu and Qiyan,

627
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,360
and their fellows in the prison.

628
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,760
Long Aoyi is clever.

629
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,760
But,

630
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,670
no one gets information

631
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,040
from the dead.

632
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,430
By the way,

633
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,630
did Prince Zhao come back
from the temple?

634
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:23,580
Yes.

635
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,460
He went to Wuyun Pavilion right away.

636
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,630
It’s time for me to go to the Capital.

637
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:34,420
I need to set off soon.

638
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,470
Prince Zhao and Long Aoyi

639
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,950
are real dangers.

640
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,600
Watch them.

641
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,040
No mistakes allowed.

642
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,390
Yes.

643
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,870
= Wuyun Pavilion =
- We are reopening today. - Come on.

644
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,550
- Come on, people.
- Come on.

645
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:02,800
Come in, let’s have fun.

646
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,600
You’re late.

647
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:22,150
I’m not only pretty but also smart.

648
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,870
Make a backstitch for straight lines.

649
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,670
Xiaoqin said that except for spices,

650
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,560
we should put hair

651
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,320
in it, too.

652
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,470
Who’d want that?

653
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,390
You can’t sell it nor eat it.

654
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,280
It’s kind of creepy, too.

655
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,320
Never mind.

656
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,470
= Wuyun Pavilion =
Bring out your posture.

657
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,230
Be pretty. That’s right.

658
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,520
Greetings to Feng.

659
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:13,360
Mr. Li, what are you doing here?

660
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,670
Please ask

661
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,430
Master Long to come out, okay?

662
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,560
You can just go in.

663
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:20,670
Watch.

664
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,330
Nice.

665
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,430
Please do me this favor.

666
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:25,470
You’re too shy.

667
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:28,320
Master, come out.

668
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:29,950
Master Li is here for you.

669
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,630
Tell him I’m busy.

670
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,520
Master Li, what brings you here?

671
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:40,870
Well,

672
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,150
the Silk Store arranged a dinner for me.

673
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,040
- I’d like to
- Come on, Sir.

674
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,280
invite her

675

with the leaders in our gang.

She’s quite busy right now.

681

Any problem?

You haven’t been here for long.

Come on.

686
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,120
Let’s pick another day, then.

687

See you.

See you next time.

You’ve learned how to

play hard to get from me.

693
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,950
It’s wrong to be too

694
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,800
active for proud guys like Li Qingliu.

695
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,600
Be cold with him, ignore him.

696
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,360
Learn it.

697
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,560
Come on.

698
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,150
Come on. Shout it.

699
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,600
- What, what to learn?
- Shout it.

700
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,360
Master.

701
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,710
Why did Li Qingliu

702
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:50,120
come all the way to invite you?

703
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,710
You’ve said no.

704
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,670
Why did you ask me

705
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,520
about his reactions then?

706
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,430
I was just curious

707
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:03,150
how he’d react to rejections.

708
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,280
I think

709
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,600
he rarely gets rejected.

710
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:13,360
Rejection works fine with men.

711
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,230
What are you thinking?

712
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,800
I think Yan Bin is fine.

713
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,760
Do you have something else in mind?

714
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,670
You’ve got more in your mind, Master.

715
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,000
How to say that?

716
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,080
Hard-to-get.

717
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,080
I find you evil now.

718
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,440
Did Yan Bin teach you this?

719
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,830
No.

720
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,750
Feng did.

721
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,310
She’s really funny.

722
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,750
Master, seriously.

723
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,710
You and Master Li...

724
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,830
What?

725
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,400
Do you feel a little...

726
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,440
A little what?

727
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,520
We just had a little contact

728
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,750
when we stuck together.

729
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,150
I don’t want to talk about it.

730
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,670
Mentioning it makes me feel

731
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,310
hot.

732
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,670
I took off all my clothes one by one.

733
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,310
All your clothes.

734
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,600
I find that you know how to
trick me now.

735
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:09,880
I know.

736
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,830
That’s when you started to

737
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,960
like him!

738
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,480
I don’t like him.

739
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,520
Don’t, don’t make up things.

740
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,000
Why, why are you stuttering?

741
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,080
Are, are you shy?

742
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,000
I’m not shy at all.

743
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:25,560
Ah. Master.

744
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,120
Didn’t he save you

745
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,350
by using the precious Customs Pass?

746
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,000
Yeah, he saved me.

747
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:32,080
He got beaten up

748
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,040
bad by Qiyan, too.

749
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,310
He lifted me up high in the room.

750
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,080
Lifted up?

751
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,830
That’s why

752
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:44,750
you asked me how to make a sachet?

753
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:46,040
Do you like him now?

754
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,710
You want to make one for him, right?

755
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:49,630
Stop it.

756
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,440
Stop it.

757
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:52,750
That’s why.

758
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,710
Give it back.

759
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,150
No.

760
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,000
Give it back.

761
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,440
No.

762
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:58,350
Xiaoqin.

763
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,350
What’s wrong, why it’s falling dust?

764
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,690
Shh.

765
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,560
Why are you sighing?

766
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,020
I thought the truth would come out

767
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,470
after catching Qiyan.

768
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:20,390
Now that he’s dead,

769
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,160
it makes things worse.

770
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,320
Du Changfeng

771
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,720
is obviously lying.

772
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,080
What should we do?

773
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,550
What can we do?

774
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,700
Mind our business first.

775
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:32,960
We can

776
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,190
only put out water with fire.

777
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,190
Master.

778
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,150
Did you put it backwards?

779
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:41,880
No, don’t you believe me?

780
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,670
I do.

781
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,830
I believe everything you say.

782
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,150
Give me back my sachet first.

783
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,000
- Give it back.
- No.

784
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,230
- Give it back.
- No.

785
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,630
Oh my!

786
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,630
Girls, stop it.

787
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,670
The guests were scared by you.

788
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:03,790
Xiaoqin.

789
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,880
I’ll fight you if you continue.

790
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,600
I’ll attack your vital point.

791
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,830
Miss.

792
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,630
Don’t be mad.

793
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,190
Got stuck at the Silk Store,

794
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,600
he was in trouble.

795
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,270
So many things happened.

796
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:20,560
How come he still went to
see Long Aoyi.

797
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:21,710
The girl

798
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,190
is a trouble to Li Qingliu,

799
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,600
he’s fooled by her.

800
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,000
Miss.

801
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,400
I’m not saying to comfort you.

802
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,440
I don’t think so.

803
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,480
You know

804
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,440
about Master Li.

805
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:33,990
It’d be no use

806
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,160
no matter how many girls

807
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:36,950
are coming to him.

808
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:40,680
Miss.

809
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,810
I think

810
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,330
you should try to understand Long Aoyi.

811
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,350
I think so, too.

812
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,310
But it’s hard.

813
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,440
You two have conflicts at every meeting.

814
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,480
It’s a wrong strategy.

815
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,270
You can’t conflict with her.

816
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,960
You should be friends with her.

817
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,350
Be friends?

818
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:12,560
Do you want her

819
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,230
to become Li Qingliu’s mistress?

820
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,040
Even if there’s one,

821
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,080
it can’t be her.

822
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,520
By

823
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:21,710
becoming friends with her.

824
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,790
First, it makes Master Li

825
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,350
know about your advantages.

826
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,310
Then

827
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,600
you can be in a fair competition
with her.

828
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,190
She’s a crazy girl who loses control.

829
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,230
She’s not as talented as you are.

830
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,520
With all your advantages.

831
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,750
Would Master Li pay attention to her?

832
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,120
You’re right.

833
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,750
