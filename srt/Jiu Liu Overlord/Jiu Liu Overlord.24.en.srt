32
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,640
Summon Li Qingliu!

33
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,560
Greetings to Father.

34
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,600
You may rise.

35
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,320
Thank you, Father.

36
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,760
Qingliu is my son.

37
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,720
But he drifted among
the folks for many years.

38
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,040
Now he has returned.

39
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,760
I grant him the title of Prince Jun.

40
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,000
He will enjoy the same rights and status

41
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,760
as other princes.

42
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,510
I also grant him a mansion at Chang’an.

43
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,870
Thank you, Father.

44
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,560
As for the post of Prince Jun,

45
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,910
councilors, you can speak out.

46
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,160
Ministry of Personnel.

47
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,350
What do you think?

48
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,320
Your Majesty, I thought

49
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,470
Prince Jun has just returned
to the Palace.

50
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,830
The affairs in the court are
complicated and rigorous.

51
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:49,960
It is difficult to manage in a short time.

52
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,160
Now all departments are fully staffed.

53
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,960
It’s hard to insert a new position.

54
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,240
I think it’s better...

55
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,240
Go on.

56
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,550
Condescend to the Ministry of Rites

57
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,090
and take charge of
concierge services and foreign affairs.

58
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,990
Prime Minister, you’ve done a good job

59
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,470
in finding my son in Silver City.

60
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,760
Tell me your opinion.

61
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,070
I think

62
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,110
Ministry of Personnel has a point.

63
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,760
Get familiar with the procedure,

64
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,280
system and etiquette of the court,

65
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,840
then transfer His Highness
to another post.

66
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,190
All right.

67
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,880
Then make Prince Jun

68
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,600
a fifth rank official
of the Ministry of Rites.

69
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,560
Award five boxes of silver

70
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,560
to Prime Minister, Lyu Chenyun.

71
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,070
Thank you, Your Majesty.

72
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,190
Thank you, Father.

73
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,670
Your Majesty.

74
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,200
I have one more thing to report.

75
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,520
Since Prince Jun has come of age,

76
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,280
by the clan custom,

77
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:07,210
he should get married to be
listed in the royal genealogy book.

78
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,080
Concubine De

79
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,720
mentioned it to me yesterday.

80
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,850
The daughter of Du Changfeng,
Du Xiaoxian,

81
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,550
is of marriageable age.

82
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,080
She has a good grasp of
piano, chess, calligraphy and painting.

83
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,920
Besides, she and Prince Jun
grew up together.

84
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,710
Prince Jun, what do you think?

85
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,960
Father.

86
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,670
The daughter of the Du family
is indeed brilliant.

87
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,800
But

88
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,270
I have no intention of marriage.

89
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,080
I’m about to enter the Palace
and take the post,

90
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,640
I have a lot to do and to study.

91
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,590
There is no time to think about
my personal matters.

92
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,150
Besides,

93
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,270
I already have someone in my mind.

94
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,730
Your marriage is at my disposal.

95
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,830
It’s not something you can play with.

96
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,350
Pass my order.

97
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,320
Summon Du Xiaoxian to the Palace

98
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,640
and make her the Concubine of Prince Jun.

99
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:07,960
Your Majesty.

100
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,150
I’m afraid the daughter of a commissioner

101
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,360
will not match with

102
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,990
Prince Jun right now.

103
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,780
Your Majesty.

104
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,740
Mr. Pang has a point.

105
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,000
My daughter is of no high status.

106
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,030
Prince Jun deserves better.

107
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,360
Mr. Du has been guarding
Jiannan Dao for many years,

108
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,520
you not only protect the place
and pacify the people,

109
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,520
but also made some progress in taxation.

110
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,550
Today I make you

111
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,900
a third rank assistant minister
of the Ministry of War.

112
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,830
Thank you, Your Majesty.

113
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,000
Father, I...

114
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,810
Prince Jun, you must obey
His Majesty’s order.

115
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,670
Big! Big!

116
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,160
Small!

117
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,640
Small! Small!

118
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,160
It must be small!

119
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:58,830
That’s great!

120
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,640
I have a lot of money! Big!

121
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,280
Come on!

122
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,450
Place the bet!

123
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,350
Master.

124
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,000
Why don’t you tell Second Master

125
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,390
about Feng?

126
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,200
Second Master values friendship.

127
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,120
If I tell him, he’ll offer help.

128
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,030
Now he is back in office,

129
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,640
we can’t bother him

130
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,560
like we used to do.

131
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,830
Big!

132
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,080
The stakes are high.

133
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,520
If he loses one time,

134
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,200
he will lose a mansion in Silver City.

135
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,000
There are a lot of tycoons.

136
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,710
The people here are rich but foolish.

137
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,340
Big!

138
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,790
Except the stakes are high,

139
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,640
there is no information exchange
like Second Master said.

140
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,640
Put it down!
What do you think of the jade?

141
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,120
When my father took me
to the western regions,

142
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,760
the daughter of a local tribal leader

143
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,350
gave me the jade

144
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,880
as a token of love.

145
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,590
Such an idiot.

146
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,030
He is pretty popular here.

147
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,440
I’ll use it as my bet!

148
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,910
You two look unfamiliar.

149
00:07:58,990 --> 00:07:59,640
Tuluda.

150
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,120
I’m from Jia’ermu.

151
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,760
It’s my first time to do
business in Chang’an.

152
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,830
A friend introduced me here to gamble.

153
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,150
Sorry.

154
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,030
Who is your friend?

155
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,270
We’re closed to the public now.

156
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,000
I am...

157
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,510
Him. Speak of the devil.

158
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,390
- My jade!
- That’s him.

159
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,390
I didn’t expect to

160
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,760
meet you so soon!

161
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,030
Who are you?

162
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,230
Great wits have short memories.

163
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,470
Last time you and your father

164
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,760
visited Jia’ermu,

165
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,960
I accompanied you

166
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,320
to have meal with the Queen.

167
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,760
I remember you.

168
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,440
All right!

169
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,830
Place the bet!

170
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,880
Small!

171
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,200
No, big.

172
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,700
Place your bet!

173
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:44,790
Listen to me.

174
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,000
Big! Big! Big!

175
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:48,470
Big!

176
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,550
Big! Big! Big!

177
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,560
Big!

178
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,000
You are on a roll.

179
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,060
One more time.

180
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,910
Small, Small.

181
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,000
Big!

182
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,050
No hurry.

183
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:10,770
Here you are.

184
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,780
Come on, go on!

185
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,830
Big or small?

186
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,550
Big.

187
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,640
What the hell is that?

188
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,540
Small!

189
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,850
Small!

190
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,530
Big!

191
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:22,120
Small!

192
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,000
Small!

193
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,960
It’s really valuable.

194
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,720
The three of you, please follow me.

195
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,030
= Big Small =
I heard people exchange information here.

196
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,200
All kinds of information?

197
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,270
Only those who win the bet

198
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,710
can ask questions.

199
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,880
Tell me where you got
the stuff in your hand.

200
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,710
Only those who win the bet

201
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,080
can ask questions.

202
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,390
I heard you are from Jia’ermu.

203
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,880
Let’s play the classic game
in your hometown.

204
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,880
Handblock.

205
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,390
The five fingers in the left hand
correspond to the strings.

206
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,830
When the luthier plucks the string,

207
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,440
the needle needs to be inserted
between the fingers corresponded.

208
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,230
After the music No Tears,

209
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,270
there will be someone with broken fingers.

210
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,880
Master, you’re not good at melody.
Let’s not gamble.

211
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,120
I’m the best player in my hometown.

212
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,200
People don’t play like this in Jia’ermu.

213
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,060
But I don’t know about Silver City.

214
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,220
If you lose, tell me first

215
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,340
why you are so interested in my heirloom.

216
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,130
Let’s start.

217
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,980
You call such a thick stick needle?

218
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:18,890
Hone it with human bone
a few more times, it will be thin.

219
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,490
Master, it’s too dangerous. Don’t...

220
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,100
All right.

221
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,340
Why do you cover your face?

222
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,700
Look at your delicate skin,

223
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,650
I guess you never lost.

224
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:58,410
When I win, I’ll bet your face next time.

225
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,610
Miss Long.

226
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:16,730
Why don’t you chat with me now?

227
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,530
The music is good. I am entranced.

228
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,180
The second half of the song is exquisite.

229
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,610
You cover up your face,

230
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,860
only showing a pair of eyes.

231
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,180
It’s not thorough enough.

232
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,530
Why don’t we play something exciting?

233
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,130
How about we cover our eyes?

234
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,010
I grew up making a life by myself,

235
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,180
my hands were cut many times.

236
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,460
A few more wounds mean nothing to me.

237
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:16,980
Come on.

238
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,060
It’ll heal in a couple of months
at the most.

239
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,410
But I’m not sure about broken fingers.

240
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,890
Your jade koi is very rare.

241
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,410
The breed of koi of its decoration

242
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,580
is the imperial sakura koi.

243
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,300
Only the Palace has it.

244
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,340
It is impossible for
ordinary people to have it.

245
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,340
You said it is your heirloom.

246
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,180
It’s a lie.

247
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,730
It’s from the Palace.

248
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,490
You are amazing.

249
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,010
We killed two birds
with one stone this time.

250
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,300
We finally have a clue.

251
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,250
You spent the evening
fighting a battle of wits,

252
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,340
you must be hungry now.

253
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,460
Let me buy you something to eat

254
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,180
at that corner.

255
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:57,580
All right.

256
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,700
I’ll wait for you
at the intersection ahead.

257
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:58,890
Okay.

258
00:13:59,370 --> 00:13:59,860
Wait for me!

259
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,730
Be a good loser.

260
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,180
Seems that Buyu Pavilion
can’t afford to lose.

261
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,250
Master Long.

262
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,530
An old friend of mine.

263
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,100
It was a pity that you missed last time.

264
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,300
It’s not that easy

265
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,610
to kill me, Long Aoyi.

266
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:35,980
Come on!

267
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,460
= Crops =

268
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,420
= Prince Jun’s Mansion =

269
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:13,890
Master.

270
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,300
A girl wants to see you.
She is at the gate.

271
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:31,940
Qingliu.

272
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,770
What are you doing here?

273
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,020
His Majesty granted a marriage for us.

274
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,810
I moved next to your mansion,

275
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,180
then we can discuss
the details of our marriage.

276
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,140
I also want to give you a surprise.

277
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,380
I have given orders

278
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:45,210
to decorate my mansion

279
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,970
as the Silk Store.

280
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,140
It will be comfortable for you to look at.

281
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,420
Come and have a look with me?

282
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,210
Someone.

283
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:01,850
Help Miss Du

284
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,140
put away her stuff on the carriage.

285
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:04,060
Yes.

286
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,930
During these days in Chang’an,

287
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,850
you didn’t write me a letter

288
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,140
or send me any messages.

289
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,330
It happened all of a sudden.

290
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,900
I know your father has

291
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,660
told you about the whole thing.

292
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,500
Do you know how worried I am

293
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,780
after you left Silver City?

294
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,930
Sorry, it was thoughtless of me.

295
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,420
I made you worry about me.

296
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:43,930
Qingliu.

297
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,210
I like you.

298
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,660
Now you and I are engaged.

299
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,570
I can finally

300
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,970
tell you my feelings.

301
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,020
You must be kind to me

302
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,970
in the future.

303
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,820
= Chonghua Lane =

304
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,570
Do you pretend as a ghost
and scare people at night?

305
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:26,780
See it clearly!

306
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:27,570
How dare you stop our car!

307
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,330
Sir.

308
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,660
I’d like to ask you something.

309
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,780
Have you ever seen

310
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,970
a girl of this height?

311
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,090
Her face is thin.

312
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,780
The hair is all tied up.

313
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,060
What time is it now?

314
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,380
There’s no one in the street!

315
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,300
Don’t you know there is
a curfew in the capital?

316
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:40,660
Get out of the way!

317
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,450
I asked you

318
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,090
because there is

319
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,570
on one else in the street.

320
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,900
Please think it over.

321
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,570
Have you ever seen such a girl?

322
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,380
Looking for a girl at this time,

323
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,020
you should go to the entertainment
venues in the Southern City.

324
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:51,930
Go away!

325
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,610
Go!

326
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,420
What kind of person is that?

327
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,330
Long Aoyi is full of tricks.

328
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,420
I have hurt her badly.

329
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,210
But she didn’t die.

330
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,090
Sorry. I failed you.

331
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,140
I watched her get on

332
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:22,970
a royal carriage.

333
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:23,970
I didn’t chase her

334
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,020
in order not to disturb the enemy.

335
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,610
How many times you have let me down?

336
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,850
Please give me another chance.

337
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,180
Got on a royal carriage.

338
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:36,780
You stay put.

339
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,780
All right, you can leave now.

340
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:40,660
Yes.

341
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:52,020
= Prince Zhao’s Mansion =

342
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,850
Why don’t they open the door at this time?

343
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:00,930
Open the door!

344
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,330
Your Highness.
Something happened in the mansion.

345
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,850
What happened?

346
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,420
Looks like someone died.

347
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,260
Lead the way.

348
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:20,610
What’s the matter?

349
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,210
- Why is there a person?
- Yeah.

350
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,690
Why is there a person?

351
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,970
I didn’t see it when I
loaded the carriage.

352
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:29,890
Your Highness.

353
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,610
Your Highness.

354
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,330
It was late at night when I came back,

355
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,460
so I didn’t unload the carriage.

356
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,850
Who knows in the morning...

357
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:44,570
Who is that?

358
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:45,650
Your Highness, be careful.

359
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,540
In case it’s some thug.

360
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:48,940
A woman who gets hurt.

361
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,460
She is at the last gasp.

362
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,650
Find a medicine shop nearby

363
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:54,810
and take her there.

364
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,370
Give the doctor some money.

365
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,160
Yes.

366
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,020
How did you work?

367
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,220
Can anybody

368
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,300
come and leave our mansion

369
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,260
as they want?

370
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,330
Sorry. Please punish me.

371
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,980
All right, take her away.

372
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:10,540
Master. Master.

373
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,370
Master...

374
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:14,780
Get away!

375
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,740
Get the best doctor here, hurry!

376
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:22,540
Hurry up!

377
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,130
Yes!

378
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:27,810
Your Highness!

379
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,700
Can you do it or not?

380
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:50,940
Your Highness, calm down.

381
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,330
The dart is deep.

382
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,500
I’m afraid it has hurt

383
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,610
her heart.

384
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,170
With one minor mistake,

385
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,460
if this vein bleeds,

386
00:20:58,810 --> 00:20:59,620
then...

387
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,980
You are a useless quack!

388
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,370
Physician Qin has arrived.

389
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,700
Greetings to Your Highness.

390
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,060
Physician Qin, you are finally here.

391
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:05,890
Go to check her!

392
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:32,940
How is she doing?

393
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:35,570
Your Highness.

394
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,980
I have sewn her vessel

395
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,060
and stopped the bleeding.

396
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:42,810
Is it serious?

397
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:43,740
Your Highness.

398
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,980
The dart is a fatal one.

399
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,890
And it broke in her body.

400
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,810
If anything goes wrong

401
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,740
when we pull out the dart,

402
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,260
her life will be at risk.

403
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,260
Then save her life.

404
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,890
Don’t pull out the dart!

405
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,570
Then the Miss

406
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,130
will be painful in the future.

407
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,040
You!

408
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:04,940
Your Highness.

409
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:06,570
Your Highness, calm down.

410
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,460
Physician Qin is highly skilled.

411
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,610
What he said must be the best solution.

412
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,650
Your Highness, the wound is too deep.

413
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,650
We have to sew the vessel first.

414
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,650
Physician Qin,

415
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,410
if you pull out the dart,

416
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,020
what are the chances of saving her?

417
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,370
If she wakes up,

418
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,130
it’s a 40% chance.

419
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,500
40% chance?

420
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:31,170
You can’t pull out the dart

421
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,220
without an 80% chance!

422
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:32,940
Your Highness.

423
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,570
She is dying.

424
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,060
If we don’t do anything now,

425
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,460
there is not even a 20% chance!

426
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:42,500
Let me think about it.

427
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,700
You all leave!

428
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,740
Wake up, Aoyi.

429
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,330
You will have a 40% chance if you wake up.

430
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,780
I beg you, please say something.

431
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,780
Let me be sure about it.

432
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,740
Ever since you came here,

433
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,300
you haven’t opened your eyes.

434

Your Highness.

468
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,810
Have you pulled it all out?

469
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:29,650
Yes.

470
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,170

Your Highness.

The dart is taken out

and the bleeding is stopped.

475
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,370
But her breath

476
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,410
is too weak.

477
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,980
It depends on if she can
last through the night.

478
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,540
Last through the night?

479
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,300
Why is she still in danger?

480
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,500
She lost lots of blood,

481
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,270
I have done my best.

482
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:01,730
What should I do?

483
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:03,500
What can I do?

484
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,650
In the land of the far east,

485
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,370
there is a king of
purple ginseng in Balhae

486
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,460
that can support her life.

487
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,030
But it is very precious.

488
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,260
We don’t even have it
at the Imperial Medical Department.

489
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:15,610
Where is this thing?

490
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:17,850
Does Chang’an have it?

491
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:18,940
Or in Balhae?

492
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,090
As far as I know,

493
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:23,850
two purple ginsengs from Silla

494
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,650
were granted to the Crown Prince and...

495
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:27,890
Who?

496
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:29,740
Concubine De.

497
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:34,570
If there is no purple ginseng,

498
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,880
it will depend on her fate.

499
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,230
Greetings to Mother.

500
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,270
Zhao, come and have a seat.

501
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,680
Have some fruit.

502
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:00,840
No need, Mother.

503
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,120
I’ve ate at my place.

504
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,070
Go ahead. What’s up?

505
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,400
Nothing.

506
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,640
I just drop in

507
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,360
and come to greet you.

508
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,680
You boy.

509
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,990
You’ve always been cautious

510
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,980
when you talk to me.

511
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:19,510
Is there really nothing?

512
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,840
Nothing.

513
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,230
I just remembered I need to
visit the Consort Dowager.

514
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:29,020
Have a seat, I’ll be right back.

515
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,790
Of course. Please go ahead.

516
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,590
Good day, Mother.

517
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:55,470
Come over.

518
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:57,710
Where is

519
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,160
the purple ginseng my father
gave to my mother?

520
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,510
The one this long,

521
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,600
Silla paid tribute some years ago,

522
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,230
with red ribbons on it.

523
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:21,920
Sir.

524
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,310
It all depends on you about
transferring my brother

525
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,750
to the Ministry of War in Jiangnan Dao.

526
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,400
I’ll leave.

527
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,320
Manager.

528
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:36,960
Ask Xiaoxian to come here.

529
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:37,870
Yes.

530
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:45,980
Father.

531
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:48,650
Xian.

532
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:52,460
I heard you went to
Prince Jun’s Mansion to pack up stuff?

533
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:54,810
I packed some presents.

534
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,410
Qingliu and I want to visit
the Consort Dowager.

535
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,700
Long Aoyi shows up in Chang’an.

536
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,020
Long Aoyi?

537
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,290
Physician Qin

538
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,170
from the Imperial Medical
Department just came over

539
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,120
and said Long Aoyi is seriously wounded.

540
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:11,650
She went to Prince Zhao’s Mansion.

541
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,570
Seriously wounded?

542
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:17,090
Who did it?

543
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,260
Do you also suspect me?

544
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:28,410
That’s the biggest problem.

545
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,370
I have some issue with her,

546
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,020
but we can’t find the assailant now.

547
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,370
Prince Zhao and Prince Jun

548
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,940
would suspect me.

549
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,500
Father, what can I do?

550
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:46,370
The situation is not clear yet.
Let’s wait and see.

551
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,260
Don’t make any more troubles.

552
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:50,890
I know.

553
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,570
It’s being endless.

554
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,130
She even followed to Chang’an.

555
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:18,570
The physician said

556
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:20,890
it can support your life.

557
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,020
Just drink as much as you can.

558
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,850
Take a sip, and I’ll buy you a hock.

559
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,700
I’ll keep my word.

560
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,810
The Miss resting in the room

561
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,410
is His Highness’s
best friend in Silver City.

562
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,610
You have to treat her as

563
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,700
a family of His Highness

564
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:44,980
and take good care of her.

565
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,610
Whoever dares to gossip

566
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,500
and let out the news

567
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,540
will be expelled and
made a slave immediately.

568
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:52,570
Do you hear it?

569
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:53,810
Yes.

570
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,170
Wu Lin is pretty serious

571
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,370
when he instructs people.

572
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:04,700
You are awake.

573
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,740
Come on.

574
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:15,890
Come on.

575
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,060
You suddenly disappeared

576
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,060
in the Silver City.

577
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,810
I thought I would never see you again.

578
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,460
When you showed up again,

579
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,700
you were serious wounded
and lying in my yard.

580
00:31:58,330 --> 00:31:59,500
But no more worries.

581
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,610
Just rest at here.

582
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,740
As for those who hurt you,

583
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:03,980
I’ll take care of

584
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:05,500
them for you.

585
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:10,500
Who on earth did that to you?

586
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:12,740
Du Changfeng?

587
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,610
Or have you offended someone before?

588
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,780
Don’t worry, this is Chang’an.

589
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,890
I can protect you.

590
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,260
I only know

591
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,260
it’s the same people who killed my mentor.

592
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,090
They followed you from
Silver City to Chang’an.

593
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:40,460
Who wants to kill you?

594
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:42,370
Any clues?

595
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,060
Let’s not think about it.
Have some good rest.

596
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:50,610
I’ll be out for a while.

597
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,170
Just tell me if you need anything.

598
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:54,410
Rest assured.

599
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:57,260
You’re safe with me.

600
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,170
Leave us.

601
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,460
What brought Mr. Pang here

602
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,060
so late?

603
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,610
Mr. Du, do you know about Long Aoyi?

604
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:25,940
Long Aoyi is the head

605
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,980
of a gang in Silver City.

606
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,780
I heard that the relationships

607
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:33,090
between her and the two princes

608
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:35,610
are not simple.

609
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:38,130
Before Prince Jun’s identity was revealed,

610
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,460
he used to do some business with her.

611
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,810
Prince Jun

612
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,740
wanted to reject the marriage in court

613
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,650
because of her.

614
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:49,620
As for Prince Zhao,

615
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:52,370
he seems to have some feelings

616
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:55,740
for Long Aoyi.

617
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:58,780
Is Long Aoyi

618
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,060
a siren?

619
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,220
Just a woman from the lower class.

620
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,260
I really don’t know what’s wrong

621
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:08,410
with the two princes.

622
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,260
If we let this woman

623
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,650
do what she wants

624
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,810
with these two princes,

625
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:15,570
there will be trouble!

626
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,020
How can I not know

627
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,540
the dangers of it?

628
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,460
You and Her Grace must do something

629
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,500
to eliminate the hidden dangers.

630
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,370
It seems that

631
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,610
Mr. Du didn’t

632
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,500
assassinate Long Aoyi?

633
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,980
It wasn’t Her Grace who did it?

634
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:52,460
Your Highness.

635
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,330
I have inquired about it.

636
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:55,570
The shape

637
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,780
and material of the tart

638
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,060
are common in Chang’an.

639
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,130
There is nothing special.

640
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,300
These people are very careful about it.

641
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:04,980
Who killed

642
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:07,260
Feng in Silver City

643
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,650
and got people keeping an eye on Long?

644
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,020
She came to Chang’an in secret.

645
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,300
Only a few people know about it.

646
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,810
Forgive me for my incompetence.

647
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,460
Keep investigating.

648
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,330
Don’t let go of any clues.

649
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:20,940
By the way,

650
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,780
don’t tell anyone that

651
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:25,020
Long is at our mansion now.

652
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:26,370
Yes.

653
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:41,940
= Jinjiang Hock Restaurant =
Bring it to me next time.

654
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:42,780
= Jinjiang Hock Restaurant =
No problem.

655
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,780
Take care, Sir.

656
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,130
Welcome again, sir!

657
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,680
Mr. Yan, why are you here in person

658
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,780
so early?

659
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,610
It’s fine that I came here by myself.

660
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,330
My master wants to eat hock.

661
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,120
I’ll have one kilogram of hock.

662
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,760
All right. Wait a minute.

663
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,080
Xiaoqin?

664
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,410
What are you doing here?

665
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,170
Leave me alone!

666
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:16,650
You left us before,

667
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,810
why do you care about us now?

668
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:21,170
Why did you leave without telling us?

669
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:34,540
I lost Master Long.

670
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,130
I searched all over Chang’an.

671
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,060
I couldn’t find you.

672
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,740
I couldn’t find Second Master Lyu.

673
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,130
Okay.

674
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:52,940
Let’s go to Prince Jun’s Mansion.

675
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:56,290
Prince Jun’s Mansion?

676
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,420
He was made Prince Jun.

677
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,250
Now he’s at Prince Jun’s Mansion.

678
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:03,500
Let’s go.

679
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:08,500
= Prince Jun’s Mansion =

680
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,460
Xiaoqin, don’t worry.

681
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,980
When Master comes,
we will find a way together.

682
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,250
Master Li!

683
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,090
No, Your Highness.

684
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,610
Where did she disappear?

685
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,570
The last time I saw her is
in front of the Buyu Pavilion.

686
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,540
Since then I’ve looked
everywhere I can think of.

687
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,130
But there was no trace of her.

688
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:36,170
She was attacked once at the inn.

689
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,770
I am really scared.

690
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:39,610
Xiaoqin, don’t worry.

691
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,460
Master Long is a lucky person.

692
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:42,290
It’s gonna be okay.

693
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:43,900
Yan Bin.

694
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:46,570
Send everyone in the mansion
to find Master Long.

695
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:48,090
Look into every hospital nearby.

696
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,980
Long Aoyi disappeared in Chang’an,

697
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:52,610
it won’t be that easy.

698
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:53,690
Okay.

699
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:54,860
Xiaoqin,

700
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,170
get some food and have some rest.

701
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:57,940
I’m going to tell everyone.

702
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:58,980
Wait!

703
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,130
All the brothels, taverns and casinos,

704
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,290
Check them all.

705
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:03,380
Yes.

706
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,290
Tomorrow,

707
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,500
you and Prince Jun

708
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,770
will enter the Palace
to thank His Majesty for his grace.

709
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:12,900
Miss,

710
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,290
you must dress up.

711
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,210
I heard that

712
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,420
His Majesty is filial and respectful.

713
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,340
He deeply respects the Consort Dowager.

714
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:22,210
Miss,

715
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,550
why don’t we prepare a big gift?

716
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,540
If I see it clearly,

717
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,500
isn’t that someone of the
Longzhu Gang in Silver City?

718
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,610
Miss Du.

719
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:37,860
Long time no see.

720
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,770
Where is Master Long?

721
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,820
She followed Qingliu from
the Silver City to Chang’an.

722
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,340
To be frank,

723
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,820
Chang’an is

724
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,460
very different from

725
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,860
the remote Silver City.

726
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:59,980
The Emperor rules here in the capital.

727
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,380
I’m afraid talking glibly

728
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:03,820
doesn’t work here.

729
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:05,820
You don’t need to worry about it.

730
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:07,130
Miss Du.

731
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,860
If you are finished talking to Prince Jun,

732
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,690
you can go home

733
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,690
and wait on your corrupt father.

734
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:15,420
You!

735
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,130
Let me tell you,

736
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,210
our master

737
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,060
is not just a third rank official now.

738
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,860
He is about to become
Prince Jun’s father-in-law.

739
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:28,730
If you keep

740
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,250
raving and

741
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,420
slandering our master,

742
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,420
you won’t keep your head.

743
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,090
Yue’er.

744
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,980
You’ll follow me to the Palace.

745
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,090
Don’t argue with her.

746
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:56,900
Xiaoqin!

747
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:58,250
Why didn’t you tell me?

748
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,500
Li Qingliu is a prince now.

749
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,210
He left my master in Silver City.

750
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,650
Now he is going to marry Du Xiaoxian.

751
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,460
What did he take our master for?

752
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,500
The guests of Wuyun Pavilion

753
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,860
are more faithful and
righteous than you are!

754
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,210
It’s not like that.

755
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,340
His Majesty granted the marriage.

756
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,250
So what?

757
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:14,980
If he doesn’t want to marry her,

758
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,130
no one can force him.

759
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,860
Does he forget what he promised

760
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,730
to our master?

761
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,570
Does he know how much Master values it?

762
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:21,860
He doesn’t care at all!

763
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,500
Keep it down. This is Chang’an.

764
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,170
So what?

765
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,420
I want everyone in Chang’an to know

766
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,580
what a terrible person Li Qingliu is...

767
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,170
Miss. She was hurt,

768
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:42,210
why would she go to Prince Zhao’s Mansion?

769
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,210
Isn’t she always like that?

770
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,860
Maybe she learns about
my engagement with Qingliu.

771
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,980
So she went to Prince Zhao.

772
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,380
No wonder she comes from the brothel.

773
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,730
Did she just say Prince Zhao’s Mansion?

774
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,500
Well,

775
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,820
Miss Du has just been granted a marriage,

776
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:16,460
why don’t you prepare

777
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,690
at Prince Jun’s Mansion,

778
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:18,900
but come to my mansion?

779
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,730
I’m being careless.

780
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,130
Sorry for disturbing

781
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:24,540
the quietness of Your Highness.

782
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,980
I heard there is

783
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,250
an old friend in your mansion.

784
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,610
The old friend happens to be wounded.

785
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,770
So I come to visit her

786
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,020
and show my respect.

787
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:37,060
Miss Du has just come to Chang’an,

788
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,540
I didn’t expect you

789
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:39,820
to be so well-informed.

790
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,210
But I’m afraid I would disappoint you.

791
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:45,340
There’s no one in my mansion
you’re looking for.

792
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:55,020
I might hear it wrong.

793
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:57,690
Your Highness!

794
00:41:58,130 --> 00:41:58,730
What’s the matter?

795
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,170
Your Highness!

796
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,020
A man and a woman are
making trouble outside the door.

797
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,380
The woman said

798
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:04,900
she came from Silver City.

799
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:07,420
Her name is Xiaoqin.

800
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,770
Wu Lin, go to have a look.

801
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:11,690
I’ll be right there.

802
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,130
Yes. Go.

803
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:17,730
Miss Du.

804
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,420
I have something to deal with,

805
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:20,860
I will leave now.

806
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,210
Go ahead, Your Highness.

807
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,090
That’s all right for me.

808
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,290
I have a piece of advice for Miss Du.

809
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,460
Mind your own business.

810
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:35,210
If nothing happens,

811
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:36,650
don’t come to

812
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:38,090
my mansion ever again.

813
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,770
I’ll take

814
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,380
