It was you!

I’ll kill you to avenge master’s murder!

34
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,150
Minister.

35
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,710
Hand it over.

36
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,560
My life is in your hand.

37
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,560
What more do you want?

38
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,910
The Water Routes Map of Qinglong Firm

39
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,080
and the Dragon Cane.

40
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,430
Then you should go to Qinglong Firm.

41
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,910
We did. They weren’t there.

42
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,470
How would I know where they are

43
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,520
if you couldn’t find them?

44
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,680
And

45
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,030
business is all about exchange.

46
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,870
What do you have for me?

47
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,840
That’s a good question.

48
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,470
How about your life?

49
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,630
I don’t think it’s worth it.

50
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,150
Give them to me,

51
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,000
and I may be able to
cancel Prince Jun’s marriage.

52
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,030
Knowing he refused to comply,

53
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,910
His Majesty fainted

54
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,840
in rage.

55
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,240
But that

56
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,240
didn’t change Prince Jun’s mind

57
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,840
until I showed him a piece

58
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,150
of your dress.

59
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,680
Your Highness,

60
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,560
do you

61
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,630
recognize this fabric?

62
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,630
I saw

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,280
how graceful Miss Long looked

64
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,350
wearing this dress.

65
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,410
Minister Yuan

66
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,340
asks you to focus on

67
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,020
the upcoming wedding ceremony.

68
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,780
The rest isn’t your concern.

69
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,850
Otherwise,

70
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,650
the owner of this dress

71
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,140
may be in danger.

72
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,920
A seemingly honest man like you

73
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,160
is actually a cold-blooded monster.

74
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,630
Even a prince

75
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,550
yields to your threat.

76
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,670
I can give you what you want

77
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,710
only on the condition of telling me

78
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,700
why you killed my master.

79
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,040
Today’s cloudy sky

80
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,040
reveals no sign of the sun.

81
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,180
Your master and I used to study together.

82
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,750
Her name was Fengge.

83
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,480
Our master was Jiuyuan

84
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,600
at Tianlao Mountain,

85
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,010
an expert in divination,

86
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,800
and an omniscient.

87
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,380
He created

88
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,580
a set of skills

89
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,040
which sounds like fish reading,

90
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,130
but the essence is way beyond.

91
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,920
By observing the world we live in,

92
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,120
he could get hold of
everyone and everything,

93
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,240
and even foretell the future.

94
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,770
Before graduation,

95
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,710
he gave us carp jade pendants,

96
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,630
one each.

97
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,840
Mine is black,

98
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,190
hers white.

99
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,160
I planned to serve the court with her

100
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,490
and dedicated myself

101
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,780
to the prosperity of Tang.

102
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,810
But

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,470
I overheard

104
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,030
master’s instruction to her.

105
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,480
He’s thirsty for power.

106
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,810
I fear he may take the wrong path.

107
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,020
Last night,

108
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,540
I told you two’s fortune.

109
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,040
The result showed the moon descended,

110
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,700
implying the black carp
would shake the state.

111
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,280
Only the white one

112
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,010
could put down the riot.

113
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,240
He’s eager to serve the court

114
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,760
and the public.

115
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,360
The future

116
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,200
is out of my hands,

117
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,800
so you must go to the court.

118
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,680
That’s your responsibility.

119
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,800
I’m not into politics or power,

120
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,070
nor would I ever want to

121
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,120
be against him as predicted.

122
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,750
I understand.

123
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,720
The good news is

124
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,920
the white and black carps
are evenly matched.

125
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,170
As long as you’re safe,

126
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,240
he’s doomed

127
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,900
to decline

128
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,640
and vanish eventually.

129
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,360
That day, I left on my own

130
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,240
and lost contact with them

131
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,070
since then.

132
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,360
Later, when I gained

133
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,070
a foothold in court

134
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,920
and became powerful,

135
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,160
I still remembered their conversation.

136
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,160
I went to look for them

137
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,260
only to find that master had passed away

138
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,540
and Fengge had disappeared

139
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,680
as if she had vanished into thin air.

140
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,600
The growth of power

141
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,120
only increased my anxiety

142
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,400
day by day.

143
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,630
I knew your master was hiding somewhere.

144
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,600
The thought of her existence

145
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,750
deprived me of my sleep and appetite.

146
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,740
And you’re trying to

147
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:45,960
get rid of me as well.

148
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,750
Correct.

149
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,120
My attempt failed.

150
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,810
Not only did you survive

151
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,480
but you somehow got romantically involved

152
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,680
with the newly crowned Prince Jun.

153
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,770
Now that

154
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,870
he has a stigma and a weak spot,

155
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,560
it’s better for you to live.

156
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,370
One, I’m curious about
how far you can go.

157
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,950
Two, I can use you as leverage

158
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,750
against him.

159
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,600
You know,

160
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,190
because of you,

161
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,950
Prince Jun is making
the world even messier.

162
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,630
As for you,

163
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,160
you’re of no more use.

164
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,600
You have no chance to turn things around.

165
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,080
Given our relationship

166
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,200
that you’re my senior,

167
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,840
I should surrender,

168
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,240
but I don’t think my master

169
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,030
would allow me to.

170
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:48,870
Go!

171
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,170
Miss Long,
you’re committing a capital crime

172
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,870
by disobeying the decree.

173
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,440
You broke the law

174
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,750
by committing murder.

175
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,750
If you don’t have any proof,

176
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,630
you’ll be charged with slander, too.

177
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,200
No one can help you.

178
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,240
Even if Prince Jun covers for you,

179
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,150
you’ll still be executed

180
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,300
for disobedience.

181
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,830
Loosen up and come with us.

182
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,880
Let Prince Jun enjoy his night.

183
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,430
If Crown Prince dies,

184
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,270
Yuan Zai will make Qingliu his successor?

185
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,910
You’re Prince Jun’s wife,

186
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,510
so we’re on the same boat.

187
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,080
Li Qingliu, help!

188
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,870
Take care of her.

189
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:41,910
Yes.

190
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,720
Where will you go?

191
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,440
Didn’t you hear the scream?

192
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,750
That must be a cheer.

193
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,750
It was Long Aoyi.

194
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:57,840
I have to go.

195
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,150
This is our wedding day.

196
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,120
You cannot leave.

197
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,320
I must go.

198
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,720
Where to?

199
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,870
Even when we’re getting married,

200
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,600
you still have no feelings for me?

201
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,790
I’ve given my heart to you

202
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,080
and always been thinking for you.

203
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,080
But what have you done?

204
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,240
You were with her all the time
back in Silver City,

205
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,720
and had her come over
after moving to Chang’an.

206
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,320
I can put all that behind.

207
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,750
But now, you’re leaving

208
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,320
in the middle of our ceremony.

209
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,360
Don’t you know

210
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,960
how insulting that is?

211
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,270
I failed you.

212
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,440
I’m sorry.

213
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,630
Li Qingliu!

214
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,150
Consort De hated all the princes

215
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,550
but didn’t hurt you. You know why?

216
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,150
I had eyes in your mansion

217
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,550
watching Long Aoyi’s every move

218
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,600
and checking your meals every day.

219
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,150
Do you know how many times

220
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,270
your soup has been poisoned?

221
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,240
You can leave

222
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,030
after drinking this.

223
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:21,840
Xiaoxian!

224
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,720
What are you doing?

225
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,390
The tea is poisoned.

226
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,750
Take it and you can leave.

227
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,390
Otherwise, you must stay.

228
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,140
You’re evil!

229
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,960
Qingliu!

230
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,550
From this point onward,

231
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,890
Li Qingliu

232
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,440
and Du Xiaoxian are over.

233
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,580
We’re even!

234
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,280
Li Qingliu!

235
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,110
Miss!

236
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,300
Miss!

237
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,200
Miss!

238
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:13,820
Guards!

239
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,880
Protect Crown Prince!

240
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,060
= Prince Jun’s Mansion =

241
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:16,650
Let’s go!

242
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,720
Protect Crown Prince!

243
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,270
These two attempted to harm Crown Prince.

244
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,910
Guards, arrest them!

245
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,870
Go ahead!

246
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,360
Don’t move!

247
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:36,180
= Prince Jun’s Mansion =

248
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,720
Your Highness, sorry, I’m late.

249
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,320
Du Changfeng and his daughter

250
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,150
are guilty of attempted murder,

251
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,060
thus shall be executed.

252
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,060
Master!

253
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:05,450
Father!

254
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:06,840
Master!

255
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,370
Father!

256
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,280
Father!

257
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,650
Father!

258
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,210
Father!

259
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,050
Why?

260
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,910
Why are you doing this to me?

261
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,870
What did I do wrong?

262
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,940
Father!

263
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,030
Li Qingliu abandoned me.

264
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,750
And you also left me. Why?

265
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:43,910
Father! Wake up!

266
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,600
Don’t leave me, Father!

267
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,810
Father!

268
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,510
Father!

269
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,720
Father!

270
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,440
Didn’t you

271
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,150
want to be

272
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,390
a witness at my wedding ceremony?

273
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,310
This is it.

274
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,480
Look. Look at me.

275
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,670
- I’m wearing a wedding gown.
- Miss.

276
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,150
Father,

277
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:31,900
look at me.

278
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,270
Look, Father!

279
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,240
Miss!

280
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,670
How do I look?

281
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,670
Am I beautiful?

282
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,750
Am I gorgeous?

283
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,120
Am I?

284
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,630
Miss!

285
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,270
Do I look beautiful?

286
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:47,630
Get her out.

287
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,080
Take her away.

288
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,150
- Qingliu! Qingliu!
- Miss!

289
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,600
Move!

290
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,270
Move!

291
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,960
- Don’t take her away!
- Go!

292
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,550
No!

293
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,600
Miss!

294
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,320
- Qingliu!
- Move!

295
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,120
Miss!

296
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,840
Qingliu!

297
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,440
Your Highness,

298
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,480
I had arranged armed guards

299
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,750
to protect you in the dark

300
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,910
in case of danger.

301
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,030
Please punish me.

302
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,270
Thank you for protecting me.

303
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,200
You did nothing wrong.

304
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,240
You’re too kind, Your Highness.

305
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,450
Kill!

306
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:42,400
Long!

307
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,440
Long! Wake up!

308
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:44,590
Come on!

309
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,830
Long, are you alright?

310
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,440
Watch out!

311
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:54,680
Go!

312
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,640
What about you?

313
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,440
Don’t worry about me.

314
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,880
Prince Jun,

315
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,200
aren’t you a lucky man?

316
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,350
Leave!

317
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,830
Qingliu!

318
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,680
Be careful!

319
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,640
Qingliu, how do you feel?

320
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,160
I’m fine.

321
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,270
Prince Zhao!

322
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,640
Qingliu!

323
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,110
Leave without me.

324
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,030
Where are you taking him?

325
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,110
Meet me with the Map and the Dragon Cane.

326
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,960
You must come alone.

327
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:30,790
Move!

328
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,330
A map?

329
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,550
Where the hell am I?

330
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:22,780
Let’s go.

331
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,330
Hurry up.

332
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,370
Prince Jun is dying.

333
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,180
Let’s go. There are beasts in the wild.

334
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,230
Qingliu.

335
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:03,790
How are you doing?

336
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:04,640
Just go.

337
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,830
I won’t,

338
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,880
not if you’re with me.

339
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,030
Prince Zhao,

340
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:26,160
stop hesitating.

341
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,880
What’s not yours

342
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,830
is not yours.

343
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,350
You’re worrying about nothing.

344
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,110
I’ve already let it go.

345
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,350
Long Aoyi,

346
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,880
do you have those things?

347
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,510
Why are you siding with him?

348
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,240
Yuan Zai is a monster.

349
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,480
Once he controls the water routes,

350
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,110
the public will suffer.

351
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,480
You’re doing business by water

352
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,030
and so can he.

353
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,510
How’s that wrong?

354
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,510
You must’ve been brainwashed!

355
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,550
Li Zhao, how could you collude with him?

356
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,550
Father will be utterly disappointed.

357
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,490
You defied him in your marriage,

358
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,790
causing him to collapse in anger.

359
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:22,960
It’s you

360
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,640
who’re a disappointment

361
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,510
all this time.

362
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,380
Qingliu!

363
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,310
I have the things you asked for.

364
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,440
Let him go.

365
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,830
You must’ve mistaken it.

366
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,350
He’s free

367
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,880
to go anytime,

368
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,720
but I don’t think he can.

369
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,400
What do you mean?

370
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,200
During the wedding ceremony,

371
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,590
he took the poisoned tea

372
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,790
served to Crown Prince,

373
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,920
so that

374
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,480
he could end things with Miss Du.

375
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,350
Is that true?

376
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,880
I’m fine.

377
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,240
Forget about me.

378
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,070
Just leave!

379
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,630
Without the antidote,

380
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,730
he’ll soon die.

381
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,920
Is it the real one?

382
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,110
It is, believe it or not.

383
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,590
Go!

384
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,350
Fine.

385
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,160
Here’s what you want.

386
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,590
It’s covered with gasoline.

387
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,070
Give me the antidote,

388
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,000
or I’ll set it on fire.

389
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,880
Calm down.

390
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,960
Now that you’re here,

391
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,440
don’t rush to leave.

392
00:24:59,080 --> 00:24:59,680
Move!

393
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,160
Qingliu!

394
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,440
Qingliu!

395
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,550
Let go of me.

396
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,070
Qingliu!

397
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,400
Qingliu!

398
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,240
Why are you doing this?

399
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,160
He made you do it,

400
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,590
didn’t he?

401
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,790
Master Long,

402
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,160
men change easily.

403
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:34,920
How can a woman weigh more than power,

404
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,640
especially that
she’s in love with someone else?

405
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,640
You’re lying!

406
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
He’s never a greedy man.

407
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,680
I know him the best.

408
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,880
All he cares about are freedom and...

409
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,510
No, I want power!

410
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,030
Why?

411
00:25:59,070 --> 00:25:59,830
Why?

412
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,110
You tell me.

413
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,070
I fell in love with you first,

414
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,270
much earlier than him

415
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,740
before you realized it.

416
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,240
And when you did,

417
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,200
you were already in love with him.

418
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,750
Since you left Silver City,

419
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,440
everything has changed.

420
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,030
He’s become a prince

421
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,720
while you’re in the palace.

422
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,310
But I remain the same.

423
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,160
I was in Silver City,

424
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,270
as the day you smiled at me

425
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,590
in that flowery dress!

426
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,240
Have you ever looked back at me?

427
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,440
I...

428
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,160
No.

429
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,830
Never.

430
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,070
Neither has Father

431
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:13,960
or those officials.

432
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,400
No one!

433
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,310
In your eyes, I’m invisible,

434
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,240
indolent.

435
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,350
So now, I have to be in charge

436
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,240
to get back all that I’ve lost

437
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,110
so that everyone will look up at me!

438
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,070
It’s time to put an end.

439
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:45,990
Qingliu!

440
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,750
Let go of me!

441
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,550
Qingliu!

442
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,270
Qingliu!

443
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,270
I tried everything I could

444
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,310
and finally, narrowed it down
to this place by astrology.

445
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,680
There are mines rich in copper and iron,

446
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,830
so much as they’ve successfully

447
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,640
bent those in court

448
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,510
into following my orders.

449
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:17,200
And they’re my tools for making money.

450
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,590
Prince Jun, thanks to you

451
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,240
and your help,

452
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,110
I can easily smuggle
goods to foreign states.

453
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,240
How dare you

454
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,960
trade official posts and innocent lives

455
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,310
for your monopoly!

456
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:38,680
You aren’t making money
but jeopardizing the nation!

457
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:43,030
Tell that to others if you can.

458
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,640
Let’s see if you can live long enough

459
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,480
to see the state fall.

460
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,070
Don’t touch him!

461
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,960
Let go of me!

462
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:57,830
Let him go.

463
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,070
Yes!

464
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,640
Go.

465
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,960
Qingliu, hold me!

466
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,400
Let go, Long.

467
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,310
I won’t!

468
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,480
I won’t let you go!

469
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,720
Silly girl.

470
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:55,640
The pit is filled with poison.

471
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,240
Let him go

472
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,880
and you can live.

473
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,640
I will speak to Minister Yuan

474
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,350
to spare you.

475
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,440
Prince Zhao,

476
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,550
help!

477
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,030
He killed my mother

478
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,000
and stole you from me.

479
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,240
Why should I help him?

480
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,720
He’ll kill you, too.

481
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,680
Let go,

482
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,750
or you’ll be dragged down, too.

483
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,270
Let him go and you’re safe.

484
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,070
No!

485
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,590
Don’t be stubborn.

486
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:30,880
Let go now!

487
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:31,910
No!

488
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,070
I’ll die with you.

489
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,160
If we met again in the next life,

490
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,640
I’d hold you tight.

491
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:45,910
Fine.

492
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,750
You’ll get what you wish for.

493
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:52,710
Long!

494
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,000
All done, Prince Zhao?

495
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,110
That’s good.

496
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,400
I was worried

497
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,240
that Long Aoyi would shake your mind.

498
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,880
His Majesty’s will

499
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,880
has been amended.

500
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,350
He’s too sick in bed.

501
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Once he’s gone,

502
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,920
you’ll succeed to the throne.

503
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,070
Your mother entrusted you

504
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,070
to me before her demise.

505
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,920
As long as you listen to me,

506
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:35,880
the throne and the world

507
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,880
will all be yours.

508
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,830
You’re wise and farsighted.

509
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,350
Please accept my bow.

510
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,880
Body armor!

511
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:10,680
I was going to keep you as a puppet

512
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,790
to shield me from rumors,

513
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,240
but you gave that up.

514
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,110
When Mother

515
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,400
told me to blame everything on her,

516
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,400
I knew you plotted

517
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,750
the whole thing.

518
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,790
Bastard!

519
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,960
You used my mother and uncle

520
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:37,790
to make tons of officials

521
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,140
your lackeys just like Du Changfeng,

522
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:45,240
and a puppet emperor
dance to your strings.

523
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,590
Do you really think

524
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,720
your evil and vicious scheme

525
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,240
will succeed?

526
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:01,970
I must say

527
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,480
I’m disappointed in you.

528
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,720
I assumed you were smart.

529
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,760
But turns out,

530
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:11,880
you’re just

531
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,920
another blind fool in love.

532
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,230
In this case,

533
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,280
keeping you is a waste of space.

534
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,510
Wu Lin!

535
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,110
Why are you back?

536
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,330
I was concerned about you.

537
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:43,630
Wu Lin!

538
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:45,410
Wu Lin!

539
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,590
Run, Your... Your Highness.

540
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:52,280
Why didn’t you go home as I said?

541
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:53,440
My life

542
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,590
belongs to you.

543
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,320
It’s all I have

544
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,810
to protect you.

545
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,480
Wu Lin!

546
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:10,950
Wu Lin!

547
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,880
Bastard!

548
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:45,700
Minister,

549
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,770
the door of death is open.

550
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,360
Poison is released.

551
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,320
No one in the world

552
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,230
could survive.

553
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,070
To achieve big,

554
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,800
one must be extremely cautious.

555
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,880
Before everything is settled,

556
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,920
no mistake is allowed.

557
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,920
You’re worrying too much.

558
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,000
At this stage,

559
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,630
only by sinking in the Holy Flame

560
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:11,630
to open the door of life

561
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,440
can one escape.

562
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,590
That kind of pain

563
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,840
is excruciating and unbearable.

564
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,710
And Prince Zhao...

565
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:22,710
Burn his body.

566
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,880
Take off his robe and bring it back

567
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,510
to have something to tell His Majesty.

568
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:31,960
