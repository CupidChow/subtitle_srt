Master Long,

33
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,620
I got your favorite

34
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,940
sweet and sour fillet of pork.

35
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,860
And here, Master Long.

36
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,540
I got this specially-made plaster for you.

37
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,420
Master Long,

38
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,860
these are your favorite fruits.

39
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,620
Master Long,

40
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,740
this is the latest style of fabric.

41
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,460
= Garment Design =

42
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,940
Master, take a look at this.

43
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,340
This is not bad.

44
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,980
You dumb heads finally

45
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,980
got smarter.

46
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,540
You finally put flowers and plants

47
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,380
patterns in the carves.

48
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,580
Master.

49
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,100
Except for the burned part,
there’s some left of

50
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:16,900
the single-stranded silk
in the warehouse.

51
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,140
So we made a new skirt.

52
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,580
Will Miss Long like it?

53
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:27,980
Get out!

54
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,220
Master,

55
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,420
they’re too young.

56
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,980
Don’t bother yourself getting mad at them.

57
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,340
According to the official news,
the fire’s target was Long Aoyi.

58
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,220
I think she not only causes fire but

59
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,580
also flirts with guys.

60
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,660
Well, we can kick her out.

61
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,780
Will she accept that?

62
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,820
Do I need her permission to kick her out?

63
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,180
Yan Bin.

64
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,060
No matter who set the fire,

65
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,460
Master Long spared no effort
while putting out the fire.

66
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,460
Everybody witnessed it.

67
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,940
Plus, after the fire was put out,

68
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,020
no one in the Silk Store

69
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,740
talks about losing talents anymore.

70
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,860
What she did has

71
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,660
steadied the team.

72
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,300
I think she’s

73
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,340
not a terrible person.

74
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,420
Why don’t you try to befriend her?

75
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,940
Why would I do that?

76
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,500
I thought you like,

77
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,780
like

78
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,900
making friends?

79
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,500
You even hurt your hand for her.

80
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,060
I won’t tell others about your arm.

81
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,100
But,

82
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,780
Master Long got hurt

83
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,180
while saving the fabric.

84
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,540
But you scolded her.

85
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,660
Of course she’s mad at you.

86
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,660
Master,

87
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:06,980
listen to me.

88
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,540
While eating with Nanny,

89
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,460
pick some food for Master Long.

90
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,140
Try to be nice.

91
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,580
Basically,

92
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,420
after a man and a woman
have experienced death together.

93
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,940
You should say:

94
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,100
Master Long,

95
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,460
you’ve saved the fabric for me.

96
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,180
I’d like to commit myself to you.

97
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,580
We’re expanding our business to Nanban.

98
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,820
I’ll ask Manager Liu to arrange for you.

99
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:36,740
No.

100
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,260
Master, I’m just trying to help.

101
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,860
Since you don’t want to say
thank you in person,

102
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,780
picking food for her is easier.

103
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,180
Right?

104
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:47,460
Come on.

105
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:50,460
Go.

106
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,460
Hold it. I’ll do it.

107
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,380
Thank you, Ma’am.

108
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,700
They’re washing clothes.

109
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:07,980
Go. Go.

110
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,900
Master is strict with people indeed.

111
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,940
But he’s good in nature.

112
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,900
Miss Long, you’re kind and generous.

113
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:13,860
Don’t be mad at him.

114
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,580
I’m mad?

115
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,540
Not like that...

116
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,180
Nanny is helping you.

117
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,940
Well, this is a good opportunity.

118
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,420
I’ve experienced all kinds of things,

119
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,620
and met all kinds of people.

120
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,700
Qingliu is

121
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,420
very popular out there

122
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,020
with you ladies.

123
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,380
I brought him up.

124
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,460
Why are you laughing?

125
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,460
If you haven’t said it,

126
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,980
I’d forget that he’s a mortal as well

127
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,340
though he looks grim.

128
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,740
He always looks like an immortal.

129
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,100
He’s always been smarter than others.

130
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,500
No matter in business,

131
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,900
or in knitting,

132
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,820
he’s a generally recognized talent.

133
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
That’s why he may be aloof and arrogant.

134
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,340
Maybe he got it

135
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,660
from his parents.

136
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,260
He’s better without this kind of parents

137
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,060
who abandoned their kid.

138
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,100
I somehow find you adorable and warm.

139
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,380
I’m jealous

140
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,380
of Li Qingliu for having you around.

141
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:15,780
By the way, Ma’am.

142
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,700
May I ask you something?

143
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,940
I promise to keep the secret.

144
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,060
OK.

145
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,420
Well, based on my incisive insight

146
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,300
and observation from years
of life experience,

147
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,860
is Li Qingliu not into women?

148
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,020
See, I knew it.

149
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,580
Every time he saw me,

150
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,540
he said the worst things to me.

151
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,580
Always made fun of me.

152
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:40,780
At least we should

153
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,980
show some respect to others.

154
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,580
I’m a girl after all.

155
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,380
That’s why I guess

156
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,180
that he’s not

157
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,700
into girls.

158
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:49,740
No, no.

159
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,680
Shh, shh.

160
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,300
No, no.

161
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,340
It’s right that you’re a weirdo.

162
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,220
It’s what she actually thinks.

163
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,860
Dig a little deeper, deeper.

164
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,860
But he’s

165
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,860
gotten a problem since young.

166
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,780
What problem?

167
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,420
Whenever he gets close to girls,

168
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,980
he may sneeze or sweat.

169
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,300
If worse, he feels dizzy and weak.

170
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,380
Moreover, he may faint.

171
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,300
I found that.

172
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,780
When will the symptoms get worse?

173
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,380
Do you need me
this old lady to tell you?

174
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,300
It gets worse when he kisses

175
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,820
or gets intimate with someone.

176
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,300
Don’t tell others about this.

177
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:32,900
You hear me?

178
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,500
Don’t worry, Ma’am.

179
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,380
Ma’am, you’re pretty and nice.

180
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,100
Stop making fun of me.

181
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,740
I’m no pretty. I’m old.

182
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,380
I’m serious. I never lie.

183
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,540
Pretty, pretty.

184
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,780
She even flattered Nanny.

185
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,420
Let me check

186
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,740
why it takes so long
to do the washing.

187
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,100
You’re just young and beautiful.

188
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,420
Look at your waist,

189
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,940
and your skin.

190
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,420
There’s even a red mole on your chest.

191
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,500
I didn’t even notice that.

192
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,420
There’s an old saying back in my hometown

193
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,180
that a mole on the chest

194
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,740
means you’ll be appreciated by someone.

195
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,940
Seems like Nanny is showering for her.

196
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,340
Let’s go.

197
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,260
Wait.

198
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,900
I think

199
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,140
that since we’re here already,

200
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,420
we should just wait.

201
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,980
But I’ve been an orphan since young.

202
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,180
If it hadn’t been my mentor, I would...

203
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,580
The good things always come late.

204
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,820
Your day will eventually come.

205
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,300
Maybe

206
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,340
you’ll meet a good husband.

207
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:47,940
OK.

208
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,540
When did you come?

209
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,420
Nanny, Master said that

210
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,300
we haven’t had meals together for long.

211
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,940
He has to make time for a meal

212
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,340
with you today no matter what.

213
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,420
He got the chef made

214
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,140
some of your favorite dishes on purpose.

215
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,500
Ma’am.

216
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:06,940
Coming.

217
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,380
Where are my clothes?

218
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,580
What’s wrong? Are you having a cold?

219
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,780
It’s fine.

220
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,620
I just need some rest.

221
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,420
Well, have a seat then.

222
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,540
I’ll be right with you.

223
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,340
Take a seat, take a seat.

224
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,620
Here it comes!

225
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:27,900
Sit, please.

226
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,060
What are you doing here?

227
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,340
Our Master said that we come every month

228
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,940
to have a meal with Nanny.

229
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,980
They are all vegetarian food.

230
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,300
They did it for me.

231
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,380
I’ll cook something nice for you later.

232
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:08,740
Here we go.

233
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,420
Let’s have the meal first.

234
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:10,860
Have your meal.

235
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,300
Come on.

236
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,900
Thank you.

237
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,100
Is your arm better?

238
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,100
I’m fine.

239
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,500
Don’t worry.

240
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,140
I heard that you got hurt.

241
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,100
You went to put out the fire
without wrapping it up.

242
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,860
Don’t do it again,

243
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,500
okay?

244
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:48,860
OK.

245
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,140
Have your meal.

246
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,100
He got hurt before the fire?

247
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,820
Was he hurt for saving me?

248
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:14,980
Have some, too.

249
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,540
What?

250
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,140
Did you overhear us?

251
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:44,740
I only heard that…

252
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,900
There, there is a mold on your chest.

253
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,140
Ma’am, I’m good.

254
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:01,940
Please continue.

255
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,780
How can I say you…

256
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,700
Why would I be shy?

257
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,780
= Xinsilu =

258
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,660
= Xinsilu Silk Store was damaged in a fire =

259
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,620
Look at your waist,

260
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,100
and your skin.

261
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,380
There’s even a red mole on your chest.

262
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,860
Did you overhear us?

263
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,300
I only heard that…

264
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,700
There, there is a mold on your chest.

265
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,100
Are you okay, Master?

266
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:27,820
Nothing.

267
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,940
Just a bit headache.

268
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:38,780
Master.

269
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,620
Be more careful.

270
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,140
It must be that in the fire you

271
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,460
were short of breath for smoke inhalation

272
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,500
but then you wetted yourself
with cold water.

273
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,460
The coldness outside and heat inside

274
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,860
caused your headache.

275
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,340
Doctor Yan’s idea didn’t work.

276
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,340
And he’s going to his appointment

277
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,860
to be a quack again.

278
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,100
Master.

279
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,420
I don’t know if I should tell you this.

280
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,300
Then don’t.

281
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,100
I’ll say then.

282
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,420
Because you don’t understand women.

283
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,460
You can’t treat her

284
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,820
the way like you do to me.

285
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:14,900
Look at Prince Zhao,

286
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,420
he knows all kinds of tricks.

287
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,940
You should ask and learn

288
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,860
about how to deal with girls.

289
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,340
Master.

290
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,340
I’m sorry.

291
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,100
I know.

292
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,580
Xinsilu forbids office romance

293
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,820
in case of influencing the work.

294
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,980
Punish me only if you have to.

295
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,460
It was all my idea.

296
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,300
She refused me at first.

297
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,100
Who said anything about punishment?

298
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:05,940
Sit down.

299
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,060
Sit down.

300
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,780
Just tell me, how do you reverse

301
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,220
the condition when you are
with the girl you like?

302
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,100
Well.

303
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,900
Master Long taught us to scratch the hand.

304
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,660
Scratch the hand?

305
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,260
Yes...

306
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,740
I see!

307
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,340
Master, are you seeing somebody?

308
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,500
If you want to win a girl over,

309
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,180
first you need to know what’s in her mind.

310
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,980
How do you know it?

311
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:44,780
We must be tender.

312
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,100
First, you care about her.

313
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:47,820
Make her happy.

314
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:48,780
When she starts to believe you,

315
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,380
she’d tell you everything.

316
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,100
Be more specific.

317
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,140
Master,

318
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,740
how come you don’t know this?

319
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,620
Manager Yan doesn’t know as well.

320
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,100
Master,

321
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,900
you were too much.

322
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,420
No. No. No.

323
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,780
Too serious.

324
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,940
You look aloof. People may get scared.

325
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,740
You should be romantic.

326
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,500
Normally,

327
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,700
women like flowers.

328
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,300
You can buy her one or two every day.

329
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,780
You’ll definitely get her within a month.

330
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,700
Women are fragile and sensitive.

331
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,380
Pay more attention to her emotions.

332
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,420
Make sure she feels safe.

333
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,580
She’s neither fragile nor sensitive.

334
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,700
She doesn’t need sense of security.

335
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,540
But she may get a headache
or a fever sometimes.

336
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,140
That she does.

337
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,580
It’d be the best opportunity.

338
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,300
You can take care of her then.

339
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,380
It’d be better if she has some scratches,

340
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,340
so that you can have body contacts.

341
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,580
Touching her hand or something is better.

342
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,460
Master.

343
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,780
I think Master Long won’t like desserts.

344
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,260
Let’s buy her some flowers.

345
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,100
Maybe a box of flowers,

346
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,100
or a cart of flowers.

347
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,820
I don’t think that’s a very smart way

348
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:58,780
to do.

349
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:05,940
Miss Long.

350
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,540
How do you know that I like peonies?

351
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,300
I asked my fellow

352
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,820
to go to Yunnan to get the freshest one.

353
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:17,780
Do you like them?

354
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,220
Got them from Yunnan?

355
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,820
Deliver them to Miss Long’s room.

356
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,260
Yes.

357
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,020
She can use them while showering.

358
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,420
Master, how did he know to send flowers?

359
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,260
Go and get the flowers

360
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,740
I got from the Indian merchant last month.

361
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,300
Okay, I’m going now.

362
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,140
There’s something next to your ear.

363
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,940
Last time it was a magnolia hair clasp.

364
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,140
This time it’s a white peony.

365
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,780
Where did they come from? Tell me.

366
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,420
There’s still something

367
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,180
next to your foot.

368
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,260
Cool.

369
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,420
Wait!

370
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,500
You’ve got flowers in your clothes, too.

371
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,100
Cool.

372
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,300
You should be a magician on the street.

373
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,740
I can only be a magician for you.

374
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:30,980
Master Li,

375
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,060
what’s in your hand?

376
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,300
= Heaven and Earth... =

377
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,020
These are the flowers

378
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,940
I got from the Indian merchant last month.

379
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,220
It’s no use keeping them in the warehouse.

380
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,100
Better to give you as a present.

381
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:46,940
Let me.

382
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:47,660
Thank you.

383
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,220
What’s the species?

384
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,140
It’s not just unique.

385
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,500
It’s also rare.

386
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,580
There are only a few

387
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,820
plants in the country.

388
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,180
And,

389
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,820
its name is special, too.

390
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,500
It’s called Euphorbia Royleana Boiss.

391
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,380
It suits you well.

392
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:12,700
Your Highness.

393
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,940
Do you know why the flower’s smell

394
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,140
is really strong?

395
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,460
I’m curious.

396
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,580
My master is interested in pollen rouge,

397
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,820
and is specialized in unique plants.

398
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,100
The reason why its smell is so strong

399
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,540
is that it eats meat.

400
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,260
It uses its smell to attract bugs,

401
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,140
then uses its sword-like petal

402
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,100
to catch them,

403
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,940
then it eats them.

404
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,900
Since you’ve mentioned it,

405
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,060
I think I’ve heard it before, too.

406
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,540
The flower does not only eat meat,

407
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,900
its pollen is also functional
to human, too.

408
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,780
If you’ve smelled it for long,

409
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,460
you may get palpitation, or diarrhea.

410
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,540
Master Li,

411
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,220
are you trying to kill me?

412
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,060
Take it.

413
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,340
I don’t understand your intention.

414
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,460
I thought Your Highness came here

415
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,260
to discuss something with me.

416
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,500
Join me in the study.

417
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:11,660
Please.

418
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,340
Master, what should we do to the flowers?

419
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,660
Rise up 30 percent of the price

420
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,820
of the business with India.

421
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,220
This way,

422
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,260
Silk Store’s account can be unlocked now.

423
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,820
After the fire,

424
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,220
the accounts are not balanced.

425
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,740
Just see it as fate.

426
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,980
I only believe in myself,

427
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,180
not in fate.

428
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,980
Prince Zhao, please be frank with me.

429
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,220
I believe the police has told you

430
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,860
that the fire started in Miss Long’s yard.

431
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,540
That’s why I want to cooperate with you.

432
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,580
Your Highness,

433
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,420
what’s your point?

434
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,900
I want to find out the truth.

435
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,580
Who wants her dead?

436
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,180
Any proofs?

437
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,540
It’s just my instincts.

438
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,780
Since you’ve already got a plan,

439
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,900
why don’t you look into it yourself?

440
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,460
In different situations,

441
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,620
enemies can be friends.

442
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,620
Even if I didn’t say it,

443
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,500
wouldn’t you look into it?

444
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:33,380
= North Street of Silver City =

445
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:33,860
Your Highness.

446
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,620
Why would you unlock Xinsilu?

447
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,660
When I found

448
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,740
about the pepper in the bank,

449
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:42,980
with this much money,

450
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,020
I think

451
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,260
we should start from the richest guy.

452
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,220
Though Mr. Zhu stocked the goods,

453
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,820
you suspect

454
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,460
Commissioner was sheltering behind.

455
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,140
If we only hand in the pepper,

456
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,900
the result would be

457
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,460
charge Zhu Chengzhi of corruption.

458
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,460
The man behind this
is still hiding deeply.

459
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,140
On the contrary,

460
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,180
the fire in Xinsilu has

461
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,420
reminded me,

462
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,860
it looks like the fire

463
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,100
was aiming at Master Long.

464
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,980
But it indicates

465
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,460
that the killer isn’t afraid of Xinsilu,

466
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,300
instead, he’s coming at Xinsilu.

467
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,460
Let me put in another words,

468
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,180
the fire was using Xinsilu’s force.

469
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:28,780
Wise you, Your Highness.

470
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,860
You’ve still got a lot to learn.

471
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,900
White goose…

472
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,900
Don’t read it out loud.

473
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:40,100
And flying birds are fleeting.

474
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,220
Red beans scattering in the picture.

475
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,540
North wind blowing, putting out the fire.

476
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,020
A man standing under the sunset.

477
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:50,860
Birds toward the south.

478
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,420
I forbade you to smile

479
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,540
but you can still talk.

480
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:02,780
Comments, please.

481
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,220
It looks good.

482
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,140
Not bad, right?

483
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,420
But I’m not very good

484
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:08,700
at poems.

485
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,900
You can’t understand?

486
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,780
You can’t understand…

487
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,260
It’s good not to understand.

488
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,340
It’s fine.

489
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,420
Well, I remember

490
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,820
that there’s a newly
opened desserts store.

491
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:28,900
I’ll take you to try it.

492
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:29,900
Let’s go.

493
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,500
Come on.

494
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,220
White gooses and flying bird
are fleeting. I.

495
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,420
Red beans scattering
in the picture. Like.

496
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,260
North wind blowing,
putting out the fire. You.

497
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,420
A man standing under the sunset,
birds toward the south. A lot.

498
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,220
I like you a lot.

499
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,220
Scholars who go to the brothels
are the most dramatic ones.

500
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,260
Always using lame poems as presents.

501
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,500
I’ve seen a bunch of love poems like this.

502
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,140
Xiaoqin,

503
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,300
hurry up. Or they’d be selling out.

504
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,300
Then we have to wait until tomorrow.

505

Thank you for your support.

00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,820
are released today.

509
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,020
Please stand in queue.

510
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:37,860
When the time comes.

511
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,100
- Master Li will host the ceremony.
- Step aside.

512
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,900
Step aside. You hear me?

513
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,820
Who is it?

514
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,500
- Go away. Go away.
- What’s wrong?

515
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,220
What are you doing? Go and wait in lines.

516
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,140
You hear me? I’ll beat you up.

517
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:50,700
Back off.

518
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,300
Go away and back off.

519
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,500
What are you doing?

520
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,300
You hear me?

521
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,300
We’ve been waiting in lines for hours.

522
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,080
Well...

523
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:57,580
I...

524
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,860
Good one.

525
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,300
Dear guests,

526
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,260
today we are selling new bellybands.

527
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,100
We’ll skip the lion dance and all that.

528
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,580
Master Li will show up personally

529
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,980
to juggle to bring everyone good luck.

530
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,100
Please welcome.

531
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,820
Great!

532
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,000
Good!

533
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:20,620
Nice!

534
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:21,320
Cool!

535
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,900
Good move, Master Li. Go, go!

536
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,980
I want two!

537
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,660
Five for me!

538
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,260
No problem.

539
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,620
OK, OK.

540
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,700
Great, great!

541
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:38,900
Let’s go.

542
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,420
It’s open!

543
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,740
Go, go, go.

544
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,380
No, no, no.

545
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,090
Move, move.

546
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,460
Be careful, watch out.

547
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,060
Be careful, watch out.

548
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,380
You can all get it.

549
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:54,860
Don’t rush.

550
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:55,430
Go.

551
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,020
Don’t push me.

552
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:57,850
Heavens.

553
00:26:59,210 --> 00:26:59,690
Go away.

554
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:00,470
Hurry up.

555
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,460
- Go away.
- Don’t push.

556
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,370
Excuse me.

557
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,260
She has done a lot for the bellybands.

558
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,820
Did she do it for Xinsilu?

559
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,980
We’ve burned down three yards

560
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,140
but the bellybands survived.

561
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,980
They even got popular because of this.

562
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,620
Rumors say

563
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,740
that you set the fire
to burn the Silk Store.

564
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,380
Now Longzhu Gang is coming for you.

565
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,620
Li Qingliu is looking for you.

566
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,260
I remind you

567
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,860
to get out of Silver City now.

568
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:55,580
Mr. Zhu,

569
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,020
I’ve got other ideas.

570
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,140
As long as you are willing to help me,

571
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,260
after it’s done…

572
00:27:59,380 --> 00:27:59,940
Enough!

573
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,460
How dare you to ask me for help?

574
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,580
I would not pick up the

575
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,660
thrown trash.

576
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:09,620
Mr. Zhu...

577
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,980
Remember, don’t let me see you again.

578
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,020
How dare you to overhear us?

579
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,580
Do you want to live or not?

580
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,940
Master Qiyan...

581
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,500
I will watch the Silk Store.

582
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,580
Don’t mess anything up anymore.

583
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,500
Handle this man.

584
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,820
Remember, this is your last chance.

585
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,180
Yes, I understand.

586
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,660
Master Qi… Qiyan.

587
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,860
I didn’t hear anything, Master.

588
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,260
Please forgive me, Master.

589
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,940
I didn’t hear anything, Master.

590
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,100
Master Qiyan, forgive me, please.

591
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,420
Master Qiyan!

592
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,180
Does it still hurt?

593
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,460
Yes.

594
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,380
Let the imperial doctor check.

595
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,540
You even called the imperial doctor here.

596
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,860
It’s so much trouble.

597
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,340
Excuse me.

598
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,460
I came here for business.

599
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,980
According to the Prince,
I temporarily rescheduled to Silver City.

600
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,460
I invited him just for you.

601
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,340
But...

602
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,180
You don’t need to

603
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,460
invite the imperial doctor

604
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,980
just for me. I’m pretty strong.

605
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,220
It’s not just a scratch on your hand.

606
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,140
You hurt your

607
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,300
muscles and bones, too.

608
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,540
I will prescribe some decoctions.

609
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,180
With the internal and external therapy,

610
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,980
I can assure your hand

611
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,460
to be as good as before.

612
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,820
But you have to wear the splint
for a dozen days.

613
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,420
Be careful, please.

614
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,300
Take good care of yourself.

615
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,860
Don’t be overdue.

616
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,020
A dozen days?

617
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,300
That long?

618
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,820
I can take care of you.

619
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:22,460
What?

620
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,780
Tianqi and orange segments

621
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,140
are good for trauma.

622
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,980
I’ve tried the decoction.

623
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,020
It’s too bitter.

624
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,300
More? I don’t want it.

625
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,100
What?

626
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,620
If you don’t want it, I’ll help you.

627
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:50,620
Open your mouth.

628
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,660
Open your mouth.

629
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,020
What’s wrong with you?

630
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,340
Is this how you take care of others?

631
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,140
Don’t you dare try to

632
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,100
feed me decoction again, Li Qingliu!

633
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,260
Master, Master.

634
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,100
Your hand is injured.

635
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,180
Stop boiling the medicine for her.

636
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,260
Go and invite Xiaoqin here.

637
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:20,900
Seriously?

638
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,540
I see.

639
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,300
It’s better to invite Xiaoqin here

640
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,540
than letting Prince Zhao

641
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,420
help her, right?

642
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,060
How great.

643
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,860
I’m gonna be fine.

644
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,180
Maybe I can find you a place

645
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:41,980
to rest next to Manager Yan.

646
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,180
Master,

647
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:47,900
I want to sleep with you.

648
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,060
I can agree with Xiaoqin coming over,

649
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,380
but you have to keep an eye on her.

650
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,300
If she doesn’t come,

651
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,380
Prince Zhao would live in the Silk Store.

652
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,060
Ridiculous!

653
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,380
How can I allow a prince to come

654
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,540
to my place to look after someone?

655
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,700
He’s cramping?

656
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:06,700
No.

657
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,180
This is our code.

658
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,020
Two hands and two fingers.

659
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:10,780
It means the second part

660
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,660
of the second chapter of the book.

661
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,500
Meaning that

662
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,140
if it doesn’t rain tonight,

663
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,300
we’d meet in the garden.

664
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,620
Master, let me see your hand.

665
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,140
You must be painful these days.

666
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,340
My hand is fine.

667
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:26,780
Did you bring me any snacks?

668
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,460
Smells good.

669
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,060
By the way,

670
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,500
is Li Qingliu still arrogant?

671
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,100
He’s crazy.

672
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,020
He brought me desserts a few days ago.

673
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,260
Now he’s playing it cold.

674
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,620
Maybe he likes you.

675
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:53,620
It says on the script

676
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,940
that you only become sensitive

677
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,020
when you fall for someone.

678
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,140
Which script did you get obsessed with?

679
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,500
How’s life in the Gang?

680
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,580
Good. Everyone misses you.

681
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,580
They’ve asked me

682
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,540
to bring you these.

683
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,340
Look.

684
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:05,780
Really?

685
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:06,780
Pork.

686
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,700
Let’s have a feast tonight.

687
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,620
= Accounts Eleven =

688
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,420
Master.

689
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,340
It only took two days

690
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,860
to sell out one thousand bellybands.

691
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,140
We’ve earned 13,900 taels in total.

692
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,300
Congratulations, Master.

693
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,260
The accounting office has been unlocked.
The workers can go back to their jobs soon.

694
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,220
Currently we have another

695
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,540
resounding signature product.

696
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,180
Good things come in pairs.

697
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,900
The cost of raw materials,

698
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,940
let’s use tail plumes of peacock
for example,

699
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,220
it’s about 6,000 taels.

700
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,380
The salaries of the craftsmen are

701
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,420
about 3,000 taels per month.

702
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:38,900
On the release day,

703
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,580
those ruined by hooligans are worth 500.

704
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,140
4,000 taels are left.

705
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,380
This is definitely not enough

706
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,940
to repair the burned houses.

707
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,180
Master Long is indeed brilliant.

708
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,260
I used to think

709
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,940
that she’s just a

710
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,820
dumb head, a street rat.

711
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:55,940
But in fact,

712
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,500
she can do good business.

713
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,340
Since she joined Xinsilu,

714
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,340
her behaviors are bad and vulgar.

715
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,300
But as the old saying goes,

716
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,620
practice makes perfect.

717
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,780
Though she’s not a genius,

718
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,940
she’s still able to work.

719
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,140
Master.

720
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,060
Master Long has contributed a lot.

721
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,460
According to our regulations,

722
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,260
we ought to reward her

723
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,420
as encouragement.

724
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,700
What do you think?

725
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,700
We used to reward money.

726
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,380
This time,

727
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,420
I’ve got a new idea.

728
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,780
I heard that people of Chang’an

729
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,660
love rewarding mutton.

730
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,380
Good idea. Two and a half kilograms

731
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,420
of mutton will do.

732
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,860
Pork is not bad, either.

733
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,020
It’s cheap but roasted pork

734
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,300
is pretty good.

735
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,140
I somehow find pig hair is better.

736
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,100
Use it to pick teeth. It’s neither
too soft nor hard.

737
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,700
When it’s not completely cooked,

738
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,180
it can help curing burns and scalds.

739
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,420
If it’s roasted to ashes, adding with lard

740
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,500
can be very helpful to baldness.

741
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,740
Who’s bald?

742
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,380
Go, go, go.

743
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:12,940
What do you want?

744
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:14,940
You heard me.

745
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,660
Nice job with the bellybands.

746
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,540
So I want to reward you.

747
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:20,860
It’s OK.

748
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,900
It’s not pig hair.

749
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,700
I know it’s not.

750
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,060
You the upper class look down upon pork.

751
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,220
You wouldn’t collect pig hair.

752
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,700
Since you want to reward me,

753
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,100
well, how about

754
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,860
giving me the permanent bonus
of the bellybands.

755
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,780
I get thirty percent of the profit

756
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,540
each time you sell one, okay?

757
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,140
Permanent profit?

758
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,580
You really know your way

759
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,100
of earning money.

760
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,820
People say that business men value money
more than relationship.

761
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,860
We’re no regular relationship.

762
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,420
We went to the jail together and...

763
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:53,980
I’m okay with it.

764
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,460
Really?

765
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,140
Promise?

766
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,380
But,

767
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,740
I have one condition.

768
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,620
Since you’ve bounded yourself
with the bellybands,

769
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,340
you’ll be in charge of designing

770
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,460
new patterns in the future.

771
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:09,980
Are you on board?

772
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,620
Just say that you admire my talents.

773
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,900
Bellybands are a rather

774
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,660
private kind of clothes.

775
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,580
You’d not be that shy since you

776
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,020
came from the brothel.

777
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,460
OK.

778
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,140
If I’m engaged with designing,

779
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,420
give me the title of Manager
of the Design Department.

780
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,060
Manager?

781
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:41,700
Manager?

782
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,980
- Manager?
- Manager?

783
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,540
Yes, you’re right.

784
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,140
From now on,

785
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,060
I’d be your manager of Design Department.

786
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,420
- Manager?
- I’d like to freshen things up

787
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,740
a little bit.

788
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,900
Change the department’s fate.

789
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,340
We’ll start from you.

790
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:57,620
Here. Come.

791
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,220
Me?

792
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:58,980
Yes, you.

793
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,420
Your eyebrows are too thin.

794
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,620
We should make them thicker.

795
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,020
Come on, thicker.

796
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,020
Thicker,

797
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,500
so that they make your face looks smaller.

798
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,220
Now, blush.

799
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,940
Just like a peach.

800
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,180
Right there would be the Silk Store’s

801
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,020
public designing room.

802
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,540
We finish the designing and cutting here.

803
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,020
Is it good?

804
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,220
This way, please.

805
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,500
So much better, go.

806
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,260
Xiaoqin.

807
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,300
You should have come earlier.

808
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,220
It seems like Li Qingliu is rich,

809
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:47,780
but he’s very stingy.

810
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,540
They hardly cook meat.

811
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,660
I’m almost thinner.

812
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,420
Tell me whatever you want to eat.

813
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,620
I’ll buy them for you.

814
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,220
Oh, Master.

815
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,060
I heard that the accounting office
has been unlocked.

816
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,940
Does it mean you can come back

817
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,060
as soon as your hand gets better?

818
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,340
Not yet.

819
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,020
Now I’m the manager of Design Department.

820
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,300
I want to learn some skills first.

821
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,460
I can’t go back yet.

822
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,740
I think my pear is burned.

823
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:18,700
Hurry, hurry.

824
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,420
Blow it, blow it.

825
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:30,500
Did you smell that?

826
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,500
Why does it smell like oil?

827
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:37,980
Is there a fire again?

828
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:05,980
Long Aoyi!

829
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,940
I don’t care if you’re a mess yourself.

830
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,420
But don’t treat here as a sty!

831
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,180
Master Li,

832
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,820
our Master hurt her hand because of you.

833
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,380
She only ate some of your food.

834
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,420
Do you have to be so mean?

835
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,620
Saying that she’s a…

836
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,020
She’s a pig?

837
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,180
Xiaoqin.

838
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,260
I’ve been having plenty of spare time.

839
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,180
I had these

840
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,780
new ideas all of a sudden.

841
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,580
I was planning to use them

842
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,900
to work on the

843
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,500
kneeler, half-sleeved shirt
for both parents and kids,

844
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,060
maybe the fancy silk
sun-protective shield.

845
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:35,700
Maybe they sell

846
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,140
better than the bellybands.

847
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,300
Master,

848
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,300
the names are already special.

849
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,220
Right?

850
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,660
But someone called me a pig.

851
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,980
How good can the ideas

852
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,740
of a pig be?

853
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,180
Never mind.

854
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,460
I’d rather

855
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,260
continue sweeping the floors

856
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,180
with my injured arm.

857
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,620
Be careful.

858

Xiaoqin.

I just cleaned?

868
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,380
