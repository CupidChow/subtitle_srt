32
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,800
Greetings to Grandmother.

33
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,430
I asked you two to come.

34
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,720
Why do you come alone?

35
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,030
She is not feeling well.

36
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,920
Please forgive us.

37
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,350
I am being senile again.

38
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,550
I forgot that.

39
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,710
She is pregnant now.

40
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,710
But

41
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,230
I’m always worried about her.

42
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,520
Bring it here.

43
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,590
Look.

44
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,750
I asked someone to make it.

45
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,280
Take it as the first gift

46
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,750
for your child.

47
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,880
Thank you, Grandmother.

48
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,670
All right.

49
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,520
Go back now.

50
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,790
Spend more time with her.

51
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:26,920
Yes.

52
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,590
I want to know,

53
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,280
are you really

54
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,480
looking forward to this child?

55
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,990
It’s not like that.

56
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,400
I like Aoyi

57
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,310
not because

58
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,710
she is pregnant with
the child of the Li family.

59
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,920
After all, there are a lot of
people in the Palace.

60
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,030
What we need is dynamic people.

61
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,560
This golden-made Palace

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,650
is like a cage.

63
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,870
We enjoy bliss here

64
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,840
but lost our freedom.

65
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,960
However, Long Aoyi

66
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,110
is like a weed in the Palace.

67
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:14,260
She is trampled and torn,

68
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,680
but she survived tenaciously.

69
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,280
She is like Cui back then.

70
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,360
The Emperor loved her and spoiled her,

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,590
he even forgot about the nation.

72
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,310
The thought of it

73
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,630
makes me sad.

74
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,310
All right, it’s over now.

75
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,310
What matters is the person
in front of you.

76
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,080
You must keep this treasure in good watch.

77
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,000
Duly noted.

78
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,400
Any news?

79
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,030
No.

80
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,430
Skinny and I have mobilized our brothers

81
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,000
to search everywhere she hangs out.

82
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,870
How should we do?

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,360
Prince Jun is summoned into the Palace,

84
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,310
if she comes back

85
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,190
and I go out to find her...

86
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,400
Don’t worry.

87
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,870
I can still search every house.

88
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,590
If we can’t find her,
let’s go to Silver City

89
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,520
and search the whole country

90
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,520
through our brothers of canal transport.

91
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560
We must find Master Long!

92
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,000
Yes.

93
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,800
Master, where did you go?

94
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,520
How’s it going?

95
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,750
Ezi has done it.

96
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,910
Do you see it clearly?

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,240
I didn’t see the belly clearly.

98
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,310
But

99
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,190
there was ceiba falling out.

100
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,680
I don’t know what’s in her belly.

101
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,310
Prince Jun walked up to it
and took a look,

102
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,520
then he followed up.

103
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,840
Didn’t see it clearly?

104
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,360
Let’s go to Prince Jun’s Mansion now.

105
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,950
= Prince Jun’s Mansion =

106
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,410
= Prince Jun’s Mansion =
Master has not returned yet.

107
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,560
We have searched the whole city
but couldn’t find her.

108
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,930
You must do something about it!

109
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,920
Hush.

110
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,560
Miss Du has arrived.

111
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,630
We have to wait for them to leave.

112
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,360
Right?

113
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,200
Xiaoqin.

114
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,710
Listen to me.

115
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,630
Don’t worry.

116
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,120
When did anything happen to Master Long?

117
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,360
Right? It’s okay.

118
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,190
The old wound of her has not healed!

119
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,080
She left being dressed up like that

120
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,840
and didn’t take anything she usually wore.

121
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,590
How could she be okay?

122
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,930
Xiaoqin, take it easy.

123
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,160
Impulse is the devil.

124
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,760
Don’t worry, calm down.

125
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,290
All right?

126
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,870
Qingliu.

127
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:54,950
Qingliu?

128
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,390
I learned a golden salmon

129
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,000
in the Palace today.

130
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,680
Try it.

131
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:13,960
Xiaoxian.

132
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,790
Qingliu.

133
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,120
The weather changes quickly.

134
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,230
It’s sunny in the day,

135
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,560
and it rains hard at night.

136
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,030
Isn’t the fate of people the same?

137
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,630
We used to be childhood sweethearts,

138
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,360
now your heart doesn’t belong to me.

139
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,820
= Prince Jun’s Mansion =

140
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,700
I’m afraid

141
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,850
Lady Long has to stay
in the Palace tonight.

142
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,140
Qingliu.

143
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,410
This thunder is too scary.

144
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,970
Can you stay with me for a while?

145
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,360
Leave me alone!

146
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,440
- Go away!
- Xiaoqin.

147
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,160
Prince Jun!

148
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,390
Get me the raincoat.

149
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,570
Master.

150
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,160
Hurry up.

151
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,490
Let’s go.

152
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,560
Thank you, Xiaoxian.

153
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,480
It’s my fault.
I didn’t know how to say it.

154
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,800
But you said it for me.

155
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,930
I already knew

156
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,580
I don’t have your heart.

157
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,730
What’s the use of keeping you?

158
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,140
It’s like this rain.

159
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,610
The more you want to grab it,

160
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,970
the quicker it slips away.

161
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,900
Go ahead.

162
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,340
= Prince Jun’s Mansion =

163
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,850
It suddenly thundered and rained.

164
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,290
I just want to find someplace

165
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,770
with eaves to avoid the rain.

166
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,750
You don’t need to drive me away.
I’ll leave now.

167
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:35,850
- Well...
- Well...

168
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:38,930
You go ahead.

169
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:45,730
I...

170
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,100
I wanted to tell you several times.

171
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,140
But watching you

172
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,340
get edged out,

173
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,970
if it is revealed that I am not pregnant,

174
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:54,940
I’m afraid...

175
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:55,970
Afraid of what?

176
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,300
Yan Bin and I

177
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,540
came to the capital with nothing to lose,

178
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,940
will we fear those
who have something to lose?

179
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:03,730
At the worst

180
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,250
I can go back to Silver City
to do my own business.

181
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,890
It’s good to stock up at Jia’ermu.

182
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,280
It was better then.

183
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,620
What did you say?

184
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,890
The fake pregnancy

185
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,340
is between us.

186
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,490
If it gets out,

187
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:33,580
you are going to be beheaded.

188
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,700
Well, are you going to cover me up?

189
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,100
Otherwise?

190
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,820
You and I are on the same boat.

191
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,540
I won’t let it happen.

192
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,820
What a prince.

193
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,940
You are still a businessman inside.

194
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,580
Yeah.

195
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,060
You are

196
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,650
the most precious goods I have.

197
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,580
Am I only your goods?

198
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,420
How are you going to sell it?

199
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,300
Hoard first

200
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,300
like those profiteers.

201
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:07,700
Then sell it at a good price

202
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,060
when the good times come.

203
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,340
Fine by me.

204
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,940
I have legs and hands anyway.

205
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,700
I can run away if it doesn’t sell well.

206
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,200
I won’t let you go

207
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:21,890
this time.

208
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,820
But...

209
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,420
Are you worried about Xiaoxian?

210
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,460
I have made my mind

211
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,220
clear to her.

212
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,490
I will go to my father

213
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:33,850
and let him take back his order.

214
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,130
But...

215
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:38,650
There is no but.

216
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,540
I will solve

217
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,540
all of your concerns.

218
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,610
From now on,

219
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,340
there will be no more

220
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,940
concealment and lie

221
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,250
between you and me.

222
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,060
Okay.

223
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,340
Miss.

224
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,190
Did you really agree

225
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,550
to break the engagement with Prince Jun?

226
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:32,790
Otherwise?

227
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,220
Don’t you know

228
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,220
what kind of a person Qingliu is?

229
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,460
Once he wants to do something,

230
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,430
he will definitely do it.

231
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,410
Even if I don’t agree now,

232
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,060
he won’t compromise.

233
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,180
I might as well say yes.

234
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,290
There still might be

235
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,690
a chance to change it.

236
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,650
You mean...

237
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,320
Today I saw Long Aoyi.

238
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,330
The more I think there is something
wrong with her pregnancy.

239
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,550
So...

240
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,080
If she is not pregnant,

241
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,730
even if Qingliu is bewitched by her,

242
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,150
the other people in the Palace
won’t spare her.

243
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,000
Well,

244
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,460
let’s go to find them now.

245
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,310
From Qingliu’s reaction,

246
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,840
he seems to know something.

247
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,610
I have to wait for the opportunity

248
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,200
and expose her in front of everyone.

249
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:37,740
= Prince Jun’s Mansion =

250
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,280
= I know if it weren’t for your master, =

251
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,980
= you would never want to be Lady Long. =

252
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,580
Miss?

253
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,950
In order to

254
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,910
see you every day,

255
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,950
Prince Jun even makes you
move next to his room.

256
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,070
I think he wants to

257
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,790
sleep with you on one bed every day.

258
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,580
Where is he now?

259
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,270
He saw you sleeping soundly,

260
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,460
so he didn’t bear to wake you up.

261
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,700
He said he would pick you up
when you are awake.

262
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,390
Take you to Qinglong Temple to pray.

263
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:34,500
What is this?

264
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:36,940
I know

265
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,870
if it weren’t for your master,

266
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,690
you would never want to be Lady Long.

267
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,100
You have to mind all these
red tapes every day.

268
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,230
I promise you,

269
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,460
after I finish these affairs these days,

270
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,950
I will find a chance to ask my father

271
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,340
to let us leave.

272
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,550
By that time

273
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,930
you can go wherever you want.

274
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,710
I will always be with you,

275
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,200
only with you.

276
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,520
We will

277
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,190
live a carefree life.

278
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,040
And, Long Aoyi.

279
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,770
I love you.

280
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,000
This,

281
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,390
this is Prince Jun’s

282
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,500
affectionate confession to you?

283
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,500
Get out.

284
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:16,810
Get out.

285
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,670
- Don’t be shy!
- Get out.

286
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,300
= Qinglong Temple =

287
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:35,300
= Daxiong Palace =

288
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,070
There are so many temples in Chang’an,

289
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,580
why do we have to come here?

290
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,980
Qinglong Temple was built
in Taizong period.

291
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,460
There are Buddhist relics

292
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,980
of Gautama Buddha in the temple,

293
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,490
so the people of Chang’an

294
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,030
and the royal family members
come here to pray for blessing.

295
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,320
Amitabha.

296
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,120
Benefactress, please do not
enter the main hall.

297
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,030
Master.

298
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,240
We want to pray for blessing

299
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,160
and make a donation.

300
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,390
Why can’t we come forward?

301
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,760
You misunderstand me.

302
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,780
I notice that this benefactress

303
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,180
is pregnant.

304
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,980
There is musk in the incense.

305
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,520
It will volatilize when it’s burning,

306
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,090
and it will harm the fetus.

307
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,290
Therefore, I ask this benefactress

308
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,560
to worship Buddha in the side hall.

309
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,460
Thank you for reminding us.

310
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,190
I’ll wait for you in the side hall.

311
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,700
What’s good about this temple?

312
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:35,950
Xiaoqin.

313
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,380
Get the carriage ready.

314
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,210
I will go back in a while.

315
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,980
Don’t we wait for Prince Jun?

316
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,030
I’ll go to find him later.

317
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:41,700
You prepare it first.

318
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,500
Okay.

319
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,950
Obsessed apprentice, now you are here.

320
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,220
I’ll make you reborn.

321
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,340
Cut off

322
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,030
you and your past in the future.

323
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,390
Why is Long not here?

324
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,200
- Master, she might...
- Qingliu.

325
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,820
I seemed to see

326
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,820
an old monk healing another strange monk.

327
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,740
Strange monk?

328
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:57,430
Yes.

329
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,070
He was lying on the bed.

330
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,340
The other old monk was
giving him acupuncture.

331
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:02,910
The monk who was pierced

332
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:03,980
looks horrible.

333
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,950
There are red marks all over his body.

334
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,740
Are you sure you saw it clearly?

335
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,030
How about we go and have a look?

336
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:10,860
Long.

337
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,670
Don’t forget why we are here.

338
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,270
Let’s go back first

339
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,450
since we have prayed for blessing.

340
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,100
Miss, the carriage is ready.

341
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,190
Hurry up.

342
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:45,500
This song is made by Emperor Ming.

343
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,540
Back then,

344
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,190
Cui was not familiar with pipa.

345
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:54,780
She can only play this song.

346
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,420
Come on.

347
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,190
How do you think about

348
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,260
the Lofty Moon I just played?

349
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,700
You played it beautifully.

350
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,580
But Cui played it

351
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,040
affectionately.

352
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,020
Qingliu said nothing,

353
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,020
but he must

354
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,430
blame me

355
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,830
for not protecting his mother well.

356
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,460
She ended up with

357
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,870
dying alone far from home.

358
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:51,260
What’s gone is gone.
Please don’t blame yourself.

359
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,590
But Qingliu is indeed talented.

360
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,110
Although he made slight omission

361
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,590
in the water transportation,

362
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,980
with some cultivation,

363
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,630
he will definitely make huge achievement.

364
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,670
Exactly.

365
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:13,430
Come on.

366
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,150
Let me make a toast to you.

367
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:14,950
Good.

368
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,640
The meeting will end
if there is no report!

369
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,830
Your Majesty, I have something to report.

370
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:41,980
Go ahead.

371
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,060
According to Celestial Bureau,

372
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,910
the Dragon Star moves to the east.

373
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,350
It’s time to hold Qiuxian,
the autumn hunting.

374
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,150
Qiuxian

375
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,700
is Tang’s ritual to welcome autumn.

376
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,260
Arrange it well.

377
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:58,860
Yes, Your Majesty.

378
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,540
Father, I think

379
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,020
the northern rebels are not solved yet,

380
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,070
it’s not a good time

381
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,460
to kill now.

382
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,060
Father, I have something to say.

383
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:19,680
The hunting events in the four seasons

384
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,350
are for demonstrating Tang’s force

385
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,500
and national prestige.
We never missed one hunting.

386
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,540
Now the border is in turmoil,

387
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:26,540
if the royal family of Tang

388
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,430
cancels the hunting this time,

389
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,280
it might make those foreigners
have evil thoughts.

390
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,960
I think we must

391
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,570
hold the event on time.

392
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,390
Prince Zhao also has a point.

393
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,590
Prime Minister, what do you say?

394
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,540
Your Majesty.

395
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:50,260
I think we can hold the event.

396
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,910
But we can

397
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,350
reduce its size this year.

398
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,590
How about holding it

399
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,540
at the small hunting ground
in Nanyuan on the hill behind?

400
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,060
Not bad.

401
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,460
Prime Minister

402
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,590
gave consideration to both sides.

403
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,020
Pass my order.

404
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:07,840
Qiuxian will be

405
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,500
held in Nanyuan hunting ground this year.

406
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,630
Crown Prince, Prince Jun, Prince Zhao.

407
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,390
- Yes, Father.
- Yes, Father.

408
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,060
In Qiuxian ceremony,

409
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,810
the three of you each lead a team.

410
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,990
Whoever hunts the most preys

411
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:23,900
will be the winner.

412
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,670
I have a great reward for him.

413
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,220
- Yes, Father.
- Yes, Father.

414
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,740
Did His Majesty say

415
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,650
Qiuxian ceremony

416
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:44,920
will be held in Nanyuan this year?

417
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,150
Yes, Your Grace.

418
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,950
His Majesty also proposed that

419
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,740
the Crown Prince,

420
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,300
Prince Zhao and Prince Jun

421
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,720
each leads a team.

422
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,110
Whoever hunts the most will win.

423
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,780
Prince Zhao is skilled in
archery and horsemanship.

424
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,240
He never missed the target.

425
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:01,370
This time

426
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:04,020
he will make a figure
in front of His Majesty.

427
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,880
Nanyuan is smaller than the

428
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,370
hunting ground before.

429
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,590
What rare prey can there be?

430
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,140
You are right.

431
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,720
Unless

432
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,630
the snow-white deer in the legend

433
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,500
will appear.

434
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,300
It will be

435
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,700
auspicious to catch it.

436
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,430
White deer?

437
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,740
You reminded me.

438
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,060
Sometimes the legend

439
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,500
is not all imaginary.

440
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,190
It might come true.

441
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,260
Your Grace, you mean...

442
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,300
I’ll see you off

443
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,680
this time.

444
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,980
God bless the fate of Tang!

445
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,190
Qiuxian this year

446
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,960
officially begins!

447
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,900
I heard there is a white deer

448
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,920
in Nanyuan.

449
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,430
Whiteness doesn’t only
apply to the immortal,

450
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,240
but also to deer.

451
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,300
= Tang =

452
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,170
This is for seeking luck,

453
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,060
why don’t you throw?

454
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:02,570
Not interested.

455
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,210
Instead of littering,

456
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,670
I might as well take a hound
and a goshawk,

457
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,700
and ride the horse.

458
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,580
This is your fault.

459
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,230
Look at Xiaoxian.

460
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,280
She is not the wife of Qingliu yet.

461
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,430
She knows how to manage
her reputation now.

462
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,780
Her praying dance

463
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,670
is pretty good.

464
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,020
I can also do the praying dance.

465
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:21,560
Have you heard of the
five-animal exercises?

466
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,640
Imitate five animals

467
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:25,520
to regulate the five internal organs.

468
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,110
Are you talking about

469
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,820
Hua Tuo’s five-animal exercises?

470
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,950
It’s popular among the people.

471
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:31,630
Let me teach you.

472
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,870
They are going to do
five-animal exercises.

473
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,980
It sounds fun.

474
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,640
I also want to go.

475
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,330
- Let’s go.
- Let’s take a look.

476
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:41,750
- Let’s go.
- Come on.

477
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,500
What happened?

478
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:46,730
Your Highness, Qingliu,

479
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,260
there seems to be something wrong
with my saddle.

480
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,360
I need to adjust it.

481
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,430
Bad luck for you,

482
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,290
the reward will be mine.

483
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,970
Don’t blame me for not letting you win.

484
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,350
Your Highness, I’m still here.

485
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,970
Seems that Prince Jun is also confident.

486
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:03,950
You go first.

487
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,300
I will catch up later.

488
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,110
Why would my saddle

489
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,190
go wrong?

490
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,740
Hurry up and change my saddle!

491
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,740
Draw your waist, raise your head.

492
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,290
Yes, this is tiger.

493
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:23,020
This action is good for the waist.

494
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,440
Very good.

495
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,220
Lift the hip.

496
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,430
The Princess even falls for

497
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,270
this kind of cheap trick.

498
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,500
That’s right.

499
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:33,780
Not bad.

500
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,650
You Grace, the white deer appeared

501
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,220
as they set off.

502
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:41,470
The Crown Prince chased it
with Prince Jun.

503
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:44,960
When the white deer shows up,
something good will happen.

504
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,110
Crawl.

505
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:50,830
Crawl.

506
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,970
This move is very good for the spine.

507
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,810
Let’s crawl.

508
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,940
Come on.

509
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,590
What is this?

510
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,260
This...

511
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,030
Isn’t it

512
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,570
the quiver of the Crown Prince?

513
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,260
Yes.

514
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,020
The Crown Prince is in poor health,

515
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,430
so they made a lightweight

516
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,480
quiver specially for him.

517
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,100
Why is it here?

518
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:29,830
Who’s that person?

519
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,830
The one beside Concubine De.

520
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,520
He might be from the Pang family.

521
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,620
Also a member of the Shence Army
of the Imperial Guards.

522
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,270
Being short

523
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,660
also has advantages.

524
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,720
Why did the hook for stealing money bag

525
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,960
appear in the Palace?

526
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,100
No.

527
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:02,980
Maybe someone uses it because

528
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,770
most people in the Palace

529
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,620
don’t know about it.

530
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:26,960
What were you looking for?

531
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,850
I’m here to get the chessboard.

532
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,560
The concubines and Concubine De
want to play chess.

533
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,630
I noticed that you were looking around.

534
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,960
I thought you were looking for something.

535
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,090
Thank you.

536
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,300
I’ll leave now.

537
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:49,940
The hook is gone.

538
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:51,310
It seems that

539
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,680
Concubine De changed
the Crown Prince’s quiver.

540
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,190
Qingliu.

541
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,700
The white deer leads us to this place.

542
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,330
It’s pretty cunning. Shoot it in the neck.

543
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,190
Don’t let it run.

544
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,460
Let’s keep it alive
and dedicate it to Father.

545
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,150
I’ll outflank it. Shoot its legs.

546
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:17,670
Okay.

547
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,780
Today I’ll be the winner.

548
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:44,720
Be careful!

549
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:50,540
Long!

550
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:52,110
Long!

551
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:55,830
Long!

552
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,350
Long!

553
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:00,910
I am hit by the arrow.

554
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,420
I will die soon.

555
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,690
Don’t be silly, you’ll be fine.

556
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,390
I hate it.

557
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,430
I couldn’t be

558
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,260
a rich woman

559
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,740
like you in this life.

560
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:24,740
Can you

561
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,390
fulfill my last wish?

562
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,350
Can you give me
a thousand taels of silver?

563
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,780
At least I can have some money

564
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,150
on my way to the underground.

565
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,700
It doesn’t matter if there is no cash.

566
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,500
You can write me an IOU.

567
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,240
By the way, I still want...

568
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,110
Are you done?

569
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:10,830
I’m fine.

570
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,350
My child is so nice.

571
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,020
He warded off the arrow for me.

572
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,870
Can you still

573
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,190
make jokes now?

574
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:19,700
Right.

575
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,870
I’m here to tell you about this arrow.

576
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,430
Look.

577
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,060
There they are.

578
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,630
Qingliu, did you...

579
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,510
I was frightened and I fell off the horse.

580
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,460
Look, I am fine.

581
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:42,900
Great.

582
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:44,110
You scared me.

583
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,080
Sorry for making you worried.

584
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,210
I’m relieved to see you are fine.

585
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:48,210
Let’s go.

586
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:49,630
Come on.

587
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:02,780
I threw the arrow

588
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,210
in this direction.

589
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,360
Why is it missing?

590
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,590
Do you suspect the subordinate
of Concubine De

591
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,780
changed the quiver of the Crown Prince?

592
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,220
I was afraid of being questioned
by the Crown Prince

593
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,830
about the arrow in my hand,

594
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:19,590
so I threw the arrow away

595
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,870
in a hurry.

596
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,700
There is something wrong about the arrow.

597
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,190
Even it has something wrong,

598
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,020
we can’t make sure that
Concubine De did it.

599
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:28,200
Besides,

600
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,260
why would Concubine De
kill me through the Crown Prince?

601
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,280
I rarely make mistakes about judging people.

602
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,400
The guard beside Concubine De
must have a problem.

603
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,020
Is she behind everything in the Palace

604
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,590
and related to the koi pendant?

605
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,780
If it’s Concubine De,

606
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:44,060
she has

607
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,980
the entire Pang family to support her.

608
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,540
There must be positive evidence

609
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,950
to bring her down.

610
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,020
Evidence?

611
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:54,350
I heard that Chongwen Hall

612
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,780
has all the information
about the concubines.

613
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:56,460
I’ll check it.

614
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,540
Chongwen Hall is not some place
you can get in as you want.

615
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,630
I’ll find a way.

616
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,540
You look down on me. Wait and see.

617
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,260
He didn’t die.

618
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,110
Cui’s wicked son

619
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,780
is pretty lucky.

620
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,530
Your Grace. Don’t be angry.

621
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,980
We led the Crown Prince and him
to chase the white deer

622
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,220
and found the right spot.

623
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,950
But Long Aoyi

624
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,350
suddenly showed up and ruined it.

625
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,580
Well...

626
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,330
There was nothing we can do.

627
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,300
Did you find the arrow?

628
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,980
It’s filled with mercury.

629
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,020
We can’t let other people get it.

630
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,320
Not yet.

631
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,860
But we have checked that

632
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,680
Li Qingliu doesn’t have it.

633
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:42,400
You adjusted the shoes of Prince Zhao,

634
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,780
did he notice it?

635
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,690
I don’t think so.

636
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,390
Prince Zhao just entered
the Palace to see you.

637
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,870
Hearing you are uncomfortable,

638
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,510
he just went back.

639
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,830
Keep looking for that arrow.

640
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:55,670
Yes.

641
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,060
Have you checked out

642
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:08,740
the person I asked you

643
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,110
to investigate yesterday?

644
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,890
Pang Dahai, from the Pang family.

645
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,300
He was promoted by Concubine De

646
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:19,260
and has been working in the
Imperial Guard in the harem.

647
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,150
I checked it.

648
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,540
There is nothing wrong.

649
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,830
Shence Army and Jinwu Guards

650
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,470
perform our own duties
without interfering with each other.

651
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,350
So there is

652
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,170
no other news yet.

653
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,660
Can you bring

654
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,680
this person to see me?

655
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,350
He took a sick leave

656
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,350
and left the Palace yesterday.

657
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,620
It’s not sure when he will come back.

658
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,020
Could it just be a coincidence?

659
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,980
It’s inconvenient for me to ask.

660
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,390
If you need me,

661
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,020
I’m willing to help you anytime.

662
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,870
Thank you, General Lyu.

this is the gathering place.

666
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:02,400
Good.

667
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,800
It’s hot now.

668
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,950
The gnats and bugs are all out.

Take it down!

Mei is pretty powerful.

You can ignore me now.

675
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,920
You have changed too much.
Sorry for not recognizing you.

676

Why do you want to take the plate down?

00:37:59,050 --> 00:37:59,710
Stop!

686
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,660
Let me see who is acting unruly

687
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:05,520
in Xingqing Palace!

688
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,650
Lady Long is pregnant with
the heir of the Prince.

689
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,430
Her Qinglong Firm is helping the court

690
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,920
investigate the lack of food.

691
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,770
Mei, no matter how powerful
your master is,

692
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,310
she can’t be the master
of the royal family!

693
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,210
This is...

694
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,060
My seal.

695
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,980
I’ll lend it to you for now.

696
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:39,140
Take it and stamp it on that wooden plate.

697
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,500
Let me see who would dare to
bully you again.

698
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,060
Your Highness.

699
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,910
You should lend me your knees.

700
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,180
What happened?

701
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:54,840
Nothing.

702
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,660
I just think of an elder.

703
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,500
She treated me very well

704
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,810
just like you.

705
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,480
Then you should pay filial piety to her.

706
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,950
You are a member of the royal family.

707
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,790
Why don’t you get her here

708
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,210
and settle her well?

709
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,230
Why are you shaking your head?

710
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:23,830
She couldn’t come.

711
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,540
She has passed away.

712
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,100
What a nostalgic good girl.

713
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:49,950
Yes.

714
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,500
I have come to the Palace for so long.

715
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,350
The Palace Gathering is established.

716
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,680
But there is no progress at all.

717
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,540
Master.

718
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,400
You must bless me in the heaven

719
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,600
to find the murderer quickly.

720
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,700
Come on, have a look.

721
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,870
Take whichever

722
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:14,830
you like.

723
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:18,420
Her Highness noticed that you are sad,

724
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,710
she knows you like

725
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,050
these rare objects.

726
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:22,580
She gives up her treasures
specially for you.

727
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,180
It even makes me

728
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,620
a little jealous.

729
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,460
Your Highness, then I'll help myself.

730
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,710
