Order from the master,

34
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,750
the clothing samples have been made.

35
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,680
The production of gold thread clothes
officially begins.

36
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,920
Sister.

37
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,480
Do you really want to go?

38
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,720
The gold thread has been recovered.

39
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,000
It's time for me to go.

40
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,070
But I don’t want you to go.

41
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,720
It's fine.

42
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,360
I’m just leaving the manor,

43
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,800
not the Silver City.

44
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,430
If you miss me,

45
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480
go to the Southern City to visit me.

46
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,950
Master Long, you know

47
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,630
the Silk Manor and Longzhu Gang

48
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,830
never have any dealings usually.

49
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,360
Separated by a wall,

50
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,190
we seem to be hundreds of miles
away from each other.

51
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,040
Yes, that’s right.

52
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,600
We’re busy working on weekdays.

53
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,830
Even our master

54
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,270
rarely goes out of the manor.

55
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,630
I don’t want to see him.

56
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,920
A lot of things have happened recently.

57
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,160
I haven’t gone out

58
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,190
for months.

59
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,830
It’s okay. At the worst,

60
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,360
I can dig a doghole

61
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,920
in the corner for each of you.

62
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,920
Everyone owns a door.

63
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,270
I will receive you personally.

64
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,310
Well, don’t be upset.

65
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,310
We have a celebration party tonight.

66
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,120
All right then.

68
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,510
The gold thread was recovered.

69
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,040
Their business starts to run again.

70
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,750
The money I’ve invested

71
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,360
should be recouped with interest.

72
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,120
But Dongzi is dead.

73
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,560
Who is the accountant now?

74
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,040
Second Master.

75
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,510
Master, we know
you’re leaving the manor today.

76
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,560
We’ve already prepared a banquet.

77
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,390
A brazier.

78
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,870
First, to wash you off the dust.

79
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,630
Second, to help you
out of the ill-fortune.

80
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,920
We got everything prepared.

81
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,070
We must celebrate after we return.

82
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,600
Of course we must celebrate.

83
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,920
First, we cleared the Longzhu Gang

84
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,160
of suspicion about the gold thread,

85
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,040
and recovered Dachun’s reputation.

86
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,070
Second,

87
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,750
I can finally leave the terrible place.

88
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,190
There’s one more thing to celebrate.

89
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,070
The money our brothers saved

90
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,720
has earned lots of interest.

91
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,390
Master Li.

92
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,310
Don’t rush me.

93
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,560
I’ll go as soon as
I get my silver reward.

94
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,160
Happy to work together.

95
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,680
Let’s have an amicable parting,
and never meet again.

96
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,160
You can’t go.

97
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,270
What do you want, Li Qingliu?

98
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,360
Are you trying to deny?

99
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,750
I don’t owe anyone favors.

100
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,270
Manager Liu is out on business today.

101
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,870
I must pay you the reward tomorrow.

102
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,160
He is out. Fine.

103
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,950
I’m not in a hurry.

104
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,800
I’ll come back another day.

105
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,950
Second Master. Let’s go.

106
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,040
Wait!

107
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,950
Not only you and me

108
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,800
suffered from the gold thread incident,

109
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,390
but the whole Silk Manor

110
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,160
suffered too.

111
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,560
So?

112
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,160
So I want to take this opportunity

113
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,160
to give everyone a vacation.

114
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,270
Let’s relax a little.

115
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,390
You, Second Master and Xiaoqin,

116
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,750
are all invited.

117
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,560
Master,

118
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,510
I think Master Li is sincere.

119
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,830
It’s difficult to refuse such kindness.

120
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,390
Why don't you let our brothers

121
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,040
take two days off for relaxation?

122
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:37,270
OK. Well.

123
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,240
Shall we have a meal?

124
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,750
Oh, no, no.

125
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,560
You have too bad tastes.
It’s boring to have a meal with you.

126
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,830
Then an opera?

127
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:45,750
No.

128
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,190
Handsome scholars and pretty girls.

129
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,160
Emperors and generals. They’re insipid.

130
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,240
Well, forget it.

131
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,480
I’d better go back to eat meat.

132
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:00,950
Master,

133
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,600
what about a hot spring?

134
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,240
That sounds nice.

135
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,870
It’s relaxing.

136
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,390
At the foot of the mountain
in the south of the city,

137
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,720
I’m running a hot spring.

138
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,750
Such a nice coincidence.

139
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,070
Suitable for young and old.

140
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,480
It's settled then.

141
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,000
Well, it's just two or three days.

142
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,070
The Silk Manor won’t be stolen.

143
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,870
That’s it. I have to go.

144
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,140
= Suyong Hall =

145
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:41,790
So,

146
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,030
he manages to change a supplier

147
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,120
and maintains regular production.

148
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,080
He doesn’t lack goods and funds.

149
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,790
I thought

150
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,480
as long as we cut off his supply,

151
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,510
and accepted the official silver
allocated by the imperial court,

152
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,550
Prince Zhao

153
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,750
would support us more.

154
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,360
But he didn’t fall.

155
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,240
He even got back on his feet
after having recovered the gold thread.

156
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,870
By contrast,

157
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,240
the interest we have to pay this month

158
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,630
is no less than the capital.

159
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,910
Nobody knows

160
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,720
he has the ability to save the situation.

161
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,080
Obviously,

162
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,270
he must be this year’s guild leader.

163
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,030
Go for wool and come home shorn.

164
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,480
At last, we are the one

165
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,030
who is in a dilemma.

166
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,200
Your Highness.

167
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,750
Your Highness. The bosses

168
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,080
offered the monthly material money
in person.

169
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,480
I have it counted.

170
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,200
That's the total.

171
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,790
Well, about the selection of guild leader,

172
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,440
Your Highness, with all due respect,

173
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,510
It’s an open secret in the guild.

174
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,320
Shen Yiguan

175
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,600
isn’t open to persuasion,

176
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,960
yet Li Qingliu

177
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,320
persuaded him easily

178
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,270
and resumed production.

179
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,030
Behind this,

180
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,480
there might be something shady.

181
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,150
The imperial court presented

182
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,240
gold and silver to him.

183
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,840
He refused to take it.

184
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,440
Instead, he stretched his arm

185
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,480
to the south to earn hard money.

186
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
With so many efforts,

187
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,200
did he try to avoid something?

188
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,240
Now, Li Qingliu is encumbered

189
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,240
by the production
of gold thread clothes.

190
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,630
But he still turned down
the offer of the government.

191
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,510
He is really in contempt
of the imperial court.

192
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,200
Don't mention him again.

193
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,840
I specially prepared good liquor
for Your Highness.

194
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,720
Your Highness, please take your seat.

195
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,750
I appreciate your kind offer.

196
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:32,790
Mr. Du,

197
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,240
please send several tax officials

198
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,150
to Xinsilu tomorrow.

199
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,960
Goodbye, Your Highness.

200
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,780
= Suyong Hall =

201
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,080
Your Highness, when you first
came to Silver City,

202
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,550
the servants

203
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,360
presented you
with the account book of Xinsilu.

204
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,960
There seemed to be no problem.

205
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,030
Did you see the wily old birds?

206
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,200
They want to use my sword
to fight their own battle.

207
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,390
Good.

208
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,910
I’ll push the boat with the current.

209
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,030
Maybe,

210
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,150
I would catch the foxes’ tails.

211
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,030
As for Li Qingliu,

212
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,840
he needs to be put in his place.

213
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,440
Before Sister came here,

214
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,750
master never let us come out with him

215
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,390
and have group activities.

216
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,550
It’s nothing.

217
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,030
In Longzhu Gang,

218
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,080
we usually go out together

219
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,390
to wine and dine.

220
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,550
Your master

221
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,440
doesn’t know how to use
the “prison and rabbit” tactic.

222
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,910
Prison and rabbit?

223
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,030
Yeah.

224
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,390
Make you work like you are in prison.

225
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,030
Sometimes let you out

226
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,080
and jump at will like rabbits.

227
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,150
He is so stingy.

228
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,600
Master Li looks young,

229
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,550
but you’re running
such a big family business.

230
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,120
You’re competent.

231
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,030
I’m flattered.

232
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,320
With all due respect,

233
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,630
how old are you?

234
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,720
I was adopted by the Li Family
when I was a child.

235
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,910
It was probably in Shangyuan Period.

236
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,200
Shangyuan Period?

237
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,150
Freshly boiled hotspring eggs!

238
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:50,790
Master!

239
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,550
When shall we go back to the gang?

240
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,150
Soon. In the future,

241
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:55,870
we don’t have to see

242
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,630
the stink face again.

243
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,790
But after spending these days with him,

244
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,840
I don’t think Master Li

245
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,030
is a bad person.

246
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,440
Just think, he is a profiteer,

247
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,550
but he didn’t go after the gold thread.

248
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,580
Instead, he went to save you.

249
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,550
Come on.

250
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,360
I was so lucky

251
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,550
that he didn’t break my bones.

252
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,670
Master.

253
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,120
How much money do we get?

254
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,000
I did the math.

255
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,440
With the 10,000 taels of silver reward,

256
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:32,790
we get 80,000 taels of silver in total.

257
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,750
That's enough for us
to open a few more stores,

258
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,120
and purchase a few more mu of land
for silkworm rearing.

259
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,200
One is enough.

260
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,360
No one will marry you if you get fat.

261
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,440
Wait for me for a moment.

262
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,440
Master.

263
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,270
It’s a nice place.

264
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,390
Shuisheng and Qi Zheng are happy.

265
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,910
They were grateful to Master Long.

266
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,480
Two men have a bath together.

267
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,270
Never mind.

268
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,120
If I may say,

269
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,550
you have a different attitude
toward Master Long.

270
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,630
See,

271
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,790
Silk Manor never welcomes outsiders.

272
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,320
She is the first.

273
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,320
All the clerks take a vacation.

274
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,670
It hasn’t been heard of for years.

275
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,120
You don’t want to be close to women.

276
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,320
You even keep the right distance
to Miss Du.

277
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,390
But, these days,

278
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,390
you and Master Long

279
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,360
have spent much time together.

280
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,630
You went out alone

281
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,510
without me.

282
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,150
All in all,

283
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,360
you are blaming me

284
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,510
for not letting you go out with me.

285
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,360
No.

286
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,630
From a businessman’s point of view,

287
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,870
the time when you chased Dongzi,

288
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,910
you should go after the gold thread.

289
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,440
But you saved Master Long.

290
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,320
Why?

291
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,030
You are such a fool.

292
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,630
The gold thread incident
was not only our problem,

293
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,240
but also a trouble that Longzhu Gang
needed to solve quickly.

294
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,030
Others may not try their best.

295
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,240
But she will.

296
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,270
It turned out

297
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,790
with the gold thread being recovered,

298
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,000
she got silver reward

299
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,390
and got rid of her suspicion.

300
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,200
This is a business

301
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,550
that benefits both of us.

302
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,790
Profiteer.

303
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,360
Mr. Lyu,

304
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,630
I was sent to

305
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,960
ask you if everything went well.

306
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,870
Please report back,

307
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,510
we have clues about the man
you’re looking for.

308
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,550
But, to make sure nothing goes wrong,

309
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,030
after I get the hard evidence,

310
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,320
I'll report back in person.

311
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,670
I ask to leave.

312
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,780
= Xinsilu =

313
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,080
According to the order
of the salt and iron officer,

314
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,910
= Xinsilu =
we come to inspect the trade tax.

315
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,480
The accountant's office of Xinsilu
must cooperate.

316
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,320
Sir, please have a look.

317
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,270
Sir, if you need anything,

318
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,840
you’d better wait for our boss
to come back.

319
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,550
Look,

320
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,550
you’ve made such a mess around here.

321
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,030
I don’t know how to explain to my boss.

322
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,840
I’m in charge of salt and iron trade.

323
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:56,960
This time,

324
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,960
inspection of trade tax is carried out
in the whole city.

325
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,270
You don’t have a say.

326
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,240
Take him away.

327
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:02,720
Sir?

328
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,200
Go.

329
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,150
Sir, no, no, no.

330
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,440
You can’t do that, sir.

331
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,220
Sir?

332
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,790
Master.

333
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,340
Master.

334
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:11,780
Stop!

335
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:12,470
Look.

336
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,070
Look.

337
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,550
Are you injured?

338
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,440
Step back.

339
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,400
Mr. Li, do you try to resist the law?

340
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,240
Mr. Zhu, if you have to
check the accounts,

341
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,110
you should do it according to the rules.

342
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,680
You either check the accounts of one year

343
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,240
or those of two years.

344
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,310
It’s one thing to replenish stock,

345
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,510
and another thing to deliver products.

346
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,110
You just check all the accounts
at the same time.

347
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,440
Should we report to you

348
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,110
about how much rice we ate today?

349
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,200
Mr. Li,

350
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,960
we

351
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,590
don’t want to be buried
in the account books either.

352
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,440
But our boss said clearly

353
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,830
we must check all the accounts.

354
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,590
Please do cooperate with us.

355
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,720
Rules are rules.

356
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,920
I won’t

357
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,310
give you convenience

358
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,550
to break the rules.

359
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,350
What if I go on with it?

360
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,480
Move. Move.

361
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,750
Go away!

362
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:23,830
Who?

363
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,440
Go away!

364
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:24,720
No...

365
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:25,680
Go away!

366
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:30,920
Be careful.

367
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,590
It’s you.

368
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:39,830
Thanks.

369
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,640
Never mind.

370
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:48,920
Your Highness!

371
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,310
Perfect timing.

372
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,590
I was checking the accounts with my men,

373
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,750
but Li Qingliu stopped us with no reason.

374
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,640
Your Highness, please uphold justice.

375
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,160
Li Qingliu,

376
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,240
you publicly rejected
the government’s capital before.

377
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,720
Now you stopped the officer

378
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,790
from checking your accounts.

379
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,640
What tricks are you playing?

380
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,960
I dare not play a trick.

381
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,960
I just followed the rules.

382
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,480
OK.

383
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,510
Since Mr. Li follows rules in everything,

384
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,070
I will set a rule for you.

385
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,550
From now on, the accounting office
of Xinsilu is closed down.

386
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,590
You can’t reopen it
till all your accounts are checked.

387
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,400
How come?

388
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,070
The accounting office is closed down?

389
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,590
What about the money
I kept in the Silk Manor?

390
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,310
- Master.
- Master.

391
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:00,750
Yiwen.

392
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,550
Yiwen, come.

393
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,590
Take it.

394
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:08,750
No! No!

395
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,240
Take it.

396
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,070
No! No!

397
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,350
Take it.

398
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,780
No! No!

399
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,510
Master Long,

400
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,640
even if you give me more chicks,

401
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,480
I can’t grant

402
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,440
your request.

403
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,720
I don't believe you.

404
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,960
I gave all my favorite chicks

405
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,030
to you.

406
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,110
Do me a favor.

407
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,920
Spit out our money.

408
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,310
Master Long, my goodness,

409
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,440
Dongzi passed away.

410
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,960
I just take care of the accounts
temporarily.

411
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,000
Now Prince Zhao

412
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,000
closed the accounting office down.

413
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,160
Not to mention your money

414
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,750
kept in the store,

415
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,200
even our monthly salary

416
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,590
and the money used to purchase goods

417
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,000
couldn’t be taken out.

418
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:49,000
You mean the accounting office
is closed down,

419
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,270
and the Silk Manor has no money.

420
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,110
That’s the point.

421
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,200
Now the accounting office

422
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,200
can’t spit out a penny.

423
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,720
Yiwen, what should we do?

424
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,000
We have to break in the office ourselves.

425
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,230
- Go. Get out.
- Leave me alone.

426
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:06,160
- My money. My money is in there.
- Get out.

427
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:06,450
Get out!

428
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:06,970
Let me go!

429
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,480
- Go.
- Get out.

430
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,100
My money.

431
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,830
= Closed by Silver City Government =
My money. Give me my money.

432
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:10,510
Wait.

433
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,920
Your Highness.

434
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,960
All of you withdraw.

435
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:13,830
Yes.

436
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,510
Ms. Long,

437
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,000
the gold thread was recovered.

438
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,000
Why don’t you go home?

439
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,110
I’m supposed to go home
after I get my money.

440
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,110
Just because...

441
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,030
You can tell me everything.

442
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,960
Why do you make such a mess?

443
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,200
It’s official business
of the imperial court.

444
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,790
Do you have anything to do with it?

445
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:40,680
Well,

446
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,920
do you want to have a drink?

447
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:42,790
We can talk while drinking.

448
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,400
How do you know I love drinking?

449
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,920
The whole Silver City

450
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,830
know Ms. Long is a good drinker.

451
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:51,440
And...

452
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,510
I know something else about you.

453
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,270
Do you want to hear it?

454
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,030
You’re an interesting man.

455
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,960
But I don’t drink recently.

456
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,680
I can take a rain check.

457
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,400
I just remembered something.

458
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,440
It may help you.

459
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,070
What is it?

460
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,030
Last time at big bazar,

461
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,000
were you looking for pepper?

462
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,070
Yeah.

463
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,400
Are you serious?

464
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,720
Just have a look and you'll know.

465
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,160
My money. It’s killing me.

466
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,000
What should I do?

467
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
What should I do?

468
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,080
Could it reopen?

469
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,110
All of my money is in there.

470
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,030
What about our monthly salary?

471
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:35,830
It’s all gone.

472
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,030
The East Gate Silver Manor

473
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,000
doubled the salary to poach me.

474
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,350
Do you think I should go?

475
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,880
Go, go, go. Do your job.

476
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,000
Go, go, go.

477
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:53,030
Master, the worst thing is...

478
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,350
What’s wrong?

479
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,960
Because of the capital,

480
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,200
the rent of the restaurant
has more than doubled.

481
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,270
Many of our brothers are out of work

482
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,960
and wait for the subsidy from the gang.

483
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,160
But our money…

484
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,480
You were very kind.

485
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,960
But it’s just a bad timing.

486
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,270
Too bad.

487
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,960
Two hours’ delay,

488
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,270
we can’t withdraw our money.

489
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:22,640
No.

490
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,720
We have to find another way.

491
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,110
At the worst,

492
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,400
I’m going to borrow some money.

493
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,160
I can’t eat pork hock any more.

494
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:33,960
I feel guilty.

495
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,200
Master, you must find a way.

496
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,640
Qingliu,

497
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,750
at present, the Silk Manor is

498
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,960
in a great bustle.

499
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,310
Master Long shouldn’t

500
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,960
be involved in our business again.

501
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,310
I know the boundary.

502
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,960
I’m always at ease about you.

503
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,310
Have a talk.

504
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:04,790
Master Long.

505
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,160
You should knock the door.

506
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,030
Forget it.

507
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,100
= 5,000 taels =

508
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:26,830
What’s your deal?

509
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:28,720
10,000 taels.

510
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,550
This is my private silver.

511
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:31,920
Master Long.

512
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:32,960
This is the silver reward

513
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,510
for you to find our gold thread.

514
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,070
If you have any needs later,

515
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,310
just tell me.

516
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:40,830
What shall I do?

517
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,270
= 5,000 taels =
It’s a consolation to get 10,000 taels.

518
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,830
But what shall we do
with the 50,000 taels

519
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,030
we put in the store?

520
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,110
Don’t worry, Master Long.

521
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,550
I’ve taken the silver out early.

522
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,400
You needn’t worry about the government.

523
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,790
Miss Du,

524
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,550
before you came out today,

525
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,030
didn’t you look in the mirror?

526
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,480
What do you mean?

527
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:10,830
In your ear.

528
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,640
You can speak it aloud.

529
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,550
I don’t like whispers.

530
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,350
Fine.

531
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,270
I just want to say,

532
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,440
there’s a long hair that

533
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,200
comes out of your nose.

534
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,790
You burnt the bridge after crossing it.

535
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,790
Since the gold thread was recovered,

536
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,030
it saved the Silk Manor

537
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,000
a lot of

538
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,680
compensation money.

539
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,160
It also saved your business reputation.

540
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,240
You think

541
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,880
only 10,000 taels are enough?

542
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,350
= 5,000 taels =
I don't want the silver.

543
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,720
Then what do you want?

544
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,070
I want to learn to do business with you.

545
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,160
Do you want to learn to make clothes?

546
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,160
That’s a gift. I can’t learn it.

547
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,480
I want to learn

548
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,110
the tricks you’ve played in business.

549
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,350
How do you force your rivals
to lower their price?

550
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,510
How do you charge

551
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,880
before you produce?

552
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:21,960
And,

553
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,270
how do you fix a high price and

554
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,750
make people pay for it voluntarily?

555
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,640
Master Long,

556
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,830
did you make a mistake?

557
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,310
Of course I made a mistake.

558
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,680
Such a beauty as Miss Du

559
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,960
won’t grow nose hairs.

560
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:43,680
You!

561
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,550
What were you talking about?

562
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,790
I was asking for advice from Master Li...

563
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:58,980

This is one of Tao Zhu’s famous articles.

00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,880
It is all about merchant’s skill.

567
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:10,720
Is it?

568
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,880
Isn’t it a deceptive name?

569
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:14,880
I need advice

570
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,400
because I don’t know anything.

571
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:18,920
Well.

572
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,960
I have business. I should go.

573
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,240
Master Li,

574
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:22,960
think carefully

575
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,030
about the question I asked just now.

576
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,480
I’ll visit you another day.

= 5,000 taels =

578

Who are you?

579
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,690
Don't talk nonsense. Open the door.

580
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,160
Your Highness!

581
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,480
Whose belongings are these?

582
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,110
Young master,

583
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,790
didn’t you see the name here?

584
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,510
Pepper is as valuable as gold.

585
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,750
The quantity of pepper that offered
as tribute to the imperial court is

586
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,720
only 0.6 tons each year.

587
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,070
Here

588
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,960
are 1.8 tons of pepper.

589

I don’t know anything.

597
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,070
Your Highness, how do we punish him?

598
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,270
He’s right.

599
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,590
He’s just a doorman.

600
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,110
Don’t take the trouble to punish him.

601
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,830
But think about it.

602
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,550
It’s such a small bank,

603
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,350
but it conceals so many tricks.

604
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,640
How does it stay safe in Silver City?

605
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:12,960
About this,

606
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,440
never bring it up to anyone,

607
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,680

Lady.

611
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,590
Lady, what are you doing?

612
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,750
The Silk Manor is in trouble.

613
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,960
I must help Qingliu.

614

Lady, you forgot.

615
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,200
It’s Prince Zhao’s idea.

616
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:38,960
If you do this,

617
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,350
master will be angry.

Father,

620
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,880
I heard the accounting office of Xinsilu
was closed down

621
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,070
by Prince Zhao.

622
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,000
Yes, Father.

623
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
You’re my daughter.

624
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,720
You must know

625
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,110
the situation well.

626
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,510
When do you step forward.

627
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,510
When do you get away.

628
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,070
I believe you don’t need me

629
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,310
to tell you again.

630
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,030
What do you mean, Father?

631
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,000
Xinsilu is lack of money now.

632
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:28,880
If you…

633
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,160
I threw the jewelries away

634
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,510
because I don’t like them.

635

Father,

636
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,350
I know you will

637

attain eminence step by step.

638
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,400
As your daughter,

639
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,680
I must be noble in the future.

642
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,200
OK.

643
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,920
You’re definitely my daughter.

644
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,550
I promise you,

645
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,350
as long as I’m here,

646
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,440
I’ll let you marry the prince.

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,790
at Silk Manor.

652
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,510
Are you kidding?

653
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,680
I told you not to go, not to go.

654
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,270
Well,

655
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,790
Now their accounting office is closed down,

656
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,200
and we’re stuck in the trouble.

657
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,240
Master, we are not

658
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,550
afraid of a clothes seller.

659
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,110
- Yes.
- Of course.

660
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:48,720
Listen,

661
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,480
this time I’m going back voluntarily.

662
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,550
I’m not detained by Li Qingliu.

663
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,310
Most importantly,

664
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,480
did the discords among the stores

665
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,400
in Silver City

666
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,750
affect us?

667
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,720
They affected us so much.

668
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,110
The wharf business is not
as good as before.

669
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,790
The restaurant rent

670
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,790
has doubled.

671
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,640
We can’t make enough money
to pay the rent.

672
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:08,550
Besides farming,

673
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,640
no matter part-time or full-time job,

674
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,070
we must look at others’ face.

675
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,440
If they need us,

676
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,110
we get the job.

677
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,110
If they don’t need us,
they give us the brush.

678
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:16,640
Yeah.

679
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,510
So

680
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,750
I’m going to the Silk Manor

681
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,750
to find us a livelihood.

682
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,110
These days,

683
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,510
I’ve been watching carefully

684
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,790
how Xinsilu do their business.

685
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,310
It turns out they don’t

686
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,400
just produce products and sell them.

687
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:36,960
It isn’t that simple.

688
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:38,750
They are rich.

689
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,920
They can do whatever they want.

690
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,440
We can’t learn that.

691
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,310
We can’t learn that.

692
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,440
What is the most important thing
to do business?

693
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,400
Money?

694
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:48,720
I don’t think so.

695
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,440
The most important things are

696
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,640
information and connection.

697
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,270
That’s exactly what people like us

698
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,310
are good at.

699
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,830
You mean that

700
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,160
you’ll work

701
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,720
undercover for us at the Silk Manor?

702
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:05,300
Undercover.

703
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,550
No kidding.

704
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,160
Gengzi.

705
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,270
You number our sericulturists.

706
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,480
How many people do we have
and what is the output of silk.

707
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,440
You figure it out.

708
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,550
OK.

709
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:15,920
The second thing,

710
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,200
Second Master,

711
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,680
please gather all the idle labors

712
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,830
in the gang.

713
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,830
Next silk season,

714
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,240
we must be the silk supplier

715
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,720
of Xinsilu.

716
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,680
No matter how big a store he owns,

717
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,400
his business is limited in an area.

718
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,960
But if we try our best,

719
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,480
maybe in some time,

720
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,880
we’ll run a bigger business than he does.

721
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,960
We could do business with Dayi State,

722
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,440
Tubo state,

723
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,830
and throughout

724
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,880
the world.

725
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,070
Great. It’s great.

726
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,910
Good. Throughout the world.

727
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,920
Throughout the world.

728
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,920
Wonderful!

729
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:48,000
OK.

730
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,590
- Master.
- Great.

731
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,200
These days at the Silk Manor,

732
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,000
did you see Mr. Li’s parents?

733
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,400
He has no parents like me.

734
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,510
He is brought up by his wet nurse.

735
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,310
What’s wrong?

736
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,400
Never mind.

737
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,160
We had a chat when we were in the bath.

738
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,030
Xiaoxian,

739
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,830
I appreciate your kindness.

740
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,720
But I don’t want you

741
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,150
to upset your father

742
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,000
because of the Silk Manor.

743
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,190
I did this for…

744
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,360
The Silk Manor is lack of money.

745
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,510
Your men are being poached too.

746
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,360
I worry that if it goes on like this,

747
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,590
you’ll lose your money and workers.

748
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,880
Don’t forget.

749
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,280
I’m also a manager of Xinsilu.

750
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,710
Why didn’t Master Long leave?

751
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,150
Is that a problem?

752
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,360
Do you want to see me off?

753
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,710
Don’t be so courteous.

754
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,320
I just have a small package.

755
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,840
All my valuables are in it.

756
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,800
You’re kidding.

757
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,280
During your stay in the manor,

758
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,280
you made so many friends.

759
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,510
I can’t compete with them

760
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,030
to see you off.

761
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,070
Xiaoxian, you go home first.

762
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:50,440
What are you doing?

763
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,630
Sorry. Sorry.

764
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:54,630
- Never hit people in the face.
- Sorry. I didn’t do it on purpose.

765
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,280
Why do you scare me?

766
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,760
What are you doing outside
my master’s study?

767
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:01,590
Do you

768
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,880
have a crush on my master?

769
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,510
I’m watching our master.

770
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,280
Just now I saw Du Xiaoxian

771
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,360
went with a long face.

772
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,480
Now our master

773
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,590
is in the study with your master.

774
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,710
A single man and a single woman?

775
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,840
Lady Du left in anger?

776
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,670
You can’t see anything here.

777
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,840
I’ll take you to a better place.

778
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,440
Go.

779
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,070
Seriously?

780
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:25,400
Seriously.

781
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:26,710
Come on.

782
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,480
Can I see it clearly?

783
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,670
Of course you can.

784
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,550
- Hold this hand. Hold this hand.
- Hurry.

785
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:34,760
You know

786
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,230
the silkworm eggs trading was

787
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,280
in Qiyan’s hands.

788
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,190
But after the game at Wanhua,

789
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,110
sericultures turned their coat.

790
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,110
I have taken half of the trading.

791
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,230
Their raw silk

792
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,630
gets markup again and again

793
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,760
before arriving in your warehouse.

794
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,590
The middlemen’s profits doubled.

795
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,710
But your cost increases.

796
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,840
If I’m going to supply

797
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,000
raw silk to your store,

798
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,030
I only add 10%

799
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,510
to the cost price.

800
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:57,800
What do you think?

801
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,670
That's what you said

802
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,800
about learning business from me.

803
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,960
Since you don't want to teach me,

804
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,440
let’s talk about cooperation.

805
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,110
Do you have money for purchasing?

806
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,030
= 5,000 taels =
I have the 10,000 taels you gave me.

807
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,880
Now you’re in a critical situation.

808
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:19,840
I’ll do it.

809
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,670
You’ll save manpower
and material resources.

810
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,400
I’m not taking advantage of you.

811
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,630
It’s called business mind.

812
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:33,960
What are your

813
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:35,840
conditions?

814
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,920
I just told you.

815
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:38,710
Add 10% to the cost price.

816
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,760
What else? Make it clear at one time.

817
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,230
You should say yes

818
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,110
if you think it’s profitable.

819
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,840
You should have started

820
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,760
the business before.

821
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,070
Even if you have sericultures,

822
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,400
the work of silk reeling is complex.

823
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:56,480
It needs a lot of manpower.

824
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,630
You want to start the work.

825
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,110
It’s not so easy.

826
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,880
I ask to live in the Silk Manor.

827
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,920
To match the sellers and buyer,

828
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,800
there’re too many problems to solve.

829
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:17,150
Everyone in your manor has his own duty.

830
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,360
If you specially draft a man

831
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,360
to do the work,

832
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,360
it will increase costs.

833
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,670
It’s the same in our gang.

834
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,800
But if I’m about to do the job,

835
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,960
I will be the most suitable person.

836
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,000
I’ll go between you and the sellers.
I’ll solve all the problems.

837
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,440
I live in your manor,

838
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,480
just like the place set up by Chang’an,

839
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,440
which is called...

840
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,070
Liaison mansion.

841
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,190
Right. An agency anyway.

842
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,150
It’s more convenient.

843
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,590
It’s not impossible.

844
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,400
But…

845
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:48,960
What do you want me to do?

846
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,860
= Escort =

847
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:10,480
Hold on.

848
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,630
I have to do the accounts carefully

849
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,840
to make sure I’m not tricked.

850
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,510
It has been a long time.

851
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,230
What are they doing?

852
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,590
Master, you must stay,

853
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:31,070
or we can’t console our brothers.

854
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,150
Tell you what, it doesn’t matter,

855
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:33,880
as long as they don’t have their dress

856
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,880
and hair messed up.

857
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,480
Master, you must let her stay,

858
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,150
otherwise I can’t

859
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,710
see Xiaoqin every day.

860
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,110
Get off.

861
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,030
10% for one single deal.

862
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,760
If you make 50 deals monthly,

863
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,550
in a year you’ll make…

864
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,550
Good boy.

865
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,000
In a year,

866
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,710
we can earn more than 100,000 taels too.

867
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,550
We’ll purchase the raw silk.

868
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,440
Another condition,

869
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,030
we are in charge of the escort of goods.

870
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,000
Sure. According to your condition,

871
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,000
how much would I get?

872
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,960
I’ll go. I’ll leave.

873
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:44,480
I’m fine. I’m fine.

874
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,110
Are you OK?

875
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:56,710
You may leave.

876
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,840
What about the deal?

877
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,670
I agree.

878
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,000
Alright.

879
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,440
She comes out. Let’s go.

880
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,760
She is out. She is out.

881
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,550
- Untidy clothes.
- Messy hair.

882
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,110
Falling in love is terrible.

883
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,710
I love money more.
