= Episode 27 =

32
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,480
Father,

33
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,000
the girl people talked about

34
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,110
is neither a dancing girl nor a lost girl,

35
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,590
but an old friend of mine in Silver City.

36
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,390
We’ve experienced a lot

37
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,710
and fell in love with each other.

38
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,510
Then what does she do

39
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,710
if she’s not a dancing girl?

40
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,280
Your Majesty,

41
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,440
she’s actually the master

42
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,230
of a gang in Silver City.

43
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:55,820
What?

44
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,780
What an unfilial son!

45
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,500
I can forgive you for some of

46
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,460
your misbehaviors.

47
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,460
But how could you talk about

48
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,900
the affairs

49
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,330
in the royal court

50
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,970
between you and a lower class bandit?

51
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,540
You’ve humiliated
the imperial family enough.

52
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,100
I will never allow

53
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,860
this kind of disregard

54
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,840
of royal status.

55
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,290
Father,

56
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,740
Long Aoyi is from the lower class.

57
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,380
But she’s been thinking of the people.

58
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,970
So she is praised

59
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,850
by many in Silver City.

60
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,330
What’s more,

61
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,100
she helped me turn the corner

62
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,330
when I was in Xinsilu.

63
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,380
I haven’t been well-educated,

64
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,250
but I know very well

65
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,250
people can’t bite the hand that feeds one.

66
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,100
I can accept

67
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,460
any kind of punishment.

68
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,850
Please don’t get Long Aoyi wrong.

69
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,210
You have the courage

70
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,970
to take the blame for the woman.

71
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:05,900
The royal court

72
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,850
is a place for national affairs.

73
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,300
Don’t let the things in bed

74
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,110
idle your time away.

75
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,100
I will order the people

76
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,330
to handle the matters of

77
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,250
picking up brides for you

78
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:23,380
half a month later.

79
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,520
Since the lower class girl

80
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,100
had the relationship with you

81
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,010
and she can’t stay in folk places

82
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,850
for being pregnant.

83
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,220
= Prince Jun’s Mansion =

84
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,950
Did I wake you up?

85
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,380
It’s alright. You are just in time.

86
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,970
I have to finish the files today.

87
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,340
Qingliu, your health is more important.

88
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,660
You are looking very tired.

89
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,850
How about going get some sleep?

90
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,660
I’m fine.

91
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,810
I just need to stand up for a rest.

92
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,940
When we were in Silver City,

93
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,850
Xinsilu and Arabia

94
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,290
signed the first contract.

95
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,410
Back then,

96
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,810
you checked the goods repeatedly

97
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,730
without any rest like now you are.

98
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,970
You made comparison with other merchants

99
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:27,900
and never wasted any time.

100
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:29,100
Yes.

101
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,850
It’s still fresh in my memory.

102
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:33,850
I still remember

103
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,220
you made lotus seed soup with Osmanthus

104
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,410
for me for ten consecutive days.

105
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,060
So I didn’t drop.

106
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,370
But you got sick.

107
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,260
You just reminded me.

108
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,140
Wanna some lotus seed soup now?

109
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,290
I’m making it for you.

110
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,820
Xiaoxian. Xiaoxian.

111
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,820
I know very well about your feelings.

112
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,900
But last night...

113
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,900
You were drunk last night.

114
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,730
So you made do last night.

115
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,020
Not that.

116
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,490
Long Aoyi and I...

117
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,020
Qingliu, no need to explain.

118
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,410
Do you think

119
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:17,660
I am that kind of

120
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,220
mean and dissatisfied housewife?

121
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,460
If you really like her,

122
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,100
I can take her as your concubine

123
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,410
after I marry into your mansion

124
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,140
as the Princess.

125
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,780
If you also like any other girls,

126
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,530
I can also...

127
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:39,220
Xiaoxian.

128
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,970
You’ve been too thoughtful for me.

129
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,700
But you should think more for yourself.

130
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,700
Qingliu.

131
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,260
You’ve been

132
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,730
with me for years

133
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,780
and done everything for me.

134
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,580
We can’t make the achievements of Xinsilu

135
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,530
without your efforts.

136
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:01,900
But

137
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,460
you also lost the carefree time

138
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,020
as a girl.

139
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:06,170
Now

140
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,660
we are granted a marriage...

141
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,970
You still don’t understand?

142
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,580
I’ve been thinking of marrying you

143
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:16,970
after growing up

144
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,530
when I first saw you.

145
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,220
You opened a silk shop,

146
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,900
so I went to learn accounting

147
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,530
and became your right hand.

148
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,530
Since you are the Prince,

149
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,220
I tried every way

150
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,930
to become the one worthy of you.

151
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,410
I’ve been with you no matter
where you are.

152
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,700
From the beginning till now,

153
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,970
you are the only one I want.

154
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,780
I’m making the soup for you.

155
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,370
Xiaoxian.

156
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,900
= Jinjiang Hock Restaurant =

157
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,700
A pancake.

158
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,780
Some biscuits. Some crusty pancake.

159
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:27,970
And some water.

160
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,020
Please enjoy.

161
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:37,730
Oh yeah.

162
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,820
We also serve fresh roast duck.

163
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,020
Shut up.

164
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,060
Thanks. Thank you.

165
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,730
You know?

166
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,530
She said she had her first meal

167
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:07,850
in this restaurant

168
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,530
after coming to Chang’an.

169
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,460
Before, I never gave a glance

170
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,020
at this kind of snacks in Chang’an.

171
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,730
But it tastes great today.

172
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,940
So I can also endure the hardships

173
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,820
she bore before.

174
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,170
I can live a life

175
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,970
she lived before.

176
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,650
Your highness. Why bother yourself?

177
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,000
Miss Long and Prince Jun have...

178
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,750
Prince Jun.

179
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:39,870
Since Prince Jun can do that,

180
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,800
why can’t I?

181
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,750
I can bear

182
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,310
any kind of hardships,

183
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,560
let alone the pancakes.

184
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,550
Just for the sake of her,

185
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,320
I will never be cowardly any longer.

186
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,910
I’d get all that

187
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,960
I should gain.

188
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:42,480
= Court of Censors =

189
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:42,910
Mr. Du.

190
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,630
The gentry Mr. Zhang
in the west of the city

191
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,080
brought a casket of jewels,

192
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:48,750
wishing you

193
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,750
to support his son.

194
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,360
Just return all.

195
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,600
Tell them

196
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,390
if they still have this bold idea in mind,

197
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,600
I will surely

198
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,480
punish him for bribing the courtier.

199
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,150
Yes.

200
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,200
Mr. Liu

201
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,960
who you impeached a few days ago

202
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,120
wanted to visit you.

203
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,670
Refuse him.

204
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,720
Since I’m the new assistant minister
of the Ministry of War,

205
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,080
I will certainly improve morale

206
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,030
without tolerating any concealing
and error.

207
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,270
I asked you to pay attention to

208
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,390
the colleagues’ opinions about me.
How about it?

209
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,750
They all said you are just

210
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,030
without any bias.

211
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,840
You got more and more rave reviews.

212
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:44,120
OK. You may leave.

213
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,120
Yes.

214
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,120
Mr. Du. Concubine De is visiting.

215
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,720
Come on.

216
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,910
Welcome her with me.

217
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,360
Your Grace, please excuse me

218
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,150
for not greeting you

219
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,150
out of the mansion.

220
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,360
I’m the solecist.

221
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,960
Mr. Du, don’t worry.

222
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,270
Your Grace. Please be seated.

223
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,750
You and my brother are close friends.

224
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,790
Now you got a promotion,

225
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,320
it’s a matter of course
for congratulating.

226
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,480
Thank you so much.

227
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,960
I’m a new here.

228
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,480
I might do something wrong.

229
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,600
Thanks to Mr. Pang’s help.

230
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,270
He’s done a lot for me.

231
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,360
Your Grace,

232
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,600
it’s my great honor to see you here.

233
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,000
If it is wrong

234
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,000
depends on what the result is.

235
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,600
Your Grace.

236
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,840
What would you like me to do?

237
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,840
I have a batch of goods.

238
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,080
Would you mind managing them for me?

239
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,840
Your Grace. What are the goods?

240
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,030
Where are they?

241
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,480
A batch of timber.

242
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,630
Hanjiacang Warehouse.

243
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,960
In Eastern Capital Luoyang.

244
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,910
I won’t let you be disappointed.

245
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,750
Great. I didn’t pick the wrong one.

246
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,670
Mr. Du. You are managing the selection
and registry of military officers.

247
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,720
Be cautious while making your decisions.

248
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,810
Know loyal from crooked.

249
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,620
Be close to the kind.

250
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,930
Thank you, Your Grace.

251
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,220
If I do anything bad,

252
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,050
please kindly

253
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,220
remind me and help me to correct.

254
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,570
Then I’m going.

255
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,450
It’s a secret for me to come out today.

256
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,530
See you then.

257
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,100
See you, Your Grace.

258
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:26,870
Hurry.

259
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,840
Keep the jewels from Mr. Zhang

260
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,910
in the west of the city.

261
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,480
Tell him to take it easy.

262
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:33,630
And

263
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,790
ask the Mr. Liu who was dismissed

264
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,790
to the office immediately.

265
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,000
You just said…

266
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,270
Concubine De came so suddenly.

267
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,080
Do you know what it means?

268
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,910
What does that mean?

269
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,030
You blockhead.

270
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,720
It means she has taken me

271
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,960
as her right-hand man.

272
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:56,600
Go, go, go.

273
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,790
Do what I said.

274
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,510
Yes.

275
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,670
Hurry.

276
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,900
= Xishi Market =

277
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,840
= Chonghua Lane =

278
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,270
Miss!

279
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,440
You went to the banquet
of the prime minister’s mansion

280
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,080
without any clue,

281
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,870
but drinking all the time

282
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,480
with the merchants of Qinglong.

283
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,750
In that way, we can get no clue.

284
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,200
The merchants in Chang’an

285
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,320
are all alcoholics.

286
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,720
It’s not that easy.

287
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,870
I found we’ve been followed

288
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,840
every time we came out

289
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,630
after you came back that morning.

290
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,630
There are really a lot.

291
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,790
Didn’t you find a rule

292
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,870
that once we two are alone,

293
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,080
the guys began to follow us?

294
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,960
Nobody follows when our followers and we

295
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,200
are all together.

296
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,480
It’s fine. The old way.

297
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,670
The other side.

298
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,440
= Gamble =
Small. Small. Big. Big.

299
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:57,630
Big. Big. Small. Big. Big. Big.

300
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,620
Small. Big.

301
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,730
This should be Big.

302
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,720
That’s the Jia’ermu nabobess

303
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,600
who won a great number of money

304
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,990
a few days ago, right?

305
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,400
We can follow her

306
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,830
so we will surely make money.

307
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,600
Miss Long, it’s been a while.

308
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,360
Come with me.

309
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:12,960
OK.

310
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,990
Say no more. Just hurry.

311
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,320
Will you play or not?

312
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:17,650
Come on. Let’s continue.

313
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,440
Why is she leaving?

314
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,390
Our master especially asked us

315
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,480
to wait for you. It’s been long.

316
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,840
Me? What’s it?

317
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,120
Since the establishment of Buyu Pavilion,

318
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,150
the owner seldom lost,

319
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,000
particularly as crushingly as last time.

320
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,150
They only think of getting the money

321
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,390
without losing any.

322
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,630
So they feel shameful

323
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,960
and want to defeat me.

324
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,240
Please tell your master

325
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,750
I really have something to deal with.

326
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,600
Only one question,

327
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,670
do you have that kind of guests

328
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,120
who are easily recognized as
from the palace?

329
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,870
What?

330
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,600
Miss Long, you haven’t come
for a long time.

331
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,750
So did you forget the rules here?

332
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,200
You can ask for a question only
after winning.

333
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,120
Then forget it.

334
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,200
Maybe they still haven’t left.

335
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,630
Well, quickly. Take out the needle.

336
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,360
We will change the way today.

337
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,440
Let’s use the simplest way.

338
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,120
Miss, still feel sick?

339
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,840
These days,

340
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,390
you’ve really suffered a lot.

341
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,790
Why do they look at me weirdly?

342
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,960
Do they think I am pregnant?

343
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,240
That’s a good idea.

344
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,440
In this way, I can enter the Palace

345
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,790
with a reasonable excuse.

346
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:55,380
= Prince Jun’s Mansion =

347
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,270
= Right Qianniu Guardian =
We are executing His Majesty’s orders.

348
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:57,960
Make way quickly.

349
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,750
Hold on, sir.

350
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,750
This is Prince Jun’s Mansion.

351
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,480
How can you…

352
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,960
It’s a serious problem, can you bear it

353
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,030
if there is any delay?

354
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:04,480
Go.

355
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,960
This white jade

356
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,390
was originally from Persia.

357
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,550
It goes well with your skin.

358
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,200
So I particularly got it for you.

359
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,600
Thank you.

360
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,200
I was thinking on the way here

361
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,070
that you might dislike these things.

362
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,000
Not that. Thank you.

363
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,000
Prince Jun really

364
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,350
married a good wife.

365
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,640
I’m flattered, Your Grace.

366
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:36,920
Oh yeah.

367
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,590
I also prepared you

368
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,400
the walnut dew.

369
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,720
It’s fresh and sweet

370
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,960
and can make your skin

371
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,310
smoother and ruddier.

372
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:46,960
Yue’er.

373
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,200
Your Grace. Sorry to bother you.

374
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,440
I’m leaving now.

375
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,270
OK.

376
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,240
Anything happened to Prince Jun’s Mansion?

377
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,720
I’m not very sure.

378
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,000
Just now, I heard the carters

379
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,400
discussing in the backyard

380
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,790
that Right Qianniu Guardians

381
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,200
brought Physician Qin
to Prince Jun’s Mansion.

382
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,960
Figure it out right now.

383
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,200
I’d know the details.

384
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,330
Yes.

385
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,580
= Prince Jun’s Mansion =

386
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,880
What is the matter?

387
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:03,960
Miss Du.

388
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,640
Qianniu Guardians by His Majesty’s side

389
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,880
suddenly brought people here.

390
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,270
They entered the right wing

391
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,510
and blocked the gate.

392
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,230
No one is allowed to enter.

393
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,600
I’ve no idea about what happened.

394
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:52,070
Miss, your pulse

395
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,960
is smooth but sometimes not.

396
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,790
Sometimes it’s slippery.

397
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:03,160
Make it simple. What does it mean?

398
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,350
Your pulse is slippery.

399
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,350
That means

400
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,350
you are pregnant. Congrats.

401
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,640
Seriously?

402
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,680
Exactly right.

403
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:29,750
Miss.

404
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:39,920
Qingliu.

405
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,240
Xiaoxian, go back now.

406
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,350
Let’s talk later.

407
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,200
Open the door.

408
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,720
Greetings, Your Highness.

409
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,720
How is she?

410
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,590
I just felt her pulse.

411
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,000
She’s pregnant.

412
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,110
Congrats, Your Highness.

413
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,790
According to her pulse,

414
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,240
she has some retention of food.

415
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,000
From now on,

416
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,270
take medicine
according to my prescription,

417
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,480
she will recover soon.

418
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,350
Thank you.

419
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,480
I will write the prescription.

420
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,590
I’m leaving.

421
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,720
You all may leave now.

422
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,310
Do you…

423
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,550
Such being the case,

424
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,590
feel at ease to stay here.

425
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,400
Take a good rest.

426
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
I’m leaving now.

427
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,350
The special pulse

428
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,550
is really helpful.

429
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,240
Master really knows a lot.

430
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,680
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

431
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,830
I’m leaving now.

432
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:58,640
Qingliu.

433
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,830
Xiaoxian, sorry.

434
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:01,750
It was too urgent just now.

435
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:03,680
It’s fine.

436
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,640
I’ve already known the details.

437
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,830
I just have one question.

438
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,880
Are you sure Long Aoyi

439
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,830
has your baby?

440
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,400
Both you and I know

441
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,640
Long Aoyi isn’t a punctilious person.

442
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,110
She even took brothel

443
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,640
as a domicile.

444
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,590
I’m afraid she didn’t pay much attention

445
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,640
to the matters between men and women.

446
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,750
How can you be sure

447
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,680
the baby

448
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,440
is yours?

449
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,480
After that night,

450
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:40,750
His Majesty arranged

451
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,920
Qianniu Guardians to monitor.

452
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,000
She didn’t do that with any others.

453
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,680
That doesn’t mean she didn’t do that

454
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,640
before.

455
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,550
Xiaoxian.

456
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,000
I know you were thinking of it for me.

457
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,550
But you are

458
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,070
just guessing.

459
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,580
Guessing?

460
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,830
You should have known

461
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,960
the measures of the lower class.

462
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:06,680
The Snake Gang people stole gold threads

463
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,070
and burned the Silk Store last time.

464
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,550
Now it’s a woman

465
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,720
from the same lower class.

466
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,960
Are you sure she won’t

467
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,350
cheat with all kinds of tricks?

468
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,310
Enough!

469
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,240
Xiaoxian.

470
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,000
Miss.

471
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:36,920
Miss.

472
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,440
Your Highness, a messenger came
from the Palace.

473
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,680
His Majesty has an order

474
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,750
to ask Master Long

475
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,550
to go to the Palace for re-check.

476
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,400
You may leave.

477
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,680
It’s confirmed.

478
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,350
She’s pregnant.

479
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,030
We will report it soon.

480
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,050
Here comes His Majesty.

481
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,200
Ridiculous. Ridiculous.

482
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,030
She’s just an ordinary woman.

483
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,590
How can she excuse Her Highness to come?

484
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:14,160
Calm down!

485
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,920
That’s my idea.

486
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,240
If the girl

487
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,160
really has the baby,

488
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,750
it’s a great event of our royal family.

489
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,070
I was eager to confirm it.

490
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,390
Please excuse me.

491
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,550
Come and sit.

492
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,160
Then what is the outcome?

493
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:40,830
Your Majesty,

494
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:41,960
after being confirmed

495
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,030
by several imperial physicians,

496
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,960
it’s confirmed that Miss Long

497
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,240
does have the baby

498
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,750
although she’s sick.

499
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,790
Since she’s pregnant,

500
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,350
let her stay in the Palace.

501
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,590
Your Majesty, it’s improper.

502
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:01,960
Why?

503
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,550
I heard

504
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,160
the girl came to Chang’an

505
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,880
since Prince Jun returned to the capital.

506
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,720
She pretended to be someone from the west

507
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,000
and entered the banquet of the official.

508
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:14,200
Later she bewitched the Prince
and became pregnant.

509
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,590
She’s really planned everything.

510
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,350
Your Grace.

511
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,110
You are really well-in-formed.

512
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,680
So it’s true

513
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,160
everything happened in the Palace

514
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,160
can’t be hidden from you.

515
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,070
Who is she? It sounds familiar.

516
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,480
Of course I should check it out.

517
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,160
She made every plan

518
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,440
and had a finger in the pie.

519
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,480
She doesn’t have pure motive.

520
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,240
Do you mean you want to kill the baby,

521
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,400
Your Grace?

522
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,880
It’s not what I mean.

523
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:39,310
I am...

524
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,080
Shut up.

525
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,000
There haven’t been many babies
borne recently.

526
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,640
If she really can give birth to a boy,

527
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:51,440
it will be a great happy event.

528
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,480
Those borne

529
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:56,310
in recent years are all girls.

530
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,480
If we really can have

531
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,200
a new-borne boy,

532
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,640
it will enlarge our royal family.

533
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,480
Your Highness, you are right.

534
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,200
But I also heard of one thing.

535
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,590
It’s said

536
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,790
Prince Jun was drunk that night.

537
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,790
They stayed in one room.

538
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,590
But they might not sleep together.

539
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,350
You are worrying too much.

540
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,400
It happened.

541
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,350
There is no need to speak of details.

542
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,110
And after all,

543
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,200
it’s me who blackened her name.

544
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,670
Yes.

545
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,440
Your Grace,
what else do you want to hear?

546
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,920
Do you want Long

547
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,440
to speak out Prince Jun’s secrets?

548
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:46,550
For example, the spot at the breast?

549
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,350
The mole at the ham?

550
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,040
It’s my fault.

551
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,570
I’m the wrong one.

552
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,670
Aoyi, get up.

553
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,400
Your Majesty.

554
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,350
It’s a big deal. I dare not cheat.

555
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,960
Except the leopard head mark

556
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,270
at his arm,

557
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,720
Prince Jun has smooth skin

558
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,040
at every part.

559
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,180
No spot.

560
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,550
He does have a light spot

561
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,960
at the breast.

562
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,440
I checked that

563
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,030
it disappeared on the second day.

564
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,110
It might be caused by drinking.

565
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,680
Other than that,

566
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:29,210
Prince Jun is healthy and pure.

567
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,000
All right then.

568
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,790
Since this girl

569
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,110
is pregnant now,

570
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:42,640
take her back to Prince Jun’s Mansion

571
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,750
for nourishing the fetus.

572
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,510
Mentioning the rewards and punishments,

573
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,110
let’s decide it

574
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,070
after she gives birth to the baby.

575
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,240
Thank you, Your Majesty!

576
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,400
Thank you, Father.

577
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,020
= Prince Jun’s Mansion =

578
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,240
His Highness said

579
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,590
you could live

580
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,200
beside Miss Long’s room.

581
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,510
Why did you bring so many things here?

582
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,500
The mansion won’t make you

583
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,930
and Miss Long be short of food.

584
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,680
Miss is pregnant now.

585
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,790
It’s normal to eat a lot.

586
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,590
Normal?

587
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,680
Eat so much at night?

588
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,240
Aren’t you afraid of retention of food?

589
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:34,790
Alright.

590
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:35,960
Just go for your own business.

591
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,400
Come on. Just leave.

592
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,050
Give it to me.

593
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,790
You have taken a lot.

594
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,480
How about you stop eating?

595
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,830
No way.

596
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,440
It still needs several days.

597
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,270
Otherwise, if they check suddenly,

598
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,480
it’ll be found.

599
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,590
I am afraid

600
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,640
you can’t bear it

601
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,000
if you keep eating like this.

602
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,680
If you got sick,

603
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:16,880
any kind of plan

604
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,000
will be useless.

605
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,000
Oh, God.

606
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,440
I’ve taken five bowls of noodles.

607
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,480
It should be enough.

608
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,680
Let’s continue tomorrow morning.

609
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,510
The way of pretending to be pregnant

610
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,640
by combining retention and musk pills

611
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,070
is an idea of Master.

612
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,480
Only if the retention of food remains,

613
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,000
nobody can get anything on me.

614
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,590
Feng even thought of this method

615
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,550
to help the girl

616
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,830
of Wuyun Pavilion marry her beloved.

617
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:40,590
It’s very useful.

618
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,550
Even the imperial physicians
didn’t find it.

619
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,920
But it’s harmful to your health.

620
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,550
And

621
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,640
using this kind of way

622
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,510
ruined your fame.

623
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,480
Fame is always

624
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,830
talked by others.

625
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,110
But it won’t help us to take revenge.

626
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,590
The most important thing

627
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,160
is entering the Palace
to find out the murderer.

628
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:17,510
Nice to see you, Your Grace.

629
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:20,400
Mr. Du, what brought you here?

630
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,200
I heard you don’t feel well recently.

631
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,920
The Chinese chestnut is good for

632
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,000
your health.

633
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,200
Your Grace.

634
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:38,830
Below the chestnut,

635
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,680
I also put some

636
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,200
gold fruits by water.

637
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,830
Your Grace, please have a taste.

638
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,640
Seems the business

639
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,590
are very smooth.

640
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:53,740
Yes.

641
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:54,480
Rise.

642
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,070
Thank you, Your Grace.

643
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,750
Thank you for your promotion.

644
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:05,070
I’m still worrying about one thing.

645
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,720
Please say it.

646
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,790
It’s my daughter.

647
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,830
She’s been appointed to marry Prince Jun.

648
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,400
But the girl surnamed Long

649
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,680
now moves into Prince Jun’s Mansion.

650
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,920
If she gives birth to a boy earlier,

651
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,510
I’m afraid it will be hard

652
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,960
for my daughter in the future.

653
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,960
You are worrying too much.

654
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,640
Let alone the princes,

655
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:29,070
even normal nobilities in Chang’an,

656
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,590
all have many concubines.

657
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,960
It’s normal to have a girl
before marrying.

658
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:34,720
Yes.

659
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,510
Miss Du has been appointed
as the Princess.

660
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,590
After ancestor worship,

661
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,440
she will become the expectant Princess.

662
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,000
With your words,

663
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,400
I’m feeling at ease.

664
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,070
You may leave now.

665
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:49,960
Tell your daughter.

666
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,880
Don’t be in haste.

667
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:57,240
Yes. I’m leaving now.

668
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:06,240
Long Aoyi is pregnant.
Zhao can give up now.

669
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,740
= Tianxian Restaurant =

670
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,960
Some more.

671
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,230
Hurry.

672
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,270
Please wait.

673
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,840
I’m taking it for you.

674
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,750
All girls beside you

675
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,150
are the top ones

676
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:26,880
in Chang’an.

677
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:27,710
Go away!

678
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:30,180
You can watch any kind of performance.

679
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:31,750
All right.

680
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,340
You tell me

681
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,470
who can gamble.

682
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:37,000
What?

683
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:41,430
Girls here always learn
the elegant things.

684
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,910
Right.

685
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:58,910
Who can weave animals with grass?

686
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:02,830
You are the Prince.

687
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,790
This is for you.

688
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:16,040
Who can disguise herself as a man?

689
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,920
You don’t need to come purposely.

690
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,860
I’ll wait for you in Silver City

691
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,240
after finishing my business in Chang’an.

692
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,000
Come on.

693
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,300
Aoyi.

694
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,390
Aoyi.

695
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,120
Why?

696
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,200
We are Aoyi.

697
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,200
You are not qualified.

698
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,430
You are not qualified.

699
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,640
I will smash the building.

700
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:55,960
Listen.

701
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:59,600
There is only one Long Aoyi in the world.

702
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:04,060
= Prince Jun’s Mansion =

703
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:07,930
Chunlan.

704
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:13,390
What is it?

705
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,270
This is Miss Long’s breakfast.

706
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,910
Braised upper part of a leg
of pork this early?

707
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,600
Your Highness, please calm down.

708
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,600
Miss Long asked for it herself.

709
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,380
Change it into sliced fish congee.

710
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,020
No oily food

711
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,540
in daily meals.

712
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:31,330
Yes.

713
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:32,610
Is it good?

714
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,370
Take it easy.

715
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,200
It’s all yours.

716
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,060
Listen.

717
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:38,610
That guy is really tricking me.

718
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:39,980
Porridge every day.

719
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,650
Without your help,

720
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,250
maybe I can’t be full,

721
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,650
let alone retention of food.

722
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:45,540
Rest assured.

723
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,580
These are all yours.

724
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:47,330
Also here is your favorite

725
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,170
spiced pork shoulder.

726
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:49,940
Delicious.

727
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:50,650
Eat more.

728
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:56,860
What for today?

729
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,500
Porridge with vegetables.

730
00:38:58,980 --> 00:38:59,650
Finished?

731
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,210
She said she disliked it.

732
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,770
But she finished them all

733
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,690
every time.

734
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:07,610
That’s good.

735
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,420
Your Highness.

736
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:32,610
Only porridge in the morning.

737
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:33,500
Soups at noon.

738
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,650
Finally there is some meat in the evening,

739
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:35,650
but it’s saltless.

740
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:36,650
How could I endure it?

741
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,810
It’s the medicative diet.

742
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:42,330
Good for your health.

743
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:44,940
Living here

744
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,020
is very boring.

745
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,100
But now I have to take

746
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,810
these boring food.

747
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:48,860
Are you killing me?

748
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,770
You said you are here to divert me

749
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,770
but actually to bring more boredom, right?

750
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:40,730
Physician Qin said

751
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,380
you need to listen to music more.

752
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:43,610
It’s good to promote

753
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,690
the intelligence development for the baby.

754
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,540
Did he say

755
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,170
listening to this kind of slow music

756
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:50,020
will let me,

757
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,900
a pregnant woman, be crazy?

758
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,250
If I knew it early,

759
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,380
I’d choose to sleep.

760
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,860
How about bringing me into the Palace?

761
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:02,580
I heard everything there is the top.

762
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,170
You hated the complicated things

763
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,380
before, right?

764
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:07,980
Moreover,

765
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:09,650
the prince’s family

766
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,020
can’t go without being called.

767
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,610
You can go after being conferred.

768
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:16,130
Now the musicians are already here.

769
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:17,860
Just enjoy it.

770
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:30,330
I know some place

771
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,860
