= Overlord =

31
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,820
= Episode 6 =

32
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,360
Why do you bring me here?

33
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,840
Say it.

34
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,120
Let me ask you,

35
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,590
if you kick the wall,

36
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,470
your foot should point up, right?

37
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,870
Why does this footprint

38
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,240
point down?

39
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,360
What do you want to say?

40
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,150
You mean

41
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,080
the thief climbed down the wall
to steal the gold thread?

42
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,240
The gold thread was lost at the dock,

43
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,630
not in the warehouse.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,630
I thought you were smart enough.

45
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,910
Didn’t you tell me

46
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,630
these supervisors know

47
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,590
part of the information
of the gold thread?

48
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,080
Have you ever thought about that

49
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,240
there might be a mole?

50
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,400
Master Long

51
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,840
Do you think I spent
the ten thousand taels

52
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,030
for nothing?

53
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,800
We never allow

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,590
outsiders to stay overnight.

55
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,280
Why did we invite you in?

56
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,910
You use me to find out the mole!

57
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,030
I might alert the mole

58
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,470
if I investigate it myself.

59
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,960
Besides

60
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,430
I paid you to do it.
I won’t say it’s using.

61
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,590
It’s your mole,

62
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,360
why do you get me
and Longzhu Gang involved?

63
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,080
It’s not like it has nothing to do

64
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,840
with Longzhu Gang.

65
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,030
Tell me

66
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,520
what do you think about

67
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,630
the footprints and the mole.

68
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,360
Profiteer.

69
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,190
Put your arm around my ear.

70
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,280
What do you want to do?

71
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,480
Have a try, it’s the key.

72
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,630
Stop the nonsense!

73
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,950
Come on.

74
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,390
Don’t act like a girl.

75
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,390
Hurry up.

76
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,190
Get closer.

77
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,360
Why are you sweating? Is it hot?

78
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,040
Don’t talk to my ears. It’s itchy!

79
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,480
What does this have to do with the mole?

80
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,830
What are you thinking about?

81
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,560
That’s the reason

82
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,240
why the footprint points down!

83
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,600
What were they doing?

84
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,070
They were doing what lovers can do.

85
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,240
What lovers can do?

86
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,310
What does that have anything
to do with the mole?

87
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,870
I ask you to investigate the mole,

88
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,270
not to gossip!

89
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,750
The three supervisors only know
part of the information.

90
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,040
What if they collude?

91
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,510
They will put the information together.

92
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:33,920
Understand?

93
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,800
Li Jun’er must have a lover.

94
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,720
And they often meet in this warehouse.

95
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:39,870
This is the evidence.

96
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,800
Who is that lover?

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,310
Now it’s your task.

98
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,510
My task?

99
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,870
Do you think it’s me?

100
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,270
Why do you act like an idiot

101
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,390
when it comes to relationship?

102
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,600
Think about it by yourself!

103
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:39,870
Hurry up.

104
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,680
Put the boxes at the door.

105
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,630
Yes.

106
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,070
Come on.

107
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,310
Wait for me!

108
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,120
The perfume you sprayed on Li Jun’er

109
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,270
is the same as the smell of Shuisheng.

110
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,310
How can you be sure that

111
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,070
he got the smell from her?

112
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,560
This is Wuyun Pavilion’s
special Sugu Fragrance.

113
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,560
No one else in Silver City can make it.

114
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,310
Listen to this gaudy name.

115
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,830
I know it’s not something good.

116
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,000
Focus on investigating Shuisheng.

117
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,270
There is still one of
the three informed supervisors

118
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,680
not being investigated yet.

119
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,160
Qi Zheng?

120
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,680
Is it not enough that Li Jun’er
has the key to the warehouse

121
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,560
and Shuisheng knows the time?

122
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:07,870
Have you forgot that

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,430
neither of these two supervisors
knows the unloading place?

124
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,360
The information is not complete yet.

125
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,270
If the entire of your management
is under suspicion,

126
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,680
your place would be turned upside down.

127
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,870
Don’t forget to pay me then.

128
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,480
I am going to investigate.

129
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,450
Let’s check over there.

130
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,740
= Wanhua =

131
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,870
Your Highness.

132
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,540
= Wanhua =

133
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,440
Take care!

134
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:10,670
Your Highness.

135
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,390
Would Bai become desperate

136
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,200
and come to gamble again?

137
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,320
He has lost all his money.

138
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,320
Now he needs to raise money.

139
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,120
This place should be his stronghold.

140
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:22,960
Well,

141
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,360
how about we abduct the owner

142
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,270
and interrogate him?

143
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,080
It’s too early.

144
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,390
Let’s not alert them.

145
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,720
Shh.

146
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,120
Your Highness.

147
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,390
It’s the owner of Qingping Winery.

148
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,720
Here comes the prey. Get him.

149
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,120
Yes.

150
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,200
Don’t talk.

151
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:47,670
Sit down!

152
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,000
Don’t make any noise.

153
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,240
Just answer my question.

154
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,960
Got it?

155
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,030
Is Executive Bai next door?

156
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,270
Why did you go to see him?

157
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,440
We are good friends.

158
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,960
Sometimes we have a drink here.

159
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,960
Still lying?

160
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,510
Say it!

161
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,260
= Zhao =

162
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,030
According to Tang’s law,

163
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,720
whoever evades taxes

164
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,030
would face property confiscation

165
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,480
and seventy floggings.

166
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,910
And garrison the border for three years.

167
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,790
Why did you collude with the tax officer?

168
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,000
Master, mercy!

169
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:26,200
Mr. Bai asks for bribery with his power.

170
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,550
He lost money at the casino today.

171
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:32,360
So he asked each merchant
for one thousand taels.

172
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,360
Master, please do justice for us!

173
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,360
Tell me,

174
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,720
have you kept accounts about the money?

175
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,240
Yes, every account.

176
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,780
= 200 Taels =

177
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,510
Executive Bai

178
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,270
How much money have you gathered?

179
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,240
Who let you in? Get out!

180
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,320
Come on!

181
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,360
Take him down!

182
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,510
Well...

183
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:12,930
Well...

184
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,440
Mr. Magistrate.

185
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,350
Mr. Magistrate.

186
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,670
Your Highness.

187
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,150
For the black sheep like him,

188
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,870
I have got the evidence
to prove him guilty.

189
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:22,910
Bai Xiaoshan!

190
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,120
As the officer of Salt and Iron Bureau,

191
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,240
you deliberately break the law

192
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,630
and take advantage of the tax revenue

193
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,750
to enrich yourself!

194
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,270
Do you admit your crime?

195
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,630
Take him down!

196
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,840
- Lord, I...
- Let’s go!

197
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,000
Lord, listen to me, Lord!

198
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,630
Your Highness.

199
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,840
I still have official affairs to deal with.
Sorry that I can’t keep you company.

200
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,720
Good day.

201
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,600
Take care.

202
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,000
Your Highness.

203
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,120
This is not right.

204
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,840
= Wuyun Pavilion =

205
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,150
I didn’t expect this handsome man

206
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,270
to be Prince Zhao.

207
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,720
However,

208
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,620
I bit his chin.

209
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,320
I even served

210
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,080
the prince that up close!

211
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,240
It will bring honor and glory
to my ancestors.

212
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,440
I have to write it into my genealogy!

213
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,750
Haven’t you two met any man?

214
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,630
One bit his chin.

215
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,870
One scratched him.

216
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,440
Listen, if I didn’t show up in time,

217
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,750
were you going to murder the prince?

218
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,360
Then Wuyun Pavilion

219
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,510
has to be shut down!

220
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,750
Feng.

221
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,440
I’m fine.

222
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,550
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

223
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,550
Don’t lose your composure.

224
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,000
Compared to the girls in Chang’an,

225
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,910
you two are really

226
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,750
more enthusiastic.

227
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,030
Luckily Your Highness won’t blame us.

228
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,240
You two make me angry.

229
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,480
Just go to work.

230
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,670
I can’t drive you away now?

231
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,360
Your Highness.

232
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,750
You must be here to look for Ms. Long.

233
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,670
Unfortunately,

234
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,440
she went to Xinsilu.

235
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,720
I’m afraid

236
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,270
she won’t be back for a while.

237
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,720
Xinsilu? It’s Li Qingliu again.

238
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,150
Why did Ms. Long go to Xinsilu?

239
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,870
She seemed to go there

240
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,550
for gold or silver thread.

241
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:19,670
Your Highness.
Since Ms. Long is not here,

242
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,030
and you are very busy,

243
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,360
why don’t you go back first?

244
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,640
Go away!

245
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,370
Go away!

246
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,670
Ermao.

247
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
- Ermao.
- Go away.

248
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,030
Go home with me, okay?

249
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:00,790
Catch the chicken for me, hurry up!

250
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,240
Don’t run!

251
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,270
Ermao!

252
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:04,720
Don’t run!

253
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,630
Over there!

254
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:07,900
Over there!

255
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,030
- Come here, Ermao.
- Hurry!

256
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:10,750
That way!

257
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,030
Over there!

258
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,910
Where?

259
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,670
I got you.

260
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,200
Thank you.

261
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,360
Sorry for that.

262
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,600
Look how sweet it is. It falls asleep.

263
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,240
What are you doing?

264
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,320
Go to work. Hurry up.

265
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:39,850
Hurry up.

266
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,320
It’s my chicken.

267
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,510
But I didn’t release it.

268
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,840
You can punish me as you want.

269
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,270
I’ll keep

270
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,750
this account for you now.

271
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,150
What are you doing?

272
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,440
It should be six strands of thread.

273
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,600
You only twisted five strands.

274
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,080
This kind of defective product

275
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,790
will ruin the reputation
of our Silk Manor.

276
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,150
Get up.

277
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,120
Thank you.

278
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,480
Time can brew wine,

279
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:46,670
brew people,

280
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,960
and brew fine products.

281
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,790
Our weavers devote sixty days

282
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,030
to weave only a batch of silk

283
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,440
with exquisite patterns
and amorous feelings.

284
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,240
Although silk is worth thousands of taels,

285
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,670
isn’t time

286
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,240
more precious?

287
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,080
Shouldn’t you cherish the time more?

288
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,160
Why does he have such a bad temper today?

289
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,680
He met something tricky today.

290
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,790
Such a good piece of cloth is wasted.

291
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,480
Look at what it is.

292
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,160
Look at the pig.

293
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,350
Does it look like Li Qingliu?

294
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,830
Are you happy now?

295
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,160
He is the pig.

296
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,550
Just ignore him.

297
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:43,480
Be happy.

298
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,070
It’s been some time
since I came to the Silver City

299
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,920
= Du’s Mansion =
as the Salt and Iron Bureau Officer.

300
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,350
I noticed that there are
some hidden rules that need to be changed.

301
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,400
I heard from Commissioner Du that

302
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,270
the guild leaders

303
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,160
led from the front

304
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,200
and made a lot of contributions
to the government these years.

305
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,310
But there is no making without breaking.

306
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,270
Why don’t we take turns

307
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,160
and let those who join the guild later

308
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,920
become the leader

309
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,000
and experience it.

310
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,400
Otherwise, people will say

311
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,400
the leader has more privileges

312
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,680
and the government
treats the leader better.

313
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,960
Your Highness are right.

314
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,160
The guild leader has enjoyed
many graces from the government.

315
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,070
We all want to enjoy the grace.

316
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,270
Good.

317
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,830
Since we are going to implement new rules

318
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,160
and establish new trends,

319
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,830
those who

320
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,310
accept the government investment
in the next year

321
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,200
will be first considered to be the leader.

322
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,590
I have doubts.

323
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,750
I think

324
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,310
my Silk Manor

325
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,110
and other merchants in the silk guild

326
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,590
don’t need the government investment
at the moment.

327
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,350
The grace of the government

328
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,640
should be given to

329
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,590
those who are in need,

330
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,350
which will better show

331
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,350
the grace of His Majesty to the merchants.

332
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,350
The price of manpower is rising.

333
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,400
We will take the government investment

334
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,350
in the next year.

335
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,200
We will also take the government
investment in the next year.

336
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,440
Yeah.

337
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,640
That’s right.

338
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:45,590
Business is about righteousness
since ancient times.

339
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,310
Those who pick up the bowl and eat meat,

340
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,030
put down the chopsticks and start to swear

341
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,350
are not allowed by the government.

342
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,720
Those who reject the government investment

343
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,750
would lose the righteousness
of doing business.

344
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,750
Therefore he has no right

345
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,400
to be the guild leader.

346
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,550
I know you are anxious.

347
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,070
But the government investment

348
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,720
is a task assigned by the government.

349
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,000
We have no other choice.

350
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,350
It’s like a hot potato.

351
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,270
In fact,

352
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,830
we have to wait for our master.

353
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,880
Wait a moment.

354
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,070
What “instrument” were you talking about?

355
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,750
Government investment

356
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,070
is a loan from the government
lent to merchants as equity participation.

357
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,880
After the merchant makes money,

358
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,350
the government would
take some of the profit.

359
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,240
Isn’t that good to get money?

360
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,640
Why are you all frowning?

361
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,310
This is one of the methods
that the government

362
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,200
uses to control merchants.

363
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,000
Once they accept the money,

364
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,790
there will be many things

365
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,200
that merchants can’t decide on their own.

366
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,000
Let me give you an example.

367
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,240
You want to build a house,

368
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,510
and I give you some beams.

369
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,880
When you have an autumn harvest,

370
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,510
I’m going to take some of your harvest.

371
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,200
Or,

372
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,720
I will not only punish you
to do corvee labor

373
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,400
but also take away
the beams of your house.

374
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,240
Isn’t it just like a butcher

375
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,750
killing the caw and sheep?

376
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,640
Tighten the rope little by little,

377
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,510
when the animals realize the danger,

378
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,880
it’s already too late to run away.

379
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,200
There is no free lunch in life.

380
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,110
If they need money,

381
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,030
just borrow from your master.

382
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,040
He is rich.

383
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,480
No...

384
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,590
Just sweep the floor.

385
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,680
Don’t chat.

386
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,830
Landlord.

387
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,200
You are here to sweep the floor,

388
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,750
not to gossip.

389
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,440
Instead of worrying about it,

390
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,200
you should find clues of the gold thread.

391
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,480
Don’t think the 10,000 taels

392
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,270
is that easy to earn.

393
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,750
You are using this to suppress me again.

394
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,590
I don’t care if it’s 10,000 or 20,000,

395
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,830
if you push me too far, I will quit!

396
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,350
Does money mean everything?

397
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,000
It’s easy for you to say it.

398
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,790
The price of yarn rose by 40 percent.

399
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,480
The price of leather doubled.

400
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,110
Brocade is completely out of stock.

401
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,310
The owners of these three businesses

402
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,680
changed their sides too quickly.

403
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,110
Other silk stores bought the goods

404
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:08,550
with a lower price than us.

405
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,880
They are against us.

406
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,440
If we keep producing in this speed,

407
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,720
there will only be two results.

408
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,750
We will lose money

409
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,720
and our stock will run out in two weeks.

410
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,200
What about

411
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,830
we offer a higher price?

412
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,160
How much higher?

413
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,030
Haven’t your realized that

414
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,070
they are coming after me?

415
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,350
I’m afraid no matter how much we offer,

416
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,480
no one would dare to sell goods to us.

417
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,030
Don’t you have other choices?

418
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,550
You have so much money.

419
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,350
Can’t you spend it in other places?

420
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,640
You don’t need to worry about it.

421
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,550
Do you want us

422
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,920
to search for the supply

423
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,720
all over the world?

424
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,880
Why not?

425
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,510
Qingliu.

426
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,200
We are being restricted everywhere.

427
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:19,720
Where should we get the supply?

428
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,680
I will

429
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,510
ask Father and Prince Zhao

430
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,920
to give us a way out.

431
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,680
You should also bow down a little bit.

432
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,110
Don’t be up against the storm.

433
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,200
The knife is on my neck,

434
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,600
if I bow down, wouldn’t I be slashed?

435
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:34,960
Qingliu.

436
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,790
Master Long, you stay.

437
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,590
The rest of you can leave now.

438
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,400
What can I do for you?

439
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,160
Could you please

440
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,960
use your network in the lower class

441
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:04,350
to contact the raw material suppliers
of yarn and cotton in Jiangnan

442
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,590
and ask about the price?

443
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,790
I stay here

444
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,720
for 10,000 taels.

445
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,920
What network do I have?

446
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,790
There are thousands of workers
in the Silk Manor.

447
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,270
Most of them are weavers and embroiders.

448
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,030
They are breadwinners of the family.

449
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,920
Have you ever thought about that

450
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,640
if I cut out their work,

451
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,400
what would happen to these people?

452
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,680
You are prodding me.

453
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,680
Give me the list!

454
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,400
Yan Bin!

455
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,590
Choose a good day,

456
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,310
I want to host a horse race
to entertain the guest.

457
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,310
Got it!

458
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,720
This is the list of
raw material suppliers in Jiangnan.

459
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,640
Contact them right now
and ask for the price.

460
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,980
= Suppliers in Jiangnan =

461
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,900
= Dyeing cloth Chiffon Cow leather =

462
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,030
This horrible handwriting

463
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,410
is unbearable.

464
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,650
Unbearable

465
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,350
Give it to me!

466
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,200
Make a list

467
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,030
of the merchants who offered a price.

468
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,480
Invite them to

469
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,440
the horse race of Silk Manor

470
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,960
on the day of the Crown Prince’s
Coming of Age Ceremony.

471
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,480
Use pigeon post.

472
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,070
Use pigeon post.

473
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,480
Miss.

474
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,720
You are here.

475
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:15,720
Take it.

476
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,560
There are more.

477
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,750
Miss.

478
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:23,880
Well,

479
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,710
what’s with

480
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,270
the couple of lovers in the warehouse?

481
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,160
You are only interested in gossip.

482
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,920
Am I here to investigate
their love affair?

483
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,790
Just tell me about it.

484
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,510
First of all,

485
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,200
Li Jun’er has the key to
the box of the gold thread,

486
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,440
which puts her under suspicion.

487
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,000
When they got the gold thread,

488
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,070
Li Jun’er had been waiting in Silk Manor.

489
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,000
She couldn’t steal it directly.

490
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,640
If she colluded with Shuisheng,

491
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,070
the two of them work from inside
and outside respectively,

492
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,550
it would be much easier
to steal the gold thread.

493
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:52,750
Well,

494
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,310
just tell it to Li Qingliu

495
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,680
and let him investigate it himself.

496
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,960
Let’s take the bounty

497
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,110
and live a free and unfettered life.

498
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,720
Not yet.

499
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,510
We don’t have positive evidence.

500
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,880
It would come off embarrassing
if we act rashly.

501
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,440
Now the Silk Manor is busy with

502
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,590
preparing for the

503
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,550
horse and archery race.

504
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,920
It is said

505
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,830
there will be a bunch of
businessmen from Jiangnan.

506
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,830
If Shuisheng stole the gold thread,

507
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:14,640
the horse race would be

508
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,350
his best chance to sell the gold thread.

509
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,160
I have to keep an eye on him.

510
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,920
All right, I need to go back now.

511
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,510
Miss, be careful
when you go to the horse race.

512
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,830
Okay, go back now.

513
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,270
Be careful!

514
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,920
The leather guild took 20,000 taels.

515
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,270
The yarn guild took 30,000 taels.

516
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,960
The woven cotton guild
also took 20,000 taels.

517
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:39,750
Master...

518
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,640
Bastard!

519
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,720
What things that His Highness can’t hear?

520
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,270
Your Highness, Mr. Du.

521
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,640
Li Qingliu

522
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,640
is making a big move in Silver City.

523
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,720
He invited all the raw material suppliers
from Jiangnan.

524
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:58,960
It’s said

525
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,350
he is going to hold
a horse and archery race

526
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,400
on the day of the Crown Prince’s
Coming of Age Ceremony.

527
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:05,600
Well.

528
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,640
Look.

529
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,310
He is reaching out his hands.

530
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,400
We can make some trouble

531
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,680
at the horse race

532
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,200
and make him shoot his own feet.

533
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,550
The royal family

534
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,510
doesn’t use dirty move!

535
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,550
Your Highness are right.

536
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:31,310
Then let’s wait and watch.

537
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,440
Please, Your Highness.

538
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,580
= Horse Race =

539
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:06,920
Master Li.

540
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,440
Miss Du.

541
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,110
Mr. Shen, long time no see.

542
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,480
Long time no see.

543
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,590
Mr. Shen, please have a seat there.

544
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:16,750
Okay.

545
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,960
Although Mr. Shen is from Shanxi,

546
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,590
he is the largest silk merchant
in Jiangnan now.

547
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,350
Mr. Shen, I’ve long heard your name.

548
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,640
- Long time no see.
- Long time no see.

549
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,240
I must win him over today.

550
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,880
- Mr. Li.
- Long time no see.

551
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,550
- Long time no see.
- Have a seat.

552
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,790
Shuisheng, if I don’t keep an eye on you,

553
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,680
isn’t it like letting the tiger
go back to the mountain?

554
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,240
Everyone!

555
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,070
Everyone!

556
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,790
The horse race and archery today

557
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,110
has the same rules as usual.

558
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,350
The difficulty increases with

559
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,110
the size of the dough.

560
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:00,270
No matter which dough you get,

561
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:03,310
Master Li from Xinsilu
has prepared a reward for you.

562
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,200
Whoever shoots the small
rabbit-shaped pink ball in the field

563
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,830
will be rewarded with a mystery prize!

564
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:12,000
I declare the game starts now!

565
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:15,450
Please.

566
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,590
Bravo!

- Bravo!
- Nice!

568
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:36,820
Well done!

569
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,640
Not good.

570
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,140
So close.

571
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,440
Be careful.

572
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,270
Please.

573
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,880
- Nice!
- Well done!

574
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,110
Mr. Zhang from Jiangsu
and Zhejiang is excellent.

575
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,680
You are flattering me.

576
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:14,850
Bravo!

577
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,480
Let’s sign now.

578
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,510
Sir.

579
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,120
Well.

Please take care of

582
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,440
Fulin of Mr. Dong and Mr. Lin.

583
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,200
The merchants of Zhejiang and Sichuan
were never on good terms before.

584
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,310
Today,

585
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,920
Master Li holds such a grand event.

586
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,110
Let’s cast aside the previous enmity.

587
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,110
We will be family

588
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,790
from today.

589
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,070
Good!

590
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,920
Nice!

591
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,740
- Master Li.
- Bravo!

592
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:07,220
This time Xinsilu offered a high price.

593
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,200
Very good.

594
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,030
Exactly.

595
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,310
One should know when to stop.
I’ll sign it.

596
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,440
Mr. Shen.

597
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,550
Put it here.

598
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,110
Be careful.

599
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,240
Please.

600
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:36,790
Be safe.

601
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,550
Master Long?

602
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:46,160
Are you going to take part in the race?

603
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,640
No, I just take a look at the horse.

604
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,400
Why are you so tiny?

605
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,440
So adorable.

606
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,720
Come on, have more.

607
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,680
You dare to be up against Miss Du,

608
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,350
let me teach you a lesson today.

609
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,200
Master Long.

610
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,880
Since you want to have a try,

611
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,960
why don’t you ride this big horse?

612
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,160
Is this too big for me?

613
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,270
Master Long, please.

614
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:37,510
Please.

615
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:42,790
My god!

616
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:44,680
Slow down!

617
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,400
Isn’t that Master Long
from the dock of Silver City?

618
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,000
Stop!

619
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,110
I want to stop!

620
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,600
Is she all right?

621
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:06,840
It seems serious.

622
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,030
What should we do?

623
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,200
This is a

624
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,240
funny show arranged by Master Li, right?

625
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,920
They tried hard.
Why does Master Long help him that much?

626
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,230
Master Long lives in the Silk Manor now.

627
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,760
They might get married in the future.

628
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,960
Please go back to your seat, everyone.

629
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,030
Please.

630
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:34,800
Come on.

631
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,670
Master Long.

632
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,280
How are you? Are you all right?

633
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,280
You will see.

634
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,230
Come here, sit down.

635
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,000
Be careful.

636
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,710
You seem

637
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,320
to be stylish

638
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,230
and carefree.

639
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,150
I didn’t expect you to be so caring

640
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,880
and live such an exquisite life.

641
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:14,920
Listen.

642
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,880
I live in Wuyun Pavilion

643
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,920
and hang out with those girls every day,

644
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,000
but I always forget

645
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,440
to use any perfume or powder.

646
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:24,030
But the odor of you that day

647
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:24,800
was very peculiar.

648
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,510
What do you mean?

649
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,190
I am a man.

650
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,590
How would I wear perfume?

651
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,920
Since you didn’t use it,

652
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,710
then it must be Li Jun’er who used it.

653
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:36,550
You...

654
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,840
You are smearing me!

655
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,440
Don’t panic.

656
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,550
If I don’t have positive evidence,

657
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,630
how can I be so sure?

658
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,360
Don’t think I didn’t notice that

659
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,550
you two were cheating in the warehouse.

660
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,440
Li Jun’er knows the delivery time.

661
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,150
You know the supply list.

662
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,870
Qi Zheng is dating with Chubby.

663
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,110
You hid it for him,

664
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,360
so you might know the location.

665
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,000
In this case,

666
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,440
you are most suspected of
stealing the gold thread.

667
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:18,880
Master.

668
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,630
Several merchants refused to sign.

669
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,760
Shen Yiguan is the first one.

670
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,650
Okay.

671
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,880
Let’s meet him.

672
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:40,680
I came to the Silk Manor

673
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,480
to win the bounty

674
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,480
of Li Qingliu.

675
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,200
It’s 8,000 taels.

676
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,520
If you tell me

677
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,120
where the gold thread is,

678
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,120
I will give you half of it.

679
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,120
Then we can secretly

680
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,120
give back the gold thread to the owner.

681
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,130
It’s hard for you to sell it anyway.

682
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,500
No one dare to buy it now.

683
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:00,460
What do you think?

684
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:04,290
You are looking down on me.

685
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,100
Master Li has been treating me well.

686
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,730
He let me take charge of the selling.

687
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,500
If I want to enrich myself,

688
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:13,650
it would be more than 10,000 taels

689
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:14,380
he promised you.

690
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,060
Jun’er and I do have an affair.

691
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,170
But we are both single.

692
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,460
We are not cheating.

693
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:25,610
If you think

694
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:27,250
I stole the gold thread

695
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:28,900
because we know part of the information,

696
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:31,060
you can tie me up and
send me to the government.

697
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,330
I know how they torture people

698
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,500
in the prison of Silver City.

699
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,250
I would never ruin my future

700
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,650
just for the gold thread.

701
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:52,580
Mr. Shen.

702
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:55,520
Where did I not entertain you well?

703
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,790
You sincerely

704
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:01,480
invited me to such a good place.

705
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,230
It’s just

706
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,000
after I got here,

707
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,350
I found there is something wrong.

708
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,960
What’s wrong? Mr. Shen, you can tell me.

709
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,600
You never

710
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,000
raised the price before.

711
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,560
Even when we delivered the goods
to your place and sell on credit,

712
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,230
you might not take it.

713
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,270
But when I came to Silver City this time,

714
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,830
I found the entire Silver City,

715
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,640
from the special envoy of the capital
to the commissioner in Silver City,

716
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,350
are all isolating you.

717
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,530
What if we offer the supply to you

718
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,970
and the government intervenes?

719
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,900
What would we do then?

720
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:40,490
What would you do?

721
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,280
You are being too serious.

722
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,990
Our business is more than silk.

723
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,830
If anything happens as you said,

724
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,600
we still have an industrial pledge.

725
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,120
I’m a rough fellow,

726
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,990
I know nothing about the pledge.

727
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,350
What I care about is your sincerity.

728
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,390
Not gimmicks like horse race.

729
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,240
I heard that

730
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:16,560
Mr. Shen is addicted to gambling.

731
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:20,240
We can spend some money to win him over.

732
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:24,350
Arrange a gambling game.

733
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:27,950
I wonder

734
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,600
what is not a gimmick for you?

735
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,680
How about

736
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,280
we get up a game and have some fun?

737
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,280
You are straightforward.

738
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,240
Then let’s have some fun.

739
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:40,560
Please.

740
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,910
Are you more familiar with cards or dice?

741
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:48,990
I never played cards before.

742
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:51,430
But to show my sincerity today,

743
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,280
I’ll listen to you.

744
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,120
You make a bet and I’ll follow.

745
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,190
Good.

746
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,840
In that case,

747
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,400
let’s not be petty

748
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,360
and guess round.

749
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,800
What about guessing the side of the coin?

750
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,110
Take a coin.

751
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,360
You and I each pick one side.

752
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,150
Drop the coin vertically into the water.

753
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,480
The person whose side faces up

754
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,630
when the coin
falls to the bottom will win.

755
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:19,000
That’s fair.

756
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,360
Go away.

757
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:33,030
May I ask this is...

758
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,230
Chief of Longzhu Gang, Long Aoyi.

759
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,400
Right now I am the
personal maid of Master Li.

760
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,800
My job is sweeping the floor.

761
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:40,880
Sorry for making you laugh.

762
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,670
Interesting. Interesting.

763
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,230
They have a study partner.

764
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,440
Master Li has a gambling partner.

765
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:49,760
That’s good.

766
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,230
