Du Changfeng, no kidding me!

Two of three witnesses have no evidences.

37
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,380
You want to sentence a person to death

by word of mouth.

39
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,010
You are just a prisoner

and you have no right to argue.

41
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,130
The world is in chaos today

42
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,730
right because of evil people like you.

43
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,340
You are just a big old liar.

44

From now on,

45
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,930
seal up Xinsilu right away
and take back its

46

foreign trade channels and Customs Seal

This is your real purpose, isn’t it?

Don’t wait any longer.

Decapitate these two people

51
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,420
right away.

00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,130
Let go of me.

00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:56,770
Let go of me.

54
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:57,300
Du Changfeng,

55
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:57,700
let go of me.

56
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,740
Stop it!

= Order =

58
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,380
Second Master.

59
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,170
I am former royal guard commandant
Lyu Chengyun.

60
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,130
Sir,

61
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,780
he is really the royal guard,

62
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,810
one of the private guards
of His Majesty today.

63
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:33,220
Mr. Du,

64
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,250
it is beyond your power to kill

65
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,330
Li Qingliu and Long Aoyi.

66
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,500
Hasn’t Second Master gone too far?

67
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,050
How will he continue with his lie?

68
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,380
Release them, Mr. Du.

69
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,610
Just because of what you said?

70
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,250
Twenty years ago,

71
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,890
something secret happened at the court.

72
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,220
One concubine gave birth to a prince.

73
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,660
After an incident occurred at the court,

74
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,860
the concubine fled with the son secretly.

75
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,530
Unfortunately,

76
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:08,860
the concubine died

77
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,810
on the way of escape.

78
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,810
From then on,
the prince started his life off the court.

79
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,140
The prince you claimed is…

80
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,610
He is Li Qingliu,

81
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,900
the No.1 businessman of the Silver City

82
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,130
and the big boss of Xinsilu.

83
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,420
I…

84
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,410
I wanted to decapitate the prince
just now!

85
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,290
Are you sure it is true?

86
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,250
Mr. Du,

87
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,850
the prince must have genuine identity.

88
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,380
In that year, I escorted

89
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,690
the concubine and a maid of honor

90
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,010
off the court at the royal order.

91
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,010
Go get them!

92
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,250
Your Grace, Your Grace.

93
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,180
Leave with the prince.

94
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,240
Hurry up.

95
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,940
There, hurry up.

96
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:47,780
You guys, follow me.

97
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,130
You two guys go in that direction.

98
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,220
You and I search here.

99
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:51,910
Yes.

100
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,180
I had enemies in both directions and

101
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,460
had to hide the maid of honor
and the prince

102
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,690
- in a deserted thatched hut.
- Go get them.

103
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,660
When I was back,

104
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,500
they had gone.

105
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,460
Due to my failure to fulfill my mission,

106
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,010
I was dismissed from
the royal guard commandant,

107
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,730
settled down near the Silver City

108
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,620
and started to search for the prince

109
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,180
in regions around the city.

110
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,380
Second Master has gone too far in his lie.

111
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,460
How can he finish the story?

112
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,730
You are in the Silver City

113
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,690
and he is also in the Silver City.

114
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,970
Why didn’t you come to him earlier?

115
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,290
Frankly,

116
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,850
the nanny of Li Qingliu

117
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,900
is the maid of honor then.

118
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,940
As I found later, she had hidden herself

119
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,900
at the Buddhist hall
before being discovered

120
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,530
by master of the Li family.

121
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,260
In order to avoid the chasing soldiers,

122
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,610
she allowed the sonless Li family

123
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,220
to adopt the prince and disguised herself

124
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,610
as nanny of the Li family.

125
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,700
In these years, the prince

126
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,220
has been a high-profile businessman.

127
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,820
Thus I have the chance to witness
the identical appearance of His Majesty.

128
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,730
Isn’t it too reckless

129
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,490
to conclude his royal blood on such basis?

130
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,820
It is really a coincidence.

131
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,370
When I developed suspicions,

132
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,020
Longzhu Gang and Xinsilu
happened to have a dispute.

133
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,370
It thus brought convenience
for me to make investigations in the shop.

134
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,660
I hadn’t been able to find the evidences

135
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,370
and the truth

136
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,050
until I met Li Qingliu’s nanny.

137
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,100
You are…

138
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,610
Are you sure it is true?

139
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,020
If my nanny

140
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,220
is the maid of honor you mentioned,

141
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,220
why didn’t she tell me earlier?

142
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,260
What a moron you are!

143
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,820
Second Master is lying
in order to save us.

144
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:47,580
That maid of honor broke

145
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,290
the Leopard-head Token that the prince

146
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,900
had worn since birth into two halves

147
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,700
before leaving the court.

148
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:58,020
One was printed on the prince’s left arm

149
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,140
and the other half

150
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,260
is kept by His Majesty.

151
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,410
Do you want to ask me

152
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,970
to release him now

153
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,580
and then report to His Majesty?

154
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:41,850
Yes.

155
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,490
How dare

156
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,780
you disguise yourself as an official.

157
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,100
Tie him up.

158
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,220
Stop!

159
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,020
Great honor to invite

160
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,970
Mr. Yuan, head of the secretariat.

161
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,850
Great honor to see you,

162
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,340
Mr. Yuan.

163
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,260
What can I do for you, Mr. Yuan?

164
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,220
I, Yuan Zai,
hereby observe His Majesty’s order

165
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,170
= Silence =
to welcome Prince Li Qingliu

166
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:41,850
back to the court.

167
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,260
Li Qingliu is really the prince?

168
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,530
How dare

169
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,050
you call His Highness’s name directly.

170
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,530
I am sorry for not having recognized

171
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,580
the royal identity of His Highness.

172
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,050
Please show your mercy.

173
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,490
Mr. Du,

174
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,050
it is really a hasty mission this time.

175
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,660
I am sorry.

176
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,700
I received a secret message claiming

177
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,290
someone uses the escort’s convenience

178
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,170
to deliver a weapon forging book

179
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,220
beyond national borders.

180
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,260
Were it not for my fear of any error

181
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,660
and decision to preside
over it personally,

182
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,730
I am afraid it must have…

183
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,580
Please kindly ask His Majesty

184
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:32,850
to consider

185
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,260
my loyalty to the state

186
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,260
and that I have been deceived

187
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,820
for fear of any mistake that would

188
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,260
render the Tang Dynasty in danger.

189
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,730
You have been deceived?

190
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,730
Somebody, tie up the county magistrate.

191
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,180
Sir, it…

192
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,130
He spread rumors

193
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,970
so that I made a big mistake.

194
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,700
What? Do you want to argue any further

195
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,540
and have your family decapitated?

196
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:12,130
I, I plead guilty.

197
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,700
Drag him out and decapitate him.

198
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,490
Sir!

199
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,130
Release the shackle right away.

200
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,340
Yes.

201
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,610
Hurry up, release it.

202
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,970
Your Highness,
sorry for having arrived late

203
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,340
and keeping you startled.

204
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,890
Please take a rest, Your Highness.

205
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,300
We will set out for the capital city
some days later

206
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,340
and report to His Majesty.

207
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,340
Your Highness, please leave here now.

208
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:03,220
Please.

209
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,540
Please.

210
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,580
Sir, this way please.

211
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,610
= Wuyun Pavilion =

212
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,970
Everyone knows that the Silver City is

213
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,540
a far and remote region full of bugs.

214
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,850
Nobody expects it to be
the origin of a prince.

215
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,340
Our Wuyun Pavilion has never had

216
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,700
such booming businesses in history.

217
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,730
I suggest that we honor Miss Long

218
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,010
as the head showgirl.

219
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,420
Sirs,

220
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,130
I am really sorry today.

221
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,610
It is too crowded.

222
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,010
Dear all, please come again the other day.

223
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,060
How can you do that?

224
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,250
Keep an eye on them. Don’t admit them in.

225
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:15,130
Dear all, it is crowded here.

226
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,220
Pay 20 coins for each seat

227
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,130
and 10 coins for no seat.

228
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,700
Go to the backyard if you can’t afford it.

229
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,730
Just make do and pay five coins.

230
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,490
It is said Master Long

231
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,130
had a new title now.

232
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,490
What is that?

233
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,370
The Woman of the King!

234
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,370
- Yes, Woman of the King.
- Yes.

235
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,730
Why isn’t there any sound?

236
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:37,890
She has shut herself up indoors

237
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,370
for six full hours

238
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,460
since her return from the government.

239
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,770
I didn’t expect that Second Master

240
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,540
is a royal guard commandant.

241
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,340
Your noodles!

242
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:47,970
Wait.

243
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,130
Give it to me.

244
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:53,770
Long,

245
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:56,820
Long,

246
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,060
the handmade noodles are really terrific.

247
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,010
There are also your
favorite pig’s knuckles.

248
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,700
Gone again?

249
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:32,890
Princess Zhao of Pingyang
and her husband Chai Shao.

250
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,970
One is a heroine

251
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,940
and the other is a brave general.

252
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,490
They have equal powers.

253
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,650
I must be candid with you today.

254
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,770
I, Li Qingliu,

255
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,580
will never leave Long Aoyi.

256
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,610
From gold thread to Nyuertu,

257
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,650
we seem to back up each other

258
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:24,850
unconsciously.

259
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,150
Maybe we can always work together

260
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,890
and help each other to realize dreams
as we are doing now.

261
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,580
How do you know I don’t love a girl?

262
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,100
Who do you love

263
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,220
or have you loved then?

264
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,340
Do you also want to know?

265
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,130
Actually…

266
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:02,850
Actually, I love…

267
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,540
= Wuyun Pavilion =

268
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,400
Come on,

269
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,460
let me introduce a new friend to you.

270
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,100
Come on,

271
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,890
have a talk and drink more.

272
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,430
I didn’t expect that.

273
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,950
Great job for you!

274
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,380
I will drink.

275
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:40,500
I will drink.

276
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,970
What a talent you are!

277
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:12,850
Sorry, Master.

278
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,420
I didn’t honor my promise to you.

279
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,100
It is my fault.

280
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,970
Eleven years ago,

281
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:21,970
I adopted a child.

282
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:23,970
She was quick-witted

283
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,130
and intelligent.

284
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,060
So I taught her

285
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,010
the secrets of political strategies.

286
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,300
Many years have passed,

287
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:32,890
she has been proven
to be the right person.

288
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,130
She knows to behave flexibly

289
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,060
whoever she encounters.

290
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,300
She even knows

291
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,650
to consider others’ opinions and feelings.

292
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,060
Now

293
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,540
she is almost ready to be independent.

294
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,220
May I pass this White Fancy Carp

295
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,890
to her now?

296
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:11,540
I have hidden myself at Wuyun Pavilion

297
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,820
for years.

298
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,300
But it will come

299
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,820
sooner or later.

300
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,220
I didn’t expect

301
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,940
Li Qingliu was the prince and

302
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:26,340
Long has fallen in love with him.

303
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,730
I am afraid he will take her to Chang’an.

304
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,420
She is still young.

305
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,340
If she encounters that person,

306
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,610
she will certainly be defeated.

307
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,340
Master,

308
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,180
what shall I do now?

309
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,100
Sir,

310
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,100
everyone knows Xinsilu is a big store

311
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,300
and it is not easy
to deal with in the Silver City.

312
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,700
But I didn’t expect

313
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:20,940
Li Qingliu

314
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,890
was a prince growing up off the court.

315
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:24,490
Nobody has never heard about it

316
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,610
in the past.

317
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,890
No wonder Mr. Zhu said

318
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,740
he was a hard nut to crack.

319
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,690
He refused to submit
Customs Seal

320
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,260
or cooperate with the government.

321
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,020
Maybe he already knew it personally

322
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,690
and just lied to you.

323
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:39,210
Shut up!

324
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,410
I thought I could get rid of him
this time.

325
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,060
But I didn’t expect

326
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,100
I almost had myself killed.

327
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,410
The biggest trouble is

328
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,890
there will be severe consequences

329
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,500
after he meets His Majesty at the court.

330
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:02,780
Are you worried about

331
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,850
the content of the impeachment letter?

332
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,370
Hasn’t it been blocked by Council Pang

333
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,300
of the Council of Advisors?

334
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,340
He and Concubine De are brother and sister

335
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,260
and so long as we can realize the marriage

336
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,370
between Prince Zhao and Miss Du,

337
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,980
- with the powers of the Pangs, we will…
- Enough.

338
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,650
I have considered having
marital relations with the royal family.

339
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,100
But Prince Zhao

340
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,020
loves Long Aoyi deeply.

341
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:32,780
Wait,

342
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,450
according the laws of Tang,

343
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:40,540
no prince is permitted to do businesses.

344
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:43,820
We can avail this opportunity

345
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,980
to close Xinsilu Store

346
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:48,780
according to law and

347
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,130
obtain the Customs Seal.

348
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,610
After we got it,

349
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:57,850
we will have enough chips

350
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:00,020
to talk to Mr. Pang then.

351
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:05,370
This is really a good trick, Master.

352
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:06,610
Moreover,

353
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,100
declare to the whole city that

354
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:12,100
it is great news for the Silver City
to be origin of a prince.

355
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,260
In order to avoid tainting
the prince’s royal

356
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,740
status by low businesses,

357
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,690
it is necessary to clear the accounts
of Xinsilu Store.

358
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,540
It will have far-reaching impacts
on the city.

359
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,260
To protect trade and commercial orders,

360
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,610
we will set up an official market

361
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,340
and all key merchants of the city

362
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:30,820
need to be franchised by the government.

363
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,610
All the merchants of the lower class

364
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,170
will be categorized as craftsmen

365
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,820
and only registered merchants
can enter the market.

366
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,260
In this way,

367
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,890
we can take over
all businesses of the city

368
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:48,210
in a justified way.

369
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,500
OK, go and do it right away.

370
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:53,020
I will prepare some valuable gifts
for my trip to Chang’an.

371
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,170
Your…

372
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,020
Your…

373
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:10,370
Call me as before.

374
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:14,850
Yes, Master.

375
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:16,980
What’s up?

376
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,450
The governmental runners have come

377
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,930
and the ban on the silk stores

378
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,340
and banks has been lifted.

379
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,850
We can resume work with a seal.

380
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,210
Check the wages

381
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:28,690
and replenish the deficient amount.

382
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,020
Take it easy.

383
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,500
I have made the arrangement.

384
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,300
Moreover,

385
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,780
Mr. Lyu is waiting for you
at the gate possibly

386
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,820
to discuss on the trip
to the capital city.

387
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,930
Tell him I have gone to bed.

388
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:44,850
Yes.

389
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:53,980
Ma’am,

390
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,890
you know it all now.

391
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:00,410
Come here,

392
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,580
look what I have cooked for you.

393
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:11,930
Millet porridge!

394
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,690
Whenever you cried

395
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,170
as a child,

396
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,410
I always cooked millet porridge for you.

397
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,500
You would stop crying after eating it.

398
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,020
It is possibly because

399
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,450
there was limited food when I was young.

400
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,650
I can eat all delicacies but rarely

401
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,410
the millet porridge when I grow up now.

402
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:33,980
Your mother fed you

403
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,060
with the first millet porridge personally.

404
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,780
In that year, I was fifteen years old

405
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,850
and was dispatched to serve a concubine.

406
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,130
You were just born then.

407
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,370
Later,

408
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,890
I fled with her.

409
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,820
It was very remote.

410
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,690
You cried very hard.

411
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,370
We found no food and so

412
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,980
begged for millets from the villagers

413
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,300
and cooked porridge for you.

414
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:07,020
It was very cold.

415
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:09,210
Your mother

416
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,450
put it close to her bosom

417
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,300
to keep it warm and fed you.

418
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,980
You smiled while eating it.

419
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,410
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

420
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,690
Are you sure it is true?

421
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,410
I have been at a loss these two days.

422
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:31,370
I just can’t believe it.

423
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,210
Later,

424
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:37,610
your adoptive mother accepted us

425
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,210
and adopted you as her son.

426
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,060
Although she died of illness
five years later

427
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:45,340
and the Li family also started to decline

428
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:46,820
after that,

429
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,100
I promised

430
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,850
to make it a secret finally.

431
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,210
I thought it was something good

432
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:56,020
to live off the court

433
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,890
with concealed identity.

434
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,610
At least,

435
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,060
You can live safely

436
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,820
and healthily.

437
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,540
But I didn’t expect…

438
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:09,610
Why do you

439
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,260
still keep that Huluo skirt?

440
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:15,740
Your mother loved you so much.

441
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,930
She was in deep sorrow at the court.

442
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,890
If you don’t remember her,

443
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,300
who else will remember her

444
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,780
in the world?

445
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,980
She died of a serious arrow wound.

446
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,130
But she was already highly depressed

447
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,300
before it.

448
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,610
I used to notice red spots

449
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,650
like blood tears

450
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,850
at the corners of her eyes.

451
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:46,740
Blood tears?

452
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,650
But I don’t like to be a prince.

453
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,540
Can I stay here?

454
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,740
You aren’t an ordinary person.

455
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,540
You are a prince

456
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,170
and the off-spring of the royal family.

457
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,610
Your fate was already determined

458
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,690
at the moment of your birth.

459
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,740
You have no choice.

460
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,980
It is too unfair.

461
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,740
Li Qingliu is handsome,

462
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,540
rich

463
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,610
and,

464
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,980
more importantly,

465
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,340
the son of an emperor.

466
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,170
I already recognized

467
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,610
the extraordinary look of Li Qingliu

468
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:41,690
and his extraordinary identity.

469
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,850
Don’t be a Monday morning quarterback.

470
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,340
I wonder if our master

471
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,130
will be a concubine at the court.

472
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:50,740
It is great to be a concubine.

473
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,740
If so, we can go to Chang’an with her.

474
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,130
It is said the girls in Chang’an

475
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,500
are charming with half-shaved eyebrows,

476
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,610
half-worn rouges and half-bare bras.

477
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,780
If our master is dressed up that way…

478
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,370
Where is the boss?

479
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,500
No more business from now on.

480
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,060
Why?

481
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,260
Pack up and withdraw.

482
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:21,780
Sirs,

483
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:24,260
we just paid the money.

484
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,860
= Notice =

485
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,210
All businesses are closed from now on.

486
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,210
Do not open to business again
until a craftsman license is acquired.

487
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,740
You will be put in jail

488
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,210
if you open without a license.

489
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:43,610
Miss,

490
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:46,540
Miss,

491
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,130
you have drunk too much.

492
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,890
Miss, where did you go yesterday?

493
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,370
We couldn’t find you

494
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,300
throughout the Silver City.

495
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,890
What are you looking for? Heaven?

496
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,690
The South Heavenly Gate
or the Central Heavenly Gate?

497
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,650
Wake up.

498
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,300
I will fetch you a bowl of sweet soups.

499
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,200
Where is master?

500
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,650
She doesn’t feel good today.

501
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:19,690
Come here later whatever you want.

502
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:20,780
Even if you are choked,

503
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,930
you must stand it for now. Go away.

504
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:22,650
Choked?

505
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,890
We almost have no food.

506
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,980
Du Changfeng just issued a decree

507
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,340
to close all businesses in the city.

508
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,980
Master, Master.

509
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,890
Let them in.

510
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:31,690
Go, go.

511
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,980
Did you drink last night, Master?

512
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,260
Get straight to the point.

513
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:40,450
Frankly,

514
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:42,260
all businesses are banned

515
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,610
in the Silver City now.

516
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,610
It is said even Xinsilu

517
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:51,610
has been heavily impacted.

518
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,260
The government has dealt

519
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,980
a heavy blow

520
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,610
to Longzhu Gang and Xinsilu.

521
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,300
Du Changfeng just expects

522
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,850
to get rid of all competitors

523
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,370
and take over all businesses this time.

524
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,450
He wants to stop our means
to make a living.

525
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,450
Fortunately,

526
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,890
Yan Bin and I already reserved

527
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,340
the warehouses along the river course

528
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,370
as per the Master’s advice.

529
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,410
We finally survived

530
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:16,340
the case of Weng Dayou.

531
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,300
Otherwise, many of our brothers

532
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:19,610
and people will starve to death

533
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:20,300
at this time of disasters.

534
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:23,410
Our master and Master Li,

535
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:28,820
the new prince
are forward-looking enough,

536
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,690
aren’t they?

537
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,930
What is the plan

538
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,610
of our master next?

539
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,210
A girl is reluctant
to stay with parents after growing up.

540
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,540
She certainly wishes to go together

541
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,980
with the new prince.

542
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,740
One is the prince

543
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,370
and the other is a gang master.

544
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,300
Impossible!

545
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,100
Why?

546
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,610
Everything that can be done is done.

547
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,450
Just wait for it patiently.

548
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,540
Then,

549
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,340
you will not meet the new prince again?

550
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,020
I am talking about the water transport.

551
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,540
It depends on destiny

552
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:04,690
for the water transport business
to flourish.

553
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,100
We still have two points

554
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,300
that require our bribery now.

555
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:09,890
I recommend we go to the Silk Store

556
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:10,930
to discuss with them.

557
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,020
Forget it, he is a prince.

558
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,610
How can he have time for our livelihood?

559
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,300
Just make an arrangement

560
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,610
for a meeting at the station tomorrow.

561
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,060
= Xinsilu =

562
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,210
Great to see you, Your Highness!

563
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,340
Good morning, Mr. Lyu.

564
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,740
Good morning, Your Highness!

565
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,610
Everything is ready for the trip
to the capital city.

566
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:44,820
His Majesty is waiting for us.

567
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,410
Please set out for the capital city
with me as soon as possible.

568
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,820
Give me some more time.

569
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,210
I will set out after my jobs are finished.

570
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,610
The royal order must be observed.

571
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:54,500
If you delay it,

572
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,450
the evil people will have more chances

573
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,610
and even people of the silk store

574
00:30:59,020 --> 00:30:59,450
may be involved

575
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,930
and decapitated.

576
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,450
Are you threatening me?

577
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:04,340
No, of course.

578
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:05,850
But various forces are about to break out

579
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:06,850
in the Silver City now.

580
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,650
If we delay the trip,

581
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,690
the silk store will just vanish

582
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:13,060
even if you are a prince.

583
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,300
Your Highness,

584
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:15,690
why not grasp on this opportunity

585
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:16,780
and strive for it?

586
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,780
Only a capable person

587
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,820
can protect anyone he wishes to protect.

588
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:27,930
Master,

589
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,980
I agree with Mr. Lyu.

590
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:35,610
Okay.

591
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,370
But please give me another favor,

592
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:38,340
Mr. Lyu.

593
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:41,540
Miss,

594
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,450
eat it as it is hot.

595
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,340
Look,

596
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:51,650
we have our warehouses in Tianshui,

597
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:52,740
Luoyang and Guangling now.

598
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:55,300
Calculate it.

599
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,170
Buy all the other warehouses tomorrow.

600
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,170
Impossible.

601
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,540
It is your dowry.

602
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,890
We can make money in the future.

603
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,210
But we can’t miss the chance.

604
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,170
No more argument.

605
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,640
Master.

606
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,300
Come in, please.

607
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:15,820
Second Master… General Lyu.

608
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,100
Master and Xiaoqin,

609
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,130
I am coming to say good-bye.

610
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:21,500
I don’t know

611
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:23,340
when we can meet again after departure.

612
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,510
I thought

613
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,350
Longzhu Gang was just a temporary chip

614
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,510
to the royal guard commandant.

615
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,110
But I always remember the hard days

616
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,510
we spent together in the past.

617
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:42,510
Without your help

618
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,440
in the past years,

619
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,110
Longzhu Gang wouldn’t be what it is now.

620
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,790
We may not meet again in the future

621
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,960
after your departure for Chang’an.

622
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,160
Please accept my gratitude.

623
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:55,750
Master,

624
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,030
please!

625
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,240
You will always be my master for my life.

626
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,790
If you need my assistances

627
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,070
in the future,

628
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,200
please hold it

629
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,030
and look for me at the seventh shop

630
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,270
on Zhuque Street in Chang’an.

631
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,000
Thanks a lot.

632
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:18,000
When are you leaving?

633
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,110
Two days at the latest.

634
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:27,960
Accept this from His Highness.

635
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,110
Bye!

636
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,790
Have a meeting

637
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,590
at the silk store

638
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,030
at noon tomorrow.

639
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:30,880
Xiaoqin.

640
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,680
Feng.

641
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:32,750
Where is Long?

642
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,110
Miss has gone to bed.

643
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,400
I will tell her now.

644
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,590
No need.

645
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,790
Why do you have this in hand?

646
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,270
The new prince makes an appointment

647
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,350
with Miss at noon tomorrow.

648
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:42,640
I am going to

649
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,880
iron the clothes.

650
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,440
It is necessary to dress up prettily

651
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,110
on such an important day.

652
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:51,830
It seems destiny determines all
without notice.

653
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,680
Nothing special. I hope

654
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:58,550
Long can come here

655
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:59,830
after she finishes her job tomorrow.

656
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,030
I have something for her.

657
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:01,400
Okay.

658
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:02,640
You

659
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,510
also need to have a rest after work.

660
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,510
Otherwise, you won’t be pretty enough

661
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:09,510
to gain the favor of Yan Bin.

662
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:35,790
Aoyi, to be honest with you,

663
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:37,790
actually,

664
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:40,880
I love you.

665
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,070
I…

666
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,550
I love you too.

667
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:11,550
Xiaoqin,

668
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,960
is there a folk book called

669
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,070
Master Zhou’s Interpretation of Dreams?

670
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:16,830
It says dreams are
associated with reality.

671
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,200
As Xu the Incredible said,

672
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,030
dream reflects one’s yearning.

673
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,170
Some dreams are really forebodings.

674
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,000
Not yet finished.

675
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,000
You look pretty in everything.

676
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:34,340
The light green one looks nice.

677
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,690
This pink embroidered one is also pretty.

678
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,800
The yellow color fits your skins best.

679
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,710
Master Li used to wear something
like this fabric.

680
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,550
You just expect him

681
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,150
to like your dress too.

682
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,030
What nonsense!

683
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,510
You are even more imaginative than I am.

684
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,440
Please learn something more useful
from the storytellers.

685
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,150
As the storyteller says,

686
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,670
you and Master Li

687
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,150
already developed special relations

688
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,670
at Wanhua.

689
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,670
It is the same as the story.

690
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:19,550
I think

691
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,440
it is just a joke
instead of special relations.

692
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,590
The first appointment with him

693
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:24,800
became a laughingstock.

694
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,550
For this second appointment with him,

695
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,000
he has become a prince.

696
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,710
Just forget his identity.

697
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,070
Human beings are all emotional.

698
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,230
You must have a lot

699
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,280
to share with him.

700
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,550
Just tell him

701
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,110
how you feel.

702
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,230
He is leaving tomorrow anyway.

703
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,030
It isn’t humiliating at all

704
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,000
whatever happens.

705
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,280
Put the two meat dishes there.

706
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,550
Put the two vegetarian dishes here.

707
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,710
Master, as Xiaoqin said,

708
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,670
these are all favorites of Master Long.

709
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:04,960
What else

710
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,440
do you wish to add?

711
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:07,920
It is enough.

712
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,280
Isn’t it peony,

713
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,920
the favorite of Master Long?

714
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,670
Have you spent much time

715
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,400
making it?

716
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,550
What a gossiper!

717
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,840
Do you expect

718
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,630
to express your love
for Master Long today?

719
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,800
Time is limited.

720
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,320
Have you determined what to say then?

721
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,500
= Wuyun Pavilion =

722
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,760
Old boozer!

723
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,280
Old boozer!

724
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,360
I have taken the toad liquor for you.

725
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,760
White Fancy Carp,

726
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,510
there is no escape for you.

727
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,350
I am also tired

728
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,440
after such a long time of hide and seek.

729
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,280
Take the White Fancy Carp
to your master.

730
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,630
Master!

731
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,880
- Miss, what is up?
- Master!

732
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,070
Is Master here today?

733
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,280
Mr. Tan is coming

734
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,880
to drink with Feng today.

735
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,920
They should be in here now.

736
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,110
Xiaoqin,
go and call the government soldiers.

737
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,110
Master, open the door.

738
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:02,920
Feng!

739
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,460
Master!

740
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,070
Feng!

741
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,890
Feng! Open the door.

742
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,300
Open the door, Feng!

743
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,030
Get away.

744
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,840
Master!

745
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:30,990
Master!

746
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:31,690
Push open the door.

747
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:32,250
Master!

748
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,590
- Stop.
- Stop.

749
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:35,880
Don’t run away.

750
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,070
Master, what is up?

751
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,960
Why does he want to kill you?

752
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,800
Long,

753
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,920
leave here

754
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:50,590
and hide yourself

755
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,150
with concealed identity.

756
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,670
Stay away from Chang’an.

757
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:57,840
Got it?

758
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,550
I see. No more talk.

759
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,710
Help me find a doctor.

760
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,590
Okay.

761
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,800
Don’t call a doctor.

762
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,630
I want to drink some liquors.

763
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,510
Drink good liquors.

764
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,140
Liquor.

765
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,710
Master.

766
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,320
Good liquor.

767
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,440
Really good liquor.

768
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,510
Give me more.

769
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:53,360
Feng!

770
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,880
Feng!

771
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:02,230
Don’t leave me alone, Master!
