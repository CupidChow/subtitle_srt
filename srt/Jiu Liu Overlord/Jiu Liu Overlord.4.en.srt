Feng!

Young Master.

34
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,750
- Feng? Feng? Where is Feng?
- Come back soon.

35
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,560
I’m here. Are you blind or what?

36
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,120
Feng, something’s wrong!

37
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,750
What’s wrong?

38
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,680
- I have a bad news.
- I’ll wait for you!

39
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,520
A rumor spreading across the city

40
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,080
says Longzhu Gang took the gold thread.

41
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,000
Just now, some silk workers gave

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,870
butcher Song Laosan a hard time
for giving short weight.

43
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,680
They even threatened to report on that.

44
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,870
That old silk worker

45
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,000
refused to let go.

46
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,840
He said after the gold thread was gone,

47
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,560
many silk workers had to stop working,

48
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,120
so they are suffering a loss.

49
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,590
But…

50
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,750
Enough now. Stop it.

51
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,080
What about Second Master?

52
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,360
You didn’t ask him to deal with it?

53
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,750
He’s been looking for Dachun.

54
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,030
I can’t find him.

55
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,190
Lady.

56
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,960
Persian merchant’s reply? What does it say?

57
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,850
We’ve had it translated.

58
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,780
It says the Persian Princess’s dowry

59
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:30,980
can’t be late.

60
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,100
The Military Officer is trying his best

61
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,700
to search for the gold thread.

62
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,120
It says that nothing suspicious
has gone out of city.

63
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,280
What should we do then?

64
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,080
If the gold thread is still in the city,

65
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,630
how should we find it?

Shut up and go!

Fatty, Skinny,

71
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,560
what are you doing here?

72
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:00,840
Master!

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,240
Second Master Lyu has found Dachun.

74
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,750
But…

75
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,280
But Dachun…

76
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,080
Shut up!

77
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,750
Bring them down and entertain them well.

00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,310
- Yes!
- Move! Come on!

79

Move! Go!

Yes!

and walks funny.

What were you saying about Dachun?

100
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,040
He’s found?

101
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,070
Dachun… is dead.

102
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,750
What?

00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,070
Let’s go.

104
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,680
Careful.

Qiyan sent you, right?

107
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,870
I’ll double whatever amount
of money he offered.

108
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,600
Today is your day to die.

109
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,800
Go to Longzhu Gang

110
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,750
and find Second Master Lyu,

111
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,510
just ask for however much you want from him.

112
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,040
Master! Take the sabre!

113
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,950
Li Qingliu

114
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,830
put all his thoughts on
silk weaving techniques.

115
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,270
He’s always persistent.

116
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,830
His silk weaving skills

117
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,560
are inferior to none in history.

118
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,600
That’s the fortune of Silver City.

119
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,190
What’s more, the business tax

120

Xinsilu pays every year

121
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,480
covers the salaries of almost

122
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,190
half of the officials in Silver City.

123
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,950
I have ordered the county magistrate
to release him.

124
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,480
As for the customs seal,

125
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,870
please do not worry about that.

126
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,240
We still have Prince Zhao
as our supporter.

127
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:22,560
Here.

128
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:23,490
Come.

129
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,430
Master Long!

130
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:26,850
Here.

131
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,560
- Master, sit.
- I’m glad you are OK.

132
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,510
We were so worried about you.

133
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,190
Young Master.

134
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,240
You are hurt.

135
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,510
Thank you for saving me, Master Li.

136
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,120
Dachun is dead.

137
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,000
How did he die?

138
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,950
I was told he hung himself on a dead tree.

139
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,180
He was wearing

140
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,180
that torn uniform of him.

141
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,330
He left a note,

142
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,700
saying it’s you who ordered him
to steal the gold thread.

143
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,910
Dachun died miserably.

144
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,270
Master,

145
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,600
if Dachun had really
stolen the gold thread,

146
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,910
as a good son,

147
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,030
he would have left something to his parents,

148
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,000
and would have met them at least.

149
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,240
You must clear his name, Master!

150
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,720
But…

151
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,120
Master Long can’t go out at all now.

152
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,670
Master Li.

153
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,120
Master Li, sorry to startle you.

154
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,240
Sorry for all that happened.

155
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,320
That’s all misunderstandings.

156
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,870
You are free to go.

157
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,080
Master, what’s wrong with your hand?

158
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,480
Just a scratch, nothing serious.

159
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,800
Let’s get out of here. Come on.

160
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,360
Please.

161
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,790
Yan Bin, put out notice now.

162
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,200
Tell everyone Xinsilu is offering
10,000 taels for the gold thread.

163
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,390
Don’t bother.

164
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,280
You can directly give me the money.

165
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,630
You?

166
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,480
You were in a fight which hurt a prince.

167
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,390
You are going to rot in jail!

168
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,150
You dog!

169
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,000
Sir, I want to plead for Miss Long.

170
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,570
Since Miss Long and I were caught together,

171
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,290
it was a misunderstanding for me,

172
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,900
so it must also be
a misunderstanding for her.

173
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:28,260
Well…

174
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,290
But… She…

175
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,810
I don’t know if you know or not

176
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,450
that Miss Long is a friend of His Highness.

177
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,410
Now that His Highness has forgiven me,

178
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,650
he will forgive Miss Long, too.

179
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,050
I got it. I got it. Please.

180
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,140
Please.

181
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:57,740
Master.

182
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:58,170
Please.

183
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:58,740
Master.

184
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:00,860
Let’s go.

185
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,340
This is not over!

186
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,140
= Prison =

187
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:08,740
Master Li,

188
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,170
Mr. Du is giving a banquet
at Du’s Mansion tonight

189
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,570
to celebrate Third Prince’s recovery.

190
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,570
He sent me to invite you to the banquet.

191
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,500
Thank you.

192
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,000
Please tell Mr. Du that

193
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,280
I have to go freshen up before I go.

194
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,280
I’ll be going then.

195
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,280
Yan Bin, go prepare some gifts.

196
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,040
Master,

197
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,640
Miss Du was originally
going to be here for you,

198
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,160
but she had to prepare
for the banquet at home.

199
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:32,950
It’s OK.

200
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,780
Master Long.

201
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,380
= Prison =

202
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,060
I see you are pretty busy.

203
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,180
I’m going home.

204
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:47,580
Goodbye.

205
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,660
That 10,000 taels of silver…

206
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,860
I’m not really that busy though.

207
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,180
Let’s go.

208
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,060
I must uncover the truth behind

209
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,460
Dachun’s death and the missing gold thread.

210
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,620
I have to go to that silk manor
sooner or later.

211
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:09,420
OK then.

212
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,580
= North Street of Silver City =

213
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,380
Your Highness.

214
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,740
Look,

215
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,580
= Xinsilu =
this is the richest north part of Silver City,

216
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,220
many stores are gathered here.

217
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,100
If there’s some place to buy pepper,

218
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,500
this is the most possible one.

219
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,860
= Xinsilu =

220
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,860
Stop. Stop.

221
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,740
= Xinsilu =

222
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,030
Don’t forget

223
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:58,870
to verify this.

224
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,410
Got it?

225
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:00,130
OK.

226
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,780
Sir, I’m the owner of this store.

227
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,060
How can I help you?

228
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,420
It’s a fluff.

229
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,140
It can cause an allergy
once it’s sucked into your nose.

230
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,140
The hygiene condition is poor.

231
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,540
And look at your counter, so high.

232
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,260
What if your customer were a dwarf?

233
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,820
That’s not considerate at all.

234
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,700
Who’s that?

235
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,580
He’s handsome though.

236
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,740
He doesn’t look like a small potato.

237
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,180
Sir,

238
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,820
if you want to buy clothes,

239
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,910
you can come this way to be measured.

240
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,300
Look at you.

241
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,740
Look at your attitude.

242
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,140
You are by no means enthusiastic.

243
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,900
And you call yourself the best store
in Silver City?

244
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,340
Is he here to make trouble?

245
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,980
What for?

246
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,300
Smile.

247
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,200
Thank Your Highness for your advice.

248
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,620
Master, the master is back.

249
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,950
- Master.
- Master.

250
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:14,880
Master.

251
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,380
Please pardon me for the poor treat.

252
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,500
Come on, make way.

253
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,580
Make way for me.

254
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,060
What is a beggar doing here?

255
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,620
Out. Get out.

256
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,780
What beggar? Watch what you are saying!

257
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:30,900
Let her in.

258
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,420
Master Long.

259
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,500
I was arrested because of you.

260
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,500
So you are Prince Zhao?

261
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,140
Judging by your exaggerated

262
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,700
outfit bedecked with jewels,

263
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,380
I knew you were different
from those nouveau riche.

264
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,180
Master Long, please take a seat there.

265
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,460
Master never allows a girl
to get close to him.

266
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,180
For the first time, he took a girl here,

267
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,620
and she’s a beggar.

268
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,740
For what happened at the big bazar,

269
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,260
I apologize to you.

270
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,100
Your Highness,

271
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,580
how can I help you? Please tell.

272
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,900
What? You sound like

273
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,140
I’m not welcomed here.

274
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,660
I wouldn’t dare.
Of course you are welcomed.

275
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,820
What else could I do here?

276
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,420
I’m here to buy clothes of course.

277
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,700
Your Highness, do you favor anything here?

278
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,620
Too bad,

279
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,860
you don’t have

280
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,620
what I want.

281
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,580
In the whole Silver City,

282
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,380
my silk store is second to none

283
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,660
as to patterns of the clothes.

284
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,420
Red Cloud Soft Xuan.

285
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,260
According to the Public Clothes Records,

286
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,860
Xuan means solid colored dress

287
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,460
without any parti-color or stain.

288
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,140
But in Red Cloud Soft Xuan,

289
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,740
red cloud pattern is blended in.

290
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,380
That’s not possible to make in this world.

291
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,860
If Your Highness wants it,

292
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,100
you should go visit the heavens.

293
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,540
You are at the wrong place today.

294
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,380
Master Li is experienced and knowledgeable,

295
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,420
I believe you if you say so.

296
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,180
Actually I’m here

297
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,220
to buy a dress.

298
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,380
As for the requirements,

299
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,460
it should be as light
as Empress Zhao’s pleated dress,

300
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,100
and as magnificent as
Princess Anle’s hundred-bird dress.

301
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,220
He wants it light and also magnificent?

302
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,060
That’s deliberately making trouble.

303
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,060
I heard that it’s almost time

304
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,020
for the selection of
the guild leader in silk industry.

305
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,420
And Master Li is a popular candidate.

306
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,940
They all say that you are a

307
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,580
rare talent in Sichuan embroidery.

308
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,860
Then my requirements must be

309
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,380
a piece of cake to you.

310
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,460
Now that Your Highness has asked,

311
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,540
I’ll of course try my best.

312
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,420
Please.

313
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,220
Master Long, please.

314
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,820
= Optimistic =

315
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:35,980
This unscrupulous merchant!

316
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,860
He must have exploited
so many ordinary people

317
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,500
to be able to build such a big mansion.

318
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:40,620
Please.

319
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,180
It looks normal outside,

320
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,060
but holds many secrets inside.

321
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,780
Master Li

322
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,140
is really something else.

323
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,300
That’s just superficial.

324
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,060
Your Highness,

325
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,380
please take a rest in the reception room.

326
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:57,540
OK.

327
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,980
The Sichuan silk is not light enough.

328
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,580
This fabric is too soft.

329
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,940
Master, you should pick one.

330
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,820
These are all old designs.

331
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,220
I can’t cope with him with old designs.

332
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,060
The ones outside are new ones.

333
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,700
But they are still not good enough for him.

334
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:41,820
That is...

335
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,180
Eat.

336
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,900
You are not here to buy a dress, are you?

337
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,820
How do you know?

338
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,900
What are you here to do?

339
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,260
Come on, tell me.

340
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,020
I’m actually here to…

341
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,420
Why did you stop?

342
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:31,980
Here they are.

343
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,260
Peacock silk

344
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,260
was made based on Tihua silk.

345
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,260
Its weaving techniques were invented
by our Xinsilu.

346
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,200
This fabric

347
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:48,850
is the only one in the world.

348
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,860
Don’t just say it. I need to try.

349
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,260
What size do you want?

350
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,740
Just make it
according to Master Long’s size.

351
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,060
That has gone bad.

352
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,300
Need to measure me?

353
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,060
Come on.

354
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,020
What is this?

355
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,300
I can’t fit in.

356
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,700
The sleeves are so broad,

357
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,500
is this a pair of trousers or a dress?

358
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,940
It’s suffocating me.

359
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,660
Oh, no, this is worth
10,000 taels of silver.

360
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,540
I’m going to be scolded.

361
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,180
Which part is torn?

362
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,780
Is Master Li stumped

363
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,340
simply by a girl’s dress?

364
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,540
What should I do?

365
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:43,820
It’s OK.

366
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,780
Master is here.

367
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:46,780
What’s taking so long?

368
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,780
Master, it’s all my fault.

369
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,500
Master Long put it on herself,

370
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,520
and the waist part is torn.

371
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,100
Jun’er, go find me a strip of cloth.

372
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:56,580
Yes.

373
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:00,620
Master.

374
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,580
What… what are you doing?

375
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,340
Quiet, put your hands down.

376
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,580
It’s just a torn dress.

377
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,540
Come on.

378
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,180
Your arm.

379
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,300
Raise your hands.

380
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,580
Put them down.

381
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,020
Raise them again.

382
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,900
I told you not to move.

383
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,820
It’s OK.

384
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,540
You really couldn’t see?

385
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,940
Never let yourself get carried away.

386
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,420
A floor length dress with the pattern
of a begonia in mist,

387
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,980
covered with a Pinyue silk cloak
embroidered with a butterfly.

388
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,820
It’s as if a butterfly followed the scent

389
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,100
and landed on the begonia.

390
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,300
You are right, Your Highness.

391
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,820
That’s just what it means.

392
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,300
Bravo.

393
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,420
Master Li is a true master.

394
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,020
That is truly artful.

395
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,220
But I still have a question.

396
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,860
Why are the sleeves so broad?

397
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,820
This style is actually from Dayi State.

398
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,740
I altered it
according to Master Long’s figure.

399
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,220
I made the sleeves broad

400
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,620
to make it look harmonious as a whole.

401
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,980
And the broader sleeves also

402
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,740
conform to Master Long’s lively nature.

403
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,700
Good, Master Li.

404
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,140
I like this dress

405
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,380
very much.

406
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,660
Do you like it?

407
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,380
It doesn’t matter.

408
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,870
I can’t afford it anyway,

409
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:38,860
and I don’t like wearing it.

410
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,060
What if I give it to you as a gift?

411
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,540
You were asking

412
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,100
why I came earlier.

413
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,260
And now,

414
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,620
I need to ask a favor from you.

415
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,580
You ask me for a favor?

416
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,380
As long as it doesn’t break the law.

417
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,980
This Yulan hairpin

418
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,220
is not only a hairpin,

419
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,980
it’s also a gift from the royal family
to envoys.

420
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,380
What do you think?

421
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,020
You know magic tricks?

422
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,100
Can you make some food out of it for me?

423
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:19,860
Can you?

424
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,340
You are always thinking about food.

425
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,580
Just do me a favor and take it.

426
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:27,500
It’s for me?

427
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:30,580
Fine.

428
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,940
There’s a banquet at Du’s Mansion tonight,

429
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,740
I’m new here,

430
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,860
could you please

431
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,500
come with me to the banquet?

432
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,540
Please give a hand

433
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,860
to this poor non-native.

434
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,340
I just recovered from a major disease.

435
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,100
My head hurts.

436
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,060
A prince pretending to be poor.
I’ve seen everything.

437
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,060
Fine.

438
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,660
Even if it’s hell,

439
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,900
I’ll go with you to it.

440
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,540
= Xinsilu =

441
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,220
Please, Master Long.

442
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,460
Your Highness’s carriage
is really majestic.

443
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,940
I’m wondering if I’ll have the honor

444
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,540
to experience it myself.

445
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,500
Please, Master Li.

446
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,900
Wu Lin, slower.

447
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,100
Long…

448
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,420
I like this cushion.

449
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,780
Congrats, Mr. Du.

450
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,420
Please come in.

451
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,180
Congratulations, Mr. Du.

452
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,540
- Congratulations, Mr. Du.
- Thank you.

453
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:23,980
= Du’s Mansion =
Come in please.

454
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,260
= Du’s Mansion =
- Congrats, Mr. Du. - Come in please.

455
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,060
Greetings, Your Highness.

456
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,580
You may rise.

457
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,820
Thank you, Your Highness.

458
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,140
Mr. Du.

459
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,460
This is…

460
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,220
A new friend of mine in Silver City.

461
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,860
May I ask which mansion this lady is from?

462
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,460
My name’s Long Aoyi.

463
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,820
Long Aoyi?

464
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,700
You are…

465
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,020
The new master of Longzhu Gang.

466
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,380
So you are Master Long.

467
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,540
Entertain Master Long properly.

468
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,140
Xiaoxian,

469
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,140
lead the way for His Highness.

470
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,860
Your Highness, come with me please.

471
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,020
Stay close.

472
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,340
Keep an eye on Long Aoyi.

473
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,860
= Du’s Mansion =

474
00:29:59,220 --> 00:29:59,900
First of all,

475
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:03,040
= Moral Principles =
I want to thank all fellow officials

476
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,660
= Moral Principles =
and the guild leaders of all industries

477
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,020
for coming to my mansion.

478
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,420
This banquet

479
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,300
is for a triple happiness.

480
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,340
First is to welcome His Highness,

481
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,060
second is to celebrate
His Highness’s recovery.

482
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,940
And right just now,

483
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,220
I received a message says

484
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,380
His Majesty has broken out of the encirclement
and returned to the capital safely.

485
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,100
This good news brought more honor

486
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,580
to this banquet!

487
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,260
Well put!

488
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,060
His Majesty was able to break out this time,

489
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,420
it’s all thanks to Mr. Du’s assistance.

490
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,580
This banquet is also a celebration
for Mr. Du.

491
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,100
Mr. Du, I congratulate you for

492
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,220
being promoted to Left Guarding General.

493
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,340
Congratulations!

494
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,860
Stop it! Where are your manners?

495
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,580
Long Aoyi,

496
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,260
you were just released from the jail,

497
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,940
how did you sneak in Mr. Du’s mansion?

498
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,300
Drive her out!

499
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:03,860
Maid!

500
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,060
Bring this dish to her.

501
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,220
Your Highness,

502
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,860
don’t let a lowly nobody ruin all the fun.

503
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:32,740
Your Highness.

504
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,020
That’s Li Qingliu.

505
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,820
Allow me to introduce you.

506
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,780
You are about the same age.

507
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,140
One is from the royal family,
and is in an important position.

508
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,940
The other is a talented businessman.

509
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,800
If all young men of our Tang Dynasty
are like you two,

510
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,760
that would be…

511
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,080
I have already visited Master Li.

512
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,700
Master Li

513
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,860
is truly

514
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,340
a talented young man with rare skills.

515
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,020
Qingliu is one of the best businessmen

516
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,140
in our Silver City.

517
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,780
They often say that

518
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,780
a good businessman

519
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,300
is always low-key.

520
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,220
I heard that Master Li

521
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,100
just lost some valuable gold thread.

522
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,140
Looks like you failed to be low-key.

523
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,780
That’s why however ambitious you are,

524
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,260
you should not be arrogant.

525
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,820
I’m just a simple businessman.

526
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,780
I don’t have that kind of
complicated thoughts.

527
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:24,940
You are worrying too much, Your Highness.

528
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,300
Li Qingliu, how can you talk like that?

529
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,220
It’s OK.

530
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:35,840
Here.

531
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,760
I’ll propose another toast to you.

532
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,160
Please.

533
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:38,640
Please.

534
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,120
My friends, make yourselves at home!

535
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,240
- Don’t restrain yourselves, please.
- Please.

536
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,160
The guild leader of silk industry

537
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,200
got together with
the master of Longzhu Gang.

538
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,720
They fought into the jail

539
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,920
and hugged each other home.

540
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,040
And now they are here like a couple.

541
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,180
By the way,

542
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,220
Mr. Du, have you arranged everything

543
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,540
with the government investment?

544
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,460
That’s what I’m doing now.

545
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,780
Master Li is right here,

546
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,720
I’ll say it then.

547
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,960
Qingliu, this time

548
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,280
His Highness came with a mission.

549
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,120
Our Silver City must assign
a government investment

550
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,120
up to 100,000 taels of gold.

551
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,360
Claim some and be a model.

552
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,760
I can’t accept government investment.

553
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,120
Why not?

554
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,680
Government investment,

555
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,720
although it’s called investment,

556
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,080
it’s actually collecting tax.

557
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,720
It’s already abolished as early as
the first year of Wude’s reign.

558
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,000
And now it only exists in several
departments in the capital.

559
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,960
I believe there’re no official documents

560
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,800
issued about the investment now.

561
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,680
Master Li, you are right.

562
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,320
It’s just like the coming
selection of guild leader,

563
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,320
although Master Li is
the most popular candidate,

564
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,440
there’re no official documents about it yet,

565
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,880
so there’s still no guarantee.

566
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,120
Am I right, Master Li?

567
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,920
It all depends on human effort.

568
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,200
I’ll naturally try my best.

569
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,080
Why is Xiaoxian still not out?

570
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,840
My Lady, I heard
from the county magistrate that

571
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,960
it was Master Li who pleaded

572
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,320
for that Long Aoyi.

573
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,680
He even took her back to the silk manor.

574
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,800
She’s just a lowly girl.

575
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,160
Nothing to worry about.

576
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,100
Qingliu must have taken her back

577
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,560
to the silk manor for the gold thread.

578
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,680
My Lady, please get ready then.

579
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,600
Master warned us repeatedly

580
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,920
that this dance must be a success.

581
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,680
Father has fought here and there
with a spear in his hands,

582
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,120
of course he won’t waste me,
the red tassel on the spear.

583
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,840
My friends, I suggest

584
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,800
we make toast poems.

585
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,280
A candle in wind,

586
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,520
half melts, half remains.

587
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,880
Liquor in the cup,

588
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,720
half gone, half remains.

589
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,040
No, no.

590
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,680
There was already a “remains”
in the last one.

591
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,480
Picking up pearls in a dream,

592
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,720
one picked up, one lost.

593
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,790
Good one! That’s good.

594
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,670
That’s good.

595
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,970
Nice! Nice!

596
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,960
A horse died of hunger,

597
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,280
half meat, half crap.

598
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,960
A lowly girl is a lowly girl.

599
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,740
Just have fun with your upper class then.

600
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,780
I’m getting out of here.

601
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,740
Master Long, please wait.

602
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,420
Xiaoxian,

603
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,380
didn’t you prepare a dance?

604
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:04,900
Father,

605
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,340
there are so many
distinguished guests here.

606
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,060
I fear that I’d become a disappointment.

607
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,300
Masters,

608
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,300
I’m only good at

609
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,860
some insignificant skills.

610
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,780
Why don’t we watch something new?

611
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,500
I heard

612
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,540
the lower class are full of amazing talents.

613
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,780
I don’t know if you are interested.

614
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,580
Maybe we should let
Master Long dance for us.

615
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:28,970
Come on, a dance!

616
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:29,980
- Dance for us!
- Right!

617
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:30,860
A dance please!

618
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,940
Master Long, dance for us!

619
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,260
Why not? Come on!

620
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,780
So let’s welcome Master Long of Longzhu Gang

621
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,380
to dance for us.

622
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,580
After the dance,

623
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,700
you can have that crystal necklace.

624
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:52,180
If a master of a gang could dance for us,

625
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,500
that would be a rare thing to see.

626
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,780
But a rough girl like her,

627
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,140
even if she dances,

628
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,540
it’ll be some wild dance.

629
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,380
Your Highness.

630
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,460
