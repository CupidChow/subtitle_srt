= Episode 32 =

32
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,010
I have come to the Palace for so long.

33
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:28,730
The Palace Gathering is established.

34
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,320
But there is no progress at all.

35
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,260
Master.

36
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,180
You must bless me in the heaven

37
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,180
to find the murderer quickly.

38
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,380
Come on, have a look.

39
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,580
Take whichever

40
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,540
you like.

41
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,970
Her Highness noticed that you are sad,

42
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,260
she knows you like

43
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,660
these rare objects.

44
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,380
She gives up her treasures
specially for you.

45
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,890
It even makes me

46
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,340
a little jealous.

47
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,170
Your Highness, then I'll help myself.

48
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,660
The Imperial Sakura Koi?

49
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:16,940
See.

50
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,980
I said this girl has sharp eyes.

51
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,530
Lady, you made a good choice.

52
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,060
This is an antique.

53
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,090
It was specially designed during the time
of the founding emperor of Tang.

54
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,370
The look of the koi kept changing.

55
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,860
No one makes this type anymore.

56
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,620
This is the only hairpin left.

57
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,660
The beginning of Tang?

58
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,450
Never mind.

59
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,100
Since I promised you,

60
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,580
I can’t take back my words.

61
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,170
Take it if you like it.

62
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,300
Thank you, Your Highness.

63
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:06,940
Are you sure it’s okay?

64
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,100
Except the curator,

65
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,410
only eunuchs can get in Chongwen Hall.

66
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,740
It should be fine.

67
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,380
You keep watching.

68
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,740
I’ll lead the team, follow me.

69
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:23,140
= Chongwen Hall =

70
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,220
Stop.

71
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:28,890
Who are you?

72
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,690
Why do you look unfamiliar?

73
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:33,940
= Seal of the Consort Dowager =

74
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,060
You are the people of the Consort Dowager.

75
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,340
Please come inside.

76
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,460
Hurry up, I’ll be watching here.

77
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,130
Okay.

78
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,290
That’s too much.

79
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,570
When will we find it?

80
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:53,730
This one.

81
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,350
Take a look. Focus on Concubine De.

82
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,410
By the way, see if there is

83
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,940
any record of Concubine Cui.

84
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,130
The mother of Prince Jun?

85
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,570
Then I’ll look for it

86
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,060
carefully.

87
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,360
Forget it, I look for Cui Zhenzhu.

88
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,660
You go find information
about the fancy carp.

89
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,340
Since it’s from the beginning of Tang,

90
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,460
just take a look at the previous one.

91
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:13,940
Yes.

92
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,420
= Stewardess Office Jewelry Department =

93
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,300
= Stewardess Office =
= Harem =

94
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,060
The mother and daughter
of the Dugu family both died.

95
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,660
Dark red.

96
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,340
Miss.

97
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,290
Is it this one?

98
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,820
= Upper and lower lips are red. =

99
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,250
This is the Imperial Sakura Koi.

100
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,570
Finally I find you.

101
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,540
= Then put it in a big white bowl. =

102
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,410
Where should we find

103
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,810
the missing pages?

104
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,620
No one in the Palace

105
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,290
is familiar with that.

106
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:36,620
Miss.

107
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,220
Should we tell Prince Jun?

108
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,360
Let me think about it.

109
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,430
You didn’t send me a message

110
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,900
that you won’t come back for dinner.

111
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,970
I thought you are in trouble again.

112
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,260
Oh, right.

113
00:06:58,930 --> 00:06:59,930
Do you remember

114
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,820
the dumb monk I saw at Qinglong Temple?

115
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,780
The one with the red marks.

116
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,460
The apprentice of Wujiang Abbot?

117
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,910
I read it at the history record

118
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,020
of Chongwen Hall that

119
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,900
after Dugu and Princess Huayang died,

120
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,080
there were red blotches on their bodies.

121
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,920
I have been thinking about it.

122
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,520
Is it a disease?

123
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,370
Or

124
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,140
that monk is related to them?

125
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,610
She was

126
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,170
already depressed.

127
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,290
I saw there were dark red spots

128
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,330
on the corner of her eyes,

129
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,010
like tears of blood.

130
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,540
= Prince Jun’s Mansion =

131
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,530
= Qinglong Temple =

132
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,300
= Qinglong Temple =
Master.

133
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,220
Do you suspect that
Concubine De did all of it?

134
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,020
When I first entered the Palace,

135
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,900
Secretary-in-chief and Ma’am

136
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,460
once mentioned about Princess Huayang.

137
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,820
They said she was beautiful and smart.

138
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,970
She was also a quick learner.

139
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,340
You can imagine

140
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,660
how much my father loved her.

141
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,700
But she got a serious illness
at such a young age.

142
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,410
Even the physician couldn’t
find the cause of it.

143
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,490
I didn’t think much at that time.

144
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,690
But what Long said reminded me that

145
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,220
Huayang is Father’s favorite consort,

146
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,780
Dugu’s daughter.

147
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:40,220
So

148
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,560
Concubine De hates Huayang.

149
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,020
The Empress, Huayang

150
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,140
and my mother

151
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:48,820
all had similar symptoms

152
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,820
with Wuwen.

153
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,820
I have to ask him in person.

154
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,100
He was probably

155
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,170
the witness of it.

156
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,580
= Qinglong Temple =

157
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,410
Benefactors.

158
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,050
Wujiang Abbot is not feeling well.

159
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,970
Prince Jun, please go back today.

160
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,140
Please tell the abbot

161
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,290
that it concerns

162
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,170
the safety of Tang’s court.

163
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,170
This way, please.

164
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,140
I heard that Your Highness
are asking about

165
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,330
our monk, Wuwen.

166
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:27,900
Yes.

167
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,700
Amitabha.

168
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,530
This is his karma.

169
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,120
This is something in my court.

170
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,700
It happened in the 9th year of Dali.

171
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,610
The 9th year of Dali?

172
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,660
The year when the Empress died?

173
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,290
Exactly.

174
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,140
I was meditating that morning.

175
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,050
I found a person

176
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,170
behind the Buddha in our temple.

177
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,290
He was seriously poisoned

178
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,580
and unconscious.

179
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,930
I sealed his

180
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:01,780
Zhongwan point and Tianshu point

181
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,970
with golden needles

182
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,970
and expelled the poisonous blood.

183
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,410
His life was saved,

184
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,370
but soon afterwards

185
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,260
he couldn’t speak.

186
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,100
The red spots on his body

187
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,020
are caused by the toxins.

188
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,530
Is that person Wuwen?

189
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,140
He came here after what happened to him.

190
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,290
The Buddha gave him a new life.

191
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:31,930
He has nothing to do with the past now.

192
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,610
No wonder you did not want to see me.

193
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,220
I’m here for a reason.

194
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,170
I’m investigating something
that happened in the Palace.

195
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,530
He is an important clue.

196
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,780
Everything happened

197
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,340
for a reason.

198
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,780
Amitabha.

199
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:52,780
Master.

200
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,580
We can’t find Wuwen in the temple.

201
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:55,650
Why do we

202
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,060
come to the Empress’s tomb?

203
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,180
The abbot said

204
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,250
Wuwen doesn’t remember anything.

205
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,100
He is the only clue.

206
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,060
We can’t just give up.

207
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,940
According to Wujiang Abbot,

208
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,940
Wuwen used to be a eunuch in the Palace.

209
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,580
After Empress Dugu died,

210
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,770
all the people on duty on that day
in the harem disappeared.

211
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,300
Wuwen must know something

212
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,970
and was assassinated for it.

213
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,340
The person who did it

214
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,770
must have great power.

215
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,650
His poisoned body

216
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,220
is an evidence by itself.

217
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,770
As long as we find him
and let the physician examine him,

218
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,580
the truth will come out.

219
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,300
But,

220
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:39,820
- why would he come to
- Make a way!

221
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,970
- the mausoleum for no reason?
- All right!

222
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,460
Maybe he knows Dugu was buried here

223
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,490
and comes here to
pay his respects in secret.

224
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:47,220
Wait for me here.

225
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,130
I’ll go inside.

226
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:48,890
Master.

227
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,490
It’s dark and deep inside.

228
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,300
I heard His Majesty built the mausoleum

229
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,370
according to the date of birth
and the eight characters of the Empress.

230
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,810
It’s curvy inside.

231
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,250
Let me come with you.

232
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,010
There are many people here.

233
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,300
We are not familiar with them.

234
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,540
You stay here, so we can
watch over each other.

235
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,700
All right.

236
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,370
I’ll wait for you behind the passage.

237
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,730
Hurry up!

238
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:25,820
Who is that?

239
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,460
Who is that? Stop!

240
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:48,820
Stop!

241
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,180
Are you Master Wuwen?

242
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,300
Wait!

243
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,770
Master Wuwen, it’s really you.

244
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,060
Do not be afraid.

245
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,540
I won’t hurt you.

246
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,100
You used to be the eunuch of the Empress.

247
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,250
You are here to pay homage to her.

248
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:21,730
You didn’t lose your memory, right?

249
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,490
You fear that someone will hurt you.

250
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:31,420
Someone tied you up.

251
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,540
It seems they already know who you are.

252
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,820
Hurry, let’s go out first.

253
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,420
= Prince Jun’s Mansion =

254
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:00,940
I will always be with you,

255
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,220
and only with you.

256
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,940
We’ll live

257
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,060
a carefree life.

258
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:07,770
And,

259
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,130
Long Aoyi,

260
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,180
I love you.

261
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:15,130
Miss!

262
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,750
You are a girl.

263
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,130
Don’t pant like that.

264
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,180
Something happened.

265
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,580
I have something to report!

266
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,970
Nanshan Mausoleum collapsed

267
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,370
and Prince Jun is still inside.

268
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,980
= I love you =

269
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,180
Hurry up!

270
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,650
Be quick!

271
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:36,700
I’m coming!

272
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,890
Hurry up!

273
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,410
- Master, Master!
- Hurry up!

274
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,120
Miss, you can’t go there!

275
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,930
- Come here, hurry up!
- Master!

276
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:50,440
Faster!

277
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,340
- Master!
- Servant!

278
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,100
Hurry up!

279
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:53,700
- Catch up!
- Your Highness.

280
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,180
Have you found him?

281
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,340
Prince Jun is not among
the wounded rescued so far.

282
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,330
Something might happen to him.

283
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,650
It’s about the tunnel.

284
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:01,940
Dig it through!

285
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,130
You must find Prince Jun!

286
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:03,680
Got it!

287
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,610
You guys over there!

288
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,530
Come here, hurry up!

289
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,130
Yes!

290
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,460
Hurry up!

291
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,250
Master!

292
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,420
Hurry up!

293
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:32,970
Your Highness.

294
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,580
Hurry up!

295
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,540
- Aoyi, come down.
- Hurry up!

296
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,010
Listen to me, Aoyi!

297
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,730
Long Aoyi!

298
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,610
If Qingliu dies this time,

299
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,770
I want you to be buried with him!

300
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,370
- Miss!
- Hurry up!

301
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,300
- Miss, you can’t go there!
- Hurry up!

302
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,060
Let me go!

303
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,650
You can’t go!

304
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,300
Li Qingliu, you are a jerk!

305
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,610
You have not done what you promised me!

306
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,060
Do you want to leave just like that?

307
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,250
Let me go!

308
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:49,770
No!

309
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,540
You have to die in my hands!

310
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,100
Let me go...

311
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,340
Li Qingliu, come out...

312
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:03,460
You are an untrustworthy jerk...

313
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,960
Bastard! Rascal!

314
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,800
I can’t understand
any of the words you wrote.

315
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:16,440
I want you to tell me in person.

316
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,700
Come out...

317
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,700
Come out!

318
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:36,420
Prince Zhao.

319
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,610
It’s been more than ten hours.

320
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,130
We haven’t dug through the entrance.

321
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,460
I’m afraid that

322
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,890
it’s a long shot.

323
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,130
Get more people

324
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,080
and speed up.

325
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,650
If anyone dares to slack off,

326
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,540
punish him according to the military law!

327
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,150
Yes!

328
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,610
Have you done

329
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,180
the finishing touches?

330
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:03,730
Don’t worry, Your Grace.

331
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,610
Everything is taken care of.

332
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,060
There is no evidence now.

333
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,060
Good.

334
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,770
Don’t forget to watch over the other side.

335
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:12,890

Father.

364
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,650
Did you know about

365
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:57,450
Her Grace’s deployment?

366
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,210
I know your difficulty
of being an official.

367
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,500
I also promised you to

368
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,980
deal with Long Aoyi.

369
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,740
But Qingliu was almost killed.

370
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:07,260
Don’t you say

371
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,610
you only want him not to threaten

372
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,500
the position of Prince Zhao?

373
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,340
Why would she kill Qingliu?

374
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:13,130
Why?

375
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,100
I’m also surprised that

376
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,410
Concubine De made such a move.

377
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,740
Believe it or not,

378
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,340
it has nothing to do with me.

379
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,820
Why can’t you still

380
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,340
let Li Qingliu go

381
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,580
at this time?

382
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,500
He has made his love for Long Aoyi

383
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,890
clear to the world.

384
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,930
It doesn’t make you look good,

385
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,370
I’m also embarrassed.

386
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:37,980
I think

387
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,020
we should take this chance

388
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,100
and let His Majesty take back the order.

389
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,610
Make a thorough break with him!

390
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:44,210
Father!

391
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,410
How can you achieve anything big
being swayed by gain and loss?

392
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:51,540
Your Grace.

393
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,850
You are finally here.

394
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,060
You will only look suspicious

395
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:04,100
if you enter the Palace at this moment.

396
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,410
Your Grace.

397
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,020
Li Qingliu almost died.

398
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,780
There was a lot of
discussion in the court.

399
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,170
They said it’s strange that

400
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,820
Prince Jun was in danger.

401
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,980
His Majesty asked me to

402
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,740
find out why the mausoleum collapsed.

403
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,940
What should we do?

404
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:22,930
My brother was also in court.

405
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,170
He told me about it.

406
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,780
He said you looked uneasy.

407
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,060
He’s afraid you would panic
and mess it up.

408
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,370
So he asked me to comfort you.

409
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,170
Mr. Du.

410
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,740
You have gone through so many wars.

411
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:38,820
Why are you terrified?

412
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,300
Your Grace.

413
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,060
I’m worried that

414
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,260
if someone accidentally misspeaks,

415
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:45,980
well...

416
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,020
Don’t worry about that.

417
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,580
The dead can’t speak.

418
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,020
Besides,

419
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,100
he couldn’t speak.

420
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:56,540
I will deal with the rest of them.

421
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,610
Your Grace.

422
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,690
I don’t understand.

423
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,780
Why would Qingliu be in danger?

424
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,260
You helped me make the marriage happen.

425
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,980
Do you want me to be a widow?

426
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:08,890
It’s not your turn to speak.

427
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,450
He knows too much.

428
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,210
If I don’t get rid of him now,

429
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,580
Zhao and I will lose our lives.

430
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,740
Li Qingliu is still my future son-in-law.

431
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,540
Your Grace, you are making it too serious.

432
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,690
It is...

433
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,930
Just do what you should do.

434
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:26,580
Yes.

435
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:30,080
Since ancient times, the royal family
has been building temples and gardens.

436
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,260
There is nothing strange that

437
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,370
some people die in

438
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,980
such huge projects.

439
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:38,340
Besides,

440
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,970
I heard that when Li Qingliu
entered the mausoleum,

441
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,740
the weather suddenly changed.

442
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,170
Just make it look believable

443
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,880
about what you should do.

444
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,690
Then tell His Majesty

445
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,580
it is just an accident.

446
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:55,980
Mr. Du.

447
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:57,740
Do you have any other concerns?

448
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,340
You are kind to me.

449
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:03,020
I’ll do my best to serve you.

450
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,300
But

451
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,450
the Prince just showed up

452
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:07,980
and he was in danger,

453
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,060
will people suspect

454
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,610
it’s a sibling rivalry?

455
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,320
I’m afraid that His Majesty

456
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,740
won’t believe it easily.

457
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:17,820
I mean

458
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,370
the Sixth Prince

459
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,880
might be suspected.

460
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,890
There is still a Crown Prince

461
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,850
shielding us.

462
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,240
He was made the Crown Prince.

463
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,170
But he has been suffering from illness.

464
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,540
Shouldn’t he

465
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,890
be the one who worries the most?

466
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,980
You are right.

467
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,250
Greetings to Grandmother.

468
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,370
My grandson.

469
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,130
You may rise.

470
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:08,820
Thank you, Grandmother.

471
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,210
Are you feeling better now?

472
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,370
I’m fine.

473
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,930
Qingliu,

474
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,540
you really scared me this time.

475
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:23,690
Why would you

476
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:26,340
go to the mausoleum?

477
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,060
That was so scary.

478
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,930
If the monk didn’t give up his life
to save you,

479
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,140
you would be dead now.

480
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,020
Wuwen is dead?

481
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,300
Someone does want to kill him.

482
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,580
All right, Shengping.

483
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,650
Stop scolding Qingliu.

484
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,850
He is still weak now.

485
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,500
Wait until he gets better.

486
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,190
Right.

487
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,780
Are you feeling

488
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,240
any discomfort?

489
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,410
Do you need Physician Xu

490
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,100
to take a look at you?

491
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,450
Thank you, Grandmother.

492
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,410
No need.

493
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:55,370
It’s only superficial injury.

494
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:56,540
I’ll just need to rest for a few days.

495
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:57,580
But

496
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,680
I don’t remember

497
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:01,890
I went to

498
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,100
the mausoleum you talked about.

499
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,210
I just remember

500
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,440
I was eating fish with Long,

501
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:08,820
then...

502
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,120
Then I can’t remember anything.

503
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:20,160
Well...

504
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:20,930
This is...

505
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:27,580
= Xuanshi Hall =

506
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,450
Du Changfeng handled the case

507
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:33,340
perfunctorily and carelessly.

508
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,060
He even told me it’s an accident.

509
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,060
Does he mean

510
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,340
the God wants to kill Prince Jun?

511
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,540
Your Majesty, you are right.

512
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,170
Does he think

513
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,210
he can do what he wants

514
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,410
since I granted a marriage to
his daughter with Prince Jun?

515
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:52,980
I also heard

516
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,410
he formed a clique in the court

517
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,130
and has some henchmen now.

518
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,260
He held the military power

519
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:02,130
when he was the commissioner of Xichuan.

520
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,980
There must be some old acquaintances

521
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:04,890
who still take orders from him.

522
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:06,780
You go to

523
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,170
warn him

524
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,580
on behalf of me.

525
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,020
Let him know

526
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,610
who rules the nation.

527
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:17,930
If he doesn’t restrain himself,

528
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,540
no matter the Minister of War,

529
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,210
or his daughter’s marriage
with Prince Jun,

530
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,450
I can grant them to him,

531
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,930
I can also get them back.

532
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:29,410
Yes, Your Majesty.

533
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,380
= Prince Jun’s Mansion =

534
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,100
Your Highness.

535
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,370
Thank you for coming to see me.

536
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:47,690
Your Highness.

537
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,450
Do you really remember nothing?

538
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,540
What did you see in the mausoleum?

539
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,610
How did you get out?

540
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:56,980
Don’t you remember anything?

541
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,790
Why did you go to the mausoleum?

542
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,930
Physician Xu said that

543
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,370
it is just a minor head trauma,

544
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,210
but he might be hit

545
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,020
by collapsed rocks.

546
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:16,540
Besides, it was dangerous
and he was too scared,

547
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,020
so he might forget it

548
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,260
unconsciously.

549
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,500
Did Physician Xu say

550
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,450
when he will remember it?

551
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:26,890
There are similar cases

552
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,540
in medical books.

553
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,210
It’s not sure about the specific time.

554
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,130
It’s possible that

555
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,450
he will never remember it.

556
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,610
The Consort Dowager asked someone from
the Medical Department to check him.

557
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,500
But they can do nothing about it.

558
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,610
I was thinking about what you said.

559
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,260
But I don’t remember at all.

560
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,410
The results of Court of Judicial Review

561
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,300
have been reported to the court.

562
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,690
His Majesty is still worried.

563
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,780
He asked me to

564
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,690
find out the truth secretly.

565
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:01,890
Your Highness, you are the

566
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,410
only one who escaped.

567
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,410
If you think of anything,

568
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,000
please keep me informed.

569
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,500
No problem, thank you.

570
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:23,580
How is it going with the mausoleum?

571
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:26,370
The people are all from
Prince Zhao and Concubine De.

572
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,300
The body has been cleaned up.

573
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,020
Are the Consort Dowager
and Princess Shengping gone?

574
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:31,820
Yes.

575
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,890
I heard they

576
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:34,740
made a lot of effort

577
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,470
to persuade His Majesty

578
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,650
to find out the truth about the mausoleum.

579
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,980
I think His Majesty also
takes this matter seriously.

580
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,020
Otherwise, he won’t send Mr. Liu over.

581
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,100
Master.

582
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,580
Why don’t you tell the truth?

583
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,780
We don’t have any evidence now.

584
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,540
If we speak out,

585
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,300
we might alert them.

586
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,580
How long are you going to pretend it?

587
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,170
I don’t think Concubine De

588
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:00,820
will let it go easily.

589
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,210
I won’t just wait and do nothing.

590
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:05,540
Now we know that Concubine De
is good at using poison,

591
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,170
it’s nothing but food, clothing,
shelter and transportation.

592
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,980
So we will take the initiative.

593
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,500
But Concubine De can think of

594
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:14,020
what I can think of.

595
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,370
She must be busy destroying the evidence.

596
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,370
We are racing against time.

597
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,260
I pretend to lose my memory

598
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:22,340
to make them take it lightly

599
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,260
so as to buy us more time.

600
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,820
It is said that those who are
in love are telepathic.

601
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,530
Prince Jun and Lady Long

602
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:29,740
happen to have the same view.

603
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,450
What were you doing?

604
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,740
Lady Long spread the news to the people

605
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,100
of Palace Gathering to find the clue.

606
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:35,740
They should be

607
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,440
very busy now.

608
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,720
Lady is quick-thinking and considerate.

609
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,070
But shouldn’t you

610
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,920
remind them

611
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,020
to be careful,

612
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,210
so as not to look suspicious?

613
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,020
Don’t worry.

614
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,500
There are all kinds of
people in the Palace.

615
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,980
To not give away the news,

616
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,690
I only told the people
in the Palace Gathering

617
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,340
that Prince Jun and I just came
to the Palace,

618
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,820
although there are history records,

619
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,340
we still want to know more

620
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:58,610
anecdotes of the Palace.

621
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,890
So I won’t look ignorant

622
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,300
if my child

623
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,610
asks me about it in the future.

624
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:05,690
It’s often said

625
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,610
when a woman is in love

626
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,130
and being pregnant,

627
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,610
she would be most beautiful and ruddy.

628
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,210
Seeing you today, I know it’s true.

629
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,130
As for that woman becomes

630
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,690
slow to respond, fatigue and forgetful
before and after giving birth,

631
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,170
my wife is not like that at all.

632
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,450
Take care of your master.

633
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,370
Give him more decoction

634
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:29,930
in case he talks nonsense again.

635
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:32,740
They all say a woman is
gentle and submissive

636
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,980
when she faces the person who she admires.

637
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:34,980
Well,

638
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,650
can’t I even make a joke?

639
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:40,210
It’s said that men are gentlemen outside,

640
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:42,450
when they get home,
they reveal the nature as a playboy.

641
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:43,780
It’s totally true.

642
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:53,210
Miss, you helped Prince Zhao a lot before,

643
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,060
he just got the grace of His Majesty,

644
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,740
now he loses it again.

645
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,790
He hates me because of Long Aoyi,

646
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,780
but we are in the same situation.

647
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,020
Now his situation is more difficult
than mine.

648
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,650
If Prince Zhao doesn’t do anything,

649
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,690
I’m afraid it would be hard

650
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:16,020
to reverse this situation.

651
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:26,610
These people have been
gathering here these days.

652
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,170
I heard Long Aoyi wants to collect

653
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:31,010
anecdotes about the Palace.

654
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,380
These chirping servants,

655
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,970
I will drive them away.

656
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,020
Who am I now

657
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,500
to compete with Long Aoyi for the status?

658
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,980
Without the title of Mr. Du’s daughter,

659
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,780
I’m afraid these maids and eunuchs

660
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,580
would be laughing in my face.

661
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,980
Stop. Stop.

662
00:32:58,690 --> 00:32:59,690
My father is right.

663
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,740
I only have Li Qingliu in my heart.

664
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:05,980
But he only takes me as a joke.

665
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:07,930
Miss.

666
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,690
Why don’t you let Master
report to His Majesty

667
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:12,450
and find another husband for you?

668
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,100
You can’t waste your youth.

669
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:15,890
No.

670
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,450
Since I was born, there is
nothing I can’t get.

671
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,610
I won’t

672
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:24,780
give up to Long Aoyi.

673
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:32,540
= Loyalty =

674
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,100
Master.

675
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:35,890
This paper is strange.

676
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,410
It’s thicker than the usual paper.

677
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,260
What’s strange about that?

678
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,780
Thicker paper is stronger.

679
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,530
The paper in the Palace

680
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,130
must be passed down for generations.

681
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:50,740
Right?

682
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,100
Wait.

683
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:54,890
Xiaoqin.

684
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,020
What did you say about the booklet?

685
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,450
Concubine De often sent stationery
to the Empress.

686
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,400
Yes, it is written here.

687
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:04,940
Look.

688
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,890
But in Concubine De’s palace,

689
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:07,930
there is no such thing.

690
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,370
This belongs to the Crown Prince.

691
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,890
It’s not the bamboo paper we use.

692
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,260
I had dealings with the businessmen

693
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:35,210
from other countries
when I was in Silk Store.

694
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,020
I remember the merchants from Misili

695
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:38,650
once mentioned that

696
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,060
their country is later than Tang

697
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:41,340
to start making paper.

698
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,580
The raw materials they use are tougher.

699
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,020
So it can be stored longer than our paper.

700
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,450
The raw material

701
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,580
is a plant

702
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,980
they called papyrus.

703
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:51,850
I know about it.

704
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:53,850
Press the leaves to squeeze out the water

705
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,500
and place them neatly
according to the warp and weft.

706
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,040
It will take shape after being dried
with high temperature.

707
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,930
You can write and paint on it,
and it’s not easily damaged.

708
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,650
Common people

709
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,500
also used it to make clothes.

710
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:08,370
But what does this
have to do with the poisoning?

711
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,130
Yeah.

712
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,500
Bring me a bowl of hot water.

713
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:15,100
Here.

714
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,300
If I’m not guessing it wrong...

715
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,300
What is this trick?

716
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:44,060
Press the leaves of papyrus

717
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:46,410
and then soak them repeatedly

718
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,450
with prepared poison.

719
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:50,450
After several times,

720
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,540
the poison is in the veins of the leaves

721
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,740
and made into paper.

722
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:57,930
But we have tried

723
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:00,100
the paper. There is no poison in it.

724
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,780
Concubine De is careful in doing things.

725
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:03,370
The poison she used

726
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,780
will only let out when being heated.

727
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,370
When the Crown Prince writes and paints,

728
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:10,930
he is closest to the candles.

729
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,420
Plus there are many stoves

730
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:13,790
in the Palace during winter,

731
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,500
the temperature indoor is higher

732
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,020
and more favorable
for the poison to spread.

733
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,060
Didn’t you just...

734
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,310
Get the physician here.

735
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:22,740
No need.

736
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,650
How much poison can a piece of paper have?

737
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,300
With small doses of poison every time,

738
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,780
it can be done unnoticedly.

739
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:40,690
I know it.

740
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,730
They said that after the Princess
entered the Taoist temple,

741
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,750
her condition got worse
and she died young.

742
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:49,100
It must be
that she had nothing else to do,

743
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,650
so she can only write and paint.

744
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,320
She was killed without being noticed.

745
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:57,610
That booklet!

746
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,250
It says that

747
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,020
the Crown Prince thought
the paper is too thick,

748
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,290
so he didn’t use that paper.

749
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,580
To not make Concubine De unhappy,

750
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:08,420
he just put it aside.

751
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,980
That’s why the Crown Prince
has been in poor health,

752
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,980
but he doesn’t die.

753
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,020
Everything is put together.

754
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:17,810
Concubine De poisoned the Crown Prince.

755
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:21,730
I got it.

756
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,860
Is it real?

757
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:37,100
They even got the evidence.

758
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,650
Hurry up, get me a carriage.

759
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,020
No, a horse.

760
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,650
We just need to ask someone to

761
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:49,540
get more paper from
the Crown Prince’s Mansion,

762
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:50,900
then we will have the evidence.

763
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,540
With the Crown Prince,

764
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:53,980
we have witness and physical evidence.

765
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:55,900
Concubine De won’t escape this time.

766
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:02,940
Well, it’s getting late.

767
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,020
Rest early.

768
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,330
Do you want to

769
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,660
slip away again?

770
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,580
Is there nothing
you want to tell me alone?

771
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,730
They said

772
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,330
you cursed me at the entrance
for a long time that day.

773
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,580
Well...

774
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,460
I didn’t mean it.

775
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,210
I was scared.

776
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:21,290
I was afraid that you were really dead.

777
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:22,770
You know my temper.

778
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:23,290
I...

779
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,290
I know.

780
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,650
You worry about me.

781
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:35,100
You love me.

782
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,460
Are you crazy?

783
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,250
What if they see us?

784
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:39,900
You are my rightful wife.

785
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,420
Who dares to disagree?

786
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,380
But you didn’t marry me in a formal way,

787
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:49,290
it doesn’t count.

788
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,770
If you show some sincerity,

789
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,100
I will consider about it.

790
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:56,580
Fine.

791
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:57,650
I promise you.

792
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:00,130
You have to promise me that

793
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,210
this life,

794
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,900
no, next life,

795
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:06,100
and the one after that,

796
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:08,330
you have to stay with me

797
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:12,690
and have many babies for me.

798
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,810
There will be all my children in the yard.

799
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,580
Am I a hen to lay eggs?

800
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,810
Hatch a brood of chicks.

801
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:25,770
Speaking of chicken,

802
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,100
