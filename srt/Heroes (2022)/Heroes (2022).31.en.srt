00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:25,170
(Mengzhen, please join me
at Maple Bridge Tavern, Bai Choufei.)

40
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,439
Wuxie,

41
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,000
prepare a carriage for me.

42
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,759
My brother wants to see me.

43
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,039
Yes, sir.

(Liquor)

45
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,199
Mister, here's your liquor.

00:03:16,235 --> 00:03:19,440
(Liquor)

47
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,360
The House of Sunset Drizzle
is constantly suppressed.

48
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,199
Mengzhen, you're terminally ill too.

49
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:34,919
Even under such circumstances,

50
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,280
you managed to send out
elite members of the House

51
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,199
and tried to rescue me from the dungeon.

52
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:41,800
Your loyalty

53
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,479
is most impressive.

54
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,759
Where are they?

55
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,879
Both Long Xiaoqing
and Mo Beichen are dead.

56
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:02,919
I killed them.

57
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,639
Zhu Xiaoyao is still alive,

58
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,159
but I don't think
she wants to see you right now.

59
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,439
You've changed.

60
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:17,759
I knew you would change.

61
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,199
The punishments
they used on you in the dungeon,

62
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,519
or Little Rock's death,

63
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,920
I've thought of
all kinds of possibilities.

64
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,600
I thought you would be dead

65
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,959
when I see you again.

66
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,279
I told myself

67
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,120
that I will bring you back to my side

68
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,600
regardless of the cost.

69
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,040
But I didn't expect you

70
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,040
to harm the brothers
who had been through

71
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,839
thick and thin with you!

72
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,040
Some hurdles are crossed

73
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,519
in just the blink of an eye.

74
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,279
You've shouldered
the blame for me and Xiaoshi.

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,560
You've shouldered
the blame for Sunset Drizzle too.

76
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,680
You're eligible to be
the next House Master...

77
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,279
That's enough!

78
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,240
You always think
that you're superior to me.

79
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,839
You think that you can
provide me with the things I want

80
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,120
and that I won't be able
to get them without your help.

81
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,199
But everything changed.

82
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,199
Now, I might not even take it

83
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,240
even if you want to give me something.

84
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:35,600
I remembered
that Lei Mei was the first person

85
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,800
who brought me to this tavern.

86
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,439
She told me that this was the most
expensive tavern in the Capital.

87
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,879
Both you

88
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:42,920
and Lei Sun

89
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,360
drank here.

90
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,079
This was the peak
of the martial arts world.

91
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,279
Back then, she said

92
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,519
I had no right to sit here

93
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,319
or stay in the Capital.

94
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,000
Now that I've joined Youqiao Group,

95
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,759
I have the right to sit here.

96
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:03,199
This drink

97
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,000
is on me.

98
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,560
However, there's only one person

99
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,079
who can rule the martial arts world.

100
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,879
That person is me.

101
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,120
You know what Chancellor Cai is doing.

102
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,639
You still work for him

103
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,879
even though you know
the kind of person he is.

104
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:33,560
Choufei.

105
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,879
Is this truly the path you wish to take?

106
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,360
This path can help me
achieve everything I want to.

107
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,480
Why shouldn't I take it?

108
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:44,480
Su Mengzhen.

109
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,920
Actually, we knew this
deep inside our hearts.

110
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,800
You and I are utterly different.

111
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,480
You and I wouldn't even be brothers

112
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,079
without Little Rock.

113
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,000
Now that he's dead,

114
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,680
I don't need to take
his feelings into consideration.

115
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:08,399
After we finish this liquor,

116
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:12,519
you and I will cease
to be sworn brothers.

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,240
There's no need to show any mercy

118
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:17,759
when we face each other
as enemies in the future.

119
00:07:53,640 --> 00:08:00,000
(Maple Bridge)

120
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,523
(Maple Bridge)

121
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,240
Mr. Su.

122
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,810
(Pinyao Alley, Kushuipu)

123
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,559
You said you were drinking
to sever your ties with him.

124
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,320
But in the end, you still told me

125
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,440
to tell him where Zhu Xiaoyao is.

126
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,799
Seems like Zhu Xiaoyao

127
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,080
is pretty important to you.

128
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,840
You're wrong.

129
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,919
Zhu Xiaoyao is important to Su Mengzhen.

130
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,960
I want Su Mengzhen to witness

131
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:24,039
the pathetic state
Zhu Xiaoyao is in personally.

132
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,360
This is a mental attack.

133
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:30,960
He's terminally ill right now.

134
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,320
He might die

135
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,000
after this blow.

136
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,240
When I said I would
sever my ties with him,

137
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,480
I would definitely do so.

138
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,080
From now on, I won't show him any mercy.

139
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,799
Now.

140
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:04,600
It's your turn.

141
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,799
I said before that
you have the freedom to choose.

142
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,279
However, will you still choose me

143
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,519
even after seeing my true colors?

144
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,639
I have made my choice long ago,

145
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,159
and I would never change my mind.

146
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,519
Bai Choufei is much more ruthless

147
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:13,960
than both of us.

148
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,960
It's not difficult

149
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,519
to kill someone

150
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,120
with one's blade.

151
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,519
But what he wants

152
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:23,840
is to turn a noble lady

153
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,120
into a wretched woman.

154
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,840
He has a wolfish nature.

155
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,840
We've offended him
many times before this.

156
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,519
We should be more careful

157
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:33,720
when we follow him in the future.

158
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,840
We should kneel when we have to.

159
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:38,399
If not, he'll surely kill us.

160
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,320
Get out of the way!

161
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:52,879
What's with

162
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:55,159
her face?

163
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,960
Why are you being picky
when we get her for free?

164
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,200
Take her away!

165
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,720
Chancellor said

166
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,080
that you should stay here for a few days

167
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,799
since you were just
released from the dungeon.

168
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,279
You may decide
where to go after taking your rest.

169
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,240
Chancellor has given us
instructions too.

170
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:10,519
Vice House Master Bai, now...

171
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,799
Mr. Bai, you're an influential figure now.

172
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,320
From now on,

173
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,840
both of us will serve you.

174
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,519
We shall handle

175
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:20,080
your every need.

176
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,000
That's right.

177
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:22,799
You two are of noble birth.

178
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,559
Don't you hate it

179
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,639
when you have to serve someone like me?

180
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,519
Not at all.

181
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,879
Mr. Bai, you're an important figure now.

182
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,879
We're lucky

183
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,440
to be able to serve you.

184
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:35,639
Mr. Bai,

185
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,159
in the past, we were just
serving our own masters.

186
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,399
If we had offended you

187
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:40,960
in any way,

188
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,840
I hope you would pardon us.

189
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,639
In the future, we'll be working
for the Chancellor together.

190
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,240
Please take care of us in the future.

191
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,960
Please take care of us.

192
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,759
I remember the "kind deeds" you two

193
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,399
had done for me in the past.

194
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,480
In the future,

195
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,039
I will take good care of you two.

196
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:29,720
Long Xiaoqing and Mo Beichen

197
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,080
were my brothers from the House.

198
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,399
This knife is stained with their blood.

199
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:34,840
It's inauspicious.

200
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,519
Get me a new knife.

201
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,720
Mr. Bai, what kind
of knife would you like?

202
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,600
Get me the same kind of knife.

203
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,399
A killing weapon

204
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,240
doesn't need to be too fancy.

205
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,320
I've never made a wish upon the heavens.

206
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,559
But God, if you do exist,

207
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,120
I hope you can protect Wen Rou.

208
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,480
If she can survive this ordeal,

209
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,960
I'm willing to sacrifice my hands, feet,

210
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,360
heart, lungs,

211
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,519
and even my life

212
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:06,519
in exchange for her safety.

261
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:45,240
Big Beard, stop what you're doing.

262
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,000
Look at all the dishes here.

263
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,960
You should join us.

264
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:48,960
Miss Wen Rou
just recovered from her illness.

265
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,240
She has to take nutritious food.

266
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,759
I made some mutton soup for her.
It'll be ready in a minute.

267
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:52,680
Thank you, Big Beard.

268
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,319
Don't mention it.

269
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,240
The people here are really nice.

270
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:57,440
They're kind and passionate.

271
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:58,720
They keep making nice food for me

272
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,000
right after I woke up.

273
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,000
I think I'm turning into a swine.

274
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,839
I'll still love you

275
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:05,920
even if you were to become a swine.

276
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,759
Little Rock, what are you saying?

277
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,240
Master is still here.

278
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:18,720
This silly disciple of mine

279
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,759
is truly fortunate indeed.

280
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:22,759
He actually encountered
a great lady like you

281
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:25,319
after leaving the mountain.

282
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,240
Do you know something?

283
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,440
Many ladies liked him

284
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:31,359
when he was still in Baixu Garden.

285
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,079
Master.

286
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,920
But he drove all of them away.

287
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,480
I thought he was a love idiot

288
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,480
and I was worried that he might
spend the rest of his life alone.

289
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,880
Now that I think about it,

290
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,480
it's not that he's a love idiot.

291
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,400
It's just that he didn't
encounter the right person.

292
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,880
This child

293
00:20:58,359 --> 00:20:59,240
has a dull personality.

294
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,319
Sometimes, he reacts slowly

295
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,200
when he interacts with other people.

296
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,000
I'm sure he has made you angry
plenty of times, right?

297
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,599
Not at all, Master.

298
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:09,759
Although Little Rock isn't good
at reading other people's minds,

299
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,960
he's sincere to everyone.

300
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:13,240
That's a precious trait.

301
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,640
When I first met him,

302
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,079
he said he wanted to travel freely,

303
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,880
curb the violent, and assist the weak.

304
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,559
I've encountered plenty of men like him.

305
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,960
They all changed in the end.

306
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,240
But Little Rock

307
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:25,440
has never changed.

308
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,319
Although he has plenty of flaws,

309
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:29,759
that's also the best version of him.

310
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,759
Good.

311
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:36,759
A wholehearted person
is the rarest thing in the world.

312
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:38,759
Eat up.

313
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:44,759
Before I deliver the evidence
of Chancellor Cai's corruption

314
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:47,160
to the Capital and convict him of his crime,

315
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,720
you guys

316
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,880
have to wander for a while.

317
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:54,400
You might fare better outside the pass.

318
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,480
However, the area
outside the pass is cold and isolated.

319
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,839
Miss Wen Rou, you will have to suffer.

320
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,759
Brat,

321
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,440
you must take good care of her.

322
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,160
Do not let her be hurt again.

323
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,119
Master, don't worry.

324
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,000
Once everything settles down,

325
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,480
Wen Rou and I
will keep you company in Baixu Garden.

326
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,440
All right.

327
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:13,759
That's good.

328
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:15,920
The mutton soup is ready.

329
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:17,119
Come.

330
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:19,119
Listen,

331
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:20,400
this soup is very nutritious.

332
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,920
Come, join us.

333
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,559
Have some soup.

334
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:23,480
Come.

335
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,319
Bai, you're back?

336
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,400
I bought your favorite liquor.

337
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,119
Let's drink together later.

338
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,480
Little Rock?

339
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,359
Little Rock.

340
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,119
I know you're dead.

341
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,000
I didn't have the chance

342
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,240
to offer you the last toast inside the dungeon.

343
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,240
Today,

344
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,160
we shall drink until we drop.

345
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:06,799
When I was in the dungeon,

346
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,319
I killed our brothers
from the House of Sunset Drizzle.

347
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,200
I've also promised Chancellor Cai

348
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,119
that I would serve Youqiao Group.

349
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,960
I've let down
the House of Sunset Drizzle.

350
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,960
I will punish myself with a drink.

351
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,599
Back then, we swore

352
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:45,039
a brotherly vow together.

353
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:48,519
We swore to go through

354
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,119
thick and thin together.

355
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:53,000
We swore to
entrust our lives to each other

356
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,160
and never let each other down.

357
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,759
But now, you're dead.

358
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:02,599
Su Mengzhen and I

359
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,960
severed our ties too.

360
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:07,480
Now, we're enemies.

361
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,160
In the future, it's either he perishes,

362
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:15,960
or I perish.

363
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,359
I've broken our brotherly vow.

364
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,160
I will punish myself with another drink.

365
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,599
Little Rock,

366
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,240
was encountering me the worst mistake

367
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,400
you had done in your entire life?

368
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,279
When I encountered you,

369
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,519
when I encountered Wen Rou,

370
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,880
it was as if a lamp
was lit inside my heart.

371
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:03,200
I thought I would never lose my way

372
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,160
as long as the lamp was lit.

373
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,160
I thought I could be a good guy.

374
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,920
But now that you're dead,

375
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:11,920
the lamp has been extinguished.

376
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,119
That's why I have
to bid farewell to my past self.

377
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,799
I don't hate myself.

378
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,119
I don't regret my decision either!

379
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,079
From today onward,

380
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,119
I'll return to
being the true Bai Choufei.

381
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,440
This toast

382
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:55,279
is for me.

383
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:58,599
I would rather die a speaker

384
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:00,839
than survive as a mute.

385
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,240
Master.

386
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:53,799
I never taught you

387
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,400
those sword skills
you were practicing just now.

388
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:59,200
There's actually
a special story behind it.

389
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,240
I fell into a sinkhole

390
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:02,960
before I came to Baimao Stronghold.

391
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,799
I met a skeleton inside the hole.

392
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:06,039
I even had a dream.

393
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,359
The dream was pretty strange.

394
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,599
I was still a child in the dream.

395
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:12,319
I saw someone

396
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,240
showing me the sword skills
I was practicing just now.

397
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:15,759
It was as if he wanted
to teach me the sword skills.

398
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,240
Master,

399
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:21,880
what's wrong?

400
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:27,400
Do you remember

401
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:30,480
that I once asked you
whether you would like

402
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:33,079
to know about your parents
before you left the mountain?

403
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,079
I do.

404
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,799
But Master,

405
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,880
I lied to you back then.

406
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,720
I don't really remember

407
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,440
what happened to my father.

408
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,400
However, I could never forget the scene

409
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:47,519
where my mother died in front of me.

410
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,680
I also found out

411
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,960
the identity of my mother's killer.

412
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,039
It was my Martial Uncle, Thirteen Doom.

413
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:58,599
20 years ago,

414
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:01,759
Thirteen Doom participated
in your father's assassination.

415
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,480
Your Martial Uncle
wasn't the only one involved.

416
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:05,960
In order to kill your father,
Youqiao Group utilized

417
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:08,839
all of the forces under their command.

418
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,880
Your mother broke through
their encirclement together with you.

419
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:15,319
However, she was
still murdered in the end.

420
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,720
And the fate of your father

421
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:20,279
was left unknown.

422
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:22,519
It's been so many years.

423
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:26,039
Many people wish to know
where your father is.

424
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,400
However, no one could find him.

425
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,079
I didn't expect you

426
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,680
to be the one
who encountered him in the end.

427
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,480
My child,

428
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:39,799
your father is the great hero,
Fang Geyin.

429
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,960
The sword skills
you were practicing just now

430
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,279
are swift and fierce.

431
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,240
That is the Blood River Sword Skill

432
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:47,880
that your father had created.

433
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,200
Who are you? What are you doing here?

434
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:32,799
It's nothing.

435
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,799
I'm just here
to make offerings to a late relative.

436
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:35,920
You look unfamiliar to me.

437
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,599
You don't look like a local.

438
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,559
You're right. I'm not a local.

439
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,279
I came from somewhere far away.

440
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:43,519
Since you're not a local,

441
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,279
who are you making offerings to?

442
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:47,880
I'm here to make offerings to my father.

443
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:49,839
What about you?

444
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:52,200
I'm here to make offerings
to my father too.

445
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:53,519
What a coincidence.

446
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,680
I'm sure you miss your father, right?

447
00:31:57,759 --> 00:31:58,400
I do.

448
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,720
I miss him every day.

449
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,440
I still remember
the moments when he hugged me

450
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:03,519
during winter days.

451
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:05,880
He had broad shoulders and warm hands.

452
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,160
Although he has been dead
for a long time,

453
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,160
I've never forgotten those moments.

454
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,319
I'm so envious of you.

455
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,359
I don't even remember
what my father looked like.

456
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:21,519
I don't remember
if he had broad shoulders

457
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:23,160
or warm hands.

458
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:25,240
Has your father
passed away for a long time?

459
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:28,680
It's been over 20 years.

460
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:31,680
I only found out that he was my father

461
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:33,240
lately.

462
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,519
If so, I think it's better
for you to not know that fact.

463
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,920
If so, at least
you won't be heartbroken.

464
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,440
That's not it.

465
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,000
Some people say

466
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,279
that parents are
the lamps of their children.

467
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,160
They travel ahead

468
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:48,440
and guide their children
to their future.

469
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,240
I've been traveling without a lamp

470
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,359
for over 20 years,

471
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,880
and I don't know
if I took the wrong path.

472
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:55,880
However, when I got to know

473
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,720
the kind of person my father used to be,

474
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,440
I felt that
I didn't take the wrong path.

475
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:02,880
I will surely tell him

476
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,039
that I'm his son

477
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,000
if I have the chance to see him again.

478
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,880
You look pretty pitiful.

479
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:09,079
You can have a flatbread.

480
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,920
Thank you.

481
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,480
Don't mention it.

482
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:22,319
Go now.

483
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:55,599
Wen Rou?

484
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,039
I heard everything.

485
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:59,440
Initially, I wanted to comfort you,

486
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,680
but the child beat me to it.

487
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:03,799
I think his arrogant demeanor

488
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,240
is just like you when you were young.

489
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:08,679
Wen Rou,

490
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,119
Master is waiting here
for Official Liu Anshi.

491
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:13,320
Official Liu has obtained
evidence regarding the case.

492
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,960
It's related to the case

493
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,360
where Youqiao Group
had assassinated my father.

494
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,719
If we get our hands on the evidence,

495
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,480
we might have a chance
to topple Chancellor Cai.

496
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:20,599
I know that.

497
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:23,440
So, I would like to...

498
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,679
You don't need to tell me.

499
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,880
I know what you're going to tell me.

500
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,840
You're the son of a great father,

501
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,920
and you're determined
to go against the evil Youqiao Group.

502
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,920
You have to complete
the duty that is given to you.

503
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:34,559
I will keep you company.

504
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:37,440
Initially, I thought that...

505
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,719
You thought that after
crossing the border area

506
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,559
of the north,

507
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:43,039
we could live a happy life

508
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,360
in a place where
no one recognizes us, right?

509
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,639
You do know everything about me.

510
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:50,960
Of course I do.

511
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,079
You have a responsibility to handle now.

512
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,599
Master needs your help too.

513
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,079
That's why we should stay here

514
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,360
for a little longer.

515
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,960
Thank you, Wen Rou.

516
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,320
Why are you thanking me?

517
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,840
As long as I'm together with you,

518
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,840
blissful or risky days

519
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,800
make no difference to me.

520
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:21,840
Wherever you go, I'll follow.

521
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,679
This place is windy.

522
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,840
Let's head back.

523
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,440
Isn't it cold when you're
wearing thin clothing like this?

524
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,000
It's fine.

525
00:35:39,981 --> 00:35:53,473
(Six Half Hall)

526
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:07,840
Back then,

527
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,519
I was the one who wanted to
recruit you and Wang Xiaoshi

528
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:11,519
to join the Six Half Hall.

529
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,599
But now,

530
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,280
I truly don't want you
to step into the Hall.

531
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,320
Do you think you can stop me

532
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,480
from stepping into this place?

533
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:08,119
Have a seat.

534
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,119
Long time no see.

535
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,639
Father told me

536
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,159
that you are a part of Youqiao Group

537
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,320
ever since you were
released from the dungeon.

538
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:31,559
Let me congratulate you

539
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,320
with this toast.

540
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,840
In the past, Su Mengzhen
was the son of the heavens.

541
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:51,480
The Lei family also ruled
half of the martial arts world.

542
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,199
I kept thinking that I was too inferior
to become your friend.

543
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:56,840
But now, with this toast,

544
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,239
I finally have the right
to become your friend.

545
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,440
Thank you for the congratulatory toast.

546
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:09,760
It's truly difficult

547
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,320
for you to get to where you are today.

548
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:14,000
So,

549
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,000
what do you plan to do next?

550
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:20,440
I can do whatever I want.

551
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:23,719
In the past,
I used to work day and night

552
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:25,199
in order to become people like you all.

553
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,559
Powerful people like you all

554
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,360
possess power.

555
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:31,119
With power, you can order people

556
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,519
to fulfill your wishes.

557
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,159
That way, you won't need
to waste any time on them.

558
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,599
I can do plenty of things now.

559
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:42,320
Of course I can do whatever I want.

560
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,280
However, you should know

561
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,000
that I will help you with anything

562
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:54,360
as long as you make the request.

563
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,639
If we join hands,

564
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,960
we can turn the Six Half Hall

565
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,320
into the largest sect
in the martial arts world.

566
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,880
By then,

567
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:14,599
we can rule the martial arts world.

568
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:18,119
All right.

569
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,599
If so, I'll help you
to turn the Six Half Hall

570
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:26,719
into the largest sect

571
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,679
and rule the martial arts world.

572
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:35,159
I don't care how ambitious you are,

573
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,000
but you need to remember this.

574
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,360
The Six Half Hall

575
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:45,760
will always belong to the Lei family.
