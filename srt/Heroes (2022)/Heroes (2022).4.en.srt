Do you know

35
00:02:11,212 --> 00:02:12,332
how nervous and anxious
I was earlier on?

36
00:02:12,893 --> 00:02:13,973
(Li Niantang, House of Sunset Drizzle)
We feel so much relieved,

37
00:02:13,973 --> 00:02:14,653
(Li Niantang, House of Sunset Drizzle)

38
00:02:14,653 --> 00:02:16,292
(Li Niantang, House of Sunset Drizzle)
now that you're awake.

39
00:02:17,132 --> 00:02:17,973
That's right, House Master.

40
00:02:18,373 --> 00:02:19,612
Everyone was worried about you.

41
00:02:20,132 --> 00:02:21,132
Especially Delegate.

42
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,519
(Long Xiaoqing, House of Sunset Drizzle)
His hair turned gray from worrying.

43
00:02:26,572 --> 00:02:28,412
Sounds like he's the one who got ill.

44
00:02:32,093 --> 00:02:33,773
The affairs keep piling up.

45
00:02:34,452 --> 00:02:36,493
Delegate almost burst out of anger
from being too busy.

46
00:02:37,132 --> 00:02:37,933
It's all good now.

47
00:02:38,253 --> 00:02:39,172
Since you're awake,

48
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:40,773
he can finally rest.

49
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,213
I don't think that's a good idea.

50
00:02:44,572 --> 00:02:45,732
House Master
just regained consciousness.

51
00:02:46,172 --> 00:02:47,373
(Mo Beichen, House of Sunset Drizzle)
He should get more rest.

52
00:02:48,053 --> 00:02:49,253
There's no need
to exhaust House Master's energy

53
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:51,892
over trivial matters.

54
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,892
Just let Hua Wucuo do whatever he wants.

55
00:03:03,572 --> 00:03:04,572

- Greetings, Delegate.

56
00:03:04,572 --> 00:03:05,732
House Master, you're finally awake.

57
00:03:07,412 --> 00:03:08,012
Yes.

58
00:03:08,692 --> 00:03:10,612
I was waiting for you.

59
00:03:12,412 --> 00:03:13,852
All right, all of you can leave now.

60
00:03:20,132 --> 00:03:21,213
Just sitting here

61
00:03:21,213 --> 00:03:23,813
is really uncomfortable.

62
00:03:26,012 --> 00:03:26,493
Let's go.

63
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:28,493
Come and take a walk with me.

64
00:03:48,933 --> 00:03:49,533
Mr. Mo.

65
00:03:51,813 --> 00:03:53,292
What is it, Miss Lianxin?

66
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,652
(Liu Lianxin, House of Sunset Drizzle)

67
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:56,412
The physician said we'll have
to change House Master's prescription

68
00:03:56,412 --> 00:03:57,572
after he regains consciousness.

69
00:03:58,373 --> 00:03:59,093
But I'm occupied at the moment.

70
00:03:59,292 --> 00:04:01,852
Can you buy the medicinal herbs for me?

71
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,132
Sure.

72
00:04:03,773 --> 00:04:04,533
Here's the prescription.

73
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:05,213
All right.

74
00:04:05,572 --> 00:04:08,572
Please be careful
with House Master's medicinal herbs.

75
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,584
(If anything happens, stay put.
Stay alive and wait.)

76
00:04:28,093 --> 00:04:28,973
It's cold.

77
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:31,133
Let's go back inside.

78
00:04:32,653 --> 00:04:33,693
It's all right.

79
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:34,893
Let's continue walking.

80
00:04:36,612 --> 00:04:39,693
I have been half awake and half asleep.

81
00:04:39,693 --> 00:04:42,093
I find here

82
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,133
and here

83
00:04:44,732 --> 00:04:46,372
are warm.

84
00:04:47,292 --> 00:04:50,573
It makes me feel comfortable and sleepy.

85
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:52,213
I think

86
00:04:52,653 --> 00:04:55,492
if I were to sleep this comfortably,

87
00:04:56,453 --> 00:04:58,612
I don't think I'll ever wake up.

88
00:05:00,893 --> 00:05:02,252
Lianxin told me

89
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:03,533
that my eyes rolled
to the back of my head

90
00:05:04,372 --> 00:05:06,172
those several days.

91
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,852
House Master, nothing will happen to you
because you're blessed by heaven.

92
00:05:10,973 --> 00:05:13,653
There's a limit to how much one can eat.

93
00:05:14,093 --> 00:05:16,213
I think I almost hit the limit.

94
00:05:22,213 --> 00:05:24,133
When are you going to step down?

95
00:05:24,973 --> 00:05:25,693
Don't forget

96
00:05:26,013 --> 00:05:28,292
that I've got the name list.

97
00:05:48,213 --> 00:05:49,732
Who let you come in?

98
00:05:51,372 --> 00:05:53,653
Delegate, Su Mengzhen has returned.

99
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:54,893
He has the box too.

100
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,333
We must not wait any longer.

101
00:05:57,492 --> 00:05:59,412
Yes, we mustn't wait anymore.

102
00:06:00,573 --> 00:06:04,612
My son will have your head
when he returns.

103
00:06:08,292 --> 00:06:09,573
Listen up.

104
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,773
House Master is gravely ill.

105
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,612
From today on, no one can visit him

106
00:06:16,732 --> 00:06:17,812
without my permission.

107
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:18,893
Yes!

108
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:20,852
Wait.

109
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:28,612
Someone needs to stay with House Master.

110
00:06:29,213 --> 00:06:30,612
Delegate, do you think

111
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:32,893
I'm strong enough
to rescue House Master?

112
00:06:34,573 --> 00:06:35,893
You can stay if you like.

113
00:06:36,453 --> 00:06:37,453
It's your decision to make.

114
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:06,213
Do you know who I am?

115
00:07:06,213 --> 00:07:07,693
My father is Wen Wan,
the Lord of Luoyang,

116
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:08,932
my master is Red Sleeve Nun,

117
00:07:08,932 --> 00:07:10,773
and my martial brother is Su Mengzhen
of the House of Sunset Drizzle.

118
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:12,052
My other two friends may not be famous

119
00:07:12,052 --> 00:07:13,533
in the martial arts world

120
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:14,573
or have very good characters,

121
00:07:14,693 --> 00:07:15,893
but their skills are exceptional.

122
00:07:21,252 --> 00:07:21,812
Sir,

123
00:07:22,573 --> 00:07:23,932
look at your martial sister's character.

124
00:07:23,932 --> 00:07:25,533
You can't blame me for that.

125
00:07:29,052 --> 00:07:31,172
You picked on me!

126
00:07:31,172 --> 00:07:32,973
All of you are in this together!

127
00:07:35,893 --> 00:07:36,773
Get out of my way!

128
00:07:41,852 --> 00:07:44,492
Here, have some grapes.

129
00:07:46,013 --> 00:07:46,533
What?

130
00:07:46,612 --> 00:07:48,573
Do you think I'll forgive you
over these grapes?

131
00:07:49,252 --> 00:07:50,252
You don't like grapes?

132
00:07:50,693 --> 00:07:51,492
I want them!

133
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:53,093
Bad Advisor.

134
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:54,333
All right.

135
00:07:55,093 --> 00:07:56,973
I have already made
the arrangements at this inn.

136
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,412
You can enjoy reminiscing.

137
00:07:58,932 --> 00:07:59,453
Then

138
00:08:00,292 --> 00:08:01,213
I'll join in too.

139
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:02,573
In this wilderness,

140
00:08:02,573 --> 00:08:04,213
I didn't know
you have other friends apart from me.

141
00:08:05,013 --> 00:08:06,093
All the gourmets in this world

142
00:08:06,093 --> 00:08:07,412
are my best friends.

143
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,093
I, the Bad Advisor,
shall head to the kitchen

144
00:08:10,932 --> 00:08:11,612
to enjoy the food.

145
00:08:16,612 --> 00:08:17,412
What is so funny?

146
00:08:18,693 --> 00:08:19,973
You're injured.
Yet, you went out for a fight.

147
00:08:19,973 --> 00:08:21,052
You even dragged my friends with you.

148
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,732
What if something bad happened?

149
00:08:24,013 --> 00:08:25,133
Are you worried about me

150
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:26,573
or your two new friends?

151
00:08:27,412 --> 00:08:28,693
Of course, I'm worried about you.

152
00:08:30,653 --> 00:08:31,612
So, what brings you to the Capital?

153
00:08:33,252 --> 00:08:34,612
I came here

154
00:08:34,612 --> 00:08:35,492
because I miss you.

155
00:08:36,573 --> 00:08:37,693
That's thoughtful of you.

156
00:08:39,532 --> 00:08:41,532
Your father sent me a letter last month.

157
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,933
He said you're at a marriageable age.

158
00:08:44,652 --> 00:08:45,333
When will that be?

159
00:08:45,813 --> 00:08:46,973
When that time comes,
I'll bring a large group of people

160
00:08:46,973 --> 00:08:47,852
to watch your ceremony.

161
00:08:48,892 --> 00:08:51,053
There's no need to rush in this matter.

162
00:08:54,053 --> 00:08:54,652
Wen Rou,

163
00:08:54,813 --> 00:08:56,293
don't tell me you ran away from home.

164
00:08:57,132 --> 00:08:58,453
Of course, not.

165
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:02,333
My father kept forcing me
to attend matchmaking sessions.

166
00:09:02,892 --> 00:09:03,933
I told him I wasn't interested.

167
00:09:03,933 --> 00:09:05,093
He also promised not to do it anymore.

168
00:09:05,372 --> 00:09:07,012
But he still arranged it behind my back.

169
00:09:07,693 --> 00:09:09,012
He even invited the prospect
to our residence.

170
00:09:09,813 --> 00:09:11,252
That's why I left

171
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:13,173
openly.

172
00:09:15,053 --> 00:09:15,892
As expected, you ran away from home.

173
00:09:15,892 --> 00:09:16,492
Get some rest.

174
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:20,333
Don't think
about persuading me to go home.

175
00:09:20,573 --> 00:09:21,453
I'm not going home.

176
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,053
I have finally known why Su Mengzhen

177
00:09:31,053 --> 00:09:32,333
is known all over the world.

178
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:34,413
Any situation will change drastically

179
00:09:34,772 --> 00:09:35,652
when he has his blade.

180
00:09:37,573 --> 00:09:39,053
Someone with high expectations like you
has such an admiration for him.

181
00:09:39,693 --> 00:09:40,573
Now, that's rare.

182
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:44,012
He's the number one hero in the world.
Who doesn't admire him?

183
00:09:46,532 --> 00:09:48,053
I wonder if the man I met today

184
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:50,173
is also on the heroes' list.

185
00:09:51,772 --> 00:09:53,173
I have a feeling I'll meet him again.

186
00:09:54,132 --> 00:09:55,453
There are many hidden talents
in the martial arts world.

187
00:09:55,892 --> 00:09:58,333
We'll always
run into experts like these.

188
00:10:00,293 --> 00:10:00,852
Say,

189
00:10:01,492 --> 00:10:03,293
Wen Rou is Mengzhen's martial sister.

190
00:10:03,612 --> 00:10:04,652
But why does she have poor skills?

191
00:10:06,453 --> 00:10:07,213
Who knows?

192
00:10:12,892 --> 00:10:14,053
Who threw this grape?

193
00:10:15,213 --> 00:10:15,813
Who's that?

194
00:10:17,053 --> 00:10:18,173
So what if I have poor skills?

195
00:10:18,453 --> 00:10:19,333
I can still take you on anyway.

196
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:35,040
(Virtuous and Kindness)

197
00:10:47,573 --> 00:10:48,413
All right. Break it up.

198
00:10:49,453 --> 00:10:50,293
Break it up.

199
00:11:18,573 --> 00:11:19,333
Lianxin,

200
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,933
put down your dagger.

201
00:11:22,732 --> 00:11:24,173
Or else you'll hurt yourself.

202
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,732
Is House Master still awake?

203
00:11:55,413 --> 00:11:58,093
Only dogs squat at the door.

204
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:09,213
Well, I have been a "dog" for long.

205
00:12:16,892 --> 00:12:18,012
What are you doing here?

206
00:12:18,573 --> 00:12:21,693
Your son is returning to the Capital.

207
00:12:23,573 --> 00:12:25,573
You won't be able to kill him.

208
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:28,173
But

209
00:12:29,453 --> 00:12:30,732
you'll die soon.

210
00:12:33,732 --> 00:12:35,732
You'll die soon too.

211
00:12:37,413 --> 00:12:38,892
I'll die in my bed.

212
00:12:39,132 --> 00:12:40,293
But you don't even know

213
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:41,732
where you'll die.

214
00:12:48,892 --> 00:12:50,012
Don't try to fool me.

215
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:54,492
Is my name in the box?

216
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,652
I don't know if it is.

217
00:12:57,173 --> 00:13:00,492
But I'm sure there is one on my coffin.

218
00:13:01,973 --> 00:13:03,053
Won't that be nice?

219
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,732
I can be with you forever.

220
00:13:19,012 --> 00:13:21,612
How did it turn out like this?

221
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:24,132
Of all things,

222
00:13:25,612 --> 00:13:27,693
why was there an ink mark left?

223
00:13:28,852 --> 00:13:29,573
Otherwise,

224
00:13:30,693 --> 00:13:32,892
we'd still be brothers.

225
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:34,573
I have told you.

226
00:13:35,093 --> 00:13:35,973
You can plot against others.

227
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:37,933
But heaven has plans for you.

228
00:13:38,973 --> 00:13:41,252
You can't defeat heaven's will.

229
00:13:43,053 --> 00:13:44,892
Someone read my fortune.

230
00:13:47,132 --> 00:13:49,933
He said I'll live with great fortune
half of my life.

231
00:13:51,012 --> 00:13:53,413
But I'll face an obstacle when I'm 50.

232
00:13:54,573 --> 00:13:55,772
But it's a small hindrance.

233
00:13:57,293 --> 00:13:58,693
I can overcome it easily.

234
00:13:59,933 --> 00:14:02,093
Even if your son is a huge obstacle,

235
00:14:02,532 --> 00:14:04,293
I'll be able to overcome it,

236
00:14:04,293 --> 00:14:05,772
if I put some effort into it.

237
00:14:11,453 --> 00:14:12,652
Go back. It's cold outside.

238
00:14:14,413 --> 00:14:16,732
Go home and wash your neck.

239
00:14:19,933 --> 00:14:21,772
Stubborn old man.

240
00:14:50,012 --> 00:14:51,652
Mengzhen, are you cleaning the seats?

241
00:14:51,652 --> 00:14:52,573
Is there a need for such formality?

242
00:14:55,053 --> 00:14:55,492
Sit.

243
00:15:05,492 --> 00:15:06,453
I must drink to you

244
00:15:06,612 --> 00:15:07,973
for your help.

245
00:15:16,213 --> 00:15:18,492
Mengzhen, we're friends.

246
00:15:18,933 --> 00:15:20,053
No need to be courteous.

247
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:22,252
Today, Di Feijing and I have made a deal

248
00:15:22,612 --> 00:15:24,333
that Six Half Hall will not interfere
in this matter.

249
00:15:25,372 --> 00:15:26,213
Hua Wucuo wants to kill me,

250
00:15:26,372 --> 00:15:27,732
and I'm taking the box
to meet my father.

251
00:15:28,293 --> 00:15:30,213
So I hope both of you can help me again.

252
00:15:31,892 --> 00:15:32,813
How do you want us
to help you, Mengzhen?

253
00:15:34,173 --> 00:15:35,093
The House of Sunset Drizzle

254
00:15:35,093 --> 00:15:37,012
is now heavily guarded
by Hua Wucuo's men.

255
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,693
We can't barge into the building
with only the four of us.

256
00:15:40,132 --> 00:15:41,053
Four?

257
00:15:41,372 --> 00:15:43,173
Mengzhen, aren't there five of us?

258
00:15:43,492 --> 00:15:44,612
Mr. Su didn't count you in

259
00:15:45,053 --> 00:15:45,772
because you have

260
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:47,053
poor martial arts skills.

261
00:15:47,852 --> 00:15:49,573
Mengzhen, how could you not count me in?

262
00:15:50,973 --> 00:15:51,612
It's not funny.

263
00:15:52,612 --> 00:15:53,372
I do have a plan.

264
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,652
Going to the Capital
in the name of Mr. Su

265
00:15:57,012 --> 00:15:58,413
is bound to attract
everyone's attention.

266
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,852
When that time comes, the fake Mr. Su

267
00:16:01,413 --> 00:16:02,453
will be heavily surrounded by troops.

268
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,053
While the real you
will take another route.

269
00:16:05,973 --> 00:16:07,252
After they have dispersed their forces,

270
00:16:07,732 --> 00:16:09,372
we'll barge into
the House of Sunset Drizzle by force.

271
00:16:13,093 --> 00:16:13,813
I think this will work.

272
00:16:15,852 --> 00:16:16,813
Don't be a fool.

273
00:16:16,813 --> 00:16:18,053
Everyone in the Capital
knows what you look like.

274
00:16:18,213 --> 00:16:19,012
That's easy.

275
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:20,173
First of all,

276
00:16:20,933 --> 00:16:21,532
him.

277
00:16:22,852 --> 00:16:23,772
Bad Advisor?

278
00:16:24,293 --> 00:16:24,772
Correct.

279
00:16:25,532 --> 00:16:26,372
Everyone knows

280
00:16:26,732 --> 00:16:28,453
he's always with Mr. Su.

281
00:16:28,652 --> 00:16:29,652
Wherever he is,

282
00:16:30,012 --> 00:16:31,372
Mr. Su will be there.

283
00:16:31,892 --> 00:16:33,532
People also know Mr. Su has

284
00:16:33,973 --> 00:16:35,093
a martial sister.

285
00:16:35,652 --> 00:16:37,652
You're such a good talker.

286
00:16:38,492 --> 00:16:40,413
But you're pretty useful
when it comes to deceiving others.

287
00:16:41,173 --> 00:16:43,372
All right. We'll count you in,
the Heroine Yan of Hanshan Sect.

288
00:16:47,813 --> 00:16:49,173
I'm afraid Miss Wen and I
won't be enough

289
00:16:49,973 --> 00:16:51,413
to convince the people.

290
00:16:52,213 --> 00:16:54,173
We'll need it if we want to convince

291
00:16:54,372 --> 00:16:55,053
it's Su Mengzhen.

292
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:03,612
It's your lucky day.

293
00:17:03,693 --> 00:17:04,772
Not anyone can casually touch

294
00:17:05,173 --> 00:17:06,213
Mengzhen's Red Sleeve Blade.

295
00:17:09,293 --> 00:17:11,653
Since you entrust us with this task,

296
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:12,973
I shall not refuse.

297
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:15,292
Me, too.

298
00:17:15,572 --> 00:17:16,173
Don't forget me.

299
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:20,492
I don't usually thank people verbally.

300
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,572
But I will return your kindness.

301
00:17:24,213 --> 00:17:26,532
Mr. Su, you're taking it too seriously.

302
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,133
My friends are more valuable,

303
00:17:29,853 --> 00:17:30,853
and you're already my friends.

304
00:17:37,213 --> 00:17:40,413
Next, we'll decide
who'll be the substitute.

305
00:17:41,252 --> 00:17:42,092
- Let me do it.
- I'll do it.

306
00:17:45,012 --> 00:17:46,052
You're inexperienced in the ways
of the martial arts world.

307
00:17:46,492 --> 00:17:47,012
Let me do it.

308
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,653
What is it that you want to say?

309
00:17:57,973 --> 00:17:59,413
Bai, can we switch?

310
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:01,092
I'll be the substitute.

311
00:18:02,012 --> 00:18:02,653
Why?

312
00:18:06,532 --> 00:18:07,373
Because I...

313
00:18:10,252 --> 00:18:10,732
All right.

314
00:18:11,052 --> 00:18:12,173
I won't ask further
if you don't want to say it.

315
00:18:13,052 --> 00:18:13,693
We'll switch.

316
00:18:15,653 --> 00:18:16,133
Really?

317
00:18:18,492 --> 00:18:19,292
But if you want to go,

318
00:18:19,693 --> 00:18:20,532
you must be extra careful.

319
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:22,252
It won't be easy to deal
with those old foxes.

320
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:23,933
You'll have to protect Wen Rou
at the same time.

321
00:18:25,173 --> 00:18:25,772
Please rest assured.

322
00:18:26,092 --> 00:18:26,893
When you walk into the lion's den,

323
00:18:26,893 --> 00:18:27,973
you must protect Mengzhen.

324
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,653
Curbing the violent
and protecting the "weak" Su Mengzhen.

325
00:18:39,613 --> 00:18:41,812
Your martial sister sure talks a lot.

326
00:18:42,492 --> 00:18:43,332
She has never stopped talking

327
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:44,373
since I knew her.

328
00:18:44,532 --> 00:18:46,492
It made me quite thirsty
from all that talking.

329
00:18:51,252 --> 00:18:52,012
What on earth is

330
00:18:52,893 --> 00:18:53,772
inside this box?

331
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:54,772
I never open it.

332
00:18:55,413 --> 00:18:56,133
Why don't you guess?

333
00:18:58,853 --> 00:18:59,732
Let me think.

334
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:02,693
Could it be Hua Wucuo's lifeline?

335
00:19:04,653 --> 00:19:05,332
Hua Wucuo

336
00:19:05,572 --> 00:19:06,332
may appear vulgar.

337
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:08,693
But he's pretty cautious.

338
00:19:09,252 --> 00:19:10,332
Since he desires
to take over the position,

339
00:19:10,653 --> 00:19:12,373
I'm sure he has his own forces.

340
00:19:13,213 --> 00:19:14,092
It's not hard to kill him.

341
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,252
But I fear there will be unrest
among the members.

342
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:20,453
Are you worried about House Master?

343
00:19:28,453 --> 00:19:29,252
Return to the House first.

344
00:19:29,772 --> 00:19:31,572
Tell Father that I'll return
to the Capital

345
00:19:32,373 --> 00:19:33,173
and tell him not to worry.

346
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:34,413
Also,

347
00:19:35,052 --> 00:19:35,693
send out the invitations.

348
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,453
Was that your archer?

349
00:19:46,868 --> 00:19:48,427
(Lawless)

350
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:49,173
The Lawless.

351
00:19:49,492 --> 00:19:50,373
I have been raising a group of people.

352
00:19:50,572 --> 00:19:51,413
I'm handing them over to you now.

353
00:19:51,772 --> 00:19:52,933
I don't have to worry
about your efficiency.

354
00:19:54,933 --> 00:19:56,772
The name is pretty interesting.

355
00:19:57,413 --> 00:19:58,732
How long have you been supporting them?

356
00:19:58,973 --> 00:20:00,012
Not long, just five years.

357
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:01,893
It looks like
you have been making preparations.

358
00:20:02,893 --> 00:20:03,653
You handed over

359
00:20:03,653 --> 00:20:04,732
such an important task to two young men.

360
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:07,092
You sure think highly of them.

361
00:20:08,012 --> 00:20:09,092
What do you think?

362
00:20:10,973 --> 00:20:11,772
What do I think?

363
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:14,332
I think

364
00:20:14,453 --> 00:20:16,173
I'll have to see
if they can survive tomorrow.

365
00:20:32,173 --> 00:20:33,332
Why are you here?

366
00:20:33,613 --> 00:20:35,133
Aren't you supposed
to be with Mengzhen?

367
00:20:35,492 --> 00:20:36,492
I switched with Bai.

368
00:20:37,453 --> 00:20:38,213
Why?

369
00:20:38,213 --> 00:20:39,252
Stop asking questions.

370
00:20:40,693 --> 00:20:41,133
Let's go.

371
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:41,613
Get in.

372
00:20:47,853 --> 00:20:48,453
Get in.

373
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,078
(Yiji Inn)

374
00:21:01,161 --> 00:21:03,968
(Yiji Inn)

375
00:21:22,252 --> 00:21:23,213
Why are you looking at me?

376
00:21:24,373 --> 00:21:24,973
Why?

377
00:21:25,613 --> 00:21:26,492
What do you mean "why"?

378
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:27,653
Why?

379
00:21:28,252 --> 00:21:29,012
What is it?

380
00:21:29,012 --> 00:21:30,413
Why did you switch with Cabbage?

381
00:21:30,413 --> 00:21:30,853
I...

382
00:21:31,693 --> 00:21:32,772
I didn't want to keep it from you.

383
00:21:33,933 --> 00:21:34,413
So tell me.

384
00:21:34,772 --> 00:21:35,373
When it comes to skills,

385
00:21:35,653 --> 00:21:36,492
Bai and I are almost similar.

386
00:21:36,893 --> 00:21:37,572
When it comes to danger,

387
00:21:37,893 --> 00:21:39,012
both missions are almost the same.

388
00:21:39,492 --> 00:21:40,252
So it all depends on the partners.

389
00:21:41,012 --> 00:21:42,373
If his partner is Mengzhen,

390
00:21:42,373 --> 00:21:43,173
it'll be safer for him.

391
00:21:43,413 --> 00:21:45,133
He'll be in more danger
if you're his partner.

392
00:21:45,252 --> 00:21:46,413
Do you have something
against my lack of skills?

393
00:21:46,413 --> 00:21:47,133
Yes.

394
00:21:47,133 --> 00:21:47,572
You...

395
00:21:48,012 --> 00:21:48,772
You have poor skills.

396
00:21:49,173 --> 00:21:50,012
So I'm worried.

397
00:21:50,653 --> 00:21:51,693
I'm afraid you might mess things up.

398
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:11,603
(Bianliang)

399
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:12,933
Advisor.

400
00:22:13,413 --> 00:22:14,012
Thank you.

401
00:22:17,693 --> 00:22:18,453
We have arrived at the city gate.

402
00:22:19,012 --> 00:22:20,133
Let's get off the carriage
and walk into the city.

403
00:22:20,613 --> 00:22:22,492
Won't we be found out
if we walk in like this?

404
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:24,693
That's precisely our intention.

405
00:22:25,373 --> 00:22:28,012
We want everyone to know
that Mr. Su is in the Capital.

406
00:22:31,252 --> 00:22:31,772
Come.

407
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,133
Please wait here for a moment.

408
00:22:51,012 --> 00:22:51,492
All right.

409
00:22:52,492 --> 00:22:53,012
Mengzhen,

410
00:22:53,853 --> 00:22:54,613
you don't have your blade.

411
00:22:56,772 --> 00:22:57,453
Use mine.

412
00:23:01,732 --> 00:23:02,413
I never carry any blade

413
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,012
when I meet this person.

414
00:23:08,695 --> 00:23:12,070
(Bianliang)

415
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:25,292
Impressive.

416
00:23:26,373 --> 00:23:28,173
Spectacular!

417
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:29,292
That's impressive.

418
00:23:43,853 --> 00:23:46,373
Incredible!

419
00:23:46,373 --> 00:23:47,052
One more time!

420
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:53,537
(The House of Sages)

421
00:23:58,252 --> 00:23:58,853
Mr. Su.

422
00:23:59,693 --> 00:24:00,252
Mr. Yang.

423
00:24:00,693 --> 00:24:01,292
Mr. Su,

424
00:24:02,893 --> 00:24:03,332
this way, please.

425
00:24:09,213 --> 00:24:09,772
(The House of Sages)
Sir and Miss,

426
00:24:10,453 --> 00:24:11,732
(The House of Sages)
I can only send you to this point.

427
00:24:12,213 --> 00:24:14,772
Please be careful tomorrow.

428
00:24:16,973 --> 00:24:18,853
Sir, I shall take my leave.

429
00:24:22,373 --> 00:24:23,772
Mr. Su, please come inside.

430
00:24:23,793 --> 00:24:25,272
(The House of Sages)

431
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:29,889
(The House of Sages)

432
00:24:33,453 --> 00:24:35,292
It's chaotic in the House now.

433
00:24:36,373 --> 00:24:37,973
Delegate has House Master
under his control.

434
00:24:39,092 --> 00:24:40,133
Beichen and Wukui

435
00:24:40,373 --> 00:24:42,052
aren't saying anything like cowards.

436
00:24:43,052 --> 00:24:43,732
Long,

437
00:24:44,292 --> 00:24:44,933
what about you?

438
00:24:45,653 --> 00:24:47,252
I have already made my choice anyway.

439
00:24:47,732 --> 00:24:49,613
Delegate has been watching over me
until this day.

440
00:24:50,373 --> 00:24:51,812
I'll just follow his lead.

441
00:24:52,732 --> 00:24:55,012
If we compare Delegate's action
to the imperial court,

442
00:24:56,213 --> 00:24:57,772
it's usurping power.

443
00:24:58,572 --> 00:24:59,933
It'll be a change of era.

444
00:25:01,173 --> 00:25:02,613
It's wrong to put it that way.

445
00:25:03,453 --> 00:25:04,772
If Delegate takes over,

446
00:25:05,252 --> 00:25:05,853
we're still

447
00:25:06,332 --> 00:25:07,732
the House of Sunset Drizzle.

448
00:25:08,252 --> 00:25:09,613
He'll make everyone

449
00:25:09,613 --> 00:25:11,373
and the House of Sunset Drizzle
even stronger.

450
00:25:11,933 --> 00:25:12,973
How is that a bad thing?

451
00:25:13,653 --> 00:25:15,052
Speaking of

452
00:25:15,613 --> 00:25:16,653
that sickly Su Mengzhen,

453
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:18,732
he doesn't even know
how long he can live.

454
00:25:19,012 --> 00:25:20,133
Yet, he wants to be the house master?

455
00:25:21,332 --> 00:25:22,133
All right.

456
00:25:22,453 --> 00:25:23,292
Calm down.

457
00:25:23,693 --> 00:25:25,332
We're all on the same side.

458
00:25:25,332 --> 00:25:26,492
Enough talking, then.

459
00:25:27,213 --> 00:25:27,693
Have some meat.

460
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:30,092
Here.

461
00:25:30,332 --> 00:25:30,772
Eat.

462
00:25:34,572 --> 00:25:35,052
What is...

463
00:25:43,246 --> 00:25:44,179
(Invitation)

464
00:25:44,213 --> 00:25:45,812
(Li Niantang. Long Xiaoqing.)

465
00:25:46,453 --> 00:25:47,653
(Please meet me at 9 a.m. tomorrow)

466
00:25:48,012 --> 00:25:48,893
(at the House of Sages.)

467
00:25:49,492 --> 00:25:50,213
(Su Mengzhen.)

468
00:26:42,413 --> 00:26:43,492
It's cold to travel at night.

469
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,252
I have brewed citrus tea for you.

470
00:26:46,213 --> 00:26:47,052
I just returned to the Capital.

471
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,332
So I didn't have time
to prepare other things.

472
00:26:49,893 --> 00:26:50,853
Please bear with it.

473
00:26:53,732 --> 00:26:54,413
Not at all.

474
00:26:55,173 --> 00:26:56,572
Do you know

475
00:26:57,933 --> 00:26:58,772
how long I have been craving this tea?

476
00:27:02,893 --> 00:27:04,052
That advisor of yours

477
00:27:04,732 --> 00:27:06,413
only brews medicinal concoctions
for you.

478
00:27:06,853 --> 00:27:08,133
He doesn't know anything else.

479
00:27:08,653 --> 00:27:09,693
Fortunately, Wen Rou has returned.

480
00:27:10,453 --> 00:27:11,492
So I'm quite relieved.

481
00:27:13,292 --> 00:27:14,133
Compared to Wen Rou,

482
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:16,092
Wuxie is more attentive.

483
00:27:17,812 --> 00:27:18,772
What about me?

484
00:27:22,413 --> 00:27:23,532
No one can compare to you.

485
00:27:36,052 --> 00:27:36,812
Say,

486
00:27:38,213 --> 00:27:39,532
I have been to Xiliu,

487
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:41,772
and I almost got my hand on the box.

488
00:27:45,772 --> 00:27:47,812
Your father told you
to pick up the box

489
00:27:47,973 --> 00:27:49,252
to lure you away.

490
00:27:49,812 --> 00:27:51,532
He never intended to negotiate.

491
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,373
We have made a promise

492
00:27:56,933 --> 00:27:57,732
that we won't discuss

493
00:27:57,853 --> 00:27:59,092
the two sects.

494
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:02,572
It was my fault for breaking the rules.

495
00:28:03,853 --> 00:28:04,693
Would you blame me?

496
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:08,492
Why would I?

497
00:28:09,572 --> 00:28:10,213
But

498
00:28:10,853 --> 00:28:11,572
I'm worried.

499
00:28:13,933 --> 00:28:15,133
You gave up on the box.

500
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:16,653
It'll be harder

501
00:28:16,933 --> 00:28:17,732
for you to return to Six Half Hall.

502
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:19,653
No, it won't be.

503
00:28:21,092 --> 00:28:22,133
With your words,

504
00:28:23,492 --> 00:28:24,292
it won't be hard at all.

505
00:28:32,732 --> 00:28:34,893
I'm sure you've met my two new friends.

506
00:28:38,012 --> 00:28:38,572
What do you think?

507
00:28:38,812 --> 00:28:39,492
Miss Lei,

508
00:28:40,092 --> 00:28:40,893
what do you think?

509
00:28:43,413 --> 00:28:44,653
They have excellent martial arts.

510
00:28:45,373 --> 00:28:47,092
You can say it's rare
among the younger generation.

511
00:28:48,492 --> 00:28:49,893
Wang Xiaoshi has a pure heart.

512
00:28:50,252 --> 00:28:51,772
He's also a man of his word.

513
00:28:52,613 --> 00:28:55,332
Bai Choufei is a very ambitious person.

514
00:28:56,012 --> 00:28:56,812
It's rare

515
00:28:57,292 --> 00:28:58,973
to have his ambitions
matching his capability.

516
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:01,292
Both of them are great talents.

517
00:29:03,373 --> 00:29:05,012
Then they're two strong men.

518
00:29:06,092 --> 00:29:07,373
Have you never thought
of bringing them to your side

519
00:29:07,933 --> 00:29:09,012
when you first met them?

520
00:29:10,052 --> 00:29:11,173
Stop teasing me.

521
00:29:12,173 --> 00:29:13,453
Because of Wen Rou,

522
00:29:13,853 --> 00:29:15,532
Wang Xiaoshi
can never join Six Half Hall.

523
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,213
Bai Choufei won't join

524
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:19,133
because of Wang Xiaoshi either.

525
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,012
In that case,

526
00:29:25,292 --> 00:29:27,052
Wen Rou is more reliable than Wuxie.

527
00:29:29,252 --> 00:29:30,653
Guide them well.

528
00:29:31,173 --> 00:29:32,453
They'll be your great helpers
in the future.

529
00:29:37,572 --> 00:29:38,213
The tea is cold.

530
00:29:39,572 --> 00:29:40,653
I'll change a new one for you.

531
00:29:56,613 --> 00:29:57,133
Your hand is cold.

532
00:29:59,653 --> 00:30:00,252
It's all right.

533
00:30:01,532 --> 00:30:02,292
I feel warm at heart.

534
00:30:11,413 --> 00:30:12,213
I'm Ding Yan,

535
00:30:12,413 --> 00:30:13,373
the manager here.

536
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,133
Mr. Su is my benefactor.

537
00:30:15,532 --> 00:30:17,332
His friends are also my friends.

538
00:30:17,772 --> 00:30:18,653
Thank you, Mister.

539
00:30:19,092 --> 00:30:20,812
I'll tidy up the place for tomorrow.

540
00:30:20,812 --> 00:30:22,732
I'll bring you there to see
if it's to your liking.

541
00:30:23,292 --> 00:30:23,812
Thank you.

542
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,532
You're indeed inexperienced.

543
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:47,052
You're lucky to have me around.

544
00:30:51,653 --> 00:30:52,772
Warm your feet without your shoes on.

545
00:30:53,012 --> 00:30:53,812
You'll feel more comfortable.

546
00:30:55,292 --> 00:30:56,012
My socks are torn.

547
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:57,732
I'm too embarrassed
to take my shoes off.

548
00:30:58,173 --> 00:30:59,572
Where did you buy your socks?

549
00:30:59,853 --> 00:31:00,693
Why were they torn easily?

550
00:31:01,413 --> 00:31:03,012
My master made these socks for me.

551
00:31:03,532 --> 00:31:05,052
He's not good at sewing.

552
00:31:05,653 --> 00:31:07,413
He surely treats you like his son.

553
00:31:08,173 --> 00:31:08,853
Just take them off.

554
00:31:09,052 --> 00:31:09,812
I won't look.

555
00:31:10,092 --> 00:31:11,492
I'll check to see
if there's anything to eat.

556
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,252
I bought this chess parlor.

557
00:32:06,413 --> 00:32:08,252
This lamp is always there.

558
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:14,532
The perpetual light

559
00:32:14,973 --> 00:32:16,092
lit the shadow of dreams
for half of the night.

560
00:32:23,613 --> 00:32:24,133
Mengzhen,

561
00:32:26,092 --> 00:32:27,213
you'll succeed as the house master

562
00:32:28,133 --> 00:32:29,893
after the battle tomorrow.

563
00:32:31,173 --> 00:32:34,012
Your every move will affect
the martial arts world.

564
00:32:36,173 --> 00:32:37,572
It'll be hard

565
00:32:38,052 --> 00:32:38,933
for us to meet again in the future.

566
00:32:40,332 --> 00:32:40,853
It won't be hard.

567
00:32:43,012 --> 00:32:43,893
After I become the house master,

568
00:32:44,772 --> 00:32:46,492
the only person in the world
who can stop us from meeting each other

569
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:48,213
will be your father.

570
00:32:52,893 --> 00:32:53,373
Go back.

571
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:55,772
You've left the Capital
for quite some time.

572
00:32:56,292 --> 00:32:57,453
It's time for you to see him.

573
00:33:31,613 --> 00:33:32,213
Let's go.

574
00:34:46,172 --> 00:34:47,933
Rouge! Powder!

575
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:52,893
Mantou! Steamy hot mantou!

576
00:34:58,212 --> 00:34:59,893
Fans with printed flowers!

577
00:35:06,612 --> 00:35:08,293
Two guests, upstairs.

578
00:35:14,092 --> 00:35:14,973
You're up early.

579
00:35:15,293 --> 00:35:15,973
Why didn't you sleep in?

580
00:35:19,572 --> 00:35:20,293
I'm enjoying the view.

581
00:35:21,933 --> 00:35:23,373
But the window is closed.

582
00:35:23,652 --> 00:35:24,652
How can you enjoy the view?

583
00:35:26,572 --> 00:35:27,092
I'm listening.

584
00:35:29,813 --> 00:35:31,253
The stalls outside are open.

585
00:35:31,933 --> 00:35:33,853
There's a mantou stall
on the ground floor.

586
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:35,212
Also,

587
00:35:35,453 --> 00:35:37,893
the wagon has commuted here twice.

588
00:35:38,773 --> 00:35:39,773
It's different from Baixu Garden.

589
00:35:40,893 --> 00:35:42,052
Every place is different in its way.

590
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,172
Like the sound of birdsong.

591
00:35:44,973 --> 00:35:46,012
The Capital is a prosperous place.

592
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:47,893
There are people everywhere.

593
00:35:49,253 --> 00:35:50,853
Life here is different
from Baixu Garden.

594
00:35:54,453 --> 00:35:56,253
Can you hear what's in here, then?

595
00:36:02,733 --> 00:36:04,132
I'm not good at needlework.

596
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:05,333
So it looks rough.

597
00:36:05,773 --> 00:36:07,333
Just make do with them and wear them.

598
00:36:11,293 --> 00:36:12,212
I don't think this is right.

599
00:36:14,293 --> 00:36:16,492
I grew up with Mengzhen.

600
00:36:16,733 --> 00:36:17,853
So he's my family.

601
00:36:18,132 --> 00:36:19,012
Since you help my family,

602
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:20,692
I made these socks to thank you.

603
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:22,692
So there's nothing wrong with it.

604
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:27,692
Thank you, Wen Rou.

605
00:36:33,212 --> 00:36:33,733
By the way,

606
00:36:34,052 --> 00:36:35,532
your figure is similar to Mengzhen.

607
00:36:36,012 --> 00:36:37,052
It'll be easy to disguise as him.

608
00:36:37,492 --> 00:36:40,333
But what about the voice?

609
00:36:44,012 --> 00:36:45,333
Those people are very cunning.

610
00:36:46,253 --> 00:36:47,212
But Little Rock will outwit them.

611
00:36:48,052 --> 00:36:48,652
He'll definitely fool them.

612
00:36:50,052 --> 00:36:51,132
How did you do it?

613
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:52,092
That's impressive.

614
00:36:52,572 --> 00:36:54,333
I learned how to imitate bird calls
in the mountain.

615
00:36:54,773 --> 00:36:56,692
After a while,
I managed to sound like others.

616
00:36:56,853 --> 00:36:58,293
Not bad. Why don't you try it again?

617
00:37:03,692 --> 00:37:04,733
I'm Su Mengzhen.

618
00:37:05,572 --> 00:37:06,853
This is my martial sister, Wen Rou.

619
00:37:08,652 --> 00:37:09,853
Her name may sound gentle.

620
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,453
But she's not gentle at all.

621
00:37:13,172 --> 00:37:14,853
Mengzhen would never say that.

622
00:37:15,172 --> 00:37:16,172
You must be firm.

623
00:37:17,092 --> 00:37:19,333
Wang Xiaoshi, I'll beat you

624
00:37:19,692 --> 00:37:20,853
if you pick on Wen Rou.

625
00:37:21,212 --> 00:37:21,612
Mengzhen

626
00:37:21,612 --> 00:37:22,773
doesn't speak that way at all.

627
00:37:23,253 --> 00:37:24,532
It doesn't matter what is being said.

628
00:37:24,853 --> 00:37:26,212
You'll have to bring it to play
when the time comes.

629
00:37:26,853 --> 00:37:28,052
You sound almost like him.

630
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:29,612
You must maintain this intonation.

631
00:37:30,212 --> 00:37:31,492
Imagine that you're Mengzhen,

632
00:37:31,692 --> 00:37:32,572
who fights and eliminates evil.

633
00:37:33,212 --> 00:37:34,012
Practice more.

634
00:37:34,893 --> 00:37:35,532
All right.

635
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,373
There's such a strong smell
of smoke in here.

636
00:37:39,773 --> 00:37:40,813
I'll open the window for ventilation.

637
00:37:45,652 --> 00:37:46,572
There might be spies outside.

638
00:37:47,172 --> 00:37:47,813
Don't open the window.

639
00:38:02,253 --> 00:38:04,373
I'll check to see if breakfast is ready.

640
00:38:32,052 --> 00:38:32,612
Delegate.

641
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:35,253
Jiansan,

642
00:38:36,092 --> 00:38:37,333
is it really hard

643
00:38:37,813 --> 00:38:39,253
to kill Su Mengzhen?

644
00:38:39,652 --> 00:38:40,453
I think

645
00:38:40,453 --> 00:38:41,813
it's still possible

646
00:38:41,813 --> 00:38:43,052
to kill him.

647
00:38:43,973 --> 00:38:45,253
He always travels alone

648
00:38:45,612 --> 00:38:46,532
without any guards all these years.

649
00:38:47,652 --> 00:38:48,893
I think so too.

650
00:38:51,092 --> 00:38:52,373
At first,

651
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:54,652
I thought Gu Dong could kill him.

652
00:38:56,052 --> 00:38:58,052
But he died in his hand instead.

653
00:38:59,052 --> 00:39:00,132
Does Su Mengzhen have

654
00:39:02,453 --> 00:39:03,893
that good martial arts skills?

655
00:39:07,532 --> 00:39:09,212
No matter how skillful a person is,

656
00:39:10,052 --> 00:39:11,973
he can't fight ten people at one time.

657
00:39:15,973 --> 00:39:16,572
Delegate,

658
00:39:18,572 --> 00:39:20,413
Su Mengzhen has also sent invitations

659
00:39:20,413 --> 00:39:21,492
to the other four Keepers.

660
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:22,933
I heard they're meeting him today.

661
00:39:23,373 --> 00:39:25,492
Li Niantang and Long Xiaoqing
are your supporters, of course.

662
00:39:25,853 --> 00:39:26,373
However,

663
00:39:27,132 --> 00:39:28,893
I can't see through

664
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:31,652
Mo Beichen and Shi Wukui.

665
00:39:32,612 --> 00:39:34,333
Those two are fence-sitters.

666
00:39:34,853 --> 00:39:35,933
After I become the house master,

667
00:39:37,212 --> 00:39:38,092
I'll deal with them.

668
00:39:48,733 --> 00:39:49,612
Gather the men

669
00:39:50,933 --> 00:39:53,092
to meet Su Mengzhen.

670
00:40:15,853 --> 00:40:17,253
I waited for so long.

671
00:40:17,253 --> 00:40:19,092
I've finally waited
for this day to come.

672
00:41:00,572 --> 00:41:02,012
(Bulrush is strong like silk,)

673
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:04,692
(and a rock is hard to move.)

674
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:08,052
(The flashes and shadows of blades)

675
00:41:09,413 --> 00:41:11,853
(can never make me give up
my original aspiration.)

676
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,012
(Blood River, Red Sleeve)

677
00:41:20,012 --> 00:41:20,853
(Silencer, and Retainment.)

678
00:41:23,813 --> 00:41:26,132
They're the four legendary weapons
in the martial arts world.

679
00:41:27,253 --> 00:41:29,012
Hero Fang Geyin's Blood River Sword,

680
00:41:29,373 --> 00:41:30,333
my Red Sleeve Blade,

681
00:41:30,733 --> 00:41:31,893
Lei Sun's Silencer,

682
00:41:32,692 --> 00:41:33,853
and Retainment.

683
00:41:34,853 --> 00:41:36,293
No one has ever seen
what Retainment looks like.

684
00:41:37,773 --> 00:41:38,373
But

685
00:41:39,132 --> 00:41:40,373
it's now in your hand.

686
00:41:42,612 --> 00:41:43,692
When my master passed it down to me,

687
00:41:44,453 --> 00:41:45,692
he only told me it's called Retainment.

688
00:41:46,092 --> 00:41:47,893
I didn't know it's well-known
in the martial arts world.

689
00:41:48,012 --> 00:41:48,973
It's the case for some people.

690
00:41:49,293 --> 00:41:50,373
Their names still spread far and wide

691
00:41:50,773 --> 00:41:52,052
even when they live quiet lives
in the remote mountains.

692
00:41:53,413 --> 00:41:54,612
Longing and Retainment

693
00:41:54,933 --> 00:41:56,293
are the world's most famous techniques.

694
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:58,172
To pose as Su Mengzhen,

695
00:41:58,612 --> 00:41:59,813
you must learn
the Red Sleeve Blade techniques.

696
00:42:00,612 --> 00:42:01,373
Red Sleeve Blade techniques?

697
00:42:01,692 --> 00:42:03,172
My master, Red Sleeve Nun, passed down

698
00:42:04,413 --> 00:42:06,532
the Sunset Drizzle
Red Sleeve Blade Technique to me.

699
00:42:07,373 --> 00:42:09,853
I mastered it through my hard work.

700
00:42:11,813 --> 00:42:12,492
Other than you,

701
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:13,492
I never passed these techniques
to anyone.

702
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:16,773
But I can't master

703
00:42:17,132 --> 00:42:18,373
your techniques in a day.

704
00:42:19,853 --> 00:42:20,733
You don't have to learn
all of the techniques.

705
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:22,212
You only need to learn one technique.

706
00:42:25,492 --> 00:42:27,092
When martial artists see this,

707
00:42:27,453 --> 00:42:28,253
they will be convinced.

708
00:42:57,253 --> 00:42:57,933
