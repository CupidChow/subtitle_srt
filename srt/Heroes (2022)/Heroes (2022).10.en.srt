I know Mr. Su agreed to your conditions.

54
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,240
Go up.

55
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,280
Your ceremony of becoming
a Vice House Master is upstairs.

56
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,680
Go.

57
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,479
Greetings, Mister.

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,879
This is...

59
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,840
House Master knows
you are here in the Capital

60
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,120
and want the best liquor.

61
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,159
But the Capital is full of liquor shops.

62
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,439
No one dares to say

63
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,439
which is the best liquor.

64
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,759
We went all over the Capital

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,599
to get you
the most expensive bottle of liquor.

66
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,960
It's called The Sky.

67
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,960
Being at the highest place
of House of Sunset Drizzle,

68
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,680
perhaps it can be considered
the best liquor.

69
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,960
The best horse is the Wuhua horse.

70
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,280
The sky is the limit.

71
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,599
You are right.

72
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,080
Besides,

73
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:13,400
this tranquil room is located
at the highest spot of White Tower.

74
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,520
And there's a rule.

75
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:18,600
Only the House Masters
can enter this room.

76
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,879
Obviously, the current House Master
of Sunset Drizzle is Mr. Su.

77
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,680
The reason why
House Master invited you

78
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,319
to drink liquor here is obvious.

79
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:32,160
Mister. After drinking this liquor,

80
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,639
I have to call you
Vice House Master Bai.

81
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,439
Thank you.

82
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,759
Please.

The House doesn't keep
any secrets from you two.

95
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,959
We show you every key department.

96
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,639
Next, it's time
for both of you to be honest.

97
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,079
How do we do that?

98
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,839
Do you want us to tell you anything?

99
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,480
We have a better way.

100
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,759
He will show you.

101

(Bai Choufei)

102
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,319
Bai Choufei.

103
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,720
26 years old.

104
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,040
Unrestrained and arrogant.

105
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,800
He often puts his hands behind his back
and looks at the sky.

106
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,199
His actions are unpredictable.

107
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,519
He shows no mercy.

108
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,160
There's a black mark
under his left chest,

109
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,920
that's as big as a fingernail.

110
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,160
Did someone

111
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,720
really see me taking a bath?

112
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,360
Keep going.

113
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,800
Bai Choufei used the name Bai Youmeng

114
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,600
and sang at Qinyuanchun in Luoyang.

115
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,360
He used the name Bai Yingyang

116
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,360
to work as an escort at Jinhua Escort.

117
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:18,920
He used the name Bai Jinlong

118
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,639
to become champion at the
Sanjiang Heroes Martial Arts Tournament.

119
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,360
I didn't expect you
to have so much experience.

120
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,600
It's not having a lot of experience.

121
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,720
It's experiencing a lot of hardships.

122
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
You are ambitious,

123
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,439
but you haven't fulfilled your ambition.

124
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,839
That's because

125
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,639
you are looking for great achievements.

126
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,800
You are not interested
in small achievements.

127
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,360
Read about his martial arts experience.

128
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,639
It's fine.

129
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:46,439
Big Brother.

130
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,879
How many people in the House
have access to this information?

131
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,839
Besides you, including me,

132
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,720
three people.

133
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,079
I am the fourth person.

134
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:55,519
I heard it.

135
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,199
Fine.

136
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,959
I don't want a fifth person to find out.

137
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:04,879
Sure.

138
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:06,839
Next person.

139
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,514
(Wang Xiaoshi)

140
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,519
Why are you all looking at me?

141
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,519
I really have nothing.

142
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,519
Nothing. Right.

143
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,680
It's true.

144
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,799
Read it.

145
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,200
Wang Xiaoshi.

146
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,639
20 years old.

147
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,440
Foster father, Wang Tianliu.

148
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,720
Sister, Wang Pingping.

149
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,240
Learned martial arts in Carefree Sect.

150
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,759
The only disciple of Recluse Tianyi.

151
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,320
His weapon is Longing and Retainment.

152
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:52,399
Likes to make friends
regardless of their status.

153
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,080
Nosy.

154
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,840
But when he fights with people
who don't know martial arts,

155
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,759
he will not use martial arts
to bully them.

156
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
He had a record of
escaping with injuries

157
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,440
after getting beaten up
by seven ruffians.

158
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,679
He is bad at martial arts.
Don't find excuses for him.

159
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,480
You...

160
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:09,759
Advisor is right.

161
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,399
Full of emotions.

162
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,600
His first love was when he was 13.

163
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,960
He had 15 heartbreaks up until now.

164
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:22,720
Not bad.

165
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:23,879
Wang Xiaoshi.

166
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,360
You are good at hiding.

167
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,399
Once every half a year.

168
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:28,279
Incredible.

169
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,399
No wonder you went to

170
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,279
House of Sanhe immediately
after entering the Capital.

171
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:32,279
Shameless. Vulgar.

172
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,720
This is not right.
Something's wrong with this.

173
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,679
Your information is wrong.

174
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,679
There's no problem with the information.

175
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,320
The mark on my left chest is the proof.

176
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,279
- This must be a misunderstanding.
- Wang Xiaoshi.

177
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,240
No wonder you didn't admit

178
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,960
going to House of Sanhe.

179
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,240
A man must be brave enough
to admit what he did.

180
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,320
But I didn't do it, Wen Rou.

181
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,919
No. Listen to me.

182
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,799
No.

183
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,200
Wen Rou.

184
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:54,840
Advisor, why didn't you help me explain?

185
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,799
No. I...

186
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,840
I'm not reading it anymore.

187
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,399
That's all for today.

188
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,919
I'm not reading it anymore.

189
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,879
What do you mean?

190
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:06,840
The House's Messenger Pigeon Group

191
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,720
was established by this Advisor.

192
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,440
His martial arts
are not as good as Di Feijing's.

193
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,320
But no one is better than him

194
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,000
in information gathering.

195
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,360
Mengzhen.

196
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,559
Is that the end
of our House admission present?

197
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:20,960
This is not the present.

198
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,159
The present

199
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:25,039
is a house that I'm giving to you.

200
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,600
Go and take a look.

201
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,240
Thank you, Mengzhen.

202
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:49,879
Looking at the fish?

203
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,600
Is your information really correct?

204
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:53,759
Yes.

205
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,200
No.

206
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,480
There must be a problem.

207
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,240
What is it?

208
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,120
You told me

209
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,759
Wang Xiaoshi was at House of Sanhe

210
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,440
because Zhu Xiaoyao played a prank.

211
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:06,440
Is that the truth?

212
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,480
Miss Xiaoyao told me herself.

213
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,159
It's true.

214
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:11,759
Even if you don't believe me,

215
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,240
you should believe Little Rock.

216
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,240
Do you think he's capable enough

217
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,840
to cause trouble at House of Sanhe?

218
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,440
That's right.

219
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,559
He can't even cause trouble
at the House of Sanhe.

220
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,480
How could he have so many heartbreaks?

221
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,960
Your information is fake.

222
00:11:30,073 --> 00:11:32,933
(Moon)

223
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,240
We finally have a place

224
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,679
to settle down in the Capital.

225
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,320
You're still feeling troubled?

226
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:45,600
It's fine.

227
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,559
I'll help you explain to Wen Rou later.

228
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,559
No.

229
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,120
I'm looking at this rock.

230
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,200
It's too ugly.

231
00:11:51,387 --> 00:11:53,285
(Ugly Rock House)

232
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,480
That's what Taihu Rock looks like.

233
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,240
If you don't like it,

234
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:58,720
we'll remove it later.

235
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,000
Stop looking.

236
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,080
Let's look at the room. Let's go.

237
00:12:06,287 --> 00:12:11,800
(Ugly Rock House)

238
00:12:11,873 --> 00:12:13,615
(Chou)

239
00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:20,520
(Chou Shi House)

240
00:12:24,581 --> 00:12:26,509
(Fu's Residence)

241
00:12:26,628 --> 00:12:28,315
(Fu's Residence)

242
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,559
Is it him?

243
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:47,399
Yes.

244
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,120
It's him.

245
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:55,840
You...

246
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,120
You have always been
managing business up north.

247
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,519
How could they discover it
and even kill him,

248
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:03,879
even though it's so hidden?

249
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,159
Tell me.

250
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,720
How much did Su Mengzhen find out?

251
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,519
He doesn't know anything.

252
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,759
No?

253
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,519
Transportation and contact

254
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,279
for the business up north
have always been separated.

255
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:20,399
Last month, the transport group
didn't see the contact

256
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,759
at the border.

257
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,159
However, we secured the goods.

258
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,639
Think about it.

259
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:28,120
If Su Mengzhen knew something,

260
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,279
why didn't he take away the goods?

261
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:39,559
Reasonable.

262
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:43,039
He's reasonable.

263
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:46,440
It's reasonable.

264
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,279
That means Su Mengzhen is clueless.

265
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,360
He is bluffing.

266
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:58,200
He dares to bluff me?

267
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,200
The goods haven't been delivered yet.

268
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:02,960
We can still keep it hidden for a while.

269
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,039
But Su Mengzhen

270
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,919
is already investigating
our business up north.

271
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,120
So, we have to change

272
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,480
this line.

273
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,080
Not only that.

274
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,840
We need to teach Su Mengzhen a lesson.

275
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,919
I will

276
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,639
help you do it.

277
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,559
Chief Elder, is there
a chance to save this situation?

278
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:34,960
What else can I do?

279
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,120
He has all the power in his hands.

280
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,000
Since we got into this situation,

281
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,080
we need to pay a price
to get ourselves out of it.

282
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,159
Business up north has always been risky.

283
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,840
But too much blood has been spilled.

284
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:51,679
If you're afraid
that killing will dirty your hands,

285
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:53,360
just leave the killing to me.

286
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,639
You can go and teach Su Mengzhen

287
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,840
a lesson.

288
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,039
Yes.

289
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,600
Why are you in a rush?

290
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,799
I'm afraid the tea will get cold.

291
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:18,360
I'll slap your mouth
if you don't tell me the truth.

292
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,799
The truth is what you want to hear too.

293
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,679
Well,

294
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:23,480
I heard

295
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,240
Mr. Wang and Mr. Bai

296
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,559
wanted to leave the Capital
this morning.

297
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:30,039
But both of them came back

298
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,879
half a day after they left the gates.

299
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,679
They even went into
the House of Sunset Drizzle directly.

300
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,480
Your investigation is really detailed.

301
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,600
It feels like
you were following them instead.

302
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,120
I also heard it from others.

303
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:43,200
That's great.

304
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,879
They finally got their wishes.

305
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:47,360
Help me write a letter

306
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,639
and send it to House of Sunset Drizzle

307
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,519
for Wen Rou.

308
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,799
After that, make a reservation
at Fenglin Restaurant.

309
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,799
I want to invite them
to the banquet tonight.

310
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:54,720
So grand?

311
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,120
You really fancy both of them.

312
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,600
Oh.

313
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:01,919
Don't use my real name.

314
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,679
Understand.

315
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,120
Small toys! Small items!

316
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:11,440
Mr. Long.

317
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,759
Get me more liquor and any kind of food.

318
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,000
Mr. Long, wait.

319
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,799
What is it?

320
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:18,399
Mr. Long, someone
is waiting for you inside.

321
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,039
This restaurant is mine.

322
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,120
I've never served people
from Six Half Hall.

323
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,840
Just say what you want to say.

324
00:16:55,712 --> 00:16:57,240
Since Mr. Su became the House Master,

325
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:59,120
I wonder if you've been living

326
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,519
a good life, Mr. Long.

327
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,960
How is that

328
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:03,960
any of your business?

329
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,920
Recently,

330
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:07,759
I heard Mr. Su became sworn brothers

331
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:08,799
with Bai Choufei and Wang Xiaoshi.

332
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,359
He even gave Bai Choufei
the position of Vice House Master.

333
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,480
House of Sunset Drizzle
has been established for 50 years.

334
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:15,920
It's still my first time

335
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,200
hearing about
the position of a Vice House Master.

336
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,599
It is a position
that even Hua Wucuo didn't get.

337
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,559
However,

338
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,039
it has been given to an unknown man now.

339
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,799
I'm not happy that Bai Choufei
became the Vice House Master.

340
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:32,160
But you are obviously
trying to alienate us.

341
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,359
I'm telling you.

342
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,119
What you are doing now

343
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:36,079
is useless to me.

344
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,759
Fine.

345
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:38,160
I'll say something useful then.

346
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,519
Do you know

347
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,040
what is inside the white jade box

348
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,960
that made Hua Wucuo fall?

349
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:50,480
There was evidence inside

350
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:51,960
that proved Hua Wucuo

351
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,640
was an undercover

352
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,440
Six Half Hall planted
at House of Sunset Drizzle.

353
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:56,519
Nonsense!

354
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,359
Seems like you don't believe me.

355
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,759
All Six Half Hall members

356
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,559
have to write a pledge.

357
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,400
They can redeem it

358
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,680
when they leave.

359
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,599
You were nurtured by Hua Wucuo.

360
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,079
I'm sure you recognize his handwriting.

361
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,334
(Drafter, Hua Wucuo)

362
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,839
Mr. Long.

363
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,480
Your fate with Six Half Hall

364
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,720
had already intertwined

365
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,240
when you were with Hua Wucuo.

366
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,200
Now that House of Sunset Drizzle

367
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,640
became like this,

368
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:33,720
you no longer have a foothold.

369
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,400
Why are you still enduring?

370
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,000
Chun.

371
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,359
Chun.

372
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:15,160
Wen Rou.

373
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:16,960
Miss Tian.

374
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:18,160
Miss Tian.

375
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:19,279
Thanks for waiting.

376
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:20,400
Please sit.

377
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:21,519
All right.

378
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,480
The dishes are here.

379
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,599
Serve them.

380
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:28,359
I simply ordered.

381
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:30,480
I don't know if they suit you.

382
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:34,960
Miss. Tell me if you need anything.

383
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,680
I'll excuse myself.

384
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:42,000
I went to
House of Sunset Drizzle to find you.

385
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:42,960
They told me

386
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,799
Miss Wen was grounded.

387
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,680
What trouble did you cause

388
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,920
at the Capital

389
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,279
that made you grounded
by House of Sunset Drizzle?

390
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:51,039
I didn't cause any trouble.

391
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:52,160
It's all my martial brother's fault.

392
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,640
Forget it.

393
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,279
But my martial brother is someone great.

394
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:57,480
If there's a chance,

395
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:59,480
I must introduce him to you.

396
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:01,200
Everyone in the Capital knows

397
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:02,640
Su Mengzhen, the Greatest Swordsman.

398
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,039
It would be nice

399
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:04,799
if I get to meet him.

400
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,279
Chun.

401
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:07,680
Little Rock and Cabbage

402
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,359
have both joined
House of Sunset Drizzle.

403
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,759
They also became
sworn brothers with Mengzhen.

404
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:13,119
Although both of them
are not better than Mengzhen,

405
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,200
they are dependable
when something bad happens.

406
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,960
Along with me, the Hanshan Swallow,

407
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,880
no one can bully you in the Capital.

408
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,279
Sure.

409
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,920
I'll depend on all of you.

410
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,599
Chun, your hair stick looks nice.

411
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,440
It makes you even prettier.

412
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,519
Yours looks cute too.

413
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:31,519
It's like a candy.

414
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,519
Very sweet.

415
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:35,960
What are you laughing at?

416
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:39,400
I think

417
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,640
both of you look like real siblings.

418
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,640
Of course.

419
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,240
Chun and I get along well.

420
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,480
Isn't it the same with you and Cabbage?

421
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,279
Little Rock and I

422
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,119
are cool and hot-headed.
We complement each other.

423
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,440
Chun and I are cool and hot-headed too.

424
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,160
We complement each other.

425
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:53,519
You are pretty and ugly,

426
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:54,279
gentle and rude.

427
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:58,039
Little Rock, how can you
say Chun is ugly?

428
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,759
Chun...

429
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,359
- Little Rock is talking about you.
- Little Rock is...

430
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,519
Fine.

431
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,519
I'm the ugly one.

432
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,480
Fine. Don't be angry.

433
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:13,039
By the way,

434
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,279
Mengzhen is benevolent, righteous,

435
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,519
and genuine.

436
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,160
Since you became brothers with him

437
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,519
and got an important position
at House of Sunset Drizzle,

438
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,039
both of you will have a bright future.

439
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:24,599
Come.

440
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,279
I hope you have a bright future
at House of Sunset Drizzle.

441
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,519
And let's celebrate the four of us
meeting each other again.

442
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,279
Cheers.

443
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,119
Cheers.

444
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:31,920
Cheers.

445
00:21:32,562 --> 00:21:33,812
(Fenglin Restaurant)

446
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,799
It's happy to gather today.

447
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:39,799
We should meet more in the future.

448
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:42,200
Come to the House and I will
visit your residence in the future.

449
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:43,960
We will definitely meet more often.

450
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,240
Otherwise, I only have them with me.

451
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:46,960
It's boring.

452
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:49,279
Fine. I promise.

453
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,960
We will meet soon.

454
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:54,359
I'll be leaving.

455
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,720
Miss, where's your hair stick?

456
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,400
Return to Fenglin Restaurant.

457
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,279
Miss, I'll go look over there.

458
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:30,960
Mr. Bai?

459
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:36,759
Miss Tian.

460
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,920
Why are you still here?

461
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,799
The scenery is beautiful.

462
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,440
I plan to stay a while longer.

463
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:49,680
Miss Tian.

464
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:52,160
Are you looking for this?

465
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,000
This is it.

466
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,400
Thanks to you.

467
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,799
This hair stick is very important to me.

468
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,920
It's a relief that I came back.

469
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,920
Do you know the legend of
the Capital's Dragon and Phoenix House?

470
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:14,920
Dragon House is the House of Sanhe.

471
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:16,880
It's luxurious on the outside

472
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,039
and there are
many people with hidden talents there.

473
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,759
It's a place of heroes.

474
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,200
That is why
it is called the Dragon House.

475
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:24,519
This place is the Phoenix House.

476
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,200
It shows its elegance.

477
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,279
The view is especially pretty at night.

478
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,599
Flowers fall for miles
to show the heart of the lake.

479
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,400
It's indeed beautiful.

480
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:50,640
I heard you playing the Qin

481
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,240
without giving anything in return.

482
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,880
Today, let me
play the flute for you in return.

483
00:23:57,759 --> 00:23:58,759
I hope you don't mind.

484
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,279
Sit.

485
00:24:41,778 --> 00:24:44,246
(Six Half Hall)

486
00:24:47,941 --> 00:24:49,979
(Bright Skies and Morning Sun)

487
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,332
(Lei Chong, Six Half Hall)

488
00:24:55,483 --> 00:24:56,382
(Good Health and Long Life)

489
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:57,960
Chief Elder Lei!

490
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:02,839
Many years ago,

491
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,160
when I got you all
out from the prison

492
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,440
to help me manage the business up north,

493
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,480
(Good Health and Long Life)
I told all of you

494
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:13,079
that you had been sentenced to death.

495
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:17,640
Every day you live

496
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,359
and every bit of money you earn

497
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,200
is for your family.

498
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:22,920
But I'm sorry.

499
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,480
That's all the money you can earn.

500
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:29,079
If there's any extra,

501
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,920
I will get someone
to send it to your family.

502
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,640
Don't worry.

503
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,680
Chief Elder Lei.

504
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:42,720
Is there another way?

505
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:45,000
We only want to live.

506
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,119
There's a person

507
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:49,240
in this well.

508
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:52,839
He used to manage business up north too.

509
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,400
He has been imprisoned
in this well for eight years.

510
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:57,839
For eight years,

511
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,680
he never came out

512
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,319
for one single day.

513
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,519
Also,

514
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:05,119
since he is alive,
his family has to die.

515
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:07,599
All of you can choose this too.

516
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,429
Chief Elder Lei, thank you
for letting me live a few more years.

517
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,599
I'm returning my life

518
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:19,640
to you.

519
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,839
Get their family

520
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:55,400
to accompany them.

521
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,480
There are many people left to kill.

522
00:26:58,119 --> 00:26:58,640
I'm afraid...

523
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,319
The Ministry of Justice
won't be doing their rounds tonight.

524
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,960
Just get it done before daybreak.

525
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:05,880
Yes.

526
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,960
Did the contact
that Su Mengzhen brought back

527
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:12,079
have any family members in the Capital?

528
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:12,880
Yes.

529
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,839
Don't blame me.

530
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,400
Don't blame me.

531
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,519
If you have to blame,

532
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:32,519
blame Su Mengzhen
for targeting my business up north.

533
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:36,319
If you become a ghost,

534
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,440
find him to get your revenge.

535
00:27:51,443 --> 00:27:58,755
(Clock)

536
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,160
Minister's order.

537
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,400
Tonight's city patrol
has to be rearranged.

538
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,640
Return to the camp
and await further orders.

539
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:20,039
Yes!

540
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:21,119
Move!

541
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:37,319
First Elder.

542
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:42,920
All of you.

543
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,079
You can start doing what I ordered.

544
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:49,880
Yes!

545
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:02,839
Return to the camp!

546
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,279
Those at the back, keep up!

547
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,279
It's not even 7 p.m. yet.

548
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:09,880
Why are the guards
stopping their patrols?

549
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:23,920
Sir.

550
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,000
We haven't arrived yet.

551
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,000
Find a liquor shop

552
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,960
and buy two bottles of good liquor

553
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,799
for them.

554
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:35,279
Yes.

555
00:29:59,160 --> 00:29:59,880
I'm telling you.

556
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,319
Tonight is strange.

557
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,799
What's wrong?

558
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:05,119
On the streets,

559
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,200
there aren't many patrols going on.

560
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,119
Are they rotating shifts?

561
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,000
I don't get it.

562
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,119
Why is Li Niantang

563
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,319
not here yet?

564
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,000
Even the liquor is here
but he's still not here yet.

565
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,759
The meat is cooked
and the liquor is warm.

566
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,680
Let's eat while we wait.

567
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:30,839
Sure. Let's eat while we wait.

568
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,400
Come.

569
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:37,960
How is it?

570
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:38,880
Smells nice, right?

571
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:42,079
It's delicious.

572
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:46,359
Xiaoqing.

573
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,000
It's easy to get drunk

574
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,960
when you drink without talking.

575
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,680
My sufferings from the past
are all very memorable.

576
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,160
I just want to drink.

577
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:57,960
I have nothing to say.

578
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,559
It's all written on your face.

579
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,680
Just get it out.

580
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,920
I'll say it then.

581
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:13,440
If what I say

582
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,079
makes both of you unhappy,

583
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,519
just think of it as drunk talk.

584
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:20,640
Since Mr. Su became House Master,

585
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,440
did both of you feel happy?

586
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:27,039
What kind of nonsense
are you talking about?

587
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:29,720
Mr. Su is a rare talent.

588
00:31:30,487 --> 00:31:33,487
He is magnanimous enough
to not care about you

589
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,640
helping Hua Wucuo in the past.

590
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:37,119
I'm not talking about the past.

591
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,720
Right now, I mean.

592
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:42,039
Since Su Mengzhen became House Master,

593
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:44,240
everything has to be reported to him.

594
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:46,240
Every decision has to be reported
to the White Tower.

595
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:48,319
Keeper and Keeper.

596
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,880
Where is our power?

597
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,000
We are all working for the House.

598
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,559
Anyone who is capable
gets to be the decision-maker.

599
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:56,200
Isn't that right?

600
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,720
Yes. You are right.

601
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,880
Anyone who is capable
gets to be the decision-maker.

602
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:01,200
But why did

603
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,319
Bai Choufei get to
become Vice House Master

604
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:04,960
once he joined?

605
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,640
If he is capable, just let him be.

606
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,920
If he is incapable,

607
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:09,839
we'll just think of it as a false title.

608
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:10,599
False title?

609
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:12,839
The title of the first Vice House Master

610
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:14,039
of House of Sunset Drizzle in 50 years

611
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:16,160
was given to an inexperienced rookie.

612
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,359
Don't you two feel aggrieved?

613
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,039
Truth comes out from being drunk.

614
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:29,039
If you think we are aggrieved,

615
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,440
what plans do you have?

616
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,519
I'll be honest then.

617
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,440
I won't hide anything then.

618
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,160
Di Feijing came to me.

619
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,519
We can't drink anymore.

620
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,079
Xiaoqing.

621
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,279
What are you trying to do?

622
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:55,559
Since both of you don't accept my offer,

623
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,720
I have to take both of your heads

624
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,960
in exchange for my lavish life.

625
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:14,480
It's done.

626
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,880
Go in and clean up the mess.

627
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,920
(Restaurant)

628
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,599
First Elder.

629
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,160
Looks like you've done it.

630
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,680
I just want to be clear about

631
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,279
whether you will keep

632
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:02,880
your promise.

633
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,519
I, Di Feijing, always keep my promise.

634
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,800
Xiaoqing is swift and fierce.

635
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,159
It's such a waste
for House of Sunset Drizzle.

636
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:24,440
First Elder,
please verify them yourself.

637
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:46,920
The three Keepers working together.

638
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:49,320
You are really showing me respect.

639
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,559
Elder Di is very famous.

640
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,039
We don't dare to attack you

641
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:58,480
with just the three of us.

642
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,800
I also prepared another 100 men

643
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,280
to not be worried.

644
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,599
First Elder Di, please stay here.

645
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:07,480
I don't think it will go as planned.

646
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:09,239
Three of you.

647
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,199
How's the liquor?

648
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,719
It's you?

649
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,679
When I said
three Keepers working together,

650
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,639
there really were only three of you.

651
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,800
Su Mengzhen has to pay a price

652
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,760
to get Wang and Bai into the House.

653
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,360
I am taking Long Xiaoqing away.

654
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,639
That is the rule of Six Half Hall.

655
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:16,800
I won't take both of your lives.

656
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:18,880
I know my place when doing things.

657
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,079
Go back and tell Mr. Su

658
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:23,880
to learn the rules in the future.

659
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,519
Know his place.

660
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:40,519
There's poison in the liquor?

661
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,639
Don't worry.

662
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,159
It won't kill you two.

663
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,119
Darn you.

664
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,360
You dare betray us?

665
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,880
We used to be comrades.

666
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,800
We can share our riches.

667
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:55,159
But dying together?

668
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:56,719
No need for that.

669
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,079
Xiaoqing.

670
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,840
First Elder Di already knew your tricks.

671
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:07,800
Traitor!

672
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:08,639
I...

673
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:10,360
Xiaoqing!

674
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:27,840
Sir.

675
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:31,559
Anything?

676
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:33,559
Yes.

677
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,400
Anything major?

678
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,400
It'll happen soon.

679
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,599
Keep a close eye on them.

680
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:51,239
Prepare the men.

681
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,880
We raid the House at daybreak.

682
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:54,920
Yes.

683
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,196
(Clock)

684
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:03,679
Advisor.

685
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,239
Long Xiaoqing got captured.

686
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,000
Li Niantang rebelled.

687
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:33,920
Many of our men got killed.

688
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,639
Together with the shops on two streets

689
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,039
and four branches in the Capital.

690
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:41,599
Also,

691
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:43,599
they are not planning to stop.

692
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:46,400
Let's work together

693
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:47,679
and do something extraordinary

694
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:49,400
to recover the House's losses.

695
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,679
For example?

696
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:51,800
For example,

697
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,840
kill Di Feijing.

698
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:55,119
No.

699
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:57,599
Di Feijing is not an easy enemy.

700
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,679
Lei Sun wants him

701
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,920
so he can dominate the world.

702
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,079
I don't want to lose both of you.

703
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:04,159
We can definitely kill him
if I work together with Wang Xiaoshi.

704
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:05,639
Di Feijing cannot die.

705
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:09,280
One day,

706
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,880
when Six Half Hall falls to us,

707
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:14,079
Lei Sun might bring us down together.

708
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,639
At that time, Di Feijing will be the one

709
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,119
to help us stabilize the situation.

710
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,800
It's better for both sides
to keep him alive.

711
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,639
Xiaoshi, what do you think?

712
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:27,239
I think

713
00:40:27,682 --> 00:40:29,000
we should rescue Long Xiaoqing.

714
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:30,719
I had a conflict with him

715
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:32,400
because we had different standpoints.

716
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,679
From the House's standpoint,

717
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,199
I feel that he is a man of integrity.

718
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:39,360
I also think

719
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,920
we should capture Li Niantang

720
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,400
and let the House punish him.

721
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,000
Doing that will also hurt
Six Half Hall's morale.

722
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:49,639
Li Niantang is already
a member of Six Half Hall.

723
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:51,119
There's no need to bring him back.

724
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,760
In my opinion,

725
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:55,239
a betrayer only has one end.

726
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:56,719
I'll be in charge of killing him.

727
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:01,440
Long Xiaoqing is one of us.

728
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,880
He can't fall into the enemies' hands.

729
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:04,159
Bring him back alive to see me.

730
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,599
I'll be in charge of his rescue.

731
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:08,639
The city's patrols

732
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,199
have retreated.

733
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:11,800
The Ministry of Justice
gave Lei Sun a window.

734
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:14,000
No one knows how long this window lasts,

735
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:16,079
whether it's a day or two.

736
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:16,920
I can't guess it as well.

737
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,559
If the window closes

738
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,760
and we are caught in the act,

739
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:22,400
we will be suppressed
by the Ministry of Justice.

740
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,920
If we are 60 percent confident,
we should do it.

741
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,920
When people are still wondering

742
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,920
when we will fight back,

743
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,239
the best timing...

744
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,760
That's when they are still wondering.

745
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,400
That's right.

746
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:34,599
Both of you, go now.

747
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,119
Get it done by tonight.

748
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,559
Can you do it?

749
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,639
- Yes.
- Yes.
