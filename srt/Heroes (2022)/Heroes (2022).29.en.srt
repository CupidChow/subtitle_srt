To have you showing filial duty

Father,

37
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:42,759
I received a news today,
but I don't know if it's true.

38
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,360
So I want to verify it with you.

39
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:48,319
You want to know
if Wang Xiaoshi is dead, right?

40
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,400
It's true.

41
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,080
I received Fang Yingkan's message
through the pigeon messenger yesterday.

42
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:58,800
I heard he died in Fang Yingkan's hands.

43
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,960
But Wang Xiaoshi was skilled in martial arts.

44
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,520
He was one of the best experts
in the martial arts world.

45
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,400
And Fang Yingkan had never revealed
his martial arts skills before.

46
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,840
This outcome is very shocking.

47
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,479
Fang Yingkan appears

48
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,479
to be a useless person.

49
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,719
But the truth is,

50
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,639
he's good at feigning.

51
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,360
He pretended to be submissive to me.

52
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:24,360
He thought he was good at hiding.

53
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,759
But I've already seen through him.

54
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,240
He's very skilled in martial arts.

55
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:31,360
Even if he faces Su Mengzhen,

56
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,039
he may not necessarily lose.

57
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,719
So it's only reasonable
that Wang Xiaoshi died in his hands.

58
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,639
You must be sad that he's dead now.

59
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:45,479
After all, you used to be good friends.

60
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,800
Since I've decided to follow you,

61
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,080
I've put everything

62
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,960
in the past.

63
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,240
We were no longer friends,

64
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,560
let alone being sad.

65
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,199
I was only thinking

66
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,319
about whose heart I should trample on

67
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,800
with this piece of news.

68
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,185
(It's fine if I can't fly. But when I do, 
I'll soar to the highest.)

69
00:04:18,186 --> 00:04:22,522
(It's fine if I can't make a sound. 
But when I do, I'll make the loudest noise.)

70
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:34,600
I'm determined
to make contributions for centuries,

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,560
which spread around the world.

72
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:41,639
The dragon flying in the sky
doesn't fear failures.

73
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,240
The eagle flying in the sky
doesn't fear being alone.

74
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,240
Turning around to reach great heights.

75
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,759
Who is not surprised?

76
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,120
Please come with us,
Vice House Master Bai.

77
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,759
- Chancellor Cai.
- Chancellor Cai.

78
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,800
You always visit me,

79
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,240
drink liquor with me, and tempt me.

80
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:57,399
What do you want to say this time?

81
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,720
There are times
when you don't need too many words.

82
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:03,079
Understanding the meaning
of a couple of sentences is enough

83
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,199
for a whole life.

84
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,879
Let's not talk about reasons today.

85
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,319
Let's talk about something else.

86
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,759
This is my official seal.

87
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
If you have it,

88
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,879
you can control the martial arts world

89
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,439
and use the power of the Youqiao Group.

90
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:29,120
When that happens,

91
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,120
you will have the control over
the martial artists' life and death.

92
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,240
However,

93
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:38,439
before I give it to you,

94
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,680
what can you give me in exchange?

95
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,720
If I want something,

96
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,879
I'll go and get it myself.

97
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:54,199
You're now locked up in the dungeon.

98
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,720
You have no power over your life.

99
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,879
Even if you get out from here,

100
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:03,120
you're only a Vice House Master at most.

101
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:04,680
You can't do anything.

102
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:08,720
You should know your limits.

103
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,639
I'll ask you again.

104
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,000
What can you use in exchange for this?

105
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,360
You have nothing at all.

106
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,399
Chancellor Cai,

107
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,759
you have the power in court
and over the people.

108
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,199
I'm sure many people want to manage

109
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:41,959
the martial arts world for you.

110
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,920
There are even more people
who kill on your behalf.

111
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,639
I was just thinking.

112
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:49,319
Why on earth

113
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,160
are you wasting time on me?

114
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,920
Or are you trying to tame me

115
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,040
into an animal?

116
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,480
After that, I shall take your rewards
and be your dog

117
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,439
to watch your territory and kill people for you.

118
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:05,240
Chancellor Cai,

119
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,439
righteousness wasn't that important

120
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,319
to me in the beginning.

121
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:10,920
But after I met my brother

122
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,319
in Xiliu,

123
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,639
I told myself to live like a person

124
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,600
from that moment.

125
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:23,839
So as long as he's around,

126
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,839
you can't say I have nothing at all.

127
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,519
Was it Wang Xiaoshi you met

128
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,120
in Xiliu?

129
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
He's already dead.

130
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,399
So you really

131
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,080
have nothing now.

132
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,559
This is the map
of the Ministry of Justice's dungeon

133
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,919
Divine Marquis has delivered.

134
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,360
All the key information is marked on the map.

135
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,080
This is great.

136
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:24,440
With this map,
we'll get a picture of what to do.

137
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,159
Not only that,

138
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,639
we must succeed in one strike.

139
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,919
Bai Choufei has a special identity.

140
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,600
As long anyone tries to rescue him,

141
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,559
the House will be dragged
into this no matter what.

142
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:35,960
So only House Master's plan will work.

143
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,440
We'll switch Bai Choufei
with a dead body

144
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,080
and burn it.

145
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,960
So others would think a fire breaks out
in the dungeon during the jailbreak,

146
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,080
and Bai Choufei

147
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,840
dies in the chaos.

148
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,000
This plan will work.

149
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,120
But the place is heavily guarded.

150
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,080
If we send more people,
it'll only alert them.

151
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,519
It's best to
reduce the number of people.

152
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:54,720
Long Xiaoqing and Mo Beichen.

153
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,039
You'll assist Miss Xiaoyao
in the rescue mission.

154
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,360
Yes.

155
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:00,279
We'll risk our lives to rescue him.

156
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,639
What about me?

157
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,799
Why aren't you sending me?

158
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,080
You're not young anymore.

159
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,639
What? Are you saying I'm old?

160
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:07,360
No, I mean...

161
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,519
- I don't mean...
- Let's compete who's better, then.

162
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,639
I didn't mean it that way.

163
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,000
It's an important mission.

164
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,399
If anything goes wrong,

165
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,960
we need a Keeper to manage the House.

166
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,320
Hey, don't say anything unlucky.

167
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,600
Everyone will return safely.

168
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:17,720
Enough.

169
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,679
With Miss Xiaoyao's experience and skills,

170
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,960
you can rest assured.

171
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:24,399
Miss Xiaoyao will lead this mission.

172
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,159
You'll decide the number of people

173
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,039
for the rescue mission.

174
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,360
Sir, rest assured. We'll bring him back

175
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,120
as you've wanted.

176
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,159
Sir!

177
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,039
Why are you panicking?

178
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,759
Sir.

179
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,000
Bad news comes after one another.

180
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,639
What major issues
we've never encountered before?

181
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,399
What happened?

182
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,240
Sir, what's the matter?

183
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:06,399
Wang Xiaoshi was intercepted
by pursuing troops

184
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,159
when he was heading north.

185
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,840
He's dead.

186
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:39,039
We must not let this matter get out.

187
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,000
We must not let House Master know.

188
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,559
Mr. Su, have some tea.

189
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:34,960
Do you miss him?

190
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,159
Who?

191
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,960
You know who I'm talking about.

192
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,039
Why do you ask me this suddenly?

193
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,639
Wang Xiaoshi has Wen Rou by his side.

194
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,320
They're probably
wandering about leisurely.

195
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,279
We must speed up
the rescue of Bai Choufei.

196
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,200
Wang Xiaoshi is dead.

197
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,919
They have a deep bond.

198
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,840
I'm afraid he won't make it
through the dungeon if he knows it.

199
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:10,159
Something bad might happen.

200
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,480
Every news at the White Tower
will come to me first.

201
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,159
This rule remains the same.

202
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,200
I received the news last night.

203
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,559
I only let all of you know today.

204
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,080
Mr. Su,

205
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,679
if Wang Xiaoshi knew,

206
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:44,279
he wouldn't have wanted you to be sad.

207
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,759
Xiaoshi never wanted people
around him to suffer.

208
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,960
I'm sure it's his wish

209
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,879
to save Choufei.

210
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:00,799
Now that he's gone,

211
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,639
we'll fulfill his wish quickly.

212
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:23,679
Mr. and Mrs. Bai,

213
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:24,720
Bai Choufei has friends

214
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,759
from today on.

215
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,039
So rest assured.

216
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,679
We'll take good care of him.

217
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,159
Since we're friends,

218
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:02,120
let's put grievances aside.

219
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,519
We came to the Capital together.

220
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:05,519
Since you want to leave,

221
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:07,200
we should leave together.

222
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,360
Don't worry. We'll meet again.

223
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,480
When that time comes,
Mengzhen's illness will recover.

224
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,159
We'll continue living at Chou Shi House.

225
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,159
We'll drink liquor, talk,

226
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,639
and listen to Wen Rou nagging.

227
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:25,159
We won't stop
until we're completely drunk.

228
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,399
When that happens,
I'd have already traveled the country

229
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,480
and met countless people.

230
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,240
I'll surely have
a lot of stories to tell you.

231
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,480
The person you met at Xiliu

232
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:39,879
is dead.

233
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:41,960
So you really

234
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:44,440
have nothing now.

235
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,200
Why did you stop crying?

236
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,120
Do you think he'd still be alive

237
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:53,720
if you stop crying?

238
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,080
He's still alive!

239
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,879
I picked that location on purpose.

240
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,240
I remember when I was 12,

241
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:03,799
I pushed someone down the cave.

242
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,440
I was scared he'd come back for revenge.

243
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,160
So I took my blade

244
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,480
and waited for three days
and three nights at the cave mouth.

245
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:15,480
But that person never showed up.

246
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,839
You animal!

247
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,960
You can scold me.

248
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,599
But you must eat.

249
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,119
If you don't eat,

250
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,759
how can you kill me for revenge?

251
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,200
Am I right?

252
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,400
There are many wild animals

253
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,279
in the wild.

254
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,319
Where do you want to go all by yourself?

255
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:13,400
Wang Xiaoshi is already dead.

256
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:15,279
Just stay by my side

257
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,480
and be my good wife.

258
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,680
Don't come any closer.

259
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:21,200
If you come any closer, I'll kill you!

260
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,079
Do you think you can kill me

261
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:25,680
with your capabilities?

262
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,799
I can't kill you.

263
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:28,519
But I can beat you.

264
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,079
Why don't we compete?

265
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:31,079
If I defeat you,

266
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,839
you'll let me go.

267
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:34,839
Sure.

268
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:36,079
I'll fight you.

269
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,279
What if you lose?

270
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,599
I'll be at your disposal.

271
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:41,839
Remember what you said.

272
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,599
Don't cry if you lose.

273
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:07,440
Why waste your energy?

274
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:08,799
You can't defeat me.

275
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,920
Just be good and be my wife.

276
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,480
In your dreams.

277
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,680
Who do you think you are?

278
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,759
You're nothing but Chancellor's lapdog!

279
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,039
Even if I die,

280
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,519
I won't like someone like you!

281
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,839
Why? Was that your sore spot?

282
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:22,519
You're just an animal.

283
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:24,160
Do you think you're human

284
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,519
after your master
feeds you with human food?

285
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,079
Do you think I care about what you said?

286
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:33,160
I've heard much worse than these before.

287
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,160
But you'll be my wife after this.

288
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,960
You can't speak this way anymore.

289
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:41,079
I'll teach you some lessons today.

290
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,720
This is rosin.

291
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:00,920
It's a useful thing.

292
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,400
It can be used as medicine.

293
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:04,920
You can grind it into rosin powder
and put it in your pocket.

294
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,200
If you run into wild animals,

295
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,799
you can throw
the resin powder into the fire.

296
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,200
It'll generate a spark
and scare them away.

297
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:29,079
My Lord, are you all right?

298
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:31,799
It's...

299
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,599
This blood...

300
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:35,720
Wen Rou is hurt.

301
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,359
She can't go far.

302
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,640
Find her now!

303
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,880
Yes!

304
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:41,000
Follow me!

305
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:41,559
Let's go!

306
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:49,440
Wen Rou!

307
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:50,480
Over here!

308
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,920
Search over there.

309
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,599
Yes.

310
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,839
Don't leave. Come out!

311
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,640
Wen Rou!

312
00:22:57,519 --> 00:22:58,599
I know you're hurt.

313
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,160
Can you show yourself?

314
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:02,440
It's already late at night.

315
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,519
You're injured in the wilderness.

316
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:07,039
Come back with me to treat your injuries!

317
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:09,839
I know you're nearby.

318
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,000
Please come out!

319
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,480
I don't want you to die!

320
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,000
Wen Rou!

321
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,240
Wen Rou!

322
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:21,920
Wen Rou!

323
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,880
(The brightest star in the sky is called)

324
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:37,680
(the North Star.)

325
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,240
(It's always in the north.)

326
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,839
(You won't lose your way this way.)

327
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,440
(Looking at the ground)

328
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,000
(is to track for footprints.)

329
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,960
(A person's footprints are more shallow.)

330
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:07,519
(That's why you need to learn
how to read a horse's foot tracks.)

331
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:57,200
You must have been here for decades.

332
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,079
It looks like

333
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,160
there's no way out.

334
