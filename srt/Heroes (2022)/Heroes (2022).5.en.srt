(House of Sunset Drizzle)

33
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:01,278
I haven't asked you this yet.

34
00:02:01,838 --> 00:02:02,838
Why did you come to the Capital?

35
00:02:04,838 --> 00:02:06,879
I came to the Capital

36
00:02:07,198 --> 00:02:08,039
to establish a foothold for myself.

37
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,558
Seems like
you're not afraid of anything.

38
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:11,799
You're just afraid that
you can't make a name for yourself.

39
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:14,039
To martial artists,

40
00:02:14,398 --> 00:02:16,238
drinking represents one's status.

41
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:19,559
Did you come to the Capital
to have the best liquor?

42
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:20,319
Of course.

43
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,918
If I have to drink,
I'll drink the best liquor.

44
00:02:22,758 --> 00:02:24,399
All right. I'll remember that.

45
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:26,719
I'll prepare them for you
once the deed is done.

46
00:02:27,358 --> 00:02:28,159
It's a promise then.

47
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,159
There's one more thing.

48
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,078
My father is bedridden.

49
00:02:33,518 --> 00:02:35,159
I don't want to see him
when I'm bathed in blood.

50
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:36,039
Don't worry.

51
00:02:36,518 --> 00:02:37,518
By then, you can enter
the room immediately.

52
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:38,279
Just leave the rest to me.

53
00:02:39,198 --> 00:02:40,238
I'll buy some time for you,

54
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:41,958
no matter how many people
they send after you.

55
00:02:42,638 --> 00:02:44,119
My archer will help you out too.

56
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:45,879
That's even better.

57
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,198
It's one quarter before 9 a.m.

58

It'll be 9 a.m. soon.

60
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,279
Seems like Hua Wucuo and the rest

61
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,999
will be reaching
the House of Sages soon.

00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,347
(Seasonable Weathers)

63
00:03:03,358 --> 00:03:05,358
It's one quarter before 9 a.m.

64
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,119
The sky is clear!

65
00:03:15,638 --> 00:03:16,518
It's not the time yet.

66
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:17,678
Why are they here already?

67
00:03:18,078 --> 00:03:19,758
The person on the right is Mo Beichen.
The person on the left is Li Niantang.

68
00:03:20,358 --> 00:03:21,678
I think they're waiting for Hua Wucuo.

69
00:03:27,238 --> 00:03:27,719
Is everyone here?

70
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:28,399
Where's Delegate?

71
00:03:28,518 --> 00:03:29,358
(The House of Sages)
Delegate is still on his way.

72
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,119
(The House of Sages)
He'll arrive soon.

73
00:03:30,758 --> 00:03:31,719
If so, let's wait here.

74
00:03:32,798 --> 00:03:33,599
There's not much time left.

75
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:34,958
Let's get ready.

76
00:03:58,337 --> 00:04:00,501
(The House of Sages)

77
00:04:01,798 --> 00:04:02,638
I'll head inside and meet him first.

78
00:04:16,678 --> 00:04:18,078
Greetings, Delegate!

79
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,358
Where's Long Xiaoqing?

80
00:04:22,758 --> 00:04:23,399
He was anxious.

81
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:25,118
He said he wanted

82
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,918
to meet Su Mengzhen in advance.

83
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:30,358
If so, we can head there later.

84
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,279
He can enjoy his meeting with him.

85
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,079
Where's Shi Wukui?

86
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:39,199
He's not here.

87
00:04:40,719 --> 00:04:41,839
That's good too.

88
00:04:42,798 --> 00:04:44,079
I'll deal with him later.

89
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:47,558
Those who are here should think twice

90
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:51,399
before they pick their sides.

91
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,558
Both Delegate and Mr. Su
come from the same family.

92
00:04:55,238 --> 00:04:56,399
Both belong to
the House of Sunset Drizzle.

93
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,318
As their subordinates,

94
00:04:58,318 --> 00:04:59,478
no matter who we side with,

95
00:05:00,118 --> 00:05:01,399
we're siding with

96
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,759
the House of Sunset Drizzle, right?

97
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:13,918
Who's there?

98
00:05:15,558 --> 00:05:17,719
I'm Long Xiaoqing, a Keeper
of the House of Sunset Drizzle.

99
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,678
Mr. Su, since you were back to
the Capital, I came to visit you.

100
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:24,519
So, what's so important that you can't
discuss it in the House?

101
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,358
I will explain everything

102
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:30,279
when everyone is here.

103
00:05:30,878 --> 00:05:32,118
Delegate and the other Keepers

104
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,558
are already waiting at the door.

105
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,118
Mr. Su, could it be that you're acting
as the house master

106
00:05:36,558 --> 00:05:37,839
even though you haven't
succeeded House Master yet?

107
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:41,159
Don't tell me you want us to
welcome you by kowtowing to you?

108
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:45,399
Mr. Su, you summoned us here,
yet you're not revealing yourself to us.

109
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:47,839
You're playing tricks on us
behind the curtain.

110
00:05:48,358 --> 00:05:49,478
Don't you think
this is inappropriate of you?

111
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,759
Why don't we speak face to face?

112
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:00,159
You!

113
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:00,878
If you dare to touch me,

114
00:06:00,878 --> 00:06:02,318
even the House of Sunset Drizzle
won't be able to protect you.

115
00:06:04,678 --> 00:06:06,558
Mr. Su, I didn't expect you
to get yourself a woman

116
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,519
after you went to the border area.

117
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:10,159
You!

118
00:06:10,318 --> 00:06:11,599
My master is the Red Sleeve Nun.

119
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:12,599
Su Mengzhen is my martial brother.

120
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,678
Touch me if you dare.

121
00:06:14,238 --> 00:06:15,478
My father is Wen Wan, Lord of Luoyang.

122
00:06:15,798 --> 00:06:16,878
I'm the Young Lady of the Wen family.

123
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:17,959
Touch me if you dare.

124
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:22,719
So, it's the Young Lady
of the Wen family?

125
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,318
Xiaoqing, how dare you make
things difficult for her?

126
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,399
We're just mere martial artists.

127
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:30,918
She's from a dignified family.

128
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:32,159
Stop arguing.

129
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:32,959
Sit down.

130
00:06:39,878 --> 00:06:42,159
This young Keeper is trying
to cause trouble

131
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,279
because he's upset.

132
00:06:43,878 --> 00:06:44,878
I'm younger than him.

133
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,878
Even so, I know
how to respect my elders.

134
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,558
I'm Wen Rou, the daughter of Wen Wan,

135
00:06:49,798 --> 00:06:50,238
Lord of Luoyang.

136
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:51,238
I will serve you all tea.

137
00:06:53,878 --> 00:06:55,399
She does come from a dignified family.

138
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,358
I'm not worthy.

139
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,599
It's 9 a.m.

140
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:03,558
There are dark clouds in the sky!

141
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,878
It's 9 a.m.

142
00:07:09,118 --> 00:07:11,399
There are dark clouds in the sky!

143
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,438
(Once it's 9 a.m,)

144
00:07:16,118 --> 00:07:18,199
(Wang Xiaoshi and I will burn
the joss stick at the same time.)

145
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:19,839
(Wang Xiaoshi and Wen Rou)

146
00:07:20,438 --> 00:07:22,998
(need to stall Hua Wucuo and the rest
until the joss sticks run out.)

147
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,279
(And we must)

148
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,079
(meet House Master.)

149
00:07:40,907 --> 00:07:41,520
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

150
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,199
I only kill traitors.

151
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,599
If no one moves,

152
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,599
I'll treat it as if this encounter
never takes place.

153
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,480

00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,800
(Honor of Dezhao)

156
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:16,678
If you wish to kill him,

157
00:08:17,238 --> 00:08:18,118
you have to go through me!

158
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,399
Do you think these men

159
00:08:41,558 --> 00:08:42,558
can fend me off?

160
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,438
This is the House of Sunset Drizzle's
family matter.

161
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,318
Buddy, can you

162
00:08:48,078 --> 00:08:49,958
bear the consequences
if two of the major sects

163
00:08:50,438 --> 00:08:50,999
in the Capital

164
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:52,479
get into a fight because of you?

165
00:08:53,598 --> 00:08:54,198
Is there anyone else

166
00:08:54,678 --> 00:08:56,078
who can be in charge here?

167
00:09:03,198 --> 00:09:05,438
So, it's Lei Mei, the Third Elder.

168
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:07,039
Miss Lei Mei,

169
00:09:07,918 --> 00:09:09,639
has the Six Half Hall
prepared themselves

170
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:11,718
for the showdown against
the House of Sunset Drizzle?

171
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:13,239
Who said we were going to fight

172
00:09:13,838 --> 00:09:14,999
in broad daylight?

173
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,039
It's just that the Sunset Drizzle
made things difficult

174
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,678
for a friend of Chief Elder's.

175
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,078
I just wanted to help him out.

176
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:23,078
Mr. Su was the one who made
things difficult for him.

177
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:24,639
Even if you're there,

178
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:26,479
do you think
you can do anything about it?

179
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,359
Besides, Mr. Su is already
engaging Hua Wucuo

180
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:31,239
while we're talking.

181
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:36,159
We've sent our greetings

182
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:37,879
and drank the tea too.

183
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,479
Mr. Su, why haven't
you shown yourself yet?

184
00:09:42,558 --> 00:09:44,039
Mr. Su is our junior.

185
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,639
We came here because he told us to.

186
00:09:47,479 --> 00:09:48,479
We're his guests.

187
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:50,918
Mengzhen has his own reasons

188
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:51,958
for not showing himself.

189
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:53,759
What do you mean?

190
00:09:55,198 --> 00:09:56,078
House Master is terminally ill.

191
00:09:56,318 --> 00:09:57,798
And Mengzhen just came back
from the northern battlefield.

192
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,718
Everyone knew that
he had reached Kushuipu.

193
00:10:00,318 --> 00:10:02,438
However, no Keeper came to welcome him.

194
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,438
Even one person is enough
for the sake of courtesy.

195
00:10:04,798 --> 00:10:06,438
However, the sinister Gu Dong
was the one who came to receive him.

196
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:08,519
Although Mengzhen
was lucky to be alive,

197
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:09,958
he was poisoned and wounded.

198
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:11,718
He cannot afford to catch a cold.

199
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:12,438
What?

200
00:10:13,318 --> 00:10:14,359
Did Gu Dong betray us?

201
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:15,399
Did he do so under
someone else's instruction?

202
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,958
Mengzhen, hurry
and explain it to the Keepers.

203
00:10:26,718 --> 00:10:27,519
My fellow peers,

204
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,678
I'm seriously wounded.

205
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:31,678
I hope you guys
can pardon me for the rudeness.

206
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:36,999
You're seriously wounded indeed.

207
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,838
Even your voice was affected.

208
00:10:42,198 --> 00:10:42,958
Of course.

209
00:10:43,239 --> 00:10:44,438
Mengzhen is a skilled martial artist.

210
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,678
Back then, that scoundrel
slashed his throat.

211
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:51,598
You don't need to act it out

212
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:53,359
when you speak.

213
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:55,678
Mr. Su,

214
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,159
you may continue.

215
00:11:01,918 --> 00:11:03,639
Mengzhen, you can continue.

216
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,992
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

217
00:11:21,078 --> 00:11:21,718
You can leave first.

218
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:23,279
Leave this to me.

219
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,974
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

220
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,159
I've summoned you guys here

221
00:11:52,438 --> 00:11:54,318
to explain the whole story.

222
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,078
A few days ago,

223
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:57,678
a good friend of my father's

224
00:11:58,078 --> 00:11:59,759
suddenly gave me a white jade box.

225
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:03,159
Inside the box

226
00:12:03,718 --> 00:12:05,198
was something extremely important.

227
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:07,279
I wasn't assaulted at Kushuipu

228
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:09,279
because they wanted to kill me.

229
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,399
They were aiming for the box.

230
00:12:19,598 --> 00:12:20,918
Those who tried to assassinate Mr. Su

231
00:12:21,318 --> 00:12:22,718
were from the Six Half Hall.

232
00:12:23,318 --> 00:12:24,279
Everyone knows

233
00:12:24,918 --> 00:12:26,399
that the Elders of the Six Half Hall

234
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,239
do kill for money too.

235
00:12:28,838 --> 00:12:29,479
Mr. Su, could it be

236
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:31,318
that you forgot who

237
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:32,318
you had offended?

238
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,718
You better think twice
before you speak next time.

239
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:36,438
Niantang,

240
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:39,318
let Mr. Su finish his words.

241
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:42,519
Many assassins were aiming for the box.

242
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:44,279
I'm sure it's something extraordinary.

243
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:45,879
Mr. Su,

244
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:49,119
where is the box right now?

245
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,359
The box is still with me.

246
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:54,759
Initially, I wanted to hand it
to my father personally.

247
00:12:55,318 --> 00:12:56,718
However, I'm seriously wounded.

248
00:12:57,838 --> 00:12:58,918
I don't have the confidence

249
00:12:59,558 --> 00:13:00,999
to hand it to my father personally.

250
00:13:02,918 --> 00:13:04,558
So, since Delegate

251
00:13:04,798 --> 00:13:05,718
and the Keepers are here today,

252
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,678
why don't we open the box

253
00:13:08,318 --> 00:13:09,119
and show its content

254
00:13:09,718 --> 00:13:11,999
to the public?

255
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,879
Since this item is so important,

256
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,359
we should hand it to House Master.

257
00:13:20,438 --> 00:13:21,479
I don't think

258
00:13:22,838 --> 00:13:24,558
we should open it here.

259
00:13:33,672 --> 00:13:35,320
(Virtuous and Kind)

260
00:13:49,838 --> 00:13:50,798
You're finally back.

261
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:51,598
Good job.

262
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:52,519
Is he doing fine?

263
00:13:55,318 --> 00:13:55,918
Follow me.

264
00:14:26,718 --> 00:14:27,838
I'm not dead yet.

265
00:14:30,678 --> 00:14:31,318
Greetings, Father.

266
00:14:38,798 --> 00:14:39,958
Is the Capital cold?

267
00:14:40,918 --> 00:14:41,718
The North is colder.

268
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:47,078
You sicko.

269
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:51,119
I brought you a pot of Shiniangchun liquor

270
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,759
from the city's gate.

271
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,519
People say that the treasures
of the world aren't durable.

272
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:22,558
Bright clouds scatter easily
while glaze is fragile.

273
00:15:23,678 --> 00:15:26,239
However, their liquor remained the same

274
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:27,479
after so many years.

275
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:29,798
This is something rare.

276
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:32,678
Lianxin,

277
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:35,119
get us two cups.

278
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,479
I will drink together with my son.

279
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:44,798
Have you obtained it?

280
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:46,078
It never left my side.

281
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,039
Open it.

282
00:16:06,718 --> 00:16:07,198
Indeed.

283
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:09,918
Hua Wucuo does belong
to the Six Half Hall.

284
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:14,598
Delegate, if you don't allow it,

285
00:16:14,918 --> 00:16:16,078
I still have another idea.

286
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:19,119
Pickled kidney with liquor and vinegar.

287
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:30,519
Mengzhen feels sick.

288
00:16:30,918 --> 00:16:31,718
Let me take a look at him.

289
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:34,838
What's going on?

290
00:16:35,918 --> 00:16:36,879
Yesterday's menu?

291
00:16:37,598 --> 00:16:38,119
Continue.

292
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,078
Regarding the other idea I have,

293
00:16:40,558 --> 00:16:41,838
I need someone
to escort me to Sunset Drizzle.

294
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:43,798
However, since there are
traitors among us,

295
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,159
I don't trust anyone here right now.

296
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,438
Keepers, I hope you guys
can escort me personally.

297
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,198
You don't need
to go through all that trouble.

298
00:16:52,838 --> 00:16:54,999
Since you're unable to move freely,

299
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:58,558
why don't you hand the box to me?

300
00:16:59,598 --> 00:17:01,558
I'll hand it to House Master for you.

301
00:17:06,639 --> 00:17:07,159
Everyone,

302
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:09,598
how long do we have to keep up the act?

303
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:12,318
The person inside
isn't Su Mengzhen at all.

304
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:13,638
I was wondering why he sounded strange.

305
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,279
So, it is an impostor!

306
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:21,638
The Red Sleeve Blade?

307
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:40,558
Now that I've returned to the Capital,

308
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,638
I wanted to have a drink with you guys

309
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:43,919
and speak out freely.

310
00:17:45,118 --> 00:17:46,479
All of you are my elders
and martial brothers.

311
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:48,479
I don't wish to fight you guys.

312
00:17:52,999 --> 00:17:53,679
Good.

313
00:17:56,558 --> 00:17:57,158
Good.

314
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:31,039
I'm sure you'll be a better

315
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:34,158
house master than me.

316
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:38,439
I have two pieces of advice for you.

317
00:18:39,358 --> 00:18:40,199
First,

318
00:18:40,838 --> 00:18:41,638
you must be benevolent and righteous.

319
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:45,719
Only then, you'll be able
to gather popularity.

320
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:48,199
Second,

321
00:18:49,358 --> 00:18:50,199
you must understand how power works.

322
00:18:52,118 --> 00:18:55,439
Life-or-death situations in the martial
arts world are determined by swords.

323
00:18:57,439 --> 00:18:59,199
However, when you're in this position,

324
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:02,358
power decides whether you live or die.

325
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,638
You can hate power,

326
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:10,798
but you must understand how it works.

327
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:23,398
All right.

328
00:19:24,878 --> 00:19:27,878
It's time for us to have a drink.

329
00:19:29,638 --> 00:19:30,158
House Master,

330
00:19:31,078 --> 00:19:31,919
your body is...

331
00:19:34,358 --> 00:19:36,439
A person only has a limited number

332
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:37,838
of meals and drinks

333
00:19:38,838 --> 00:19:40,199
to enjoy in life.

334
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,398
With the last drink of my life,

335
00:19:59,318 --> 00:20:02,398
I will celebrate my son's ascension.

336
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:05,838
Su Mengzhen,

337
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:07,798
listen closely.

338
00:20:10,719 --> 00:20:14,519
You need to keep
the martial arts world in order.

339
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,679
House Master!

340
00:21:21,598 --> 00:21:22,719
This is bad! Something
happened to the House!

341
00:21:25,838 --> 00:21:27,598
I knew it was a trick!

342
00:21:36,078 --> 00:21:37,679
I knew you were a fake.

343
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:39,878
I'll leave this brat to you guys.

344
00:21:40,439 --> 00:21:41,519
I'll return to the House!

345
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:47,078
Xiaoqing,

346
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:49,519
she's the daughter
of Wen Wan, Lord of Luoyang.

347
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:51,199
You can't afford to offend her.

348
00:21:55,838 --> 00:21:56,878
The joss stick has already run out.

349
00:21:57,558 --> 00:21:59,398
Mr. Su already has
the situation under control.

350
00:22:00,358 --> 00:22:01,078
You have no chance now.

351
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:35,558
The Red Sleeve Blade?

352
00:22:37,878 --> 00:22:39,078
This is pretty interesting.

353
00:22:43,199 --> 00:22:44,318
Their act

354
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:45,878
was pretty good.

355
00:23:07,118 --> 00:23:07,638
Chun,

356
00:23:08,439 --> 00:23:11,078
at first, you hoped that
Su Mengzhen could win,

357
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:12,158
right?

358
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:16,719
That's because you and father
went against your promise

359
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:18,078
and attacked Mengzhen.

360
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:19,959
So,

361
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:21,719
don't blame me for helping him.

362
00:23:41,398 --> 00:23:41,959
Hua Wucuo,

363
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:44,398
do you know your fault now?

364
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,040
(Memorial Tablet of Su Zhemu)

365
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:52,798
He's useless indeed.

366
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:54,479
He died before I had the chance

367
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:56,199
to kill him.

368
00:24:00,638 --> 00:24:01,439
You and House Master

369
00:24:02,078 --> 00:24:02,878
were

370
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,719
sworn brothers.

371
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:07,999
I'm still keeping you alive

372
00:24:08,598 --> 00:24:09,318
because

373
00:24:09,318 --> 00:24:10,679
you didn't attack your own brother.

374
00:24:11,558 --> 00:24:12,439
However, you're a traitor.

375
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:14,959
That's a fact.

376
00:24:15,398 --> 00:24:16,638
So what?

377
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:18,519
It's been so many years.

378
00:24:19,199 --> 00:24:21,519
I've done a lot for the House.

379
00:24:22,439 --> 00:24:24,078
You did do a lot for the House.

380
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:27,318
However, if people find out

381
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:29,439
that our next house master
is actually someone

382
00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:30,919
from the Six Half Hall,

383
00:24:32,078 --> 00:24:34,798
the House of Sunset Drizzle will cease
to exist in the martial arts world.

384
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:38,078
As long as I'm still alive,

385
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:39,519
you

386
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:42,118
won't get your way.

387
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:44,078
Hua Wucuo,

388
00:24:45,078 --> 00:24:45,919
do you know your fault?

389
00:25:18,598 --> 00:25:20,279
The box is in your hands.

390
00:25:20,439 --> 00:25:22,078
If news of this gets out,
I will lose my foothold

391
00:25:22,239 --> 00:25:24,318
in the martial arts world.

392
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:24,799
(Memorial Tablet of Su Zhemu)

393
00:25:24,838 --> 00:25:26,719
You're the hero of all heroes.

394
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,479
It's my gain

395
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:29,279
for dying in your hands.

396
00:25:29,838 --> 00:25:30,279
Come.

397
00:25:30,598 --> 00:25:31,519
Give me a quick death.

398
00:25:33,638 --> 00:25:34,878
I'm not killing you

399
00:25:35,999 --> 00:25:38,598
because the House of Sunset Drizzle
emphasizes benevolence.

400
00:25:40,598 --> 00:25:41,878
However, you don't act like

401
00:25:42,598 --> 00:25:43,999
one of us at all.

402
00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:44,798
That's nonsense.

403
00:25:45,118 --> 00:25:46,039
I had plenty of chances

404
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:47,719
to kill your father.

405
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:48,999
I had the blade with me.

406
00:25:48,999 --> 00:25:50,398
Why didn't I do it then?

407
00:25:50,838 --> 00:25:52,919
Who gives you the right to say that
I'm not one of you?

408
00:25:58,158 --> 00:25:58,719
All these years, we've witnessed

409
00:25:59,318 --> 00:26:00,638
what he had done for the House

410
00:26:01,158 --> 00:26:02,158
ourselves.

411
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:04,838
If we ask him which side
he belongs to right now,

412
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:06,999
I'm afraid he'll be confused as well.

413
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:09,239
As humans, we need to be
benevolent and righteous.

414
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:11,798
If not,

415
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:15,838
we're no different than livestock.

416
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:17,519
I kept him alive

417
00:26:18,318 --> 00:26:20,318
because he's at least a decent human.

418
00:26:21,358 --> 00:26:22,158
He's your subordinate.

419
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:23,519
How do you plan to deal with him?

420
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:27,798
Bring him here.

421
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:30,959
We can ask him if he admits defeat

422
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:33,959
and his mistake

423
00:26:37,078 --> 00:26:37,838
in front of us.

424
00:26:39,118 --> 00:26:39,519
Okay.

425
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:40,959
If he admits his mistake,

426
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:42,838
I'll keep him alive.

427
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,075
(Memorial Tablet of Su Zhemu)

428
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:13,999
After you said that,

429
00:27:15,158 --> 00:27:16,439
there's no reason for me to kill you.

430
00:27:17,638 --> 00:27:18,318
As for the name list,

431
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:20,519
it's not important to me at all.

432
00:27:25,838 --> 00:27:26,878
Father told me to ask you this

433
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:30,158
right before he died.

434
00:27:37,118 --> 00:27:37,719
Hua Wucuo,

435
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,446
(Memorial Tablet of Su Zhemu)

436
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:39,439
do you admit defeat?

437
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:41,199
Do you admit your mistake?

438
00:28:02,078 --> 00:28:03,158
I've been defeated.

439
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:06,598
I admit my mistake.

440
00:28:12,464 --> 00:28:14,815
(Memorial Tablet of Su Zhemu)

441
00:28:19,768 --> 00:28:22,355
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

442
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:23,439
The old House Master has passed away.

443
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:26,158
Gu Dong was a spy
from the Six Half Hall.

444
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:27,999
I've already executed him at Kushuipu.

445
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:29,759
The Delegate, Hua Wucuo,

446
00:28:30,318 --> 00:28:31,118
has shown his disloyalty

447
00:28:31,598 --> 00:28:33,078
by attempting to usurp
the house master's position.

448
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:34,558
According to our rules,

449
00:28:35,358 --> 00:28:36,759
he shall be expelled
from the House of Sunset Drizzle.

450
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:53,878
Delegate.

451
00:28:56,838 --> 00:28:57,638
I'm fine.

452
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:07,679
Come.

453
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:51,199

457
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:14,078
each of us used to serve our own masters.

458

Let's wipe the slate clean.

459

In the future, we're still brothers.

460
00:31:20,158 --> 00:31:22,279
Everyone knows what
the House of Sunset Drizzle has done

461
00:31:23,598 --> 00:31:25,719
but not what it's capable of.

462
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:28,999
In the future,
the House of Sunset Drizzle is me.

463
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:32,598
I am the House of Sunset Drizzle.

(Good Health and Long Life)

474
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:14,039
Greetings, Chief Elder.

475
00:32:16,078 --> 00:32:16,719
You're here?

476
00:32:19,318 --> 00:32:20,759
It must've been tough for you out there.

477
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,519
You should return to the Hall.

478
00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:26,358
I've kept the position
of the Tenth Elder for you.

479
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:32,158
Thank you, Chief Elder.

480
00:32:37,719 --> 00:32:39,598
I heard Hua Wucuo

481
00:32:39,598 --> 00:32:40,479
thought of himself

482
00:32:40,479 --> 00:32:42,759
as a member of
the House of Sunset Drizzle in the end.

483
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:45,838
He was expelled

484
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:48,878
according to the rules
of the House of Sunset Drizzle, right?

485
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:52,358
Yes.

486
00:32:54,638 --> 00:32:55,759
He's too muddle-headed.

487
00:33:00,358 --> 00:33:01,318
Since that's the case,

488
00:33:01,959 --> 00:33:02,638
Hua Wucuo

489
00:33:02,638 --> 00:33:05,439
is the traitor of Six Half Hall.

490
00:33:05,959 --> 00:33:07,878
I'm sure you know how to deal

491
00:33:08,318 --> 00:33:09,959
with the traitors of the Hall.

492
00:33:13,439 --> 00:33:14,039
Yes,

493
00:33:15,598 --> 00:33:16,318
Chief Elder.

494
00:34:57,638 --> 00:35:00,078

Sunset Drizzle yourself.)

(Father, do you have)

496
00:35:02,678 --> 00:35:03,519
(a centurial plan for the House?)

497
00:35:05,678 --> 00:35:06,519
As the saying goes,

498
00:35:06,999 --> 00:35:08,519
if you raise your son to 100 years old,

499
00:35:08,638 --> 00:35:10,319
you'll be worried for him for 99 years.

00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:15,638
However, the House of Sunset Drizzle
isn't my son.

501
00:35:16,919 --> 00:35:17,839
You are.

502
00:35:18,558 --> 00:35:21,879
You are the centurial plan
I've left behind for the House.

503
00:35:23,638 --> 00:35:25,758
You are the House of Sunset Drizzle.

504
00:36:10,598 --> 00:36:11,999
So, I'm not much happier

505
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:14,399
now that you're dead.

506
00:36:20,399 --> 00:36:22,558
The martial arts world won't be as fun

507
00:36:24,238 --> 00:36:26,399
without you around, Su Zhemu.

508
00:36:33,278 --> 00:36:35,238
Both of you are considered
old acquaintances.

509
00:36:39,278 --> 00:36:39,839
Come.

510
00:36:43,439 --> 00:36:44,758
You should drink with him too.

511
00:36:48,078 --> 00:36:50,519
Now that he's dead,
you won't be able to seek your revenge.

512
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:55,278
The elders in the martial arts world are
getting fewer and fewer by the day.

513
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,558
There are no grudges between us.

514
00:37:00,198 --> 00:37:02,399
To the elders of the martial arts world.

515
00:37:17,558 --> 00:37:18,319
Chief Elder.

516
00:37:21,718 --> 00:37:22,158
Father?

517
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,238
My daughter, you're back?

518
00:37:30,678 --> 00:37:32,039
Your father isn't dead yet.

519
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:33,558
Why are you wearing this?

520
00:37:33,638 --> 00:37:33,959
Take it off.

521
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:35,158
I'm wearing it for Uncle Su's sake.

522
00:37:37,879 --> 00:37:39,198
I know Su Zhemu is dead,

523
00:37:40,198 --> 00:37:42,078
but the engagement
between you and Su Mengzhen

524
00:37:42,078 --> 00:37:44,359
was called off five years ago, right?

525
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:46,479
There's no need for you
to do this for the Su family.

526
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:48,158
So, once the wedding
has been called off,

527
00:37:48,439 --> 00:37:49,598
you've forgotten all about benevolence
and righteousness too, right?

528
00:37:50,158 --> 00:37:52,198
That's why you tried
to kill Su Mengzhen, didn't you?

529
00:37:52,558 --> 00:37:53,238
Su Mengzhen?

530
00:37:54,638 --> 00:37:56,278
He should've been dead long ago.

531
00:37:56,758 --> 00:37:57,799
I could've saved myself a lot of trouble

532
00:37:57,799 --> 00:37:59,598
if I had killed him earlier.

533
00:37:59,959 --> 00:38:01,558
And you two
wouldn't end up like this today.

534
00:38:01,758 --> 00:38:02,399
Father.

535
00:38:02,399 --> 00:38:03,198
My daughter,

536
00:38:03,399 --> 00:38:06,439
Su Mengzhen is the house master
of the House of Sunset Drizzle now.

537
00:38:06,439 --> 00:38:08,078
The martial arts world
is no longer peaceful.

538
00:38:08,678 --> 00:38:10,439
You should forget about him.

539
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:11,678
And,

540
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:15,278
you should return the token of
the Six Half Hall to me.

541
00:38:17,118 --> 00:38:17,799
My daughter,

542
00:38:18,238 --> 00:38:19,839
the martial arts world
is no longer peaceful.

543
00:38:20,158 --> 00:38:21,999
You shouldn't get yourself involved.

544
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:22,678
Come, be a good girl.

545
00:38:24,078 --> 00:38:25,158
Regarding the martial arts world
you want to conquer,

546
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:27,399
I'm not interested in it at all.

547
00:38:29,158 --> 00:38:31,078
This token means nothing to me.
You can take it if you want.

548
00:38:54,758 --> 00:38:55,758
Now that Uncle Su passed away,

549
00:38:55,999 --> 00:38:57,439
I'm sure Mengzhen
is in a bad mood.

550
00:38:57,758 --> 00:38:59,278
And, he has plenty of other things
to deal with.

551
00:38:59,678 --> 00:39:01,319
I'll take care of you guys
for a few more days.

552
00:39:02,558 --> 00:39:03,839
I didn't expect you to be this sensible.

553
00:39:03,999 --> 00:39:05,118
Can you only tell by now?

554
00:39:05,799 --> 00:39:07,718
You'll know how nice I am
after I bring you guys

555
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:09,039
around the Capital.

556
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:10,879
You can take care of him then.

557
00:39:11,439 --> 00:39:12,319
I don't need you to take care of me.

558
00:39:12,799 --> 00:39:13,999
Why must you go against me all the time?

559
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:16,198
I'm not going against you. I'm serious.

560
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:19,959
I wish to join Sunset Drizzle
as soon as possible.

561
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:21,158
Little Rock,

562
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,399
do you remember
what I've told you before?

563
00:39:23,118 --> 00:39:24,799
I said I have to go
to the brightest place

564
00:39:24,799 --> 00:39:26,238
in order to make a name for myself.

565
00:39:29,118 --> 00:39:30,158
But, look at the Capital.

566
00:39:30,999 --> 00:39:32,839
Mr. Su, Hua Wucuo,

567
00:39:33,078 --> 00:39:33,879
Di Feijing,

568
00:39:34,479 --> 00:39:35,399
all of them are here.

569
00:39:36,278 --> 00:39:37,399
That's why I have to stay here.

570
00:39:38,078 --> 00:39:39,319
I want to be the brightest flame

571
00:39:39,999 --> 00:39:41,399
in the martial arts world.

572
00:39:41,758 --> 00:39:42,678
I was suddenly reminded
of my martial brother

573
00:39:42,879 --> 00:39:44,039
after hearing that from you.

574
00:39:44,479 --> 00:39:45,039
So,

575
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:47,078
do you also wish to become
someone like him?

576
00:39:47,078 --> 00:39:47,558
Of course.

577
00:39:48,278 --> 00:39:48,879
I do envy him a lot.

578
00:39:50,399 --> 00:39:51,479
However, I'm only envious
of him right now.

579
00:39:51,758 --> 00:39:52,399
Maybe it'll be different in the future.

580
00:39:53,718 --> 00:39:54,558
Will that change too?

581
00:39:58,839 --> 00:40:01,799
Mr. Su is the most glorious man
I've ever seen.

582
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:03,758
I envy him a lot.

583
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:05,598
But I don't want
to keep being envious of him.

584
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,758
I want to make
other people envious of me.

585
00:40:08,638 --> 00:40:10,238
I want to be the top martial artist too.

586
00:40:11,879 --> 00:40:12,799
One day,

587
00:40:13,758 --> 00:40:14,718
I, Bai Choufei,

588
00:40:15,879 --> 00:40:17,959
will dictate the rules
of the martial arts world.

589
00:40:18,799 --> 00:40:19,638
Cabbage,

590
00:40:19,799 --> 00:40:20,638
are you trying to reach the sky?

591
00:40:21,558 --> 00:40:22,999
That's precisely what I'm going to do!

592
00:40:23,999 --> 00:40:24,479
Come.

593
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:25,919
What about you, Wen Rou?

594
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:27,479
Me?

595
00:40:28,078 --> 00:40:28,919
You can forget about me.

596
00:40:29,198 --> 00:40:30,198
There's nothing in particular
that I would like to achieve.

597
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:31,758
That's right.

598
00:40:32,158 --> 00:40:33,439
You're the Young Lady of the Wen family.

599
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:34,439
You're well-fed and well-clothed.

600
00:40:34,439 --> 00:40:35,238
You don't lack anything.

601
00:40:35,879 --> 00:40:36,758
You don't even need a dream.

602
00:40:38,118 --> 00:40:40,359
I don't want it.

603
00:40:41,479 --> 00:40:42,519
Forget it if you don't want to tell us.

604
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:43,078
Precisely.

605
00:40:43,479 --> 00:40:43,959
Come on.

606
00:40:44,118 --> 00:40:44,479
Come.

607
00:40:44,479 --> 00:40:45,198
That's not it.

608
00:40:45,439 --> 00:40:46,999
The only thing I want to do in life

609
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:48,039
is "I don't want it".

610
00:40:48,758 --> 00:40:50,799
I don't want other people
to dictate my life for me.

611
00:40:51,078 --> 00:40:52,439
Since young, I've had to wait
for my betrothal.

612
00:40:52,439 --> 00:40:54,238
I had to learn music and needlework.

613
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:55,118
I don't want that.

614
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:56,319
I want to learn martial arts.

615
00:40:56,999 --> 00:40:58,959
When I'm grown up, I had no choice
but to go for an arranged marriage.

616
00:40:59,439 --> 00:41:01,278
I have to see guys I don't know
and attend blind dates.

617
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:02,479
I don't want that.

618
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:04,198
I want to roam the martial arts world.

619
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:06,718
This world always
views women with contempt.

620
00:41:07,278 --> 00:41:09,758
Women from dignified families
aren't supposed to show themselves.

621
00:41:10,078 --> 00:41:10,718
I don't want that.

622
00:41:10,999 --> 00:41:14,439
I want to be a heroine
who helps the weak.

623
00:41:15,799 --> 00:41:17,678
I didn't expect your life
to be this tough.

624
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:18,638
That's right.

625
00:41:19,198 --> 00:41:20,319
As a woman,

626
00:41:20,718 --> 00:41:21,758
there are many ordeals
we need to go through.

627
00:41:22,158 --> 00:41:22,558
However,

628
00:41:22,558 --> 00:41:24,359
why must they reinforce
such ordeals onto the ladies?

629
00:41:24,678 --> 00:41:25,598
My dream

630
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:28,879
is to tell the people
who always dictated my life

631
00:41:29,238 --> 00:41:29,839
that

632
00:41:30,999 --> 00:41:33,078
I'll decide my own life.

633
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:34,479
Great!

634
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:35,598
Great words!

635
00:41:35,598 --> 00:41:36,118
Good!

636
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:41,999
Little Rock,

637
00:41:42,238 --> 00:41:43,078
you haven't told us
about your dreams yet.

638
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:44,158
What do you want to
become in the future?

639
00:41:48,718 --> 00:41:49,439
I've made up my mind.

640
00:41:50,558 --> 00:41:52,078
I want to become a hero.

641
00:41:53,879 --> 00:41:54,879
Don't misunderstand me.

642
00:41:55,558 --> 00:41:57,479
I don't want to become the kind of hero
listed on the list of heroes.

643
00:41:58,919 --> 00:41:59,799
I just wish to be myself.

644
00:42:00,758 --> 00:42:03,839
Aren't being yourself and being a hero
two different things?

645
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:05,558
- That's right.
- It's the same thing.

646
00:42:06,919 --> 00:42:09,278
To be a hero, you must be
the best version of yourself.

647
00:42:10,078 --> 00:42:11,678
I wish to become a first-class hero.

648
00:42:12,558 --> 00:42:14,039
I will bring justice to the world

649
00:42:14,479 --> 00:42:15,718
and beat up the guys
that deserve a beating.

650
00:42:16,879 --> 00:42:18,078
I just hope that I can be an influence

651
00:42:18,238 --> 00:42:19,879
on other martial artists around me,

652
00:42:19,879 --> 00:42:20,959
so that they can help out the weak too.

653
00:42:22,638 --> 00:42:23,919
That's the reason
I want to become a hero.

654
00:42:24,479 --> 00:42:25,638
Not bad at all, Little Rock.

655
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:26,999
Come, let's drink.

656
00:42:28,399 --> 00:42:30,999
Let's hope that our dreams

657
00:42:31,638 --> 00:42:32,319
can be realized.

658
00:42:32,959 --> 00:42:33,718
- Cheers!
- To our dreams!
