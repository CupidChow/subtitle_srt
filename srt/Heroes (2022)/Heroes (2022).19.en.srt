to attend to.

48
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,120
Vice House Master Bai
used the command token

49
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,039
and brought some men

50

to carry out a huge mission for the House.

51

No.

53
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:50,439
He only said it'll only bring benefits
and no harm to the House.

54
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,639
But I think

55
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,120
I should inform you
and the House Master about this.

56

Well, let me tell you something

90
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,279
related to you.

91
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,279
Guan Qi

92
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,319
was an old friend of mine.

93
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,680
He was locked up
in the well for so many years.

94
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,279
You were the one who let him out.

95
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,560
I'll have to thank you for that.

96
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,560
I'll drink this tea instead of liquor

97
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,240
as a sign of respect to you.

98
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,560
It's quite risky to be your friend.

99
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,399
He couldn't see the light
when he was alive.

100
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,079
He even lost his head when he died.

101

Elder Chief Lei,

102
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,519
I shouldn't drink this tea.

103
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,800
It's not up to you

104
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,519
if you can pass this road.

105
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,439
It's also not up to you

106
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,439
to decline this tea.

107
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,560
I guess I can't turn you down.

108
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:30,439
But it's up to me
whether I'll continue this path.

109
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,160
Whether I'll be dead or alive,

110
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,800
I'll only know if I have a try.

111
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:46,799
It's mostly sulfur

112
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,120
and some charcoal powder.

113
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,559
It looks like we came to the right place.

114
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,200
When the five of us joined hands,

115
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,480
we could rarely be defeated.

116

Today,

120
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:39,679
I shall let you
have a taste of my power.

You're too late.

122
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:05,679
I already killed all of them.

123
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,320
Back then, I saved your life

124
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,200
because we needed
to join hands to kill Guan Qi.

125
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:12,320
Tonight,

126
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,720
you involved yourself
in the Six Half Hall's trade

127
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,320
and killed our Five Warriors.

128
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,519
I'll have to kill you now.

129
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:22,559
It's not a loss

130
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,200
to die by my hands.

131
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,600
It's not a loss to die in Di Feijing's hand?

132
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,440
Why can't I die in Lei Sun's hand

133
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,559
or be killed by someone more skillful?

134
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:42,639
Or

135
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,039
do I have to die?

136
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,320
You can't decide

137

if he lives or dies.

00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:50,319
There wasn't anyone at the House.

172
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:52,079
So I came to join the fun.

173
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:53,680
Is this the time to have fun?

174
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:55,599
No need to be anxious.

175
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,160
I can take care of myself.

176
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,240
Long is very skillful.

177
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:59,519
He did take a palm strike from me once.

178
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:00,000
Am I right?

179
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,240
Yes.

180
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,240
Miss Wen is a heroine among women.

181
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,200
Keep quiet.

182
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:07,519
They're coming.

183
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:10,920
Ready.

184
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:23,000
Stop.

185
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:31,200
Darn it!

186
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,200
Leave!

187
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,519
Wuxie and the rest succeed.

188
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,160
This sound

189
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,759
is the one I wanted to hear.

190
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,600
(Six Half Hall)

191
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,240
Chief Elder!

192
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:30,079
Get lost!

193
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,400
What happened?

194
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,799
Who did this?

195
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:40,799
Who!

196
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,759
I... I'm going to skin him alive!

197
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:48,559
We're done for.

198
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:49,720
It's over now.

199
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,960
We're doomed.

200
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,920
This is really bad!

201
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,200
The sound didn't come
from the right direction.

202
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:27,839
But it's a success regardless.

203
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:37,554
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

204
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,680
Not bad.

205
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:42,200
Not many in the martial arts world
can escape unscathed

206
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:43,839
after facing Lei Sun alone.

207
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:45,440
Mengzhen, you're flattering me.

208
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:47,440
I heard our men from the House

209
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,799
had blown up Lei Sun's firearms.

210
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,799
Everyone had done their best in this matter.

211
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,200
The mission
to hamper Lei's trade is a success.

212
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:58,839
The explosion
must have awakened many people.

213
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,000
Those from Youqiao Group
were probably shocked.

214
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:04,319
Bai,

215
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,079
how's your injury?

216
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,680
I'm fine.

217
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,240
Luckily, Mengzhen arrived in time

218
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,039
to save me.

219
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:13,920
But

220
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:15,759
I messed up your plan, right?

221
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,319
I stumbled

222
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:19,319
across the firearms after I saw Lei Sun.

223
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,000
I almost died at his hands.

224
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:25,319
Choufei,

225
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:27,319
I want to ask you something.

226
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:31,559
How did you end up
at the desolated place?

227
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,440
Fang Yingkan told me that

228
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,680
it's Six Half Hall's armory.

229
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,279
But there was
some misinformation from his side.

230
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,920
That's just the place
where Lei Sun stores the raw materials.

231
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:43,559
Mengzhen,

232
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:45,480
our goal is the same.

233
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,680
Bai managed to subdue those
from Six Half Hall.

234
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:50,440
I don't think so.

235
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,200
I think

236
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,599
Mengzhen doesn't think that way.

237
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:02,240
I told you

238
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:04,599
not to trust martial artists easily.

239
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,400
Fang Yingkan is suspicious.

240
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,319
I can't even see through his intention.

241
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,480
We've already declined him.

242
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,599
Why did you work with him again?

243
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,279
Fang Yingkan wants to take down Lei Sun

244
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:14,240
and the Youqiao Group.

245
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:15,400
We have the same goal.

246
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,440
Why can't we cooperate?

247
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,680
You're not working with him.

248
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:21,599
Both of you are using each other.

249
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:22,920
There's nothing wrong with that.

250
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,160
As long as we achieve our goal,

251
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,240
so be it.

252
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,000
As the Vice House Master
of the House of Sunset Drizzle,

253
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,680
you shouldn't have done...

254
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,559
What should the Vice House Master do,

255
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:30,599
and by what rules?

256
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,680
A person should know what can be done

257
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:33,799
and what can't be done.

258
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,680
What can't be done?

259
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,319
I think you mean
I'm not supposed to do anything.

260
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:43,200
Since we've brought it up,

261
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,079
I'll just be frank.

262
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:47,720
You made every decision

263
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,720
at the House of Sunset Drizzle.

264
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:50,640
The Messenger Pigeon Group provides

265
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,839
every piece of information to the Advisor.

266
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,799
All four Keepers have trusted followers

267
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:55,400
and subordinates.

268
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,279
What about me?

269
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,279
I have no followers and no power.

270
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,160
Even Lawless reported to you

271
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,559
when I deployed them.

272
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:06,960
Isn't that funny?

273
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,599
I'm the Vice House Master.

274
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,039
But I have no say

275
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:11,480
in such a small matter.

276
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,960
I'm just a powerless Vice House Master.

277
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,960
Today, you're capable enough

278
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,640
to act for your purpose.

279
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:19,039
But have you ever thought

280
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,599
that your decision had caused

281
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:22,599
our men of the Lawless
to die in vain?

282
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,640
How many of their family became
orphans and widows

283
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,839
because of you?

284
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,720
I've caused their deaths.

285
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:28,640
So I'll take responsibility for it.

286
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:30,440
But what's wrong
with having several people die

287
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,000
for the cause of the House?

288
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,279
Bai,

289
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,440
it's not just several people
of the House.

290
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,079
Everyone in the House

291
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:38,200
is our brother.

292
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,759
I can't treat everyone like my brothers.

293
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:44,759
Do you understand?

294
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:49,279
This is where we're different.

295
00:24:59,039 --> 00:24:59,720
I'll check on him.

296
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:07,640
Bai, can you calm down?

297
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,680
I'm calm.

298
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,839
It was because I'm too calm

299
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,720
that I could see how I'm different
from all of you.

300
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:15,319
We don't share the same path.

301
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:16,440
If we didn't,

302
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,839
we wouldn't be sworn brothers.

303
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:18,880
This is common in many people.

304
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:19,839
Everyone had the similar view
in the beginning.

305
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:21,079
As time passed by, their views changed.

306
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:22,640
Calm down a little and think about it carefully.

307
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,920
We're sworn brothers.

308
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:25,279
Don't be a fool.

309
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,440
Have you forgotten what I wanted?

310
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,920
I want to dominate the world
and be unparalleled.

311
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,000
But in the House of Sunset Drizzle,

312
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,319
Su Mengzhen always holds me down.

313
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:33,839
I can't even do anything.

314
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:34,839
Even the woman I have feelings for

315
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:35,880
likes Su Mengzhen.

316
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,640
Little Rock.

317
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,480
Have you noticed

318
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,799
we're no longer like we used to be?

319
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:58,200
I feel Mengzhen and I are not united

320
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:01,119
like before.

321
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,759
Bai.

322
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,945
(Second Year of Song-Yuan,
drawn by Bai Youjin)

323
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,706
(Drawn by Bai Youjin)

324
00:26:54,163 --> 00:26:56,485
(Studious Legacy)

325
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:59,039
The House of Sunset Drizzle
has blown up the goods to the north.

326
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:00,519
It has caused quite a stir.

327
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:01,960
I'm guilty.

328
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,000
Please punish me.

329
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,400
If you want the charcoal to burn thoroughly,

330
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,359
you must turn it over and pick carefully.

331
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,626
Then take out

332
00:27:15,627 --> 00:27:16,759
the ones

333
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:19,880
that are not burning and smash them.

334
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,519
The fire will burn fiercely that way.

335
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,880
It's the same in the martial arts world.

336
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,640
If you want to burn it all,

337
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,720
you need to find the defiant ones

338
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,119
and crush all of them.

339
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:37,839
Since it already happened,

340
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:40,640
can you find a way to solve it?

341
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:47,079
Since Lei Sun had made a mistake,

342
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,640
I'll just let this fool take the fall.

343
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:53,799
I won't let this problem implicate us.

344
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,240
I want you to take care of this.

345
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,119
If you fail me,

346
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,039
don't bother coming back alive.

347
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:06,279
Yes.

348
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:44,319
Were you behind this?

349
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:49,160
The House of Sunset Drizzle beat us to it.

350
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,960
Did you leak the information to them?

351
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,839
How could you suspect me?

352
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:56,240
This only happened the moment you got

353
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,559
your hands on the trade.

354
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:59,240
How can I not be suspicious of you?

355
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,880
I tried my best to help you

356
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:04,519
and even brought the Five Warriors here
from the Pili Sect.

357
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,240
If I wanted to harm you,

358
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,960
why would I want to harm my own people?

359
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:09,160
Besides,

360
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,519
I was with you yesterday.

361
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,880
I've done so much for you.

362
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,160
Yet, you don't trust me.

363
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:22,480
I'm worse than a dog.

364
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,960
There are two types of dogs.

365
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,960
One protects their master,
and the other bites their master.

366
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:29,440
Which one are you?

367
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,160
You caused serious injuries
to my father in the past.

368
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,119
But I gave him the last blow.

369
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:36,480
You wanted to come to the Capital.

370
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:38,279
I was also the one who gave you the power

371
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:39,240
of the Pili Sect.

372
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,960
I did everything

373
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,359
so I could stay by your side.

374
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:46,440
Can't you tell

375
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,279
which one I am?

376
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:53,119
Are you saying

377
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:56,599
you devote yourself to me

378
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:57,920
without asking for anything?

379
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:01,079
Why did you want to be involved
in the trade in the north?

380
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,480
Don't you know

381
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,559
what kind of person you are?

382
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,680
You're a cold-hearted person

383
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:11,000
who can discard anybody.

384
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,039
But if I can be involved
in the trade in the north,

385
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:20,119
you won't be able
to cast me away that easily.

386
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,920
Just leave.

387
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,400
I'm tired.

388
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,519
Wait.

(Memorial Tablet
of Beloved Father, Lei Zhenlei)

394
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,559
I wanted to avenge my father's death.

395
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,799
But I was the one who killed him.

396
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,240
Mr. Su,

397
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,160
my life must be a joke to you.

398
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:35,200
You did that to earn Lei Sun's trust.

399
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,119
If you hadn't given your father the last stab,

400
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:39,160
you wouldn't have the chance to avenge him.

401
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,680
I'm sure your father would understand.

402
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:57,119
Did Lei Sun
make things difficult for you?

403
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:07,720
He has started to suspect me.

404
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,760
I managed to deceive him for now.

405
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,679
The goods were destroyed.

406
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:13,320
He's too busy saving himself.

407
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,079
So he won't have time to give me trouble.

408
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,800
He lost for good this time.

409
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,119
But he'll retaliate.

410
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,559
All the more we can't put our guards down

411

at this time.

412
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:26,840
Don't worry.

413
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,159
I'll make sure I live

414
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,440
as long as he's not dead.

415
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:09,079
You two.

416
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:11,000
Go.

417
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,320

- Yes.
- Yes.

423
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,079
Go.

424
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,800
Minister Fu has given his order.

425
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,239
Go on now.

426
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:45,320
Yes.

427
00:35:58,639 --> 00:35:59,360
Lei.

428
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,920
I thought highly of you,

429
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,679
because you've been meticulous
all these years.

430
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,320
You've lived half of your life.

431
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,000
But why did you become
more sloppy the longer you live?

432
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,679
That explosion

433
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,320
awakened half of the Capital.

434
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,519
When it comes to this matter,

435
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,119
no one can cover this up,

436
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:24,920
no matter how powerful they are.

437
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:26,960
Don't blame me

438
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:27,960
for cutting ties with you.

439
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,159
You'll have to be responsible

440
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:33,519
for this matter.

441
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,559
I'm a nobody.

442
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:45,679
I wouldn't dare to implicate you.

443
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,400
I only wish for a chance to redeem myself.

444
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,440
So you can answer your superior.

445
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,679
Why do you sound sarcastic?

446
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:04,639
What do you mean by...

447
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:07,960
Yes,

448
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,039
I'm threatening you.

449
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,920
So what can you do about it?

450
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:13,800
You...

451
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,599
All these years,

452
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,039
you've been getting all the credits

453
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:18,639
while I've been taking the fall.

454
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:20,440
You took the money
when I committed the killings.

455
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,800
What else do you want?

456
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:23,679
To be honest with you,

457
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,119
you won't be able to answer your superior

458
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:27,679
even if I take all the blame.

459
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:29,800
You won't be able
to continue your trade in the north

460
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:32,960
as long as the House of Sunset Drizzle is around.

461
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,000
What can you answer to your superior?

462
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:38,360
Let me go first.

463
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:39,519
Let me go first.

464
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,639
Let go.

465
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:45,880
We can discuss this nicely.

466
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,800
Why the rush?

467
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,599
So tell me your plan.

468
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,320
Kill Su Mengzhen

469
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,119
and finish off the House of Sunset Drizzle.

470
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:55,800
All right.

471
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,440
You'll do it.

472
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,920
You'll take care of this.

473
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:02,679
Listen.

474
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,679
If you fail again this time,

475
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,800
I can't protect you anymore.

476
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:06,840
Thank you.

477
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:08,159
No need!

478
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:15,159
Sir.

479
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:17,559
Sir.

480
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,599
Everything is here.

481
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:21,679
All right.

482
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:23,000
Good.

483
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:26,800
Where's the Ruyi I gave him last year?

484
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,920
Don't worry. It's here, Sir.

485
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:30,679
Good.

486
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,320
Bring whatever you can back
to the residence.

487
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:34,400
Burn the ones that you can't.

488
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:35,039
Yes.

489
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:35,840
Let's go.

490
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:38,119
Use the back door.
Don't let anybody see us.

491
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:39,159
Yes, Sir.

492
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,840
Is the Six Half Hall involved

493
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,400
in last night's incident?

494
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,400
Yes.

495
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,159
Making weapons
without permission is a capital offense.

496
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,639
Anybody involved in this trade
is punishable by death.

497
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,079
Why are you and Father doing this?

498
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:04,639
Chun.

499
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,039
Matters in the martial arts world

500
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,000
are not as simple as you think.

501
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,920
Even for someone in your father's position,

502
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,119
it's not up to him

503
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,000
to stop engaging in the trade.

504
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:19,079
I'm not surprised

505
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:21,039
there are people
controlling the Six Half Hall.

506
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,800
How much have you done for them?

507
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:25,800
It has already come to this.

508
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,960
Are you still going to keep it from me?

509
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,079
Chun.

510
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:34,840
Let me take care of the crisis first.

511
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:36,360
I'll tell you

512
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:38,880
about the rest later.

513
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:56,920
Chancellor,

514
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:59,559
I've come up with another perfect plan.

515
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,280
What is it?

516
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,280
I think

517
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:11,440
it's better to take measures to deal
with the situation than to mend it.

518
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,519
Since it's related to the martial arts world,

519
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,360
let these martial artists take care of it.

520
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:19,440
We'll let Lei Sun redeem himself

521
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:21,800
by killing Su Mengzhen.

522
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,960
If he succeeds,

523
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,960
the House of Sunset Drizzle will be powerless.

524
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:32,079
No one will give you trouble after this.

525
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:33,679
If he fails,

526
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:36,360
we can still punish him.

527
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:39,079
Redeeming himself to survive.

528
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,159
Lei Sun is a clever man.

529
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:44,679
Did he send you here to say this?

530
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:47,519
(Studious Legacy)
Of course, not.

531
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,800
I came up with the plan.

532
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,639
Last time, no one delivered the goods

533
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,519
because the contact was killed.

534
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:12,000
And the goods were blown up this time.

535
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:14,639
What if those in the north rush us?

536
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:15,320
Then...

537
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,079
I'm sure they'll grant us some time

538
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,199
after trading with them for many years.

539
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:20,559
Yes.

540
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:21,880
Send a messenger

541
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,199
to tell them that there won't be
any shipment within half a year.

542
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:28,599
No need to bring trouble to ourselves.

543
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:32,440
Chancellor, you're indeed wise.

544
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:01,159
Greetings, Vice House Master Bai.

545
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,840
My master wants to see you.

546
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,199
Who's your master?

547
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:06,079
You'll know

548
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,559
who my master is

549
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,639
after you get there.

550
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:10,519
This way, please.

551
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:27,679
This way.

552
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:46,840
This way, please.

553
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,119
Life is a gamble.

554
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,760
Do you want to place a bet?

555
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,360
I thought you had set one up for me.

556
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:07,199
I almost died

557
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,559
in that firearms workshop.

558
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,559
Mr. Bai, you have luck in gambling.

559
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:13,840
Didn't your life win

560
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:17,159
against five lives from the Lei's?

561
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:19,199
That's why life is a gamble.

562
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,000
I never wait for my doom.

563
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,280
This is why you have my admiration.

564
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,480
People keep saying
everything is definite.

565
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:27,280
That's boring.

566
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,920
I like gambling.

567
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:31,960
Because there's nothing definite
on the gambling table.

568
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,880
You can place your bet as you like today.

569
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:35,679
I'll cover all your losses.

570
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:37,960
You can keep your winnings.

571
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:39,000
Sure.

572
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,280
Aren't you afraid I might bet on your life?
