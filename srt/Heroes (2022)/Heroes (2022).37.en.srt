It's late now.
What are you guys doing here?

34
00:02:08,104 --> 00:02:09,824
The scout we sent to the North
has returned.

35
00:02:10,144 --> 00:02:11,744
Mr. Thirteen and Marquis

36
00:02:11,744 --> 00:02:13,144
didn't find the item.

37
00:02:13,304 --> 00:02:15,343
I assume Wang Xiaoshi has the item.

38
00:02:15,663 --> 00:02:17,663
They did well at keeping this a secret.

39
00:02:18,144 --> 00:02:21,223
No one actually heard about this
when it's such a huge deal.

40
00:02:21,223 --> 00:02:24,024
We would have no way to know

41
00:02:24,304 --> 00:02:25,424
that Wang Xiaoshi actually found the item

42
00:02:25,704 --> 00:02:28,783
if we didn't send a scout to the North.

43
00:02:29,503 --> 00:02:32,503
Does the Chancellor know about this?

44
00:02:32,503 --> 00:02:33,343
- No.
- Yes.

45
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,783
Chancellor lives a secluded life.

46
00:02:40,264 --> 00:02:42,223
I am the one managing
the martial arts world for him.

47
00:02:42,424 --> 00:02:43,824
And I only got to hear about it by now.

48
00:02:44,584 --> 00:02:45,943
How did Chancellor hear about it?

49
00:02:46,343 --> 00:02:47,144
I reported it

50
00:02:47,783 --> 00:02:49,463
to Chancellor before coming here

51
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:52,783
as I thought it was an important matter.

52
00:03:04,424 --> 00:03:05,463
Were you the one who made the report?

53
00:03:12,183 --> 00:03:15,223
We do have to report this issue
to Chancellor first as it's huge.

54
00:03:18,424 --> 00:03:19,223
You did the right thing.

55
00:03:22,584 --> 00:03:23,903
If there's nothing else,

56
00:03:25,144 --> 00:03:26,144
you two may head back and rest.

57
00:03:28,343 --> 00:03:29,383
Yes, sir.

(House of Sunset Drizzle)

59
00:03:51,544 --> 00:03:54,463
We made a report to Chancellor
without Bai Choufei's permission.

60
00:03:54,824 --> 00:03:56,824
I'm afraid he holds
a grudge against us now.

61
00:03:57,183 --> 00:03:58,304
So what?

62
00:03:58,744 --> 00:04:00,304
You and I were originally
Official Fu's subordinates.

63
00:04:00,463 --> 00:04:02,864
After that, Chancellor
assigned me to serve Bai Choufei.

64
00:04:03,584 --> 00:04:04,463
No matter how we put it,

65
00:04:04,704 --> 00:04:06,024
we're Chancellor's subordinates.

66
00:04:06,024 --> 00:04:06,744
Subordinates?

67
00:04:07,304 --> 00:04:09,424
You and I were originally
Official Fu's lackeys.

68
00:04:09,704 --> 00:04:11,383
After that, we became Chancellor's lackeys.

69
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,544
Now, we're the lackeys of Bai Choufei.

70
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:14,943
Why are you degrading yourself?

71
00:04:15,183 --> 00:04:16,623
Isn't that the truth?

72
00:04:17,183 --> 00:04:19,464
We can indulge ourselves in worldly
pleasures and do whatever we want,

73
00:04:19,864 --> 00:04:22,104
and I can torture people
in prison all I like

74
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,383
precisely because we're the lackeys
of an influential figure.

75
00:04:25,023 --> 00:04:26,503
This is the way of the world.

76
00:04:26,503 --> 00:04:28,183
But now, we're serving Bai Choufei.

77
00:04:28,183 --> 00:04:29,063
Can you tolerate that?

78
00:04:31,383 --> 00:04:32,224
We have to.

79
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,864
Bai Choufei has an eccentric temper!

80
00:04:39,544 --> 00:04:40,224
Forget it.

81
00:04:41,503 --> 00:04:43,263
Just smile more often in front of him
in the future.

82
00:04:43,464 --> 00:04:45,703
Brother, remember this.

83
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:49,183
A lackey will survive

84
00:04:49,344 --> 00:04:52,023
while a subordinate will not.

(House of Sunset Drizzle)

86
00:05:08,784 --> 00:05:11,784
Your sworn brother,
Wang Xiaoshi, has returned.

87
00:05:13,183 --> 00:05:13,984
I met him.

88
00:05:15,703 --> 00:05:16,823
So what if he has returned?

89
00:05:18,304 --> 00:05:20,263
Su Mengzhen already died at my hands.

90
00:05:20,984 --> 00:05:21,864
He

91
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:23,464
and the old members
of the House of Sunset Drizzle

92
00:05:24,823 --> 00:05:25,864
won't be able to turn the tide.

93
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,344
Naturally, it's not an issue

94
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:30,304
if Wang Xiaoshi is by himself.

95
00:05:31,784 --> 00:05:32,864
The problem

96
00:05:34,383 --> 00:05:36,183
is the item he brought back with him.

97
00:05:41,304 --> 00:05:44,943
Chancellor, you must be referring
to the dispatch order.

98
00:05:45,744 --> 00:05:46,864
So, you already found out?

99
00:05:48,183 --> 00:05:50,344
I don't care how many men
you have to dispatch

100
00:05:50,703 --> 00:05:52,424
or how much price you have to pay for it.

101
00:05:52,984 --> 00:05:54,623
You have to retrieve it

102
00:05:54,823 --> 00:05:56,104
and hand it to me personally.

103
00:05:57,503 --> 00:06:00,503
Leave none of the insiders alive.

104
00:06:01,664 --> 00:06:02,623
Deal with them.

105
00:06:07,383 --> 00:06:08,503
However, in my opinion,

106
00:06:09,464 --> 00:06:11,904
even if we dispatch our men
to locate Wang Xiaoshi,

107
00:06:12,904 --> 00:06:15,023
we cannot be sure
that he won't hide the dispatch order.

108
00:06:16,383 --> 00:06:17,344
By then,

109
00:06:17,823 --> 00:06:20,263
it'll be like finding

110
00:06:21,503 --> 00:06:23,183
a needle in a haystack.

111
00:06:28,104 --> 00:06:30,023
Do you have any suggestions then?

112
00:06:31,943 --> 00:06:32,943
Chancellor, don't worry.

113
00:06:33,623 --> 00:06:34,623
Naturally, I have a way

114
00:06:35,224 --> 00:06:36,784
to make him deliver the dispatch order

115
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,823

00:10:04,263 --> 00:10:05,224
But that might not be the case.

170
00:10:05,464 --> 00:10:06,903
Sworn brothers

171
00:10:07,303 --> 00:10:08,663
who had been through
thick and thin together

172
00:10:08,783 --> 00:10:10,224
do treat each other like true friends too.

173
00:10:11,704 --> 00:10:13,783
But in the end, you still betrayed them.

174
00:10:15,023 --> 00:10:16,104
Do you blame me?

175
00:10:16,104 --> 00:10:17,423
Of course!

176
00:10:19,023 --> 00:10:20,543
He's my martial brother.

177
00:10:21,783 --> 00:10:23,263
I was already following him

178
00:10:23,663 --> 00:10:26,783
when I was this young.

179
00:10:28,944 --> 00:10:30,344
Not only did you kill him,

180
00:10:31,663 --> 00:10:33,663
but you also hurt Little Rock!

181
00:10:34,824 --> 00:10:36,984
You made him lose
two sworn brothers at once!

182
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:38,903
Su Mengzhen and I
were never sworn brothers!

183
00:10:39,344 --> 00:10:40,464
Back then in Kushuipu,

184
00:10:41,543 --> 00:10:42,344
he and I would have
never been sworn brothers

185
00:10:42,344 --> 00:10:43,623
if it weren't for Little Rock!

186
00:10:48,944 --> 00:10:49,824
Your martial brother

187
00:10:49,851 --> 00:10:52,793
(Chou Shi House, Four Virtues)

188
00:10:52,824 --> 00:10:54,464
was born with everything.

189
00:10:55,464 --> 00:10:56,303
But what about me?

190
00:10:56,663 --> 00:10:58,224
I have to depend on myself
to get everything.

191
00:10:58,503 --> 00:11:00,464
However, there's only one throne
at the peak of the martial arts world.

192
00:11:00,984 --> 00:11:02,104
So, it's either him

193
00:11:03,023 --> 00:11:03,903
or me.

194
00:11:04,184 --> 00:11:05,303
Are you out of your mind?

195
00:11:05,423 --> 00:11:07,464
Mengzhen has never thought of killing you.

196
00:11:07,464 --> 00:11:09,224
Many of our members

197
00:11:09,224 --> 00:11:10,224
have died in order to save you!

198
00:11:10,224 --> 00:11:11,903
You should blame it all on Su Mengzhen!

199
00:11:12,224 --> 00:11:14,023
I was his scapegoat.

200
00:11:14,224 --> 00:11:15,944
However, has anyone offered me
a helping hand

201
00:11:16,104 --> 00:11:17,064
when I was suffering in prison?

202
00:11:17,464 --> 00:11:18,864
Was it my fault

203
00:11:19,104 --> 00:11:19,903
that I ended up like this?

204
00:11:21,344 --> 00:11:22,303
Was it my fault?

205
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:25,663
No one blamed you for it.

206
00:11:25,824 --> 00:11:27,104
Everyone just wanted to help you!

207
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:28,344
I don't need any help!

208
00:11:28,464 --> 00:11:30,064
No one helped me

209
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,184
to get to where I am today!

210
00:11:32,944 --> 00:11:36,824
Your help is meaningless to me.

211
00:11:37,303 --> 00:11:38,744
I don't need your sympathy.

212
00:11:44,944 --> 00:11:45,744
Forget it.

213
00:11:46,543 --> 00:11:47,344
Let's stop arguing.

214
00:11:49,423 --> 00:11:50,623
We finally met
each other again after so long.

215
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:52,623
I assume you want

216
00:11:53,704 --> 00:11:55,224
to sever your ties with me by doing so.

217
00:11:57,328 --> 00:12:02,501
(Chou Shi House, Four Virtues)

218
00:12:02,543 --> 00:12:04,744
Take the portraits.
You drew them yourself.

219
00:12:06,344 --> 00:12:07,944
Little Rock and I won't be able
to see each other again.

220
00:12:08,224 --> 00:12:09,704
It's inappropriate for us to keep them.

221
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:11,903
It's best

222
00:12:12,903 --> 00:12:13,824
if you keep them.

223
00:12:22,344 --> 00:12:23,224
We have already fallen out
with each other.

224
00:12:24,824 --> 00:12:26,104
It's meaningless to keep the portraits.

225
00:12:29,184 --> 00:12:30,303
I'm not

226
00:12:31,903 --> 00:12:32,663
in the portrait anyway...

227
00:12:35,663 --> 00:12:37,224
It was already like this

228
00:12:38,543 --> 00:12:39,744
when I saw it.

229
00:12:40,783 --> 00:12:43,783
Judging from the strokes,
it should be Little Rock.

230
00:13:22,623 --> 00:13:23,344
Wen Rou,

231
00:13:27,464 --> 00:13:28,503
you want to help me out, right?

232
00:13:30,984 --> 00:13:32,143
You can help me out one last time.

233
00:13:54,423 --> 00:13:55,663
Keep an eye on her.

234
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:57,224
Yes, sir.

235
00:13:58,663 --> 00:14:00,623
House Master Bai, you're wise indeed.

236
00:14:00,783 --> 00:14:02,143
You can complete any task

237
00:14:02,143 --> 00:14:03,464
and take down anyone.

238
00:14:12,824 --> 00:14:13,543
House Master Bai?

239
00:14:15,623 --> 00:14:16,423
Bai Choufei!

240
00:14:27,903 --> 00:14:29,423
I can complete any task
that is given to me.

241
00:14:32,184 --> 00:14:33,663
You like to deliver news, don't you?

242
00:14:34,704 --> 00:14:36,064
You can deliver
another piece of news for me.

243
00:15:13,033 --> 00:15:16,928
(Dafo Temple)

244
00:15:44,158 --> 00:15:49,181

(Maitreya, Solemn)

247
00:16:44,423 --> 00:16:45,263
Prepare to strike.

248
00:16:45,383 --> 00:16:46,023
Remember.

249
00:16:46,023 --> 00:16:47,824
Only His Majesty is allowed
to enter the mountain pass.

250
00:16:47,824 --> 00:16:49,263
Stop the others from entering the pass.

251
00:16:51,383 --> 00:16:52,464
Act cautiously.

252
00:16:52,704 --> 00:16:53,864
Do not hurt His Majesty at all costs.

253
00:16:54,584 --> 00:16:56,383
And, wear this.

254
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,464
We're just robbing His Majesty.

255
00:16:58,464 --> 00:16:59,543
Do you need to be this nervous?

256
00:16:59,704 --> 00:17:01,023
It's better to be safe than sorry.

257
00:17:01,023 --> 00:17:02,903
It'll be easier for us to escape
if we cover our faces.

258
00:17:03,263 --> 00:17:04,023
Wear your mask.

259
00:17:11,704 --> 00:17:12,224
Let's go!

260
00:17:12,224 --> 00:17:12,904
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

261
00:17:37,343 --> 00:17:38,303
Stop right there!

262
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,184
Protect His Majesty!

263
00:18:09,103 --> 00:18:09,823
You're something else.

264
00:18:10,144 --> 00:18:11,464
You're protecting His Majesty
from our attacks.

265
00:18:11,464 --> 00:18:12,543
You're pretty accurate with your hits.

266
00:18:13,424 --> 00:18:14,023
Let's go.

267
00:18:50,744 --> 00:18:51,664
Your Majesty, please pardon us

268
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:53,144
for the sudden disturbance.

269
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,744
Excellent.

270
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,144
Well done indeed.

271
00:18:59,224 --> 00:19:01,144
One of you resigned from post

272
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,783
and the other one
hasn't been reinstated yet.

273
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,823
Both of you are over 100 years old in total.

274
00:19:05,823 --> 00:19:07,144
Look at the mess you two have created.

275
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:09,984
Do you two truly think

276
00:19:10,543 --> 00:19:12,503
that I cannot bear to chop your heads off?

277
00:19:12,904 --> 00:19:14,384
Your Majesty, it was difficult for us
to seek an audience with you

278
00:19:14,503 --> 00:19:15,744
since we haven't been reinstated yet.

279
00:19:16,343 --> 00:19:18,343
That's why we could only risk our lives.

280
00:19:18,744 --> 00:19:19,664
There's a good reason for this.

281
00:19:20,103 --> 00:19:22,863
That's why we have
to see Your Majesty no matter what.

282
00:19:23,224 --> 00:19:25,144
We're willing to face the music

283
00:19:25,263 --> 00:19:27,543
no matter what it is.

284
00:19:28,744 --> 00:19:30,144
I'm already here.

285
00:19:30,384 --> 00:19:31,783
What is it? Speak.

286
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,144
Your Majesty, we wish
to recommend someone to you.

287
00:19:34,384 --> 00:19:35,583
I guarantee with my life

288
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,103
that he won't hurt Your Majesty.

289
00:19:50,503 --> 00:19:51,384
Greetings, Your Majesty.

290
00:19:54,664 --> 00:19:56,863
I'm sure you're not an ordinary person
when the two of them

291
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:58,543
are risking their lives
to recommend you to me.

292
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:00,023
Tell me your name.

293
00:20:01,144 --> 00:20:02,103
I'm Wang Xiaoshi.

294
00:20:02,904 --> 00:20:03,904
I'm a martial artist.

295
00:20:05,144 --> 00:20:06,904
Your Majesty, I wish to show you
an item that I've retrieved

296
00:20:07,224 --> 00:20:08,384
from the North.

297
00:20:09,224 --> 00:20:10,823
Your Majesty will understand
the situation after reading it.

298
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,188
(Chancellor, Palace Secretariat.
Urgent: Eliminate the vagabonds)

299
00:21:13,904 --> 00:21:14,664
Advisor?

300
00:21:18,103 --> 00:21:19,664
Wang Xiaoshi is trustworthy.

301
00:21:20,343 --> 00:21:22,384
Divine Marquis and Official Liu Anshi
are together with him too.

302
00:21:23,744 --> 00:21:25,503
I don't think something bad
will happen to them.

303
00:21:27,904 --> 00:21:29,144
But we've received no news from them

304
00:21:29,144 --> 00:21:30,904
even after so long.

305
00:21:32,303 --> 00:21:33,984
After all, it concerns His Majesty.

306
00:21:35,624 --> 00:21:37,343
Everyone!

307
00:21:38,863 --> 00:21:39,823
Let's go and take a look.

308
00:21:44,023 --> 00:21:46,464
Everyone, my name is Ren Lao.

309
00:21:47,464 --> 00:21:49,144
Before this, I was serving
Official Fu Zongshu.

310
00:21:49,303 --> 00:21:50,583
I'd been doing dirty deeds for him

311
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:51,823
inside the dungeon.

312
00:21:52,023 --> 00:21:53,543
Now, I'm serving Bai Choufei.

313
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:56,023
Wen Rou has been abducted.

314
00:21:59,063 --> 00:22:01,063
Where did you guys take her?

315
00:22:01,503 --> 00:22:02,583
The House of Sunset Drizzle.

316
00:22:03,023 --> 00:22:03,984
Bai Choufei said

317
00:22:04,144 --> 00:22:06,063
Wen Rou will be fine as long as

318
00:22:06,464 --> 00:22:07,664
you bring us
the proof of Chancellor Cai's crime.

319
00:22:09,543 --> 00:22:11,144
Bai Choufei has already
descended into madness.

320
00:22:11,303 --> 00:22:13,063
I don't know what he'll do to Wen Rou.

321
00:22:15,984 --> 00:22:16,664
Tang Qimei!

322
00:22:16,863 --> 00:22:17,303
Yes, sir!

323
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:18,904
Send someone to notify
Wang Xiaoshi immediately!

324
00:22:19,144 --> 00:22:19,744
Yes, sir!

325
00:22:20,863 --> 00:22:21,664
Gather everyone

326
00:22:21,823 --> 00:22:23,103
and head to the House of Sunset Drizzle!

327
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:24,103
Yes, sir!

328
00:22:24,503 --> 00:22:26,664
Everyone, wait up!

329
00:22:27,224 --> 00:22:28,464
I have another request!

330
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:32,103
I beg of you!

331
00:22:33,464 --> 00:22:35,303
Can anyone stab me in the abdomen?

332
00:22:36,783 --> 00:22:38,224
That darned Bai Choufei said

333
00:22:38,543 --> 00:22:40,664
he would chop my brother into pieces

334
00:22:41,863 --> 00:22:44,343
if my body was intact!

335
00:22:44,783 --> 00:22:45,904
I have no choice but to do this.

336
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:47,863
That's why I'm begging you all,

337
00:22:48,063 --> 00:22:49,144
can anyone please stab me?

338
00:22:50,144 --> 00:22:51,144
I'm begging you all!

339
00:22:53,384 --> 00:22:54,224
Don't go!

340
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:55,863
I'm begging you all!

341
00:22:56,144 --> 00:22:58,063
If not, my brother will die!

342
00:22:58,624 --> 00:22:59,863
Can anyone please stab me?

343
00:23:00,384 --> 00:23:01,863
Please stab me!

344
00:23:02,384 --> 00:23:04,144
Anyone! Please stab me!

345
00:23:04,664 --> 00:23:06,783
If not, my brother will die!

346
00:23:15,624 --> 00:23:16,783
Bai Choufei!

347
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:18,863
You're too much!

348
00:23:19,904 --> 00:23:22,303
The heavens will deal with you!

349
00:23:44,704 --> 00:23:45,904
Now that I'm here,

350
00:23:46,263 --> 00:23:48,343
I feel like the entire Capital
is under my feet.

351
00:23:49,103 --> 00:23:50,424
I can sacrifice everything

352
00:23:50,904 --> 00:23:52,583
for this position.

353
00:23:53,464 --> 00:23:54,904
In the past, I might hesitate.

354
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:59,384
But now, I have no hesitations.

355
00:24:00,944 --> 00:24:02,343
But look at you right now.

356
00:24:02,744 --> 00:24:03,783
What have you obtained?

357
00:24:04,823 --> 00:24:06,184
Although you rule
the martial arts world now,

358
00:24:06,624 --> 00:24:08,103
you're alone.

359
00:24:08,424 --> 00:24:09,744
You've gotten nothing!

360
00:24:16,103 --> 00:24:16,984
House Master Bai,

361
00:24:17,184 --> 00:24:19,103
the Chancellor has sent you some helpers.

362
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:20,583
They've already arrived.

363
00:24:21,384 --> 00:24:22,224
Very good.

364
00:24:23,023 --> 00:24:23,984
House Master Bai.

365
00:24:26,303 --> 00:24:27,464
Get to the point.

366
00:24:30,063 --> 00:24:33,583
House Master Bai, can you
please spare Ren Lao?

367
00:24:34,103 --> 00:24:35,424
He won't be able to survive

368
00:24:35,543 --> 00:24:36,744
if he suffers a blow

369
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:38,303
on a fragile body like that.

370
00:24:38,823 --> 00:24:40,944
House Master Bai, if you still
hold a grudge against us,

371
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:42,023
I will take

372
00:24:43,303 --> 00:24:44,144
the blow for him.

373
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:53,464
What are you saying?

374
00:24:53,904 --> 00:24:54,944
In the past, you guys are the top dogs

375
00:24:55,184 --> 00:24:56,144
while I'm just some lowly soil.

376
00:24:56,343 --> 00:24:57,904
I deserved to be stomped on.

377
00:24:59,543 --> 00:25:00,343
I don't blame you guys for that.

378
00:25:01,144 --> 00:25:03,184
Come, let's drink.

379
00:25:05,023 --> 00:25:07,464
After this drink,
you can find your brother

380
00:25:07,984 --> 00:25:09,144
and tell him to stop.

381
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:11,624
Thank you, House Master Bai.

382
00:25:14,503 --> 00:25:15,664
Calm down, House Master Bai.

383
00:25:15,823 --> 00:25:17,583
Please calm down.

384
00:25:23,744 --> 00:25:24,583
Did you see that?

385
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:26,664
This was the person who stepped on me

386
00:25:27,704 --> 00:25:28,944
and forced me
to consume raw meat in the past.

387
00:25:29,464 --> 00:25:32,184
But now, he has

388
00:25:33,664 --> 00:25:35,543
to obey my every command.

389
00:25:36,303 --> 00:25:38,023
This is the power

390
00:25:39,144 --> 00:25:40,224
that I have obtained.

391
00:25:41,224 --> 00:25:42,464
Go to hell!

392
00:26:06,184 --> 00:26:07,063
You saw that, right?

393
00:26:08,863 --> 00:26:10,224
This is what I've obtained.

394
00:27:58,488 --> 00:28:02,137
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

395
00:28:15,783 --> 00:28:16,624
I recognize you guys.

396
00:28:17,944 --> 00:28:19,503
You guys are old members of the House.

397
00:28:20,984 --> 00:28:23,063
I don't wish to spill any of your blood.

398
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:25,263
Move out of the way.

399
00:28:27,984 --> 00:28:28,744
Everyone,

400
00:28:29,303 --> 00:28:30,823
we have no choice here.

401
00:28:37,464 --> 00:28:38,503
Let's assist Wang Xiaoshi.

402
00:29:38,248 --> 00:29:40,150
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

403
00:29:42,674 --> 00:29:44,111
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

404
00:29:44,208 --> 00:29:46,549
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

405
00:30:16,288 --> 00:30:19,686
(Gale as fierce as gold,
the drizzle exists forever)

406
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,804
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

407
00:31:32,328 --> 00:31:35,648
(Gale as fierce as gold,
the drizzle exists forever)

408
00:32:03,023 --> 00:32:04,144
Those people down there

409
00:32:04,904 --> 00:32:06,263
are members of Trunk Tower,

410
00:32:07,464 --> 00:32:08,944
a sect established by Little Rock.

411
00:32:10,464 --> 00:32:11,343
But today,

412
00:32:13,063 --> 00:32:14,464
all of them will die here.

413
00:32:16,263 --> 00:32:17,783
Little Rock will surely come.

414
00:32:18,063 --> 00:32:19,063
When he's here,

415
00:32:19,184 --> 00:32:20,263
he'll definitely kill you!

416
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:24,343
Of course he'll be here.

417
00:32:25,263 --> 00:32:27,384
I only abducted you
because I wanted him to come.

418
00:32:28,303 --> 00:32:29,343
But he will

419
00:32:30,384 --> 00:32:31,543
die together with you today.

420
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:17,303
Bai Choufei,

421
00:33:18,103 --> 00:33:19,103
hand over Wen Rou!

422
00:33:20,263 --> 00:33:21,224
You have to pay

423
00:33:22,384 --> 00:33:23,624
for Mengzhen's death too!

424
00:33:23,624 --> 00:33:24,744
He's already dead.

425
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:25,944
Why should I pay for his death?

426
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:27,624
A murderer like you must pay with his life!

427
00:33:27,823 --> 00:33:29,184
Wen Rou is upstairs right now.

428
00:33:30,543 --> 00:33:31,384
But later,

429
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,624
I'm not sure who will die first.

430
00:33:36,783 --> 00:33:38,343
If you dare to hurt Wen Rou,

431
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:40,704
I'll make you pay for it

432
00:33:41,503 --> 00:33:44,063
even if this is the Imperial Palace!

433
00:33:44,503 --> 00:33:46,184
Let's see if you're capable enough then.

434
00:34:20,744 --> 00:34:21,943
Why did you kill Mengzhen?

435
00:35:36,024 --> 00:35:36,903
You killed Mengzhen.

436
00:35:37,064 --> 00:35:38,584
Now, I'm going to kill you,
and you're going to kill me.

437
00:35:40,504 --> 00:35:42,303
How did our brotherhood
turn out like this?

438
00:35:42,744 --> 00:35:44,184
Was it because of our selfish desires?

439
00:35:47,823 --> 00:35:49,263
It's because that's the nature
of the martial arts world.

440
00:35:49,263 --> 00:35:50,704
It's every man for himself.

441
00:35:52,224 --> 00:35:53,704
There's only one throne

442
00:35:54,664 --> 00:35:56,303
at the peak of the martial arts world.

443
00:37:53,144 --> 00:37:53,783
Wen Rou.

444
00:37:54,303 --> 00:37:55,783
Mengzhen, what's wrong?

445
00:37:59,263 --> 00:38:01,263
This tree is the Tree of Sorrow.

446
00:38:01,823 --> 00:38:03,144
Underneath the tree

447
00:38:03,343 --> 00:38:05,303
lies a secret that only
the past house masters know about.

448
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:06,983
A secret?

449
00:38:08,544 --> 00:38:09,544
The stone lantern from afar

450
00:38:10,064 --> 00:38:11,064
is actually a switch.

451
00:38:11,544 --> 00:38:12,983
It makes the secret tunnel
underneath the tree accessible.

452
00:38:14,744 --> 00:38:16,664
Once the House of Sunset Drizzle
has fallen beyond redemption,

453
00:38:16,943 --> 00:38:19,144
the members can use this tunnel
to escape to the outside.

454
00:38:45,618 --> 00:38:48,556
(Virtuous and Kind)

455
00:39:06,259 --> 00:39:09,304
(Virtuous and Kind)

456
00:39:09,343 --> 00:39:10,224
Chun.

457
00:39:10,343 --> 00:39:10,983
Wen Rou.

458
00:39:19,144 --> 00:39:19,983
Mengzhen?

459
00:39:25,104 --> 00:39:25,823
What's that smell?

460
00:39:26,343 --> 00:39:27,303
It's Revival Poison.

461
00:39:28,463 --> 00:39:29,704
It's a secret poison
developed by the Wen family.

462
00:39:30,224 --> 00:39:31,104
You should know what it is.

463
00:39:32,463 --> 00:39:34,184
So, this was what you meant

464
00:39:35,544 --> 00:39:37,064
when you told me
that Mengzhen was still alive?

465
00:39:39,624 --> 00:39:40,624
He did so willingly.

466
00:39:42,184 --> 00:39:44,224
Mengzhen is a prideful person.

467
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:46,144
Why would he...

468
00:39:47,504 --> 00:39:48,303
Wen Rou,

469
00:39:52,664 --> 00:39:55,064
the Revival Poison
might be able to prolong my life,

470
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,584
but it will also turn me

471
00:39:57,584 --> 00:39:59,823
into a mindless puppet eventually.

472
00:40:00,343 --> 00:40:01,624
I know that.

473
00:40:02,943 --> 00:40:03,983
Don't blame Chun for this.

474
00:40:05,343 --> 00:40:07,863
Mengzhen, is this even worth it?

475
00:40:08,504 --> 00:40:11,704
There's no antidote to this poison.

476
00:40:13,983 --> 00:40:15,823
Now, I'm no longer able to wield my blade.

477
00:40:16,343 --> 00:40:17,783
What other choices do I have?

478
00:40:19,783 --> 00:40:20,943
It's all for tonight's sake.

479
00:40:21,783 --> 00:40:22,943
This is the last time.

480
00:40:24,783 --> 00:40:25,504
Wen Rou,

481
00:40:27,983 --> 00:40:29,343
you've already opened
the secret tunnel for us.

482
00:40:29,863 --> 00:40:31,343
You've done all you can.

483
00:40:32,584 --> 00:40:33,383
Next,

484
00:40:34,664 --> 00:40:35,704
just leave the rest to us.

485
00:40:36,823 --> 00:40:38,144
I want to tag along.

486
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:40,783
Those who are present tonight

487
00:40:41,863 --> 00:40:43,144
are people

488
00:40:43,664 --> 00:40:44,744
