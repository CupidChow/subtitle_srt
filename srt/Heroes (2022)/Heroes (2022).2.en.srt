(Fresh Beginning,

32
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,676
(Song-Liao Border)

33
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,000
Who are you?

34
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:31,680
Su Mengzhen.

35
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:34,254
(Su Mengzhen, House of Sunset Drizzle)

36
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,960
I've heard that name before.

37
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,840
I heard from the Song people
on the battlefield.

38
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,520
There's someone from the South

39
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,879
who wants to cross the battlefield

40
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,039
just to take one person's head.

41
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,560
Are you here to take my head?

42
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,039
You are overestimating yourself.

43
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,439
Kill him.

44
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,319
I want someone's head,

45
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,479
but it's not yours.

46
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:30,718
Come.

47
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:31,919
Come.

48
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:49,598
This is it?

49
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:53,146
(Yang Wuxie, House of Sunset Drizzle)

50
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:54,998
Why is it so small?

51
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:57,878
The Liao people usually use limewater
to cook a person's head.

52
00:03:58,278 --> 00:03:59,879
This is the size after it is cooked.

53
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,119
It's convenient for them to take it back
to Dading Division to get their reward.

54
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,918
No one came back
from the battle of Chenjiagu.

55
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:13,278
General Yang sacrificed himself
for the country.

56
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:14,718
No matter what,

57
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:16,478
I won't let his body

58
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:17,478
fall into the enemy's hands.

59
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,158
General Yang would be pleased

60
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,319
to have a friend like you in his life.

61
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,238
Mister.

62
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:39,398
It's hot.

63
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,358
Careful!

64
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:49,798
It's bitter.

65
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,038
This is obviously not as good as liquor.

66
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:54,199
Good medicine is bitter.

67
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,038
Head south.

68
00:04:58,278 --> 00:04:59,199
I miss my father.

69
00:05:08,798 --> 00:05:11,718
Why does it feel like a sneak attack
every time they send a letter?

70
00:05:12,238 --> 00:05:13,519
We are both subordinates.

71
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:16,158
Can you call the archer out

72
00:05:17,398 --> 00:05:18,278
to meet us?

73
00:05:19,398 --> 00:05:21,278
I just want to reason with him.

74
00:05:21,398 --> 00:05:23,238
You can't shoot at me all the time.

75
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:29,519
He answered you.

76
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:35,478
Pretentious!

77
00:05:40,158 --> 00:05:40,879
What is it?

78
00:05:41,358 --> 00:05:42,478
Xue Xishen is dead.

79
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,398
Who killed him?

80
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:46,598
Because of a box,

81
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,319
Xiliu turned into
a horrifying battlefield.

82
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:51,639
What is in that box?

83
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:55,119
Father told me

84
00:05:55,718 --> 00:05:57,398
this is related to
the Delegate, Hua Wucuo.

85
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,199
I want to take over
House of Sunset Drizzle.

86
00:05:59,798 --> 00:06:01,478
Hua Wucuo wants it too.

87
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,358
Is Hua Wucuo

88
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:05,238
trying to start a rebellion?

89
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:06,999
Six Half Hall is also involved.

90
00:06:07,798 --> 00:06:09,559
The scale of
Hua Wucuo's scheme is large.

91
00:06:09,838 --> 00:06:10,759
But I have a clue about it

92
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,158
thanks to that.

93
00:06:12,838 --> 00:06:15,158
Hua Wucuo will definitely strike again.

94
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,679
I hope the person
who delivers this box will be safe.

95
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:19,519
Wuxie.

96
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,439
Let's return to the Capital immediately.

97
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:25,319
If Hua Wucuo was taking orders
from Six Half Hall,

98
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,398
the journey back to the Capital
won't be so easy.

99
00:06:28,398 --> 00:06:31,398
Six Half Hall's branches
are all over the path.

100
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:35,559
We'll just have to open a path.

101
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:02,679
My lady.

102
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:04,358
I have the news.

103
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:05,238
Say it.

104
00:07:05,718 --> 00:07:07,278
The girl who's with
the person holding the box

105
00:07:07,478 --> 00:07:08,959
seems to come from
the Wen Family of Luoyang.

106
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,918
Don't hurt people from the Wen Family.

107
00:07:13,238 --> 00:07:14,278
Get the box with tricks instead.

108
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:15,918
Go back to the Capital first.

109
00:07:16,278 --> 00:07:17,158
Get Zhe Tianchou

110
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:18,079
to wait for me at Qiuling Crossing.

111
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:19,639
If I guessed it correctly,

112
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,559
they should be using the water route.

113
00:07:22,278 --> 00:07:23,079
- Yes.
- Yes.

114
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:30,358
Bringing the box like this,

115
00:07:30,358 --> 00:07:31,398
we have to be careful along the way.

116
00:07:32,278 --> 00:07:33,959
The guys from Xiliu
will catch up any time soon.

117
00:07:34,718 --> 00:07:35,679
I recommend we take the water route.

118
00:07:36,398 --> 00:07:37,639
I have the same idea.

119
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,398
Also, it's easier if we
encounter an enemy on the water route.

120
00:07:39,798 --> 00:07:40,918
We just need to sink their boat.

121
00:07:41,158 --> 00:07:42,238
There's no need to hurt them.

122
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,038
No need to hurt them?

123
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:46,718
People are trying to steal your box

124
00:07:46,718 --> 00:07:47,879
and you are thinking
about not hurting them?

125
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,119
Roaming the martial arts world.

126
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,999
There's no need
to be violent every time.

127
00:07:52,398 --> 00:07:53,718
It's better to make friends.

128
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,038
When did both of you become so close?

129
00:07:56,038 --> 00:07:57,079
Can you listen to me?

130
00:07:57,718 --> 00:07:59,398
I have three principles

131
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:00,319
in roaming the martial arts world.

132
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:01,278
What are they?

133
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:02,439
First.

134
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,759
Never ask a hero his origin.

135
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,079
A good man
never cares about trifling matters.

136
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,798
I don't like to cause trouble.

137
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:09,999
People who say that
usually cause the most trouble.

138
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:11,598
Do I cause a lot of trouble?

139
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:12,679
No.

140
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:15,598
Continue.

141
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:16,718
Second.

142
00:08:16,718 --> 00:08:18,679
I roam the martial arts world
to preserve justice.

143
00:08:18,758 --> 00:08:20,399
So, if anything happens,
I'll be the first to help.

144
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:21,679
There's no use.

145
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:22,399
Your martial arts is so bad.

146
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,118
This is an attitude problem.

147
00:08:24,118 --> 00:08:25,559
A good attitude with an average effect.

148
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:26,758
At least it proves
that I've worked hard.

149
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:28,758
I can be considered a dependable person.

150
00:08:29,118 --> 00:08:29,838
Third.

151
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,919
We are all on the same side.

152
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,238
We can't betray one of our own.

153
00:08:34,478 --> 00:08:35,559
We need to unite and face our enemies.

154
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,718
I agree.

155
00:08:36,878 --> 00:08:37,799
I agree too.

156
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:39,399
To make it easy,

157
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,758
I'll give you two nicknames.

158
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,079
You will be Little Rock.

159
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:43,319
You will be Cabbage.

160
00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:45,358
I don't want to be called Cabbage.

161
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:47,238
I'll call you Bai then.

162
00:08:48,439 --> 00:08:49,079
What about you?

163
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,598
What nickname did you give yourself?

164
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,118
Me? I am still Wen Rou.

165
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,238
- Why?
- Why?

166
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:54,199
It's decided.

167
00:08:54,598 --> 00:08:55,838
Besides my three principles,

168
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,319
I also have eight habits.

169
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:58,878
First,

170
00:08:58,878 --> 00:08:59,799
I like spicy food.

171
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:00,959
Second,

172
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,118
I like to soak my feet
before going to sleep.

173
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,279
Third,

174
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:04,878
I only sleep on soft beds.

175
00:09:05,199 --> 00:09:06,399
Fourth,

176
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,358
I like small animals.

177
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,039
Fifth,

178
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:11,079
I think every good thing belongs to me.

179
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:13,598
Sixth, I like it when people praise me.

180
00:09:13,758 --> 00:09:14,878
Seventh...

181
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:22,637
(Qiuling Crossing)

182
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,998
Why aren't there any boats?

183
00:09:27,118 --> 00:09:28,399
They left because you were too annoying.

184
00:09:29,118 --> 00:09:30,159
Why are you blaming me?

185
00:09:30,998 --> 00:09:31,998
If we don't have a boat,

186
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,399
we won't be able to
deliver the box by 14th August.

187
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,358
What a big boat.

188
00:10:11,199 --> 00:10:12,118
Can it take us?

189
00:10:12,838 --> 00:10:13,878
We'll know when we ask.

190
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,439
It's so far.

191
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,159
Can she hear us if we shout at her?

192
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:28,998
You know how to play the flute?

193
00:11:18,838 --> 00:11:20,159
Meeting friends

194
00:11:20,478 --> 00:11:21,518
on the beautiful waters.

195
00:11:21,998 --> 00:11:24,478
Miss, we are in a rush
to go to the Capital.

196
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:25,838
Can you fetch us?

197
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:28,598
It's destiny for us to meet.

198
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:29,838
Why not?

199
00:11:38,358 --> 00:11:39,238
I am Bai Choufei.

200
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:40,959
These two people are my friends.

201
00:11:41,718 --> 00:11:42,478
Wang Xiaoshi.

202
00:11:42,758 --> 00:11:43,518
I am Wen Rou.

203
00:11:44,758 --> 00:11:46,358
I am Tian. My name is Tian Chun.

204
00:11:47,518 --> 00:11:48,638
Tian Tianchun?

205
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:51,439
Miss, your name is so funny.

206
00:11:53,878 --> 00:11:55,358
My full name is Tian Chun.

207
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:04,598
You are so pretty.

208
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,878
Your eyes look like the stars.

209
00:12:07,478 --> 00:12:08,358
You are pretty too.

210
00:12:08,638 --> 00:12:09,878
Your smiling face is like a flower.

211
00:12:10,838 --> 00:12:11,638
What flower?

212
00:12:11,878 --> 00:12:13,439
Every flower that blooms in this world

213
00:12:13,598 --> 00:12:14,638
looks like you.

214
00:12:18,118 --> 00:12:18,959
Thank you.

215
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:20,238
Compared to you,

216
00:12:20,598 --> 00:12:22,039
she is more suitable to be called Wen Rou.
*[In Chinese Wen Rou means gentle.]

217
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:22,799
You...

218
00:12:25,358 --> 00:12:26,758
There are many empty rooms on the boat.

219
00:12:26,838 --> 00:12:27,718
There are no outsiders too.

220
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:29,039
You can pick your own rooms.

221
00:12:30,118 --> 00:12:31,118
There's also a luxury room.

222
00:12:31,638 --> 00:12:32,959
Leave that to Wen Rou.

223
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:33,959
You really know me well.

224
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:35,279
With you as my companion,

225
00:12:35,878 --> 00:12:37,238
it'll definitely be more fun
than those two.

226
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,559
If you are not used to sleeping alone,

227
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,679
my bed is big and soft too.

228
00:12:42,998 --> 00:12:44,118
You can stay with me.

229
00:12:44,758 --> 00:12:45,878
- Great.
- These two girls

230
00:12:45,878 --> 00:12:46,959
are already so close

231
00:12:47,358 --> 00:12:48,199
after meeting for the first time.

232
00:12:51,319 --> 00:12:52,279
Let's go take a look at the rooms.

233
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:06,279
After delivering this box,

234
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:07,279
where do you plan to go?

235
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,559
I've stayed long enough at Baixu Garden.

236
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:11,718
Since Master let me out,

237
00:13:12,478 --> 00:13:13,559
I plan to look around.

238
00:13:14,758 --> 00:13:16,319
It's important to visit places
during our lives.

239
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:19,279
I've always heard the Capital
is the center of the world.

240
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,838
I want to visit the Capital.

241
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:22,799
I'll go somewhere else

242
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:23,919
when I have enough of the Capital.

243
00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:25,838
What about you?

244
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:27,758
I want to stay in the Capital.

245
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,559
I want to gain fame.

246
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:32,758
Does it need to be in the Capital?

247
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:33,679
Of course.

248
00:13:33,838 --> 00:13:34,838
If you want to gain fame,

249
00:13:34,838 --> 00:13:36,279
you need to be in the brightest place.

250
00:13:37,758 --> 00:13:38,959
A flower in the dark

251
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:40,478
is no better than a fire striker.

252
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,199
You don't even have bait on your rod.

253
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,439
Can you catch any fish?

254
00:13:52,238 --> 00:13:53,238
Sometimes, I'm thinking.

255
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:54,838
The fish is like us.

256
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,959
The world is like a big fishbowl.

257
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,799
When we swim freely,

258
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:01,919
we don't want to be fished, right?

259
00:14:02,838 --> 00:14:03,439
But this is

260
00:14:03,439 --> 00:14:05,279
the law of the jungle in the world.

261
00:14:06,238 --> 00:14:07,319
If they are the humans

262
00:14:07,518 --> 00:14:08,319
and we are the fish,

263
00:14:08,838 --> 00:14:10,079
we will also be fished up.

264
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:12,079
No wonder you want to gain fame.

265
00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:14,518
No wonder
you want to explore the world.

266
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:19,598
My lady.

267
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,439
They took the bait.

268
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,758
(Zhe Tianchou, Six Half Hall)
The aged liquor is out of the cellar.

269
00:14:27,998 --> 00:14:29,159
(Zhe Tianchou, Six Half Hall)
The cutting board has been cleaned.

270
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:40,319
No!

271
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,758
Don't kill me!

272
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,309
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

273
00:14:48,598 --> 00:14:49,118
Keeper.

274
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,638
Mr. Gu Dong.

275
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,319
(Gu Dong, House of Sunset Drizzle)
Save me. Someone wants to kill me.

276
00:14:56,622 --> 00:14:59,278
(Lu Jiansan, House of Sunset Drizzle)

277
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,518
With me and the Delegate here,

278
00:15:03,878 --> 00:15:05,439
who dares to kill people in the house?

279
00:15:06,878 --> 00:15:07,559
Delegate?

280
00:15:10,358 --> 00:15:11,478
(Hua Wucuo, House of Sunset Drizzle)
Greetings, Delegate.

281
00:15:11,492 --> 00:15:13,452
(Hua Wucuo, House of Sunset Drizzle)

282
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:15,199
Stand up.

283
00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:17,199
Come here.

284
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:22,758
Sit.

285
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:26,718
Sit.

286
00:15:28,478 --> 00:15:31,159
Mr. Su went north.

287
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:32,679
When he gets to a new place,

288
00:15:33,478 --> 00:15:36,118
he will send a letter
back to House Master.

289
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:41,679
You are the one
who received the letters.

290
00:15:42,998 --> 00:15:46,638
You gave the letters
to House Master, right?

291
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:47,959
Yes.

292
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:51,079
House Master passed out
for half a month.

293
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:53,319
During this period,

294
00:15:53,758 --> 00:15:56,478
did Mr. Su send any letters?

295
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:58,518
He did

296
00:15:58,598 --> 00:16:00,598
but they were sent
directly to House Master.

297
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,598
It was Liu Lianxin
who received the letters.

298
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:05,238
Did you read the letters?

299
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:06,718
I...

300
00:16:08,238 --> 00:16:09,439
Don't be nervous.

301
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,199
Mr. Su went to the northern battlefield.

302
00:16:12,718 --> 00:16:14,598
This is a righteous act.

303
00:16:15,238 --> 00:16:16,319
I just want to know

304
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:18,439
which way he took back to the Capital,

305
00:16:18,838 --> 00:16:22,559
so I can welcome him along the way.

306
00:16:26,238 --> 00:16:27,039
Tell me.

307
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,638
Speak.

308
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:31,799
Delegate!

309
00:16:32,478 --> 00:16:33,319
Delegate, don't kill me!

310
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,679
When a person
wants to kill another person,

311
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:38,399
grudges are irrelevant.
It's all about the sides.

312
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:40,758
If you are on my side,

313
00:16:41,118 --> 00:16:42,559
why would I kill you?

314
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,838
Mr. Su will go to the Capital
through Kushuipu.

315
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:46,879
Kushuipu.

316
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,159
Kushuipu?

317
00:16:50,558 --> 00:16:52,078
Kushuipu is a nice place.

318
00:16:53,558 --> 00:16:55,439
If you'd told me earlier,
it would be over.

319
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:58,399
You'd be fine
if you had told me earlier.

320
00:17:01,798 --> 00:17:03,399
It's fine now. You may go.

321
00:17:16,639 --> 00:17:18,159
What's the rush?

322
00:17:18,478 --> 00:17:20,359
Can't you let him go further?

323
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:26,798
Fine. Hurry up.

324
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:27,839
Take him away.

325
00:17:47,639 --> 00:17:48,399
Kushuipu.

326
00:17:48,758 --> 00:17:51,119
Kushuipu is great. Great for an ambush.

327
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:53,919
We didn't get the box?

328
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:55,959
We didn't get it at Xiliu.

329
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:58,238
Apparently, the person who carries it
is skilled in martial arts.

330
00:17:59,518 --> 00:18:02,518
My lady wants to use a scheme
to get it on the water route.

331
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:03,718
The chance we can have it is

332
00:18:04,278 --> 00:18:05,238
fifty-fifty.

333
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:07,758
Su Mengzhen.

334
00:18:09,518 --> 00:18:10,599
Can he be easily killed?

335
00:18:10,718 --> 00:18:11,558
I don't know.

336
00:18:12,518 --> 00:18:15,318
Many of our brothers from the hall
want to give it a try.

337
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,718
Four of the twelve Elders

338
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:18,758
are already prepared.

339
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:20,318
In this martial arts world,

340
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:22,278
nothing can be considered an achievement

341
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:23,839
apart from killing Su Mengzhen.

342
00:18:25,078 --> 00:18:25,879
However,

343
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,238
I do want to give it a try.

344
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:48,039
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

345
00:18:50,278 --> 00:18:51,359
26 years ago,

346
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:53,278
Six Half Hall did something amazing.

347
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:55,998
They chose a group of newcomers

348
00:18:56,278 --> 00:18:58,839
and sent them here to work undercover
at House of Sunset Drizzle.

349
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:00,199
Do you still remember?

350
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:01,359
I do.

351
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,238
Weren't they all dealt with cleanly?

352
00:19:03,798 --> 00:19:04,599
Cleanly?

353
00:19:05,199 --> 00:19:05,959
Not necessary.

354
00:19:06,998 --> 00:19:09,919
When they wrote their names
on a name list,

355
00:19:10,318 --> 00:19:11,518
they used too much ink.

356
00:19:11,998 --> 00:19:13,919
The ink went to the table underneath.

357
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:16,478
Later on, the name list's rubbing

358
00:19:16,518 --> 00:19:19,159
came into my possession somehow.

359
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,478
It's not complete.

360
00:19:20,478 --> 00:19:21,599
But coincidentally,

361
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,639
among the few legible names,

362
00:19:24,525 --> 00:19:27,027
(Su Zhemu, House of Sunset Drizzle)

363
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:28,238
(Su Zhemu, House of Sunset Drizzle)
there was you.

364
00:19:42,278 --> 00:19:43,078
Are you surprised?

365
00:19:43,998 --> 00:19:44,758
Don't be surprised.

366
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:46,119
I knew it.

367
00:19:47,998 --> 00:19:49,879
You are someone
who contributed to the House.

368
00:19:49,879 --> 00:19:51,159
I won't hurt you.

369
00:19:52,639 --> 00:19:55,159
As long as I'm still alive,
I will always be your superior.

370
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:59,038
If I die,

371
00:19:59,758 --> 00:20:01,998
and you have any evil intentions,

372
00:20:04,478 --> 00:20:06,599
House of Sunset Drizzle will be gone.

373
00:20:09,518 --> 00:20:12,078
House Master,
you treat me like your brother.

374
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,318
I did think about

375
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:19,478
being honest with you about this.

376
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,558
But you still didn't tell me!

377
00:20:23,078 --> 00:20:24,758
That's having evil intentions.

378
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:38,478
Stop acting like a dog.

379
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:39,639
Stand up.

380
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:42,439
My legs have no strength.

381
00:20:44,238 --> 00:20:45,159
I can't stand up.

382
00:20:50,318 --> 00:20:51,758
I didn't dare to say that

383
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:54,959
I am a member of Six Half Hall.

384
00:20:56,038 --> 00:20:59,119
If the House members find out about it,

385
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:03,478
they will kill me.

386
00:21:06,879 --> 00:21:07,758
But since I came

387
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:11,278
to House of Sunset Drizzle,

388
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:13,478
I've never done anything

389
00:21:14,238 --> 00:21:15,959
bad for the House.

390
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:22,798
The rubbing is in that box.

391
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:25,478
If you don't try any tricks,

392
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:27,998
it will save your life.

393
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:31,078
If you do anything,

394
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,679
it will kill you.

395
00:21:35,478 --> 00:21:36,839
In your current position,

396
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:39,399
it's not hard to live a lavish life.

397
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,919
But don't even think about

398
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:43,478
the position of House Master.

399
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:47,159
Thank you, House Master.

400
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:53,718
Remember.

401
00:21:54,038 --> 00:21:55,399
When you are trying to set someone up,

402
00:21:55,558 --> 00:21:57,998
heaven will be setting you up.

403
00:22:16,478 --> 00:22:17,238
Bai.

404
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:19,278
Why are you
always wearing white clothes?

405
00:22:19,278 --> 00:22:20,679
Do you only have one set of clothes?

406
00:22:20,998 --> 00:22:21,639
Answer me.

407
00:22:22,318 --> 00:22:23,038
Drink.

408
00:22:23,399 --> 00:22:24,119
Drink quickly.

409
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:28,919
Again.

410
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:29,798
Who?

411
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:33,318
Wen Rou!

412
00:22:33,758 --> 00:22:34,399
Let me ask you.

413
00:22:34,758 --> 00:22:35,998
It's round when drawn,
square when written.

414
00:22:35,998 --> 00:22:36,998
You feel warm with it
but you feel cold without it.

415
00:22:36,998 --> 00:22:37,879
Guess a word. What is it?

416
00:22:38,318 --> 00:22:39,359
Three, two, one. Drink.

417
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:41,839
Hurry.

418
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:47,758
Come. Let's continue.

419
00:22:53,399 --> 00:22:54,599
I'll show you how to ask questions.

420
00:22:56,478 --> 00:22:57,959
Chun, do you have
any marriage arrangements?

421
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:03,959
Can you even ask that?

422
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:04,798
Of course.

423
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:07,798
When I was young,

424
00:23:08,518 --> 00:23:10,478
my father arranged a marriage for me.

425
00:23:11,399 --> 00:23:12,639
Time passed and things changed.

426
00:23:12,639 --> 00:23:13,558
Due to various reasons,

427
00:23:13,879 --> 00:23:14,919
it's now void.

428
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,038
It's void.

429
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,078
But do you miss him?

430
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:22,998
This is another question.

431
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:24,919
My turn.

432
00:23:30,318 --> 00:23:31,278
I'll ask a simple question.

433
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:34,919
Mr. Bai, what are your plans
for coming to the Capital?

434
00:23:35,478 --> 00:23:37,639
I come to the Capital
to achieve something.

435
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:39,439
Do you really need to achieve something?

436
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:42,959
If a man can't achieve something
and become famous,

437
00:23:43,399 --> 00:23:44,679
what's the point of living?

438
00:23:45,478 --> 00:23:47,718
Isn't it good
to live a peaceful and happy life?

439
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:49,639
But in my opinion,

440
00:23:50,238 --> 00:23:51,278
tranquility is painful.

441
00:23:51,879 --> 00:23:53,998
Sacrificing for the greater good is
better than being a normal civilian.

442
00:23:54,478 --> 00:23:55,879
Why should we muddle in our lives
without any goals?

443
00:23:59,758 --> 00:24:01,518
Little Rock, what about you?

444
00:24:02,199 --> 00:24:02,839
Me?

445
00:24:04,518 --> 00:24:05,679
I just want to give it a try.

446
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:08,558
I don't care

447
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:09,199
if I will be famous for generations.

448
00:24:09,718 --> 00:24:11,318
But if I give up without trying,

449
00:24:11,758 --> 00:24:12,839
there will be some regrets.

450
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:15,238
What about you, Miss Tian?

451
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:17,718
I just want to go home.

452
00:24:18,439 --> 00:24:19,679
Going home is my wish.

453
00:24:21,399 --> 00:24:22,199
What about you?

454
00:24:24,758 --> 00:24:25,478
Get married?

455
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:26,919
I don't want to get married.

456
00:24:27,318 --> 00:24:28,959
Chun, you are the one
who wants to get married, right?

457
00:24:29,879 --> 00:24:31,959
Are you planning to
stay single for your whole life?

458
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:37,558
I'll decide after I find Mengzhen.

459
00:24:38,318 --> 00:24:39,318
Let's continue.

460
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:42,478
You...

461
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:43,798
It's my turn!

462
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:44,998
- Let me ask you.
- Ask me.

463
00:24:45,238 --> 00:24:45,639
Say.

464
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:47,718
Why can't you simply draw that sword?

465
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,038
I can't say that.

466
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,599
Why can't you say that?

467
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:52,639
I really can't say that.

468
00:24:52,639 --> 00:24:53,518
Do you have a secret?

469
00:24:53,518 --> 00:24:54,278
I don't.

470
00:24:54,318 --> 00:24:55,238
You do.

471
00:24:55,238 --> 00:24:55,599
I...

472
00:24:56,318 --> 00:24:57,839
You need to obey the game rules.

473
00:24:58,399 --> 00:24:59,078
It's fine if you don't tell.

474
00:25:00,278 --> 00:25:01,278
You need to drink this bottle of liquor.

475
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:02,599
Bai.

476
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:04,879
You need to drink if you won't tell.

477
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:07,359
Fine. I'll drink.

478
00:25:12,639 --> 00:25:13,879
There's no more liquor.

479
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:14,758
The liquor's here.

480
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,159
My lady.

481
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:18,758
Let me pour liquor for all of you.

482
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,078
This is the best Laobaigan liquor
on the boat.

483
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:29,238
Leave us.

484
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:30,199
Yes.

485
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:34,758
Come.

486
00:25:35,318 --> 00:25:37,078
I wish all of us

487
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:38,078
can fulfill our wishes in the Capital.

488
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:38,798
All right.

489
00:25:39,478 --> 00:25:40,758
- Come. Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:04,839
We finally got the box.

505
00:28:04,959 --> 00:28:05,919
My lady, what a scheme.

506
00:28:09,558 --> 00:28:10,639
Our efforts are not in vain.

507
00:28:11,879 --> 00:28:12,679
What is

508
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:13,959
the hall's next step?

509
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:15,959
Since you've gotten the box,

510
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:17,919
you've protected Hua Wucuo.

511
00:28:18,718 --> 00:28:19,798
I'm sure

512
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,278
the House of Sunset Drizzle

513
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:22,839
will soon be crushed in the Capital.

514
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:27,439
I asked my father to give me
half a month to get the box.

515
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,359
At least I didn't let him down.

516
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:32,399
But I heard

517
00:28:32,639 --> 00:28:34,399
Su Mengzhen is on his way back
to the Capital.

518
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:36,278
Will our advantage

519
00:28:36,718 --> 00:28:39,399
be broken by his Red Sleeve Blade?

520
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,119
My lady, don't worry.

521
00:28:41,439 --> 00:28:42,599
The main branch never planned

522
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:44,639
to let Su Mengzhen return
to the Capital alive.

523
00:28:45,518 --> 00:28:47,278
They have already prepared
for his ambush.

524
00:28:47,718 --> 00:28:49,078
The Young Lady
of Wen Family can't die here.

525
00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:51,478
I will go and deal with the other two.

526
00:29:11,718 --> 00:29:12,478
My lady.

527
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:13,199
You...

528
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:49,518
(Kushuipu)
General Yang.

529
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:50,919
(Kushuipu)

530
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:52,439
I've avenged you.

531
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:54,919
Since this is where you departed,

532
00:29:55,439 --> 00:29:56,558
you should rest here as well.

533
00:30:13,718 --> 00:30:14,798
Cold breeze and freezing water.

534
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:16,758
Aged yet still ambitious.

535
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,318
A loyalty that doesn't
let the country down.

536
00:30:20,959 --> 00:30:22,639
A cup of liquor to send you off.

537
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:49,439
Chun.

538
00:30:49,998 --> 00:30:50,639
Chun.

539
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,399
Cabbage!

540
00:30:53,639 --> 00:30:54,278
Little Rock!

541
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:55,599
Wake up!

542
00:30:55,758 --> 00:30:56,478
What time is it?

543
00:30:56,478 --> 00:30:57,558
Why are you still sleeping?

544
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:02,478
Wake up.

545
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:04,798
I was drunk.

546
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:07,318
What's wrong?

547
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:09,199
Both of you, go and wash up.

548
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:10,238
I'm going to find Chun.

549
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:40,758
Where's Chun?

550
00:31:41,478 --> 00:31:42,718
The three of you finally woke up.

551
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:44,959
All of you were really drunk last night.

552
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:47,078
I made some drinks
to cure your hangover.

553
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:49,679
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Boatman.

554
00:31:50,238 --> 00:31:51,399
Where is Chun?

555
00:31:51,399 --> 00:31:53,159
Miss Tian and her subordinates

556
00:31:53,318 --> 00:31:54,679
got off the boat this morning.

557
00:31:55,078 --> 00:31:57,278
She said there was a change in schedule.

558
00:31:57,518 --> 00:31:58,119
Oh.

559
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:00,798
She left you a note

560
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:02,238
and asked me to pass it to you.

561
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:06,798
(The path
of the martial arts world is long.)

562
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:08,758
(We will meet again.)

563
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:09,798
She really left?

564
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:27,919
I really don't get it.

565
00:32:28,318 --> 00:32:29,839
She didn't even tell us in person

566
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:30,679
and left.

567
00:32:31,238 --> 00:32:33,318
Didn't we have a lot of fun last night?

568
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:34,399
You were really happy.

569
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:36,599
It was because Miss Tian Chun
was being polite.

570
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,758
But whether Miss Tian Chun
was happy or not,

571
00:32:39,478 --> 00:32:40,318
I don't know.

572
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:42,278
What do you mean?

573
00:32:42,278 --> 00:32:43,478
Are you saying that I'm not polite?

574
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:45,119
We boarded her boat

575
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:46,359
and you still wanted
to sleep in her bed.

576
00:32:46,439 --> 00:32:47,399
Is that polite to you?

577
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:48,478
I think Miss Tian Chun

578
00:32:48,478 --> 00:32:49,679
left without saying anything

579
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:50,798
because you were impolite.

580
00:32:51,318 --> 00:32:52,919
That's where you are wrong.

581
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:54,798
She invited me to sleep with her.

582
00:32:56,718 --> 00:32:57,478
I know.

583
00:32:57,879 --> 00:32:59,718
You are unhappy because Chun left.

584
00:32:59,718 --> 00:33:00,879
You like her, right?

585
00:33:01,478 --> 00:33:02,318
If you like her,

586
00:33:02,318 --> 00:33:03,718
just go and serve her.

587
00:33:04,518 --> 00:33:05,718
I can serve anyone I want.

588
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,439
I just don't like serving you.

589
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:08,078
You...

590
00:33:08,078 --> 00:33:08,839
What?

591
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:10,399
You can leave if my word hurts you.

592
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:12,159
Wang Xiaoshi wants you here. Not me.

593
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,758
Go away and don't annoy me.

594
00:33:14,238 --> 00:33:14,919
I'm telling you.

595
00:33:15,238 --> 00:33:17,359
People like you are not suitable
to roam the martial arts world.

596
00:33:17,478 --> 00:33:18,599
You are too spoiled for it.

597
00:33:19,078 --> 00:33:20,599
Return to Luoyang and be a Young Lady.

598
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:21,639
Darn Bai Choufei.

599
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:22,879
I shouldn't have
treated you as my friend!

600
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:25,599
Don't even think of seeing me again!

601
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:31,038
No. You are treating her like this?

602
00:33:32,478 --> 00:33:34,278
There are two ways
of dealing with girls.

603
00:33:34,518 --> 00:33:35,758
One is being gentle
and another one is being tough.

604
00:33:36,078 --> 00:33:36,919
I only know the tough way.

605
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:38,359
What about you?

606
00:33:39,199 --> 00:33:39,879
Didn't I...

607
00:33:40,879 --> 00:33:42,318
Didn't I go to the inn

608
00:33:42,318 --> 00:33:43,238
to get her the softest bed

609
00:33:43,238 --> 00:33:44,038
and the most expensive dishes?

610
00:33:46,238 --> 00:33:46,798
Forget it.

611
00:33:47,439 --> 00:33:48,599
She left from anger anyway.

612
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:50,319
At least we achieved our goal.

613
00:33:53,478 --> 00:33:55,359
I blame it on the cursed box.

614
00:33:55,998 --> 00:33:57,839
We have to go to Kushuipu,
which is dangerous.

615
00:33:58,359 --> 00:33:59,478
It's better for her to leave.

616
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:01,078
However,

617
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:02,759
it might be difficult

618
00:34:02,998 --> 00:34:04,038
if you want her to return.

619
00:34:05,198 --> 00:34:05,719
It'll be hard for you.

620
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:06,998
I need you to get her back.

621
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:08,518
You are good with gentle methods.

622
00:34:10,598 --> 00:34:11,678
Why me?

623
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,439
You were the one who made her angry.

624
00:34:14,959 --> 00:34:15,678
Don't go.

625
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,518
Stupid Chou! Shameless!

626
00:34:17,998 --> 00:34:19,638
Little Rock! Stupid Rock!

627
00:34:20,038 --> 00:34:21,319
He didn't back me up.

628
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:23,959
The most shameless Stupid Chou!

629
00:34:23,959 --> 00:34:25,078
The stupidest Little Rock!

630
00:34:25,198 --> 00:34:26,038
I'm so angry!

631
00:34:30,558 --> 00:34:31,118
No.

632
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:33,558
Something's wrong.

633
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:54,399
(Yang)

634
00:35:05,759 --> 00:35:08,118
You killed
a famous Liao general in the north.

635
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:10,239
On your way down south,

636
00:35:10,558 --> 00:35:12,799
you also hit
a few Six Half Hall's branches.

637
00:35:13,959 --> 00:35:15,038
When we reach
the outskirts of the Capital,

638
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:17,078
you need to keep a low profile.

639
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:18,998
I'm keeping a low profile.

640
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:20,839
How is this keeping a low profile?

641
00:35:21,158 --> 00:35:22,198
You are wearing a flaming red dress

642
00:35:22,439 --> 00:35:24,038
and sitting here heroically.

643
00:35:25,518 --> 00:35:27,799
Aren't you the greatest in the world?

644
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:29,678
I am here

645
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:31,959
so the man with the box

646
00:35:32,319 --> 00:35:33,319
can find me.

647
00:35:35,799 --> 00:35:36,998
(Bun! Mantou!)

648
00:35:47,558 --> 00:35:48,959
Sir, I beg you.

649
00:35:49,118 --> 00:35:50,319
I starved for a few days.

650
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:51,279
- Spare me some food.
- Go away!

651
00:35:51,558 --> 00:35:53,638
Stinking Beggar! Stop causing trouble!

652
00:35:58,998 --> 00:35:59,719
Hurry up!

653
00:36:05,879 --> 00:36:07,118
Kushuipu might be a mess,

654
00:36:07,678 --> 00:36:09,038
but there are masters
who are hiding around here too.

655
00:36:09,439 --> 00:36:10,598
It's a land of heroes.

656
00:36:11,638 --> 00:36:14,198
People of the martial arts world
fear this place out of respect.

657
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:15,598
Not even people

658
00:36:16,279 --> 00:36:18,879
from House of Sunset Drizzle
and Six Half Hall

659
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:20,478
would set foot in here usually.

660
00:36:22,759 --> 00:36:23,839
We have to be more careful then.

661
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:25,319
That's right.

662
00:36:37,879 --> 00:36:40,041
