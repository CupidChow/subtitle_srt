(Yesterday's rain remains, a return from
bloodshed is all but unlikely. Part 2)

32
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,840
How did you know about that?

33
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,640
Someone tried to manipulate me.

34
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,640
He said it would benefit the nation
and its people if I handed out my sword.

35
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,159
But when I look at it
from another perspective,

36
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,680
if I do stab someone with my sword,

37
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,000
who do you think will be implicated?

38
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,479
The House of Sunset Drizzle.

39
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,360
Maybe, in this world,

40
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:22,800
it's hard to identify who
is on the good side or bad side.

41
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,400
But in my heart,

42
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,000
the House of Sunset Drizzle
is on the good side.

43
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,039
The people who tried to manipulate me

44
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,400
are on the bad side.

45
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,040
(Cai)

46
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,039
Wang Xiaoshi,

47
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:44,680
I need to remind you of this.

48
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:46,879
If you wish to go against Youqiao Group,

49
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,879
you have to risk everything you have.

50
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,520
Not only that,

51
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,280
you also have to risk the lives

52
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,639
of everyone around you.

53
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,520
Their spies are everywhere.

54
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,240
So are their assassins.

55
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,280
You won't know

56
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,919
which of the words you've said

57
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,759
will reach their ears.

58
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,319
You won't even know

59
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,159
if the people around you

60
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,360
are one of them.

61
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,759
Advisor.

62
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:33,879
Come here.

63
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,800
How's Mengzhen doing?

64
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,080
He's not doing well.

65
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,680
Sometimes, it's good.
Sometimes, it's bad.

66
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,800
He just fell asleep
after taking his medicine.

67
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,120
Are you looking for him?

68
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,159
That's right.

69
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,960
But you will do just fine.

70
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,599
Let's talk somewhere else.

71
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,240
Advisor, you gather intel

72
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:00,840
and you understand
the martial arts world well.

73
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,039
I wish to ask you something.

74
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,960
How much do you know about Divine Marquis Zhuge?

75
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,560
Divine Marquis Zhuge is a renowned figure.

76
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,879
Even if you don't ask me,

77
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:13,879
the people will tell you
what you need to know

78
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,080
if you ask around in the streets.

79
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,319
He's your martial uncle.

80
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,480
How could you not know him?

81
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,600
Since I'm looking for you,

82
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:24,439
I want to know something
that other people don't.

83
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,199
You want to know something
that other people don't?

84
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:29,319
What's the matter?

85
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,920
To be honest,

86
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,600
my recent discoveries
have led me to suspect

87
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,480
that Divine Marquis Zhuge is the mastermind

88
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,720
behind Youqiao Group.

89
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,959
You must be out of your mind.

90
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,399
That's impossible.

91
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,079
At first, I couldn't believe it either.

92
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,680
But I witnessed it for myself

93
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,560
when his subordinate Official Heartless
bullied the civilians.

94
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,879
If we didn't sabotage
Six Half Hall's firearms,

95
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,879
there might be

96
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:52,959
the next firearm workshop.

97
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,680
I don't know

98
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,439
if there's any misunderstanding here,

99
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,160
but I know

100
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:02,519
that Divine Marquis Zhuge
will never betray the nation.

101
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,360
Come, follow me.

102
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,720
I'll show you something.

103
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,399
Divine Marquis Zhuge joined the imperial court
and served them when he was 23.

104
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,920
His name was only gradually known

105
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,879
after he obtained
the title of Marquis at the age of 45.

106
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,040
Now, he's 55 years old.

107
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,680
What you know

108
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:36,160
should be the events
that happened in the past decade.

109
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,399
If you wish to understand someone,

110
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,240
you have to understand his entire past.

111
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,160
These are the records

112
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:46,279
of his promotions and deeds.

113
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,680
They can compensate

114
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,000
for his unknown past
for the last two decades.

115
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,319
You can take a look.

116
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:56,399
Advisor,

117
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,519
why did the House of Sunset Drizzle

118
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:00,720
form the Messenger Pigeon Group?

119
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:05,800
Of course it's to spy
on other factions and gather intel.

120
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,480
If so, what's the goal

121
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,600
behind the two actions?

122
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,079
Little Rock,

123
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,279
plenty of things in this world

124
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,240
aren't as they seem to be.

125
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,839
That's why we need
the Messenger Pigeon Group

126
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,160
to delve deep into life, wait patiently,

127
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,319
and observe in detail

128
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,319
to approach the truth.

129
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,319
Advisor, you're right.

130
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,920
Plenty of things are indeed
not as they seem to be.

131
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,079
That's why we need to wait patiently

132
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,160
and observe in detail

133
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:36,639
to see the truth.

134
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,319
This file

135
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,759
is just a record.

136
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,639
Essentially, it's superficial.

137
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,639
As no one
had doubted its validity before,

138
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,959
no one tried to verify the truth.

139
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,959
Bad Advisor?

140
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,240
What's wrong with you?

141
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,920
Why are you acting strange too?

142
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:08,319
Too?

143
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,680
Who else is acting strange?

144
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:11,920
Little Rock.

145
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,519
He ignores me when I speak to him.

146
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,480
I feel like he's troubled by something.

147
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,399
You felt the same too?

148
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:21,199
If so, I think he's truly problematic.

149
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,920
He's not troubled by something.

150
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,040
There's just something wrong
with his brain.

151
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,560
Little Rock,

152
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,040
come here.

153
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,040
You looked listless
for the past few days.

154
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,480
That's why I've prepared
some delicacies for you.

155
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,120
I don't have any appetite.

156
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,800
You should try it.

157
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,079
There's your favorite
Shiman Flower Cake.

158
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,920
Someone is sweeping the floor.
There's too much dust.

159
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,040
I don't feel like eating.

160
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,600
I did cover them with a cloth.

161
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,639
There's no dust on top of it.

162
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,040
(Four Virtues)
You should try them.

163
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,160
I made them for you in the morning.

164
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,120
I said I'm not eating.

165
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,120
Where exactly did I make you unhappy?

166
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,199
I...

167
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,439
That's not it.

168
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,519
If so, why are you behaving like this?

169
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,639
You ignored me when I spoke to you.

170
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,079
You didn't give me
any responses when I did something.

171
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,680
You weren't like this in the past.

172
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,360
You used to tell me
everything that was on your mind.

173
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,040
But now, you're avoiding me.

174
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,920
Why would you behave like this

175
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:20,800
if you didn't think
that I was irritating?

176
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:23,319
That's not it.

177
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,720
I'm indeed troubled by something lately.

178
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,279
I'll tell you everything.

179
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,159
I have a question for you.

180
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,200
Do you believe
that in this world, there are people

181
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,600
who seem to be righteous, frank,

182
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,039
and heroic on the surface,

183
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,320
but commit every despicable deed
imaginable for the sake of profit?

184
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,559
Of course I do.

185
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,320
There are all kinds of people
in the martial arts world.

186
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:57,159
Sanctimonious hypocrites like them

187
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,639
are quite common.

188
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,639
What if

189
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,799
Zhuge Zhengwo is someone like that?

190
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,039
Would you believe it?

191
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,639
Who?

192
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,080
Zhuge Zhengwo?

193
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
(Moon)
How is that possible?

194
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,159
He's your martial uncle,

195
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:11,000
the renowned Divine Marquis Zhuge.

196
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,279
How could he be someone like that?

197
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:14,759
No matter if you believe it or not,

198
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,600
his true identity

199
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,320
is the leader of Youqiao Group.

200
00:09:18,346 --> 00:09:19,025
(Moon)

201
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,720
He's the mastermind who's manipulating
the martial arts world from the shadows.

202
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:25,159
You're making me confused here.

203
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,919
Are we even referring
to the same person?

204
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,720
Back then, the people suffered

205
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,159
when the imperial court
focused on construction

206
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:32,519
and transported marbles and rare plants.

207
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,120
During the second year of Xuanhe,

208
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,679
Divine Marquis Zhuge risked his career

209
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,519
and confronted His Majesty
about the issue.

210
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,679
That's how it was stopped.

211
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,320
A person like him who serves the people

212
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,639
can never be

213
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,399
the mastermind behind Youqiao Group.

214
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,519
No matter if you believe me or not,

215
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,360
I've witnessed his deeds personally.

216
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,759
I believe in what I saw.

217
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,919
And, I've said this before.

218
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,120
I won't let off anyone
who joins Youqiao Group.

219
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,120
Little Rock,

220
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,639
who exactly did you see?

221
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,759
What exactly did you see?

222
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,480
Why would you
have such strange thoughts?

223
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,159
Little Rock,

224
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,000
you should sober up.

225
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,840
I'm fully sober.

226
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:09,559
Forget it.

227
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:10,720
If you don't believe me,

228
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,080
I can't do anything about it.

229
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,559
What exactly happened?

230
00:10:36,378 --> 00:10:39,080
(River Chu Town)

231
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:24,039
Were you waiting for me?

232
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,080
The mountains have no sources of light.
It makes the path hard to travel.

233
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,000
I was worried about you.

234
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:30,360
That's why I came here.

235
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:31,960
Let's walk together.

236
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,039
Regarding the words
your maidservant told me,

237
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm sure she did it
under your instruction.

238
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
You're a wise man.

239
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,000
I will get straight to the point.

240
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,360
According to my current situation,

241
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,720
there are not many people
I can seek help from.

242
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,240
Even if you belong
to the House of Sunset Drizzle,

243
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:16,080
I can only give it a shot.

244
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:19,600
You should know

245
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,080
that no matter what it is,

246
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,879
as long as it's your request,

247
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,720
I will say yes.

248
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:34,480
What's your plan
for taking over Pili Sect?

249
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,720
After Old Master Lei got a stroke,

250
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,360
Lei Tian managed Pili Sect
on his behalf.

251
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,799
My father supported him

252
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:42,919
through the ranks
when he was still alive.

253
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,559
He's quite loyal to my father.

254
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,879
I've already sent him a letter
and told him to meet me tomorrow.

255
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,440
But according to what I know,

256
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,039
the situation inside Pili Sect
is extremely tense.

257
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,039
The Vice Elder, Lei Yi,
is not satisfied with his position.

258
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,440
He wants to be the Elder.

259
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,080
I'm afraid

260
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,840
it's not that easy to subdue Pili Sect.

261
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,440
I know that.

262
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,840
However, for my next step,

263
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:09,159
I think I'll decide
after meeting him tomorrow.

264
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,200
All right.

265
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,200
I'll keep you company then.

266
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,519
It's getting late.

267
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,240
You should rest early.

268
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,720
Thank you for coming.

269
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,080
Are you not asleep yet?

270
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,639
I'm not sleepy.

271
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,360
You can sleep with ease.

272
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,440
This lantern

273
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:29,600
will always be here for you.

274
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,600
I've bought this chess parlor.

275
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,559
This lantern will always
be here for you.

276
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,200
Great!

277
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,000
Great!

278
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:18,840
It's easy to get drunk
when you drink alone.

279
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:20,639
Buy me a drink.

280
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:21,759
I'll join you.

281
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:26,559
Long time no see.

282
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:30,759
Long time no see.

283
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:46,879
How

284
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:49,559
have you been?

285
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,279
In spring breezes,
we drank a cup of liquor together.

286
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,320
On rainy nights, I faced
the lamp alone for a decade.

287
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,840
Do you know

288
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,759
why I left the Capital back then?

289
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,159
Guan Qi was dead.

290
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,120
To you,

291
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:25,240
the Capital was a land of sorrow.

292
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:27,919
That's why you left.

293
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:29,840
Guan Qi was a terrible crook.

294
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,360
Everyone wanted to kill him.

295
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,559
However, I wanted to save him.

296
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,600
I even betrayed
House Master because of it.

297
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:38,039
Do you know why?

298
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,480
It's because he saved your life,

299
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,559
and you wished to repay the favor.

300
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,039
That's right.

301
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,279
I was indebted to Guan Qi.

302
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,399
Even if I knew it wouldn't succeed,

303
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,399
I would still do it.

304
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:56,080
After the incident,

305
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,440
I felt like I'd let down many people.

306
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,360
And I couldn't live
in this land of sorrow.

307
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,480
That's why I chose to leave.

308
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,920
I asked myself the same question

309
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,640
all the time.

310
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,720
Was I wrong

311
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:12,559
for saving Guan Qi?

312
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,160
Maybe I was wrong.

313
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,079
However, I found another answer too.

314
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,680
If back then, I didn't save Guan Qi,

315
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,119
I might regret it my entire life.

316
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:23,799
That's why I felt comforted.

317
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,680
After that, I came back.

318
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,039
You do look happier now.

319
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,039
That's right.

320
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,920
I'm leading a happy
and relaxing life now.

321
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,079
That's why I have
a piece of advice for you.

322
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,880
If there's something

323
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,799
that everyone thinks it's wrong,

324
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,720
you should do it as long as

325
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:45,640
you think it's your duty to do so.

326
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:57,640
I feel much better now

327
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,759
after hearing that from you.

328
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:08,680
You must've traveled to many places

329
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,839
during the past year.

330
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,000
Do you have
something interesting to share with me?

331
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:13,720
There are too many of them.

332
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:14,839
If you wish to listen,

333
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:16,720
I'll share them with you.

334
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,079
Miss Wen, Shuang is here.

335
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,400
Thank you.

336
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,440
Shuang? Why are you here?

337
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,799
Miss Wen, long time no see.

338
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:36,839
Xiaoyao and I returned
to the Capital just a few days ago.

339
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,039
We couldn't pay you a visit
as it was quite sudden.

340
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,519
Please pardon our rudeness.

341
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,240
Just now, Xiaoyao saw Mr. Wang

342
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,839
drinking alone in House of Sanhe.

343
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:43,960
She was worried about him.

344
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,799
That's why
she sent me here to notify you.

345
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:47,680
He's at House of Sanhe right now?

346
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,279
Here's a toast to you.

347
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,400
It does sound interesting
when you put it that way.

348
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,440
Xiaoyao.

349
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,960
What are you doing here?

350
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,640
You've been acting strange lately.

351
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,880
I'm really worried about you.

352
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:43,599
I don't need you to be worried about me.

353
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:45,200
You should return.

354
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:51,920
I know you've gone through a lot lately.

355
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,279
But you would rather drink alone

356
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:55,519
than tell me about it.

357
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,880
What's the use of telling you?

358
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,720
At least no one will irritate me

359
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,279
when I drink alone.

360
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:02,640
Little Rock.

361
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,240
Why did you end up like this?

362
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,240
What's wrong with that?

363
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:08,039
Mengzhen is terminally ill.

364
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:09,799
Bai has left us too.

365
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:11,960
The martial arts world
is constantly changing.

366
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,759
Why can't I change too?

367
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:16,759
Fine.

368
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,240
You can drink all you like.

369
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:21,519
You can change all you like.

370
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:24,359
But my heart will never change.

371
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:40,759
This is your hangover soup.

372
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:42,960
Remember to finish it.

373
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,194
(River Chu Town)

374
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,960
Candied hawthorns!

375
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:17,640
Candied hawthorns for sale!

376
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:31,759
Let's go.

377
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,119
It's the Pili Sect.

378
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,759
Do you mean the person who was hung?

379
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,039
Or do you mean the people down here?

380
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:43,599
Both.

381
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:45,440
The person who was hung
was a subordinate of Lei Yi.

382
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:47,000
The people guarding the stage
are the subordinates of Lei Tian.

383
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:48,440
In River Chu,

384
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,920
no one dares to meddle
with the affairs of Pili Sect.

385
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,640
They even hung their own men.

386
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,440
It seems like their internal strife

387
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,759
will escalate to another level soon.

388
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:07,239
(Pili Sect)

389
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,359
Who's there?

390
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,640
Only authorized people are allowed.

391
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:14,675
(Token)

392
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,640
Miss Lei?

393
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,279
Pardon me for not recognizing you.

394
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,799
Please forgive me.

395
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,799
Our Elder has been waiting for you.

396
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,759
Please follow me.

397
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:36,759
Please.

398
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,292
(Pili Sect)

399
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,589
(Lei Tian, Pili Sect)

400
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,640
Miss Lei has arrived.

401
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:19,640
The Old Master had a stroke.

402
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,759
When he blinks,
that means he's greeting you.

403
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:26,880
Greetings, Old Master Lei.

404
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:30,279
Please have a seat.

405
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:43,500
(Wander the world with swords,
color the sky with blood)

406
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:47,759
How old is the Old Master?

407
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,400
96.

408
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:51,319
Are you trying

409
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:53,319
to say that he's lucky

410
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:54,960
to live till this age?

411
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:57,960
What I want to say is,

412
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:00,640
all major sects are well-established
without any exceptions.

413
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,599
However, they also tend
to neglect the elders in the sect.

414
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:05,480
The Old Master is still well-served

415
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,680
by his men even at this age.

416
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:09,440
He's very lucky.

417
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:35,160
Chief Elder Lei took great care
of Pili Sect while he was alive.

418
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
We should've attended

419
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,279
the funeral ourselves
when he passed away.

420
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,599
However, as the Old Master
is seriously ill,

421
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,160
I couldn't leave.

422
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,079
Please pardon me for the rudeness.

423
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,960
You're treating me like a stranger here.

424
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:50,519
When Father was still alive,

425
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:52,440
he had great respect
for the Old Master too.

426
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,839
Miss Lei, you traveled
all the way here to River Chu.

427
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:57,279
I think I know your agenda for today.

428
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,640
Now, the Six Half Hall is in turmoil.

429
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,160
Miss Lei, I assume you're here

430
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:04,160
to obtain the support of Pili Sect.

431
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,279
That's right.

432
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:06,720
I hope

433
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,319
you can transfer your men to the Capital

434
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:10,200
in order to expand our influence

435
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,279
and stabilize the situation.

436
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:13,680
I'm indebted to Chief Elder Lei.

437
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:16,599
Logically speaking,
it's my duty to help you out.

438
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,440
However, I'm busy enough

439
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,960
with my own affairs right now.

440
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,279
You must be referring to Lei Yi.

441
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,720
Miss Lei, it seems like
you've heard about the situation.

442
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,000
Ever since the Old Master
was seriously ill,

443
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,944
(For Millenniums to Come)

444
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,920
internal strife began to arise.

445
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,799
Forsaking the bigger picture,

446
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,160
Lei Yi pitted himself against me.

447
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:39,319
And now,

448
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:42,039
he has made it official
that he'll go against me.

449
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,119
The Pili Sect is in shambles.

450
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,640
Under such circumstances,

451
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:49,799
I cannot help you out.

452
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:56,519
What if I say

453
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,640
I can solve the issue for you?

454
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:04,440
Miss Lei, please enlighten me.

455
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:05,759
This is simple.

456
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:12,720
Slay Lei Yi to serve
as a warning to others.

457
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:14,359
When his men learn about your prowess,

458
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,880
they will submit to you willingly.

459
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,920
Miss Lei, you do have
excellent individuals guarding you.

460
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,720
Even your bodyguard

461
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:25,599
is extremely daring.

462
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,680
He's not my bodyguard.

463
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,799
He's my friend.

464
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,440
It doesn't matter.

465
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,400
Let's get straight to business.

466
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,759
Lei Yi is highly skilled.

467
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,799
He's ruthless as well.

468
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:46,079
The Pili Sect wouldn't need
to end up like this

469
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,160
if I could kill him easily.

470
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,799
You guys are just not capable enough.

471
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,240
I can kill him easily.

472
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,200
Don't worry.

473
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,759
I'm very confident
that I can kill a nobody like him

474
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:28,000
in River Chu.

475
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,599
Moreover, we have
the help of Lei Tian as well.

476
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:34,000
If you have made up your mind
to do a certain thing,

477
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,920
you will do it

478
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,799
no matter the consequences,

479
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:39,519
am I right?

480
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:40,599
That's right.

481
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:42,839
Will you truly do the same

482
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,119
no matter the consequences?

483
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,160
I will reject it

484
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:53,000
if it'll hurt you.

485
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:03,519
Do you know something?

486
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:05,640
Actually, our first encounter

487
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,799
wasn't actually on the Han River.

488
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:09,720
I know that.

489
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,920
Back then, I stopped

490
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,359
a carriage that belonged
to the Six Half Hall.

491
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:25,920
You were inside the carriage.

492
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,039
So you knew it.

493
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:30,440
But after that,

494
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:32,720
I stopped involving myself
in the martial arts world.

495
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:34,759
When you roam the martial arts world,

496
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,000
you have to pay the price.

497
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:38,759
But I think

498
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,960
it's lucky that
you joined the martial arts world.

499
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:45,400
If not, I wouldn't have encountered you.

500
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:04,880
Open the gate.

501
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,440
Open the gate.

502
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,279
Who are you bringing me

503
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:50,920
to see?

504
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,839
Miss Lei, you'll know when you see it.

505
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,179
(Lei Yi, Pili Sect)

506
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:07,759
Lei Yi?

507
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:08,720
That's right.

508
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,839
I've already captured Lei Yi.

509
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,559
Miss Lei,

510
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,119
my true target

511
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,759
is the person beside you.

512
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,920
I knew he is Bai Choufei.

513
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:28,759
He killed all five
of my brothers in the Capital!

514
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:30,960
Lei Yi wouldn't have used the situation
to his advantage and revolted

515
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:33,039
if my brothers were still alive!

516
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:49,799
Miss Lei, you do not need to worry.

517
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,079
After I kill Bai Choufei
and get my revenge,

518
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,839
naturally, I would support you

519
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,319
in the Capital.

520
00:32:23,076 --> 00:32:27,436
(Shops)

521
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:47,759
Look at the ambush.

522
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,079
Seems like you
do hate Lei Yi to the core.

523
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,000
That's right.

524
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,720
I wish I could chop him up
and mince his livers.

525
00:33:57,559 --> 00:33:59,200
Actually, you just need one blade

526
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,480
to kill someone
if your blade is swift enough.

527
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:02,000
You brought so many men with you.

528
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,559
Aren't you afraid
that he'll chicken out?

529
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:07,839
Our lives are predestined.

530
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,800
It will come when the time is up.

531
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:13,639
Those who are fated to die
can never escape their fate.

532
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:48,000
Attack!

533
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,000
What do you mean by this?

534
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,119
I called you here

535
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,840
in order to kill you!

536
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:57,199
Bai Choufei,

537
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,519
you've slain all five
of my brothers in the Capital!

538
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,360
Tonight,

539
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,840
I will chop you into pieces!

540
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,639
Does Miss Lei know about this?

541
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,239
You still don't understand?

542
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:11,400
Miss Lei was the one who sold you out.

543
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,039
After your death, I will serve her.

544
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:17,400
To her, this deal

545
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,280
is not a loss.

546
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,800
Since you've made yourself clear,

547
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,119
let's see if you're capable enough
to claim my head.

548
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:47,679
Attack!

549
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:28,800
Kill him!

550
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:41,119
Get on the horse!

551
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,679
Stop right there!

552
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,360
Do not let them leave River Chu Town!

553
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,039
Are you okay?

554
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:02,719
I'll survive.

555
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,800
It's a pity
I can't subdue Pili Sect for you.

556
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:07,800
We still have a chance.

557
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,519
I released Lei Yi before I came here.

558
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,400
Let's see if he can stop
Lei Tian with his men.

559
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:13,159
It's all-or-nothing now.

560
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:22,519
Go!

561
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,400
Hurry!

562
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,199
You guys have nowhere to escape now.

563
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,920
Seems like I've lost the bet.

564
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:46,039
I'm sorry.

565
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:47,800
I shouldn't have brought you here.

566
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,239
It's not our loss
when we're still alive.

567
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,880
Both of us will die
if you want me to escape with you.

568
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,559
You can clear a path by yourself.

569
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,519
I cannot let them capture me.

570
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:57,360
I'm the Chief Elder of Six Half Hall.

571
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,199
I won't let them dictate my life!

572
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,239
Lei Chun!

573
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,440
Why did you jump into the river

574
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:02,280
even though you could not swim?

575
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:06,360
Because you jumped into the river.

576
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,800
Don't you blame me for selling you out?

577
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,239
You didn't sell me out.

578
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:15,719
Lei Tian was willing to support me

579
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,000
in exchange for your life.

580
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,960
The Five Warriors
you killed in the Capital

581
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:22,280
were his brothers.

582
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,559
I know that.

583
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:27,480
Even so, you still
came to my rescue, right?

584
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:29,440
That means you didn't sell me out.

585
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:31,800
But you.

586
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:33,639
You actually jumped
from such great heights.

587
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,800
When we're desperate,

588
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,320
we have to give everything a try.

589
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,880
If so, I'll learn
how to swim when I get back.

590
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:42,920
I'll repay you the favor

591
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,280
when you jump into the river next time.

592
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,960
Lei Tian's men should
assume that we're dead.

593
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,960
Even if they want
to search for our bodies,

594
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,639
we've been drifting
along the river for some time.

595
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:01,159
They won't catch us anytime soon.

596
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,719
If so, why don't we

597
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,480
find a path along the river

598
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,360
and leave River Chu Town
as soon as possible?

599
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:09,599
No.

600
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:12,719
We have to return to Pili Sect.

601
00:40:16,063 --> 00:40:18,032
(Pili Sect)

602
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:24,960
Say, do you think
we'll win or lose the bet?

603
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:26,920
I'm betting on your win.

604
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:39,840
Greetings, Miss Lei.

605
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:49,400
It seems like you won the bet.

606
00:40:58,119 --> 00:40:59,000
In Jiangnan's Pili Sect,

607
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:01,519
60% of them are under me
while 40% of them are under him.

608
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,760
Even if you kill me today,

609
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,519
my men will be here!

610
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,880
At most, we can perish together.

611
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,519
You will never get
your hands on Pili Sect!

612
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,800
Miss Lei, if you don't believe me,

613
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,440
you can give it a try.

614
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,000
He said you guys are under him,

615
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:19,559
is that right?

616
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,800
Yes, Miss Lei!

617
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:27,239
Is that right?

618
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:27,920
Yes, Miss Lei!

619
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,360
You!

620
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,400
What about you?

621
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:41,000
Yes, Miss Lei!

622
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,719
Kill me if you like!

623
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,440
Miss Lei, I'm willing to follow you!

624
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:56,440
Miss Lei, please spare me!

625
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:59,039
Miss Lei, please spare us!

626
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,599
Miss Lei, please spare us!

627
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:04,440
We'll follow Miss Lei!

628
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:05,760
This...

629
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,960
It seems like your men
are more afraid of death

630
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:17,920
than you.

631
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,880
Miss Lei, please spare me.

632
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,480
I'm willing to serve you!

633
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,079
You've already bowed down,

634
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:27,800
and your men have
already submitted to me.

635
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:29,639
What's the use

636
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:31,599
of keeping you alive?

637
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:59,079
The Pili Sect is willing
to serve you, Miss Lei!

638
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,800
We're willing to serve you, Miss Lei!
