(Pili Sect)

33
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,959
I'm sure you're not used

34
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,599
to seeing me kill so many people.

35
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,439
You've become more attractive
after experiencing hardship.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,319
You're one of the Six Half Hall.

37
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,920
You're already used to seeing bloodbaths.

38
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,640
Others used to kill for you.

39
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,959
Now, you're holding the blade in your hands.

40
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,799
There's nothing I don't get used to.

41
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,520
I need to be honest with you

42
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,319
about something.

43
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,560
I didn't come to River Chu

44
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,240
only to reclaim the power of the Pili Sect.

45
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,439
The key to taking over Six Half Hall

46
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,280
isn't by reclaiming Pili Sect.

47
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,360
The most important thing

48
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,080
is to complete Chancellor Cai's trial

49
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,159
and join the Youqiao Group.

50
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
But I don't have many people
around me whom I can rely on.

51
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,639
You're the only person I could think of.

52
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,560
So I was using you.

53
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,080
I helped you

54
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,000
because I wanted to help you.

55
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,360
It doesn't matter what your intention is.

56
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,360
This will never change.

57
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,919
But I've completed my mission.

58
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,159

61
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,919
I shall see you

82

peaceful.

84
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,800

101
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,399
what will happen after this.

102
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,439
But I only hope

103
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,040
I'll have more moments like this

104

to share with you in the future.

105

00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,120
This is Bad Advisor.

109

This is Mengzhen.

110
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,600
This is me.

How can this be me?

How can someone change

116
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,360
just like that?

117
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:12,480
No.

118
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,839

(Grand Speech, Radiant Life)

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,319
Little Rock's condition is more serious

122

than we thought.

123
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,000
Mengzhen is gravely ill.

124
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,800
So I can only talk to you now.

125
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,600
Come with me.

126
00:07:26,637 --> 00:07:28,825
(Grand Speech, Radiant Life)

127
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,079
Wang Xiaoshi suddenly thinks

128
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:33,240
that Divine Marquis Zhuge
is the leader of the Youqiao Group.

129
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,439
Don't you find that strange?

130
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,560
If it were before,

131
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:37,959
I'd never put it to heart.

132
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,120
After all, very few people
know his whereabouts

133
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,639
after he retired from the imperial court.

134
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,639
Even if Wang Xiaoshi tries to harm him,

135
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,439
he doesn't know where Divine Marquis is.

136
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,600
Look at this.

137
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:53,868
(Divine Marquis has returned
for more than half a month)

138
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,160
Divine Marquis has returned
to the Capital?

139
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,639
He has returned
for about half a month now.

140
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,000
I can't believe we know
about this late by half a month

141
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,560
with the capability
of the Messenger Pigeon Group.

142
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,560
But Wang Xiaoshi suddenly came up

143
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,439
with such a strange idea

144
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:05,399
at this time.

145
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,839
I suspect someone instigated him,

146
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,199
so he'd go and kill

147
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,399
Divine Marquis.

148
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,519
What are we waiting for now?

149
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,879
We must see Mengzhen now.

150
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,160
If we can't wake Mengzhen up,

151
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,279
we'll gather the persons in charge

152
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,399
to stop Wang Xiaoshi.

153
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,480
We must stop him
from doing anything foolish.

154
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,840
Are you feeling better now?

155
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,120
Didn't the physician say

156
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,159
you need to get proper rest?

157
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,360
If I keep resting,

158
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,360
I wouldn't know
how far you would have gone astray.

159
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:04,399
Some people appear

160
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,720
to behave in a confused manner.

161
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:08,440
But they're compelled to do so.

162
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:11,720
Xiaoshi, tell me.

163
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,200
Who's making you do this?

164
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:16,679
Mengzhen, you've got it wrong.

165
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,399
I decided

166
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,000
to do this.

167
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,080
No one is making me do it.

168
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:25,919
No one can talk me out of this.

169
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,840
I came here

170
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,120
to bid farewell to you.

171
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm leaving the House of Sunset Drizzle.

172
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,039
For the sake of our brotherhood,

173
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:44,440
I wrote this letter of resignation

174
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,879
from the bottom of my heart.

175
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,120
Mengzhen, please review it.

176
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,320
Are you prepared?

177
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,679
We can't be fully prepared for some things.

178
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,320
Yet, it must be done.

179
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:37,080
I've made up my mind.

180
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,879
Mengzhen.

181
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:45,919
Farewell.

182
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:20,320
(Mengzhen.)

183
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:23,279
(I've found out Chancellor Cai
is the leader of Youqiao Group.)

184
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:24,879
(I'm determined)

185
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,559
(to assassinate him to bring peace
to the martial arts world.)

186
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,080
(But I won't be returning once I leave.)

187
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,440
(I dare not bid farewell to Wen Rou.)

188
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:35,639
(I'm scared to see her cry.)

189
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,559
(I'm even more scared of being reluctant)

190
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,399
(to leave when I see her.)

191
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,919
(I don't have the chance
to say goodbye to Bai.)

192
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:58,679
(Fortunately, he's not here.)

193
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:02,200
(Or else he'll face death with me.)

194
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,960
(I hope you can convey my words to them.)

195
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,440
(Having the four of us being acquainted)

196
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,440
(made my life perfect.)

197
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,399
(I can die without regrets.)

198
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,840
(Youqiao Group had planted spies
in the House)

199
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:24,879
(to watch on me.)

200
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:27,279
(They keep my movement
posted at all times.)

201
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,799
(So I had to put up an act.)

202
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:33,320
(Now, I know who the spies are.)

203
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:35,200
(After I leave,)

204
00:12:35,217 --> 00:12:35,938
(Moon)

205
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,360
(please take them down right away)

206
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:38,879
(in case they leak more information.)

207
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:44,360
(I've prepared a formal resignation letter.)

208
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,559
(I don't wish
to get the House involved.)

209
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:49,360
(From today on,)

210
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,000
(I'm no longer one
of the House of Sunset Drizzle.)

211
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:54,639
(A day of drizzling)

212
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:56,360
(with sunset breeze.)

213
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,559
(If I turn into dust one day,)

214
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,759
(I shall never forget)

215
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,440
(my friendship
with the House of Sunset Drizzle.)

216
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,633
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

217
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,240
I'll tell you the details later.

218
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,519
I'm going to Chou Shi House.

219
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:23,919
We must take Wang Xiaoshi down.

220
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,120
No one must stop him.

221
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,279
Why?

222
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,240
The Youqiao Group wants to
use Little Rock

223
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,559
to assassinate Divine Marquis.

224
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,639
The reason he behaved strangely lately was

225
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,840
to play along with them.

226
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,560
(Chou Shi House. Four Virtues)

227
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:01,360
Little Rock!

228
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:01,960
(Self-composed)
Wen Rou.

229
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:02,720
Go back inside now.

230
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,399
Wen Rou, what are you doing?

231
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:04,000
Go back inside!

232
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,519
Wen Rou.

233
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Go back inside now!

234
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,919
Wen Rou, open this door.

235
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:08,840
No, I won't!

236
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,120
Why didn't you tell me

237
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,960
that you're going to do
something dangerous?

238
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,480
I must do this.

239
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,639
Open this door.

240
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:18,120
No.

241
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,720
Open it.

242
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,240
No!

243
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,879
You'll get hurt!

244
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:21,440
But you'll die!

245
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:25,080
Why must you do it?

246
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,200
I'm the only one who can do this.

247
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:30,080
It's something Mengzhen

248
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,919
and the rest want to do.

249
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,320
But I'm the only one
who's the most suitable.

250
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:33,519
Open this door.

251
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,480
No.

252
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,320
Open it.

253
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,559
Of course, I know that.

254
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,919
But I can't just watch you

255
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,240
send yourself to your death.

256
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,679
Everyone wants you to be a hero.

257
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,799
But I want you to live.

258
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:52,879
Little Rock,

259
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,879
please don't go.

260
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:59,279
You won't come back if you go.

261
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,039
Little Rock, please. I beg you.

262
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,440
Don't go.

263
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,600
Can you please don't go?

264
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,360
All right.

265
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:29,200
I promise you.

266
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,080
Open this door first.

267
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,200
Little Rock.

268
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:40,840
Don't go.

269
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,759
Little Rock.

270
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,120
Little Rock.

271
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:53,480
I promise you.

272
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,840
I'll promise you anything.

273
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,840
Don't cry.

274
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:11,360
Little Rock,

275
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,320
why does your hand smell of medicine?

276
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,039
But I can't promise you

277
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:24,399
this time.

278
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,720
I'm sorry, Wen Rou.

279
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:35,120
You're the most important person
in my life

280
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,519
and my weakest spot.

281
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,440
That's why I deliberately
gave you the cold shoulder

282
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:42,320
and kept a distance from you.

283
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,799
All because I don't want
you to get involved.

284
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,240
If I die

285
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,799
when the night is over,

286
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,440
I'm sure you'll remember me.

287
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,320
If I manage to live through it,

288
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:03,919
I'll be on the run around the world

289
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:04,880
my whole life.

290
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,039
So just forget me.

291
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,640
I didn't expect to meet you again

292
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:09,839
in such a remote place like this.

293
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,720
It's fate

294
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,359
that we met twice.

295
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,720
Let me give you a piece of advice.

296
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:19,039
You can't go back

297
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,599
because what's ahead of you

298
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,039
is a predestined fate
you can't surmount.

299
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,759
Since it's a predestined fate,

300
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,279
there's no way I could escape it anyway.

301
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,160
I must return

302
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:40,720
because I've promised two of my friends.

303
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,440
Even if you return,

304
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:46,200
everything is not what it used to be.

305
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,880
What do you mean?

306
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:51,279
I've said what I should.

307
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,960
It's up to you to decide

308
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:55,359
what to do.

309
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:07,440
Thank you for the advice.

310
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,279
But my brothers are waiting for my return.

311
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,880
(Wang Xiaoshi is on his way.)

312
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:43,839
What are you doing?

313
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,119
- Come with us!
- Let me go!

314
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:46,319
What are you doing?

315
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:47,599
What do you want?

316
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:57,559
Let's go.

317
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,119
What are you doing?

318
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,279
Let go of me!

319
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:09,039
Let me go!

320
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,400
(Dried fruit store)

321
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:25,599
Mister.

322
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:29,240
Divine Marquis stayed at Qinglong Temple
after he returned to the Capital.

323
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:31,240
Chancellor Cai has planted someone
beside Divine Marquis.

324
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:32,359
He'll join forces with you
in the mission.

325
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:34,039
When someone says
"a lifetime famous dish",

326
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:35,119
that's the signal to take action.

327
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:36,119
Mister, please enjoy.

328
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,319
The situation has changed.
Zhuge went to Qingniu Temple.

329
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:52,000
Set out immediately.

330
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,048
(Qingniu Temple)

331
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:03,839
Mr. Zhuge has gone out.

332
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,359
Head to Fenglin Restaurant.
There's no time to waste.

333
00:21:08,478 --> 00:21:08,742
(Coin)

334
00:21:08,743 --> 00:21:09,087
(Sipai Inn)

335
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,480
Mr. Zhuge's schedule has changed.

336
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,799
He'll show up with his disciples
Cold-blooded and Life Snatcher

337
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,200
at Fengyue Restaurant in the afternoon.

338
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:34,240
Zhuge has left Fengyue Restaurant.

339
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,599
Go to Wazi Alley now.

340
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:37,119
That's the best location to ambush and kill him.

341
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,079
You're Wang Xiaoshi?

342
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,720
Get to the point.

343
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,960
Minister Fu used himself as a bait

344
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:08,960
to invite Zhuge to have a talk
at Kongque Restaurant.

345
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:10,119
You can go.

346
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:11,839
When he smashes a cup,
that will be the signal to take action.

347
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,039
If Zhuge is not at Kongque Restaurant,

348
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:15,960
I'll pull out.

349
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:17,119
Zhuge must be at Kongque Restaurant.

350
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:18,119
Go now.

351
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,912
(Fu)

352
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,640
(Fu)

353
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,506
(Kongque Restaurant)

354
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,359
As the Vermilion Bird rises,
the Azure Dragon flies far away.

355
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,559
If a restaurant wants
to keep its customers,

356
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,680
it'd have to depend on a lifetime famous dish.

357
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:12,000
Good.

358
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:13,279
What else do you want to order?

359
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,880
That's all for now.
We'll have a taste first.

360
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,039
Sure. Help yourselves.

361
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:16,839
Sure.

362
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,559
What are you doing?

363
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,680
Stop it.

364
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,000
You can't kill him.

365
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:49,200
You told me to kill him.

366
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,559
I told you to kill Zhuge.

367
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,559
But he's not Zhuge.

368
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:53,880
Mr. Wang.

369
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:59,079
Mr. Wang. It's me.

370
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:03,079
What's the meaning of this?

371
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:05,359
If I don't do this to test you,

372
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,640
how would I know you'll kill Zhuge?

373
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,720
Besides,
the Four Great Constables always wait

374
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,640
around Divine Marquis Zhuge.

375
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:13,880
The men I dispatched are not worse

376
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,240
than the Four Great Constables.

377
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:16,519
If you can defeat them,

378
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,720
it means you can defeat
the Four Great Constables.

379
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,200
Mr. Wang, it's all for the greater good.

380
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:25,599
So are you still worried
about me killing Zhuge now?

381
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:27,440
I feel more assured now.

382
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,440
But I don't.

383
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:31,480
Killing is about intention.

384
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:34,240
If you lose your intention

385
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,839
when dealing with an expert like Zhuge,

386
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,839
you'll die.

387
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,559
First, you changed
the instructions several times,

388
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,799
which affected my state of mind.

389
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,279
When I fought with all I have,

390
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,240
it turned out to be a test.

391
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:46,119
My intention is gone now.

392
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:47,359
If I failed to kill Zhuge,

393
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:49,799
you'd never get out
of the Youqiao Group's control.

394
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:51,960
Then we'll just wait

395
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,319
for Zhuge to come
for our heads after this.

396
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:55,480
What should we do, Mr. Wang?

397
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,440
I need you to help me.

398
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,640
Sure.

399
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,240
Just ask anything.

400
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:03,240
As long as you kill Zhuge,

401
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:04,759
I'll protect you.

402
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,359
If I kill Zhuge,

403
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,640
I want to stay in the Capital.

404
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,519
I don't want to be
on the run my whole life.

405
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:10,960
It's a small matter.

406
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:13,319
I control the law in the Capital.

407
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:15,279
I can help you with this.

408
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:16,960
You can help
if I kill an ordinary person.

409
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,599
But you're still not powerful enough

410
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:20,279
when it comes to Zhuge.

411
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,720
I want to see Chancellor Cai.

412
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,000
You don't trust me.

413
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,079
Of course, I don't trust you.

414
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:28,920
Chancellor Cai came to me
right from the start.

415
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:30,279
After this matter is over,

416
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,559
I want to see Chancellor Cai right away.

417
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,240
I want him to tell me he'll protect me.

418
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,440
To die a martyr
and to sacrifice for righteousness.

419
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,440
For the sake of righteousness,

420
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:44,279
I forsake my life.

421
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,079
I'm taking such a huge risk.

422
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,720
If Chancellor Cai doesn't even see me,

423
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,559
do I still need to risk my life?

424
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,519
All right.

425
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:55,119
Chancellor Cai and I will wait
for good news in Plum Blossom Garden.

426
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:56,799
But remember.

427
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,920
We want to verify the body

428
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,799
and see Zhuge's head in person.

429
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,240
Where's Zhuge?

430
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:05,160
Qinglong Temple.

431
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,319
Did you tell me to come here

432
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,200
to pretend as Zhuge today?

433
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:23,119
That's right.

434
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:26,160
I told you to come so we can test

435
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,279
if Wang Xiaoshi's sword is swift

436
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:29,920
and fierce enough.

437
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:36,839
Thank you for thinking highly of me.

438
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:39,599
Thank you for saving my life.

439
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:12,839
These three

440
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:14,200
are the spies

441
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,880
Youqiao Group planted in our House.

442
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,680
Wang Xiaoshi will take action tonight.

443
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,400
This concerns the safety
of the House of Sunset Drizzle

444
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,359
and the future of the martial arts world.

445
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,039
Next,

446
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:33,119
you shall not go
against every single thing I say.

447
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,640
It's a matter of life and death.

448
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,119
Every one of the House must be united.

449
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,279
We shall obey your decision.

450
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:41,839
We shall obey your decision.

451
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:42,720
Good.

452
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:45,000
The first order,

453
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:47,559
disband all branches
of the House of Sunset Drizzle.

454
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:54,799
House Master, it's not a small matter

455
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,559
to disband the branches.

456
00:27:58,119 --> 00:27:58,759
Beichen,

457
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,079
didn't I say

458
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:02,640
not to go against every single thing I say?

459
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:03,839
Yes, House Master.

460
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:07,960
Good.

461
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:09,359
The second order,

462
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,759
I want all Keepers

463
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,319
to gather their elites here

464
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:15,559
and follow my orders.

465
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:16,960
Yes.

466
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:21,200
The third order,

467
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,359
use the power
of the House of Sunset Drizzle

468
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,119
to escort Wang Xiaoshi out of the Capital.

469
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:28,319
Yes, House Master.

470
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:48,960
Chancellor Cai,

471
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,000
Wang Xiaoshi is already on his way.

472
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:54,440
The spies along the road
are keeping a close watch on him.

473
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,000
Well done.

474
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:00,039
I'm really looking forward
to seeing Retainment be put into use.

475
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:01,960
If Wang Xiaoshi manages to bring

476
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:05,039
Divine Marquis Zhuge's head here,

477
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:06,400
I want you to take him

478
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,240
and the House of Sunset Drizzle down.

479
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:11,599
Killing two birds with one stone.

480
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,839
Chancellor Cai, you're indeed wise.

481
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,400
Little Rock.

482
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,720
Little Rock.

483
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,480
Stop right there. Who's there?

484
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,960
I'm Wang Xiaoshi,

485
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:24,079
Recluse Tianyi's disciple
of the Carefree Sect.

486
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,359
Greetings, Martial Uncle.

487
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,680
Please come with me.

488
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:31,480
Thank you.

489
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,559
Wang Xiaoshi, Recluse Tianyi's
disciple of the Carefree Sect.

490
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,759
Greetings, Martial Uncle.

491
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:04,240
You're all grown up now.

492
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,160
How's your Master?

493
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:08,880
I'm sure you know

494
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,599
my Master had to stay in Baixu Garden

495
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,640
because he has been unwell.

496
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,039
Come in.

497
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,430
(Horse)

498
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,920
How's House Master Su?

499
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,678
(Chinese chess)

500
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,039
I heard he has been in bed
from his illness lately.

501
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,799
You've sworn to be brothers.

502
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,519
Seeing how hard he works
despite being ill for a long time,

503
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,319
why didn't you try
and talk him out of it?

504
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,880
Some people would rather live in haste

505
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,880
their whole life than live a dull life.

506
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,720
The red-crowned crane
with a longer lifespan enjoys its life.

507
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:57,480
A mayfly also enjoys its life
to the fullest

508
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,880
despite its short lifespan.

509
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,882
(Horse)

510
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,400
Mengzhen is the latter.

511
00:32:03,432 --> 00:32:04,451
(Chinese chess)

512
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,319
He knows his days are numbered.

513
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:08,279
But he thinks achieving justice

514
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,640
is more important than his life.

515
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,519
You have a point.

516
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,920
Most people just exist.

517
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,240
But Su Mengzhen is living his life.

518
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,960
What about Bai Choufei?

519
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,160
He always wanted to be at the top.

520
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,920
He's still not content
even if he's the Vice House Master

521
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,559
of the House of Sunset Drizzle.

522
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,771
(Pawn)

523
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:36,039
Why didn't you advise him?

524
00:32:36,273 --> 00:32:37,265
(Pawn)

525
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,440
Choufei is a talented man.

526
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:43,599
No one can stop him

527
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:45,279
from realizing his ambition.

528
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,319
As long as it's in the right direction

529
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:50,559
and righteous,

530
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,440
there's no need to talk him out of it.

531
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,279
It'd be useless

532
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,319
anyway.

533
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:58,093
(Chariot)

534
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,319
You have a point.

535
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,640
Su Mengzhen wants to achieve justice,

536
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:08,359
and Bai Choufei seeks fame.

537
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:09,593
(Horse)

538
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,519
What about you?

539
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:12,359
What do you want?

540
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:13,279
Me?

541
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,726
(Pawn)

542
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:18,559
I came to the Capital
just to enjoy myself.

543
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:20,519
Enjoy yourself?

544
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,880
That's even harder
than gaining fame and wealth.

545
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:24,039
That's right.

546
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,400
I thought it was the easiest to achieve.

547
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:30,519
But only to find out

548
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:32,880
someone with power

549
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,319
is hiding behind the martial arts world,

550
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,480
intending to control everything.

551
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:39,519
As long as they are around,

552
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:40,960
there will never be peace.

553
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,799
Let alone living carefree.

554
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,279
You can indeed do many things
when you have power.

555
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,519
You're an upright person.

556
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,559
If you unite the martial arts world

557
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:52,400
and set some rules,

558
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,920
the martial arts world
will be a righteous one.

559
00:33:57,599 --> 00:33:58,920
Don't you want to do it?

560
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,680
No one is qualified to control others.

561
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:03,440
It's not up to me

562
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,920
what the martial arts world should be.

563
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:07,920
Since there are many types of people,

564
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,320
we should also have varieties
in the martial arts world.

565
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:12,519
That's what I call freedom.

566
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:13,719
That makes sense.

567
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,239
With your capabilities,

568
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,639
you can enjoy a carefree life

569
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,679
as long as you travel
and leave the martial arts world.

570
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,360
You don't have to get yourself
involved in this messy business.

571
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,239
But someone

572
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,960
has to do certain things.

573
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:28,519
My Master taught me

574
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,880
to help anyone

575
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:33,159
in trouble.

576
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,519
Upholding justice

577
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:36,320
for the oppressed

578
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,800
is what a hero should do.

579
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:42,159
The hidden forces you're facing

580
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,119
are deeply rooted with a solid foundation.

581
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,559
If you want to root them out,

582
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:49,000
you may need all the power
of the martial arts world.

583
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:50,440
My way

584
00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:54,046
(Pawn   Adviser)

585
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:54,760
is to kill one man

586
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,239
to pacify the martial arts world.

587
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,883
(Pawn)

588
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,840
What a great thing to say.

589
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,280
"To kill one to pacify the martial arts world."

590
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:14,960
My Lord,

591
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,400
don't just engage in conversations.

592
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:17,440
The food is getting cold.

593
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,440
This is the cook in charge
of meals in the temple,

594
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,719
You Shisui.

595
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,079
He's a master of cooking

596
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,079
and is famous all over the world.

597
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:29,239
My Lord, you're flattering me.
Greetings, Mr. Wang.

598
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:31,320
These are some
of the dishes I've prepared.

599
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:33,440
This roasted lamb,
one of the eight rare treasures,

600
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,159
is what I like to prepare,

601
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,480
which is also His Lordship's favorite.

602
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:38,599
It's called "a lifetime famous dish".

603
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,559
Why don't you have a taste?

604
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,079
No one should be in the way

605
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:17,719
when a young man wants
to achieve great things.

606
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:24,800
Wang Xiaoshi had succeeded
with the assassination.

607
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,880
Inform Minister Fu quickly.

608
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:26,440
Yes.

609
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,440
I wonder if we can make it

610
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:40,280
through the night safely.

611
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,280
We already did what we could.

612
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,079
Now that we did our best,

613
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:48,360
we'll just wait for our fate.

614
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:56,920
All the time,

615
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,320
I praised myself for guiding Wang Xiaoshi.

616
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:03,440
But the path he chose today

617
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,159
is no longer something I can guide.

618
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:09,559
You should have faith in him.

619
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:10,960
In this world,

620
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,360
I guess only you three sworn brothers

621
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,840
dare to do such a thing.

622
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,880
But if you do it,

623
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,679
it'll get the House involved.

624
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:21,960
If Bai Choufei do it,

625
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,280
he'd do it for his fame.

626
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:25,800
It'll be hard for him
to win the heart of others.

627
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,960
Wang Xiaoshi is the best person

628
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:29,800
to do it.

629
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:33,360
You're right.

630
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:36,400
Bai Choufei and I don't suit for this task.

631
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:37,880
This time,

632
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,199
Xiaoshi will be guiding
the martial arts world.

633
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,119
Once he succeeds,

634
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,800
they'll shut all the 12 Gates
in the Capital.

635
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,320
Can he leave the Capital safely

636
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,480
if we exhaust all our manpower?

637
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:53,840
We can.

638
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,159
Good.

639
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:57,920
Prepare the horse.

640
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,119
I want to go outside the city

641
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,440
to wait for him in person.

642
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,079
Chancellor Cai,

643
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,239
they say life is like playing chess.

644
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,880
From what I see,

645
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,320
you are in charge of this chess board.

646
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,000
It's all up to you to decide

647
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,360
who

648
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,840
will win and lose.

649
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,960
Be it the world or the chess game,

650
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,320
it's all about the human heart.

651
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,840
As long as one has desires,

652
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,320
they all can be chess pieces.

653
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,400
Chancellor, you have excellent chess skills.

654
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,440
I admit defeat.

655
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:58,960
Chancellor Cai,

656
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:01,639
Wang Xiaoshi did it.

657
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,000
He'll be arriving here very soon.

658
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,679
Are you certain?

659
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,960
Wang Xiaoshi was carrying
a bundle soaked in blood

660
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,760
with Divine Marquis' men chasing after him.

661
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:10,079
That must be it.

662
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:17,280
We've been going up
against each other for decades.

663
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:19,159
Tell you what.

664
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,159
I'll write him an elegy.

665
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,559
Tell Thirteen to get ready.

666
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,440
Yes.

667
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,119
Report!

668
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:23,920
Sir,

669
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,440
Wang Xiaoshi has passed the second post.

670
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:26,239
Go now.

671
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:38,480
Report!

672
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,239
Sir,

673
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:42,920
Wang Xiaoshi will reach
Plum Blossom Garden soon

674
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,199
with a bloody head in his hand.

675
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:44,960
All right. Go now.

676
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,440
Yes.

677
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,679
Get ready.

678
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,360
Yes.

679
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,480
Mr. Wang, you must be tired.

680
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:20,480
How did it go?

681
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:22,599
Where's Chancellor Cai?

682
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:24,000
Where's the head?

683
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,159
Please call Chancellor Cai.

684
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:28,880
Only then I'll hand over the head.

685
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,639
Chancellor Cai is in the Palace.

686
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:32,719
He won't return anytime soon.

687
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:35,599
But Chancellor Cai especially asked me
to verify the head here.

688
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,599
He'll reward you personally tomorrow.

689
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:43,599
I killed Divine Marquis Zhuge.

690
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:46,960
Only Chancellor Cai can protect me.

691
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,199
If Chancellor Cai doesn't come,

692
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:53,159
I won't hand over this head.

693
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:55,320
Wang Xiaoshi!

694
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,639
It seems you're adamant
about seeing Chancellor Cai.

695
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,559
All right.

696
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,719
I'll grant your wish.

697
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,360
Guards!

698
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:06,760
Yes!

699
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,159
Wang Xiaoshi,

700
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:14,360
the person you killed
is Divine Marquis Zhuge.

701
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,079
No one in this world can protect you!

702
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:16,960
Capture him!

703
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:17,960
Hold it there.

704
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,599
Who said this is Divine Marquis' head?

705
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:37,679
A lifetime famous dish.

706
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,719
Take him down!

707
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:41,960
Yes!
