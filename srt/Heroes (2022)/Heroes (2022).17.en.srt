32
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,280
Greetings, ladies.

33
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,040
Mister, get us some preserved plums.

34
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,040
We ran out of them.

35
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:51,200
How is that possible?

36
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,680
Look at all the plum blossoms
blooming on the streets!

37
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:55,480
Miss, yesterday, a wealthy client

38
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,480
sent his men here

39
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,640
to purchase all of
the preserved plums we had.

40
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,799
Naturally, we ran out of them
since he purchased all of them.

41
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,640
Besides,

42
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,239
the plum blossom outside
is the red plum blossom tree.

43
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,000
It's different
compared to the plums we use

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,120
for our preserved plums.

45
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,159
But the maidservant of the Li Residence

46
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,360
told me that
she bought them here yesterday.

47
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:11,919
You were referring to yesterday.

48
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,560
Last night's moon has gone down, right?

49
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,400
Even so, the moon
will still rise tonight, right?

50
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,879
You ran out of money yesterday,
didn't you?

51
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,199
I'm loaded today, is that so?

52
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:20,840
- My fair lady...
- Mo.

53
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,680
My lady?

54
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,599
Since they're out of stock,
we can buy them next time.

55
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,879
We still have some
in the residence, right?

56
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,439
Stop complaining.

57
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,039
Miss,

58
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,719
are you...

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,400
Greetings, Miss Lei.

60
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,240
Let's go.

61
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,039
Take care.

62
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,199
What wealthy client?

63
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,039
He purchased that
many preserved plums for himself?

64
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,639
He'll surely die
from consuming them all.

65
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:51,360
You can't catch me!

66
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:55,080
He didn't buy them for himself.

67
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,719
Someone will deliver the plums

68
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,639
to our residence by tomorrow
at the latest.

69
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,159
Deliver them to us?

70
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,840
My lady, don't tell me
the wealthy client was actually...

71
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,919
Today's weather is great.

72
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,560
Let's head there.

73
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,439
What do you think?

74
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,319
Listen,

75
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,479
Jade Garden belongs to
the imperial family.

76
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,080
Ordinary people cannot
access this garden usually.

77
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,960
However, the imperial family
is showing us their grace lately.

78
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,439
Since plum blossom is in season, they
open it to the public for half a month.

79
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,520
That's how we're able to
enjoy the great scenery.

80
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:37,800
You guys

81
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,599
should take a close look
and take a good sniff.

82
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,280
I've sniffed them.

83
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:48,639
I enjoyed the scenery too.

84
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,319
You should remember it at heart.

85
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:51,960
I did.

86
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,400
Tell me how you feel then.

87
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,120
- It looks great.
- It looks ordinary.

88
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:00,960
- It has a generic smell.
- It has a normal smell.

89
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,080
You guys can continue.
I'll check out that place.

90
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,360
I'll head over there.

91
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,120
My lady, you're back?

92
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:31,959
The wealthy client delivered this to us.

93
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,860
(Dream)

94
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:15,520
(Chun)

95
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,639
Sir.

96
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:24,879
Sir,

97
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,480
there's a tricky situation out there.

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,360
You have to follow me.

99
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,079
What is it?

100
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,000
You'll know when you follow me. Hurry.

101
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,240
Come.

102
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,040
This...

103
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,600
What's going on over here?

104
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,560
If you don't give me
an explanation right now,

105
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,399
I'll force you to practice
calligraphy with me.

106
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,879
No matter what I say,

107
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,839
I can never explain it
as well as the letter.

108
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:02,839
You can

109
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,120
read the letter

110
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:07,560
and enjoy your blooming plum blossom.

111
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,279
(The plum blossoms in
the Capital are blooming.)

112
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,920
(Even the Jade Garden
is open to the public.)

113
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,040
(The place is full of visitors.)

114
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,040
(It's a great time to enjoy
the blooming plum blossom.)

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,519
(I know you're busy
with the House's affairs)

116
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,560
(and that you have no time
to go outside.)

117
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,079
(So, I sent you the flowers.)

118
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:38,759
(And I am)

119
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,519
(enjoying the same scenery as you)

120
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,959
(at our usual spot.)

121
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,399
(Given the circumstances,)

122
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,040
(missing you is the best I can do.)

123
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,120
Greetings, Mr. Thirteen.

124
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,959
My foster father instructed me to search
for a good calligraphy painting.

125
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,199
I've obtained this Hawk of Seasons
just a few days ago.

126
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,120
The strokes are bold, yet calm.

127
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,680
It's the authentic work of
Ouyang Xun of the previous dynasty.

128
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,879
That's why I wanted to
hand it to him personally.

129
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,079
Mr. Thirteen, could I trouble you

130
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,120
to pass the message to him?

131
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,279
The chancellor isn't around.

132
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,839
Marquis, I will hand the painting
to him on your behalf.

133
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,120
Please return now.

134
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,360
Since my foster father isn't around,

135
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,480
I shall wait here for his return.

136
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:40,920
I will hand it to him when he returns...

137
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,759
Marquis,

138
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,480
your foster father sent you
to find paintings so you'd be occupied.

139
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,160
You'll only stop letting
your imagination run wild

140
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,120
when you have something to do.

141
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,680
Do you understand?

142
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,399
It seems like I won't be able
to meet my foster father today.

143
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,160
Marquis, you won't be able to see him
just because you want to.

144
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,360
You can only see him

145
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,600
when he wants to see you.

146
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,959
As for the calligraphy paintings,

147
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,759
I think you should continue
your search for them.

148
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,480
Yes, Mr. Thirteen.

149
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,120
I shall take my leave.

150
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,440
Good.

151
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,080
Look at how free-flowing his words are.

152
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,600
(Old Materials, New Revelations)
Amazing.

153
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,279
It looks as if
it was enchanted by a deity!

154
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,799
Amazing!

155
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,919
Such excellent words!

156
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:56,720
Great words.

157
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,399
Amazing.

158
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:58,919
He's truly amazing!

159
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,840
No one can top him!

160
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:02,960
It is truly exceptional.

161
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,080
I've never seen such great words
in my lifetime.

162
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,919
His words are superb!

163
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,159
This trip was worth it.

164
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,600
- It was so worth it.
- He writes like an angel.

165
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:15,759
What kind of words are these?

166
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:19,080
They look slanted.

167
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,519
It's as if a worm
is wriggling on the paper.

168
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,200
It's so unrefined.

169
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,519
How dare he come here
with such ugly words?

170
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:27,480
That's right.

171
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,120
Great words.

172
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,600
He actually said they're great?

173
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:40,279
Everyone said
that my words look terrible.

174
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:42,240
Why did you say they're great?

175
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,120
Can you please give me your take on it?

176
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:45,879
That's right. Tell us.

177
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,600
Old mister, your words looked entangled

178
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
as if dead snakes hanging on a tree.

179
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,240
It's great

180
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,240
because it's extremely ugly.

181
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,080
What kind of logic is that?

182
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,759
Since you think it looks terrible,

183
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:07,799
why did you praise it then?

184
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:11,240
From afar, they look like
wriggling earthworms.

185
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,559
From near, they look like autumn snakes.

186
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,919
When it's at its ugliest form,
it is also the most beautiful form.

187
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,960
Only people of exceptional capabilities
can produce such words.

188
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,639
Those words just now
are pretty good too.

189
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,840
They look good
due to their artistic effects.

190
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,080
But mister, your words are good

191
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:26,600
because they're captivating.

192
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,080
However, it's a pity.

193
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,840
Although they're great,

194
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,200
they violated the rules of calligraphy.

195
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,679
You do sound like an expert yourself.

196
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,799
Why don't you show us your writing

197
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,759
and explain to everyone

198
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,279
what you meant by captivating
and the rules of calligraphy?

199
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,320
That's right.

200
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,000
He's right.

201
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,320
Show us your writing.

202
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:49,600
Show us your writing.

203
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,399
Show us.

204
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:51,360
Let us learn something new.

205
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,320
Since the old mister has spoken,

206
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,120
I shall gladly oblige.

207
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,456
(Men Should Have Strong Minds
And Broad Aspirations)

208
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,440
You're a hidden expert.

209
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,679
It may seem uneven at first glance,

210
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,840
but in reality, the structure of the
characters is dignified yet gentle.

211
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,639
Great words.

212
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,000
I've lost.

213
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:45,960
It was my loss.

214
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,639
Old mister,

215
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,480
I wasn't referring
to the structure of the characters

216
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:50,759
when I said that the words
violated the rules.

217
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:52,799
It's because you didn't utilize

218
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,000
the strokes you excel at.

219
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,000
You actually could tell?

220
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,639
Among the 16 characters you've written,

221
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,840
you only wrote the two words
"Should Not" in one go.

222
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,639
It revealed your usual
carefree demeanor.

223
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:04,879
From these two words alone,

224
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:07,879
I know that you're much better
at writing than me.

225
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,000
Can you give this to me as a gift?

226
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:16,559
Of course.

227
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,159
All right.

228
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:18,799
Mister, you can take it if you like it.

229
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,240
I'm not a famous figure.

230
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,080
That's great.

231
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,320
This trip is worthwhile indeed.

232
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:24,720
If you're free,

233
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:25,919
you may visit

234
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,000
my Plum Blossom Garden.

235
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:30,120
By then, I'll show you

236
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,120
my true writings.

237
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,919
I will surely visit you
when I have the chance.

238
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,000
All right.

239
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:37,559
Make way.

240
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,679
Make way.

241
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,360
Make way.

242
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,799
Please make way.

243
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:45,679
Please make way.

244
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,039
Please make way.

245
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:49,679
Make way.

246
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,080
Get out of the way!

247
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,600
Why are you still here?

248
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,440
You stepped on my foot just now.
Didn't you feel that?

249
00:12:58,879 --> 00:12:59,600
You!

250
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:02,360
Sorry about that.

251
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,039
How rude.

252
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:06,440
Pardon me for the rudeness.

253
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,000
Make way.

254
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,120
These two guys

255
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,000
are worse than little girls
who need coaxing.

256
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,159
This is the time I love the most
throughout the entire day.

257
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,200
It's you?

258
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,480
Did you tail me?

259
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,440
I often come here to enjoy the sunset.

260
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,720
I didn't expect to see you here.

261
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:51,200
Let me warn you.

262
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:53,080
Wang Xiaoshi and Bai Choufei
are right over there.

263
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:54,600
If you dare to try anything funny,

264
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:55,720
you won't be able to escape.

265
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:57,879
Look over there.

266
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:02,519
People are heading back as
the tired birds return to their nests.

267
00:14:02,528 --> 00:14:03,892
(Hanxiang Pavilion)

268
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:05,039
During sunset,

269
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,200
it's as if time itself has slowed down.

270
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,399
We're willing to slow down our pace too.

271
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,039
That day,

272
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,720
why did you say
that I lived like a puppet?

273
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:19,679
I just think

274
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,039
that no matter what you do,

275
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,600
you do it for the sake
of showing it to other people.

276
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:26,879
At least a puppet can make others happy.

277
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:30,039
I'm even worse than a puppet.

278
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,480
I exist

279
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,399
merely for the officials

280
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,240
to feel as if they have the power.

281
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,840
My father passed away

282
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,559
when I was very young.

283
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,879
Taking his Blood River Sword with me,

284
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,840
I was escorted to the Capital.

285
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,559
But when I arrived in the Capital,

286
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,360
all those officials
feared my father's legacy.

287
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,279
They were afraid that
the Blood River Sword might resurface.

288
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,159
They hoped that I could become
a good-for-nothing.

289
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,679
And I had no choice
but to become a good-for-nothing.

290
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:06,159
Those officials can kill me

291
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,039
as easily as squishing an ant.

292
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,639
They're only keeping me alive

293
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:16,600
because I am willing to obey them.

294
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,960
I'm just a Marquis
who's waiting for my time to come,

295
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:23,039
wielding the Blood River Sword,
killing no one.

296
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,600
I sound like a good-for-nothing.

297
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:27,759
But I can only survive

298
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,200
by doing so.

299
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,120
This is power.

300
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,279
That's why I said

301
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,960
I was worse than a puppet.

302
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:45,080
I've spoken so much,

303
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,639
and I guess you're not willing
to listen to my rambles.

304
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,960
In your eyes,

305
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,399
all of these might be my excuses.

306
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,360
It's good as long as you can survive.

307
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:58,159
I don't know

308
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,519
what kind of person you want to become,

309
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,360
but you'll only get the chance to do so

310
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,799
if you stay alive.

311
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,159
What are you smiling at?

312
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:13,919
People say that women always
speak with their tongue in their cheek.

313
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:16,360
Although you may look like you hate me,

314
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,440
you're willing to listen to my rambles

315
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,080
and console me.

316
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:25,039
Did you fall for me?

317
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:27,039
I guess a leopard
can't change its spots.

318
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,399
I wasted my breath on you.

319
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,960
(Studious Legacy)

320
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:11,119
Sir.

321
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:12,079
Please have a seat.

322
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:14,839
Leave.

323
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,480
Fang Yingkan came today.

324
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,799
He said he found
a calligraphy painting for you.

325
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,079
Open it.

326
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,039
He's been restless lately.

327
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:30,759
I suppose Guan Qi's case

328
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,279
is related to him.

329
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,640
It was Guan Qi's fate.

330
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:37,039
He can't do anything about it.

331
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,200
He'll understand that eventually.

332
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,559
Hawk of Seasons?

333
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:47,720
This is a rare painting indeed.

334
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,079
Keep it away.

335
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,599
Famous works like these

336
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,960
lack surprises.

337
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:57,640
When it comes to calligraphy,

338
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,319
sir, you are one of the top experts.

339
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,720
Naturally, your taste would be different
from mere mortals like us.

340
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:04,920
However, today,

341
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:08,519
I finally found a calligraphy painting
that I have taken a liking to.

342
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,039
This calligraphy painting
is pretty interesting.

343
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,599
Get someone to frame it.

344
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,039
Hang it on the wall.

345
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:16,759
All right.

346
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm Zhang Fei,

347
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,319
Zhang Yide!

348
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:32,319
I'm a pork butcher.

349
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,839
However,
much of my pork meat was stolen!

350
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:38,799
Today, I will get
an explanation from him!

351
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,920
Where's the red-faced thief?

352
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,039
I'm Guan Yu, Guan Yunchang!

353
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,079
I am a gatekeeper.

354
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:50,400
Why did you say that I stole your meat?

355
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,160
Thief, do you dare battle with me?

356
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,400
The two brothers have been through
thick and thin together.

357
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:03,359
However, they still
act like little girls

358
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:05,799
when they argue.

359
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,839
The more they argue,
the more intense it gets.

360
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,119
They even brought up

361
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,319
their old scores.

362
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:17,200
Let us listen to their stories.

363
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:22,200
At first, we agreed
to make a name for ourselves

364
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,799
in the Capital.

365
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,319
But now, you're leaving

366
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,079
just because
you've encountered some difficulties?

367
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:33,440
Talented individuals like me
cannot afford to wait.

368
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,599
This is not the place
for me to build my future.

369
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,400
Is there a better place than the Capital

370
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,480
to showcase your talent?

371
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,319
Did you forget what you said

372
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,160
when we swore an oath

373
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:50,960
in Kushuipu?

374
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,680
If you dare to leave,

375
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,720
I'll break your legs!

376
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:57,200
Who said I'd forgotten it?

377
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,440
We will go through
thick and thin together.

378
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,559
We will entrust our lives to each other
and never let each other down.

379
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,440
She's really talented.

380
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:09,680
I guess she's the only person
who will resort to that.

381
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,680
Amazing!

382
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,720
Why did you bring up the past?

383
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,279
Our hearts change easily.

384
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:18,759
In the past,
you treat me as your brother.

385
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:21,799
Now, you despise me for being a demon!

386
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,079
What nonsense are you saying?

387
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,720
I'm not daring enough to criticize you.

388
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,680
I'm just a coward.

389
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,359
Who started the argument first?

390
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,880
It was you!

391
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,559
They're fighting!

392
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:37,000
Great!

393
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:37,799
Good!

394
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,000
Good!

395
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,119
I have a strange feeling.

396
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,720
One day, only
the two of us will be left,

397
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,799
stuck inside an iron cage.

398
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,519
Or, we will stand on a narrow path.

399
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:56,119
I don't know if we
have to fight each other to death

400
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,359
or embrace each other.

401
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,039
I hope it's just my imagination.

402
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,400
Of course that's just your imagination.

403
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,680
Amazing!

404
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,759
Tell us another story!

405
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,599
Great!

406
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:32,160
Great!

407
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,079
Please enjoy your meal.

408
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:38,960
They're still ungrateful
even after all I've done.

409
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,200
Fine, just ignore each other
in the future then.

410
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:42,799
This is so infuriating.

411
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:51,880
I thought you guys split up?

412
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,440
Why did you come back to find me?

413
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,039
Listen.

414
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:56,640
From now on, I'll ignore you guys.

415
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,079
The Wen family is full of heroes.

416
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,559
The people we know
are righteous heroes too,

417
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,559
not little girls like you two.

418
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,279
You guys made a huge fuss
over a tiny matter.

419
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,680
What are you two laughing at?

420
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:14,160
Both of us left early

421
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:15,640
to buy your present.

422
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,319
That's right.

423
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:17,400
We split up

424
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,960
because the presents we wanted to buy
were at different locations.

425
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:20,720
You guys still have the time
to buy presents?

426
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:22,599
Did you two

427
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,359
reconcile with each other already?

428
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,400
There was nothing
between us from the start.

429
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:28,160
We've already
been through hell together.

430
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,720
Even if we have different opinions,

431
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,440
we will surely
work together in the future.

432
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:33,200
That's right.

433
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:34,400
Besides,

434
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,920
a little girl like you actually
insulted us by calling us little girls.

435
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,000
Of course we need
to do something about it.

436
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,039
You two are really troublesome.

437
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:42,960
Fine.

438
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:45,559
At least my effort wasn't in vain.

439
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,079
Thank you, Wen Rou.

440
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,440
Thank you for your kind intention.

441
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,599
How do you plan to thank me?

442
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:51,960
By just saying thank you?

443
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,920
What do you think about this bottle?

444
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:01,400
Cabbage, you're terrible
at choosing presents.

445
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:02,799
What can this bottle do?

446
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:04,319
What do you know?

447
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:05,720
The shopkeepers said this bottle

448
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:07,440
is a good luck charm.

449
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,960
It can keep you safe.

450
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:09,920
Isn't it great?

451
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:12,119
And this.

452
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:14,599
A ceramic craftsman made this.

453
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,240
Plum blossom may wither one day,

454
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:19,400
but this flower will bloom forever.

455
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:23,440
You're indeed better
at choosing presents.

456
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,000
But you can have both of them.

457
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,200
Are you happy now?

458
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:30,119
I guess this is a worthwhile day.

459
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,960
It's a special day,

460
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,799
and it's a happy day for us.

461
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:36,200
You guys have to remember

462
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,240
what I've done for you two

463
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:39,000
since this morning, all right?

464
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,440
But why?

465
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:42,640
He's right. But why?

466
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,279
You'll face ordeals from time to time
when you roam the martial arts world.

467
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,920
In the future, there might be arguments

468
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,839
and unavoidable bloodshed.

469
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,640
So I hope you two

470
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,279
can remember
the happiness you felt today

471
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,519
and keep it in your heart.

472
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,359
When you encounter ordeals

473
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:58,839
and feel like giving up in the future,

474
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,680
you should remember
how it feels like to be happy.

475
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:02,480
Use your happy memories

476
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,000
to ward off the snow
and storms in the future.

477
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,960
Why are you staring at me?

478
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:13,240
Is there something on my face?

479
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,680
No.

480
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,319
I just think that
the Young Lady of the Wen Family

481
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,640
had grown up after living in

482
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,680
the Capital for some time.

483
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,599
Come, let's have a toast.

484
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:23,079
To

485
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:25,119
our smooth-sailing future, all right?

486
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,079
One toast isn't enough.

487
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,000
You said we have to store
happy memories, right?

488
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:30,640
We have to drink until we drop.

489
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,680
- Bring it on then.
- Come.

490
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,519
Cheers.

491
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:37,119
You won't remember anything
if you get drunk.

492
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,759
Bai, take three cups as your punishment.

493
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,599
What? Me? You should drink too.

494
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,599
All right, I'll join you.

495
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:44,519
Stop being angry. Come.

496
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:45,240
Stop being angry.

497
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,079
You shouldn't drink too much.

498
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:46,640
Here.

499
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,720
Mister,

500
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:49,960
please let me go inside!

501
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:53,440
(House of Sunset Drizzle)
I'm looking for Bai Youjin!

502
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,400
Bai Youjin? Who's that?

503
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,039
Leave immediately.

504
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:56,960
He

505
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:58,119
is very tall!

506
00:24:58,359 --> 00:24:59,160
I'll surely recognize him!

507
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,680
Mister.

508
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:03,039
Mr. Bai!

509
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:05,000
I've finally found you!

510
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:06,279
Why were you looking for me?

511
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,759
I have good news for you!
And the news is even better for you!

512
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,927
(Honor of Deshao)

513
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,319
Look, I'm here to deliver your payment.

514
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,480
So much?

515
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:15,279
The important client
I mentioned last time

516
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:16,599
bought your paintings again.

517
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,680
This time, she paid 50 taels for them.

518
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,000
It's a hefty sum.

519
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,839
By the way, not only did
she appreciate your paintings,

520
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:25,799
but she also left you a letter.

521
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,519
This letter is for you.

522
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,559
This client
is actually a beautiful lady.

523
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,319
Mr. Bai, I shall take my leave now.

524
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,710
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

525
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:51,720
It's her?

526
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:00,759
Bai?

527
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,640
What are you doing here alone?

528
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,000
It's nothing.
I'm enjoying my private time.

529
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,000
What is this?

530
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,519
(Mister, your paintings
are filled with strong strokes)

531
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:12,799
(and high ambitions.)

532
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,359
(However, the bow will snap
if you apply too much force.)

533
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,039
(Mister, I hope you
can rise together with the wind)

534
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:18,759
(and achieve your ambition
on cloud nine.)

535
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:20,279
(Tian Chun.)

536
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:22,039
So, Miss Tian Chun
was your patron all along?

537
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,440
Wait, isn't this too much
of a coincidence?

538
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,279
I didn't expect her
to like my paintings either.

539
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:28,759
The carefree Bai Choufei
who went sightseeing on the river

540
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,079
and the painter Bai Youjin

541
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:30,880
are actually the same person?

542
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,599
I'm sure Miss Tian Chun

543
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:33,799
would be surprised about that.

544
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,160
What are you laughing at?

545
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,319
Be honest with me.

546
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:38,720
Do you like Miss Tian Chun?

547
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,319
- I...
- I think this is great.

548
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,039
You two are a match made in heaven.

549
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:44,079
I just wonder

550
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:45,400
what Miss Tian Chun thinks about you.

551
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,160
About that,

552
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,279
I'll ask her about it
when I see her in person.

553
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,880
I will ask her out

554
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:54,200
and confess to her.

555
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:57,680
Not bad at all.

556
00:26:57,718 --> 00:26:59,360
(Six Half Hall)

557
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:30,839
Father.

558
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:31,680
- Okay.
- Have some warm tea.

559
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,240
It's good.

560
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,640
This is strange.

561
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:50,440
When my daughter makes tea for me,

562
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,160
it smells and tastes better
than the tea other people make for me.

563
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,880
The tea sage, Lu Yu, once said that

564
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:57,599
mountain water is superior, river water
is mediocre while well water is inferior.

565
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,759
I made this tea

566
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,079
with something better
than mountain water.

567
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,319
We call it sky water,

568
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,079
also known as dew water.

569
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,880
The water I've used to make your tea

570
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,400
was the dew water
we had collected this morning.

571
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,759
This tea is great. I like it.

572
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:21,480
Chun, you should make tea for me
when you're free in the future.

573
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,799
Everything in the world
has its own category.

574
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:28,200
It's the same for humans too.

575
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,119
Su Mengzhen is the man among men indeed.

576
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:34,119
It's because he's an exceptional talent.

577
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:37,039
But I do think
Bai Choufei is not bad as well.

578
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,160
He's a rare talent.

579
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:40,839
By the way, Chun,

580
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,039
what do you think about Bai Choufei?

581
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:47,759
I don't have many friends
in the martial arts world.

582
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:49,160
He's one of them.

583
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:52,599
But Father, you didn't want me

584
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:54,920
to go near the House of Sunset Drizzle.

585
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,880
That's why I don't see him often.

586
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:02,400
I do think

587
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,519
you can meet up
with Bai Choufei more often.

588
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,559
He's an intelligent man.

589
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:12,079
I can rest at ease when my daughter

590
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,440
makes friends with intelligent men

591
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:15,599
like him.

592
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:22,519
I heard

593
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:24,079
that the Young Lady of the Six Half Hall

594
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:25,039
is going to come here.

595
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,519
She's a rare guest.

596
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,079
That's right.

597
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,480
The woman who rejected
Mengzhen's proposal?

598
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,680
Let me see

599
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,839
what kind of woman you are.

600
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,920
Chun, you're here?

601
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,200
Long time no see.

602
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,519
I don't dare to be late
when I'm meeting you.

603
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,599
Hurry.

604
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:50,240
Have a seat.

605
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:54,839
Great timing.

606
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:56,119
You can enjoy a show later.

607
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,839
A show?

608
00:29:58,799 --> 00:29:59,759
Listen.

609
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:00,319
Later,

610
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:01,640
the Young Lady of
the Six Half Hall will be here.

611
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:03,799
She's the woman who rejected
Mengzhen's proposal.

612
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:05,880
I'll teach her a lesson.

613
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,839
You better hide

614
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,960
when we get into a fight.

615
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,160
If not, I might hit you by mistake.

616
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:12,720
Wen Rou, are you trying to hit me?

617
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,240
Why would I hit you?

618
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,279
The person I'm going to hit is...

619
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:21,079
Don't tell me

620
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:22,480
it's...

621
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:23,960
It is me.

622
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:30,079
I...

623
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:36,079
I took on another identity
because I had no choice.

624
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:37,880
I already knew you're

625
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:40,240
Su Mengzhen's martial sister
when we were at Han River.

626
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,559
You're considered a member
of the House of Sunset Drizzle.

627
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:44,000
We were predestined

628
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:46,000
to avoid each other in the Capital.

629
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:49,759
No wonder you left us
on the boat without saying a word.

630
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:51,079
I was wondering

631
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:52,559
why I couldn't find you in the Capital.

632
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,920
Do you mind that I've hidden
my true identity from you?

633
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,519
Chun, you're worried for nothing.

634
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:59,319
Your identity doesn't matter to me
as long as you're my friend.

635
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:01,119
Although I hate the Six Half Hall,

636
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,640
I like you.

637
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:05,759
I'm relieved to hear that.

638
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:07,200
Later, I need to head back

639
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,480
and tell Little Rock
and Cabbage about this.

640
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:10,079
I'm sure they'll be shocked.

641
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,279
Actually, I asked you out today because
I have a difficult favor to ask of you.

642
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,680
It's related to Mr. Bai.

643
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:16,000
Cabbage?

644
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:21,480
I think I know what the matter is.

645
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,400
I could already tell

646
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,200
when we were at Han River.

647
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,599
Cabbage is always proud and arrogant.

648
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,200
However, the way
he looked at you was different

649
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:31,440
from how he
usually looked at other people.

650
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,039
Not long ago,

651
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,240
I encountered him once again
in the Six Half Hall.

652
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:37,119
And, after that encounter,

653
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,079
I confirmed his feelings for me.

654
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,759
However, I only see him as a friend.

655
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:46,119
I need someone to assist me

656
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,079
in waking him up.

657
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,880
After careful consideration,
I still think you're the best candidate.

658
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,480
This is truly a difficult task.

659
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,240
However, it's fine.

660
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,480
I will come up with a way somehow.

661
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,039
Thank you, Wen Rou.

662
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,079
Here, have some tea.

663
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:19,956
(Four Virtues)

664
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,240
Is it nice?

665
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,200
I'm talking to you. Is it nice?

666
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:37,200
You look troubled.

667
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,400
What's the matter?

668
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,640
I'm thinking about Cabbage.

669
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:44,400
Why are you thinking about him?

670
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,920
I think I should tell you.

671
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:49,240
You can assist me
in coming up with an idea.

672
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,079
Do you know

673
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:53,440
that Chun is actually
the Young Lady of the Six Half Hall?

674
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:56,359
So, you already found out?

675
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,240
Wait, you knew it too?

676
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,559
Bai told me about it.

677
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:01,880
I was planning

678
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,160
to find a suitable opportunity
to relay the news to you.

679
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,240
So, both of you actually knew.

680
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,680
If so, do you know...

681
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,759
Bai likes Lei Chun, right?

682
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,160
Everyone can tell
as long as they're not blind.

683
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,759
And,

684
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,880
Bai will be meeting Lei Chun today.

685
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:14,119
He plans to confess
his feelings for her.

686
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:15,720
You didn't know, right?

687
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:16,559
What?

688
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:18,039
That can't be.

689
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:19,759
Isn't it great?

690
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,920
Bai is confessing to the girl he likes.

691
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,440
Moreover, Bai is handsome and talented.

692
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
He's a skilled martial artist too.

693
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:26,759
- I think...
- But Chun

694
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:28,039
had an engagement
with Mengzhen before this.

695
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,559
The person she likes is Mengzhen.

696
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,440
Bai Youjin is a strange man indeed.

697
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:44,759
Even though he hasn't seen you before,

698
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,440
he asked Wang Er to arrange
a meeting for you two.

699
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,960
And he hasn't even shown himself yet.

700
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,640
What a strange man.

701
00:33:58,279 --> 00:33:59,640
All talented individuals are prideful.

702
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:01,599
I can understand how he feels.

703
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,319
You better don't be this rude

704
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,240
in front of outsiders later.

705
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:07,400
No, I won't.

706
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,760
I'll ask the innkeeper
to prepare some snacks for us.

707
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:11,119
All right.

708
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,400
Mr. Bai, it seems like
you're in a fine mood today.

709
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:20,639
Where are Wang Xiaoshi and Wen Rou?

710
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,679
I'm here to wait for someone.

711
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:25,159
Naturally, they won't be here.

712
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,519
However, if the person
I'm waiting for doesn't turn up,

713
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,239
I can at least
drown myself in sorrow alone

714
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,079
and avoid their mockery.

715
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I might be mistaken,

716
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:37,480
but Mr. Bai, were you waiting for me?

717
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,079
That's right.

718
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:43,519
Since I'm here,
you don't need to drink alone.

719
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,400
Amid the excellent scenery,

720
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:48,920
let us be honest with each other.

721
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,599
All right.

722
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,599
This painting

723
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:01,119
represents my intention

724
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,199
and the words I want to tell you.

725
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,280
It's not like I don't know
what's good for me.

726
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:12,440
It's not like I don't understand

727
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,280
the rejections

728
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:15,639
you hide under your words.

729
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:20,719
However, I just want
to complete this painting

730
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,800
and wait for your answer.

731
00:37:34,491 --> 00:37:40,366
(Bai Youjin)

732
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,199
You've bought
all of Bai Youjin's paintings.

733
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,280
But you didn't know
that I was Bai Youjin.

734
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,280
At least today,

735
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,280
the two names have finally
acknowledged each other.

736
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,119
Lei Chun,

737
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,280
I like you.

738
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,719
I like you no matter if you're Tian Chun

739
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:19,599
or Lei Chun.

740
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:21,280
I like you

741
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:22,960
no matter
if you had bought my paintings or not.

742
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:24,599
It's because
I fell for you at first sight

743
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:26,039
on Han River.

744
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,559
Those are

745
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,800
my honest feelings.

746
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,800
Mr. Bai, I will remember

747
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:45,519
your honest feelings.

748
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,159
However, to me,

749
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,559
you're just a friend,

750
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,440
just like Wang Xiaoshi and Wen Rou.

751
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,480
I have no other ideas about you.

752
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,599
Moreover,

753
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:58,960
I've already fallen for someone

754
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,400
long ago.

755
00:39:20,344 --> 00:39:24,493
(Li's Candies)

756
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,719
At the edge of the market,

757
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:34,239
there was a small dried fruit store.

758
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:36,280
I met a person in that store

759
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:38,440
when I was ten.

760
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,280
Since then, I knew

761
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,679
that he's the only one

762
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,119
for me.

763
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,639
Mr. Bai, you're an exceptional man.

764
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:51,760
You will meet someone
you truly like in the future.

765
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,119
When you meet that person,

766
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,800
you'll realize

767
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,639
that your past love
is as transient as a fleeting cloud.

768
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,199
Take care.

769
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,440
Vice House Master Bai?

770
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:13,239
Welcome, Vice House Master Bai.

771
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,280
Do you recognize me?

772
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,920
My store is thriving
all thanks to the House's support.

773
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,400
Vice House Master Bai,
do you want to buy something?

774
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:25,239
I have all kinds of dried fruits

775
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,480
and preserved snacks available.

776
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:30,079
Have you been working here
since its opening?

777
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:30,960
That's right.

778
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,440
I inherited this store
from my ancestors.

779
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:36,280
It's been operating nearly 40 years
after I took over the store.

780
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,440
If so, I have something to ask you.

781
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:40,519
Around 13 years ago,

782
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,800
the Young Lady of the Six Half Hall,
Lei Chun, was here.

783
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:45,039
Do you remember what happened back then?

784
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,199
I do.

785
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,000
I think there was a fight

786
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,280
in this area.

787
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,800
I went outside and took a peek.

788
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,159
I saw a red-clothed young man

789
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:57,760
standing beside Miss Lei Chun.

790
00:40:58,519 --> 00:41:01,719
