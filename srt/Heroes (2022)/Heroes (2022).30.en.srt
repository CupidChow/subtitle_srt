60

66
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,039
Don't resent me.

67

68

for glory and fame,

69
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,559
for wealth and luxuries!

70
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:56,679
But you?

71
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:58,559
You rubbed them the wrong way.

72
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,639
Didn't you have any idea?

73
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,519
Offending them

74
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,679
would warrant your death

75
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,960
and all those close to you
would be killed!

76
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,639
Why would I get myself
killed because of you?

77
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,919
Besides,

78
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:18,120
you had a son.

79
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,840
Of course you'd treat him better

80
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:22,679
and care for him.

81
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,679
You'd give him everything you had.

82
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,639
Your mastery of martial arts,

83
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,759
the fame of the Fang family,

84
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:31,679
and the Blood River Sword,

85
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:33,000
he got to have everything!

86
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,000
What about me?

87
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,159
I was just the trash
you picked up on the street!

88
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:42,639
What could I possibly get?

89
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,240
Tell me.

90
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,279
Who should I kill if not you?

91
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,480
Don't give me that look!

92
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,080
I'd take your life when you were alive.

93
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,480
Now that you're dead,

94
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,039

Over the years,

196
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,200
I've been in and out of the prison.

197
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:00,359
I've seen my fair share of oddities.

198

Some who fell into the pit

199
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:06,839
thought they could be saved.

200
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:10,039
You were the same when you came in.

201
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,440
These people

202
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:15,880
then became what you are right now.

203
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:18,079
The light in their eyes

204
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:20,240
went out

205
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,599
in a blow.

206
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:29,480
Despair comes from hope.

207
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,559
Do not think that

208
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,880
your resolve would be any good.

209
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:38,480
Resolve is nothing but self-consoling.

210
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,720
It means nothing!

211
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:43,039
But from what I see here,

212
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,720
you must have already known that

213
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,200
before I told you.

214
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:52,880
Buddy,

215
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:55,359
whatever predicament you're in,

216
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:58,240
this is my advice for you.

217
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,559
Life is short and transient.

218
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:06,119
Throwing away your life for a meaningless cause

219
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,079
is completely pointless.

220
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,880
If you could somehow get out of here,

221
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,720
then lay down your stubbornness.

222
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,200
If you ever have a chance
to find success,

223
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,119
forget about right and wrong.

224
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:22,960
You must hold onto it with your own hands!

225
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,279
With power,

226
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:27,960
your words will become justice itself!

227
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,880
Do not follow in my footsteps

228
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:34,119
and die in a prison.

229
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:37,880
Everything will be too late in the end.

230
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,200
Back in the day,

231
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:43,960
my brother was still around.

232
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:47,759
We came to the Capital together.

233
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,839
Before we could enjoy ourselves,

234
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:53,759
we were sent to jail.

235
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,079
Despite that,

236
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:59,119
we believed we'd get out
and make a name for ourselves!

237
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:02,559
We wrote those words on the dungeon's wall.

238
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,559
The words...

239
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:05,880
The words...

240
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:08,880
What did we write again?

241
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:10,839
It was...

242
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,240
I remember

243
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,359
the time

244
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:17,599
when we were locked
inside a cell such as this.

245
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:21,839
Is it here?

246
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,119
I found it!

247
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,079
I found it!

248
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,799
These are the words we wrote!

249
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:41,319
It's fine if I can't make a sound.
But when I do, I'll make the loudest noise.

250
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:46,319
It's fine if I can't fly.
But when I do, I'll soar to the highest.

251
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:51,640
Back then,

252
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:54,720
I was even more spirited than you.

253
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,559
My name wasn't Gaotang back then.

254
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,279
I was worried for the land
and its future.

255
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:05,680
You must have worries
to amount to the greatness.

256
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:09,279
Hence, I gave myself a name!

257
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,799
I called myself Bai

258
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,759
Chou

259
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:16,079
Fei.

260
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,160
In hindsight,

261
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:21,039
how hopeful and arrogant of me.

262
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,440
Foolish.

263
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,880
How foolish of me.

264
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:29,160
Bai Choufei?

265
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,319
My name is Bai Gaotang.

266
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,000
I'm your new cellmate.

267
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,880
There's only a fine line
between a hero and a detested person.

268
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,039
If you don't cherish
your chance while you have it,

269
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,400
when you run out of luck, it's useless
no matter how capable you are.

270
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,319
With power,

271
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:54,720

331

338

00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:36,880
Sure, thank you.

340
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:41,759
Here,

341
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,279
finish the soup.

342
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,079
You've gone through a lot lately.

343
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,519
Take a good rest.

344
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,240
I'll take care of the things.

345
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,319
Master.

346
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,759
Put it on.

347
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:51,839
Don't get frostbite.

348
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,830
There is something

349
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,790
you might want to know.

350
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,200
Martial Uncle Zhuge sent a letter.

351
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,550
Su Mengzhen

352
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,000
is planning to rescue Bai Choufei.

353
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,750
That shouldn't be too much of a trouble.

354
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,920
So don't worry.

355
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,680
I killed,

356
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,550
but I left without a word.

357
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,400
I got them both into trouble.

358
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,440
Little Rock, you've done nothing wrong.

359
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,880
Plenty of people wanted Fu Zongshu dead,

360
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,750
but they couldn't kill him.

361
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,920
Do not feel guilty over what you did.

362
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,310
We

363
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,680
shouldn't dwell on the past.

364
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,750
Leave the rest to them.

365
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,980
After Wen Rou wakes up

366
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,070
and recovers,

367
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,860
I'll see you off.

368
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,240
Master.

369
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,480
Are you here for important matters?

370
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,920
It's the first time
you came out from the Baixu Garden.

371
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,990
Your Martial Uncle asked me for a favor.

372
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,240
I'm here to pick up Official Liu Anshi.

373
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,920
He'll arrive in a few days.

374
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:17,990
Liu Anshi?

375
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,440
That name rings a bell.

376
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,920
Of course.

377
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,240
The person who saw Official Liu off

378
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,480
was Su Mengzhen himself.

379
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,510
When Mengzhen was escorting Official Liu,

380
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,920
it was to avoid
the Youqiao Group's pursuit.

381
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,030
Why is he coming back?

382
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,350
He had to leave

383
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:45,030
to steer clear of trouble.

384
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,030
But more importantly,

385
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,270
he must secure a piece of evidence.

386
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:52,310
With the evidence,

387
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,350
we could overthrow Chancellor Cai.

388
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,270
But Chancellor Cai is too powerful.

389
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,510
Even with the full might of the House,

390
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,920
his position is still secured.

391
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,070
Is there any evidence
we can use to take him down?

392
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,680
Have you heard about Fang Geyin?

393
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:12,920
Years ago,

394
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,510
he was the most respected hero
in the martial arts world.

395
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:19,790
Years ago,

396
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,880
the Liao people invaded.

397
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,990
Fang Geyin mustered
a group of ambitious heroes

398
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:28,550
and formed a militia group to
fend off the Liao people in the north.

399
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,240
They secured numerous victories.

400
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:34,720
But their action got in the way
of Chancellor Cai's arms deals.

401
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:39,240
He secretly signed the dispatch order

402
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,990
to send a troop
to ambush the militia group.

403
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,400
Afterward,

404
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,830
he killed everyone in the militia group.

405
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:48,310
His plan wasn't flawless.

406
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,030
Someone from the group got away.

407
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,070
The dispatch order was gone.

408
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,830
We searched everywhere

409
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,480
and got a lead.

410
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,590
The sole survivor fled to Liao.

411
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,070
We believe the dispatch order

412
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,990
is with him.

413
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,270
Chancellor Cai dispatched a troop.

414
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,720
The order will have his seal.

415
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,470
That's the evidence.

416
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:12,910
If we get the order,

417
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,120
Chancellor Cai can't get away no matter

418
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,390
how powerful he is.

419
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,640
We must overthrow Chancellor Cai

420
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,390
to redeem your honor.

421
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,120
When the time comes,

422
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,240
you won't need to be on the run

423
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,160
anymore.

424
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:56,310
You recover faster than I expect.

425
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,600
Eating will fill your stomach.

426
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,520
But your hunger

427
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,470
can't be sated with just food alone.

428
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,430
What can you give me?

429
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,640
Everything.

430
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,120
I can give you

431
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,120
anything you want.

432
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,270
But how far will you go

433
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,350
to get what you want?

434
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,600
I'll sever all ties.

435
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,200
I'll become stone-cold and heartless.

436
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,350
Xiaoyao, the mission tonight is dangerous.

437
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:23,310
Are you sure about this?

438
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,520
I have two Keepers with me.

439
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,350
Don't worry.

440
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,560
If Wang Xiaoshi found out

441
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,470
Bai Choufei was suffering in jail,

442
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,790
he'd risk his life to save the man.

443
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,870
But with Wang Xiaoshi gone,

444
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,200
I want to fulfill this wish for him.

445
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:39,870
Xiaoyao!

446
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,080
I promise

447
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,520
after this mission,

448
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,240
I won't put myself in danger again.

449
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:48,640
I'll be back.

450
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:13,380
(Ministry of Justice.)

451
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,430
We follow the plan.

452
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,080
We can't afford any mistakes.

453
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,390
Stay alert.

454
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,680
Yes.

455
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,390
I'll take two and go from the side.

456
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:27,720
Wait for my signal.

457
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,200
Watch your back.

458
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:29,870
Yes.

459
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,710
(Ministry of Justice.)

460
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,780
(Ministry of Justice)

461
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:34,080
You betrayed us?

462
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:37,720
Yes.

463
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,200
Where are my men?

464
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,470
Dead.

465
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:44,560
Traitor scum!

466
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,870
We risked our lives to save you!

467
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,640
You betrayed us
and abandoned your honor!

468
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,720
You're a fiend!

469
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:53,120
Bicker however you want.

470
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,000
When you're all dead,

471
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,470
no one will ever hear you.

472
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,310
We were wrong about you.

473
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,830
We should have known

474
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,240
you're a loathsome ingrate!

475
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:07,000
The House Master saw you as his brother!

476
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,310
You don't deserve it.

477
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,430
Imbecile!

478
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,080
Shameless wretch!

479
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:14,600
You'll pay for this!

480
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,240
Is this really what you want?
