You didn't expect me
to still be alive, right?

You've been owing me
your life for so long.

It's time to return it to me.

your life would be entangled with mine

- Yes.
- Call the physician.

(Six Half Hall)

110

Here, Sir.

111
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,639

112
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,879
You're so clumsy while pouring tea.

113
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,000
Get lost!

114
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,600
I asked you all to capture Guan Qi.

115
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,039
What happened in the end?

116
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,320
He came to kill me instead.

117
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,159
Also,

118
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:35,600
who asked you to release Wang Xiaoshi?

119
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,519
If you want to capture Wang Xiaoshi,

120
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,799
you can do it with a letter.

121
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,080
The most important thing now
is to kill Guan Qi.

122
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,679
You need Red Sleeve Blade
to kill Guan Qi.

123
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,360
I let Wang Xiaoshi go

124
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,480
so he can bring a message for you.

125
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,919
On this matter,

126
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,559
Su Mengzhen needs to
give you an explanation.

127
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,279
Sir.

128
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,639
No.

129
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,000
Lei.

130
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,919
Guan Qi already came to my residence.

131
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,759
I can't stay
at the Minister's Residence anymore.

132
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,559
I have to stay at another place.

133
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:29,480
I didn't expect

134
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:32,799
Di Feijing to disobey Lei Sun.

135
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,039
Although my life was in danger,

136
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,679
I couldn't really

137
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,039
miss their fight.

138
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,720
Lei Sun can keep Di Feijing

139
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:43,039
so he can dominate the world.

140
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,799
Nothing is more important
than dealing with Guan Qi right now.

141
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,480
Di Feijing is smart.

142
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,399
He knows this.

143
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:52,240
If

144
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,440
Lei Sun is the blade of Six Half Hall,

145
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,799
Di Feijing is the scabbard.

146
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,720
What about House of Sunset Drizzle?

147
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,039
Mengzhen, you are the blade.
I am the scabbard.

148
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:06,759
You are wrong.

149
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,559
You are always doing things on the edge.

150
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,519
How can you be the scabbard?

151
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,720
Both of us are the blades.

152
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,480
As for the scabbard,

153
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:20,679
he is hurt

154
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,960
and is having sweet dreams on the bed.

155
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,759
This paddy

156
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:03,639
blooms in spring, grows in summer,

157
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,399
gets harvested in autumn,
and becomes wilted in winter.

158
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:09,159
That's natural.

159
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,799
Everything in the world is like this.

160
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,279
You are old.

161
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,399
There's no need to force

162
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,720
something you didn't do
when you were young.

163
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,000
Little Rock.

164
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,279
You're awake?

165
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:20,519
How do you feel?

166
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,200
Do you feel unwell?

167
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,080
Why did you hurt your face?

168
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:29,240
It's all because of Fang Yingkan.

169
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,159
He just had to make me
fight a wrestling match

170
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,360
before telling me where you were.

171
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,720

Here.

177

It's just a perfume pouch.

178
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,320
Is that necessary?

179

Yes.

Mengzhen.

235
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,359
He was the one
who set me up to release Guan Qi.

236
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:40,920
No.

237
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,480
This is all a misunderstanding.

238
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,279
Misunderstanding?

239
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,319
The Marquis
caused your injury accidentally.

00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,920
He is here to visit you.

241

Blood River, Red Sleeve,
Silencer, Retainment.

242

This person

243
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,319
is Marquis Shentong, Fang Yingkan.

244
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,240
He is also the only successor
of the Blood River Sword.

245
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,400
You were fooling me around
that night on the roof, right?

246
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,279
It was a misunderstanding.

247
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:06,039
Please calm down.

248
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:06,799
Listen to me.

249
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:09,880
Blood River Sword was
my foster father, Fang Geyin's weapon.

250
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,359
Since I inherited it,

251
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,880
it has been hung
in the hall of my residence.

252
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,519
It has been sealed for years.

253
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:16,519
I really don't know martial arts.

254
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:19,519
Mr. Fang was a warrior
that everyone respected.

255
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:22,279
It is really a pity

256
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,839
if Blood River Sword is lost forever.

257
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:28,400
It's useless of me.

258
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:30,920
Marquis, please take a seat.

259
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:32,920
Please.

260
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,880
Let's talk about the important matter.

261
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,000
Shouldn't you explain the reason

262
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,359
for releasing Guan Qi?

263
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:54,400
It all started with my foster father.

264
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:57,559
My foster father was an enemy
of Youqiao Group.

265
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:59,680
He was harmed after that

266
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,400
and went missing.

267
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,400
I inherited his position
and came to the Capital,

268
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:06,079
but I was being pressured as well.

269
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:08,359
I was living a befuddled life.

270
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,680
I felt aggrieved.

271
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,440
Even if you felt aggrieved,

272
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,200
you shouldn't fool around
with Wang Xiaoshi's life.

273
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:22,160
I apologize to the three of you.

274
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,319
Marquis, let me introduce you.

275
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,480
This is my second brother, Bai Choufei.

276
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,920
He is also the new Vice House Master
of Sunset Drizzle.

277
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,920
It's Sunset Drizzle's Vice House Master.

278
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:40,880
No wonder you look so charming.

279
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,160
Forgive me for my rudeness.

280
00:20:45,173 --> 00:20:47,864
(Freedom)

281
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,880
No wonder

282
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,799
the three of you
are Youqiao Group's enemies.

283
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,079
As far as I know,

284
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,961
the power structure of Youqiao Group
has always been changing.

285
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:57,839
I'm sure all of you know

286
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:01,680
Lei Sun and Fu Zongshu
are the foundations of the power.

287
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,680
They are deeply rooted

288
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,119
with just the two of them.

289
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,880
Even the Feisty Official,
Liu Anshi wasn't spared.

290
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:11,279
There's no one left
who dares to go against them.

291
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,279
I am alone.

292
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,359
I can only depend on Guan Qi
to deal with this mess.

293
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:19,559
Guan Qi used to be Fu Zongshu's aide.

294
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:21,400
He was like today's Lei Sun.

295
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,039
We might find

296
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,640
a breakthrough from Guan Qi.

297
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:27,480
You want to hit Youqiao Group.

298
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,279
I want to do it too.

299
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,400
Why don't we ally with each other?

300
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:34,640
Marquis. People of the
martial arts world are used to freedom.

301
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:37,480
I don't know the
peculiarity of the imperial court.

302
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:38,759
It looks like

303
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:41,039
the House of Sunset Drizzle
won't be able to accept your invitation.

304
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:49,000
All of you talk about freedom.

305
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,759
But in my opinion,

306
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:53,119
there's no such thing as freedom.

307
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,880
Those who have talents and integrity

308
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,400
are being suppressed

309
00:21:58,759 --> 00:21:59,799
and are trapped by their fame.

310
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,599
Those who chase fame

311
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:05,000
seek a higher position

312
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,400
and are trapped by their heart.

313
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,319
Those who are romantic

314
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:12,640
yearn for freedom

315
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:14,240
and are trapped by their emotions.

316
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:15,799
According to you,

317
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,279
there isn't a free man in this world.

318
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:19,119
Of course, there is.

319
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,920
If a person has no talents, integrity,

320
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:22,400
and ambition,

321
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,400
living a muddled life will be freedom.

322
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,160
Stop deceiving people.

323
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:29,160
What you said
is the price to pay for freedom.

324
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:31,359
Everything is difficult.

325
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,759
If you can't even overcome
this bit of difficulty,

326
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:34,880
and you say you don't have freedom,

327
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:36,920
your understanding
of freedom is too shallow.

328
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:38,680
You said you are living a befuddled life

329
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,359
and being pressured.

330
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,559
They are all excuses.

331
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,160
I didn't expect you
to be skilled in martial arts

332
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:47,759
as well as having good comprehension.

333
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:49,359
Thankfully, you are fine.

334
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,039
Otherwise, the martial arts world
would've lost a talent.

335
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:54,880
Shut up.

336
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,519
House Master Su.

337
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,000
Guan Qi is bad.

338
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,799
He can help us
open the door to Youqiao Group.

339
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,680
I've set up the trap.

340
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:10,240
Its success
depends on House of Sunset Drizzle.

341
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,839
Marquis. What you've been saying
has been beneficial to you.

342
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:18,759
In return,
what will House of Sunset Drizzle get?

343
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,400
If Youqiao Group falls,

344
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,240
Six Half Hall will lose their support.

345
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:29,599
They will no longer be great.

346
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,240
The next 30 years
of the martial arts world

347
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,839
will be decided
by House of Sunset Drizzle.

348
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:48,200
Marquis, please rise.

349
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:50,319
We will talk

350
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,960
about the alliance next time.

351
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:55,400
Xiaoshi, send Marquis off.

352
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:03,720
Thank you, House Master Su. Farewell.

353
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,160
Please.

354
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,880
You purposely see me off

355
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,839
because you miss me,

356
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,960
which is impossible.

357
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:36,960
It's because of Wen Rou, right?

358
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,640
You purposely troubled Wen Rou.

359
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:40,839
I'll definitely get you for it.

360
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,360
Sure.

361
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:44,559
How do you want to do it?

362
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,079
With the same method.

363
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,160
I want a wrestling match with you.

364
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:52,200
That's easy.

365
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,720
Come and find me

366
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,119
when you've recovered.

367
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,279
Are you blaming me
for saying something wrong, Mengzhen?

368
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:15,039
Did you say anything wrong?

369
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,519
Considering the benefits
of House of Sunset Drizzle

370
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,720
is the House Master's responsibility

371
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,519
and not the Vice House Master's.

372
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,359
Choufei.

373
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:33,160
Do you know
what type of people I hate the most?

374
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:36,240
Businessman.

375
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:38,920
That's right.

376
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,880
Be good if you're good.
Be evil if you're evil.

377
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:42,839
Separate the good from the bad.

378
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,039
I hate it the most when people try to

379
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,440
please both sides.

380
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,799
I don't mind you

381
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:57,039
speaking on my behalf.

382
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,599
But asking others for benefits

383
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:00,160
is not a righteous act.

384
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,160
It's what a businessman does.

385
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,400
I am a part of the House.

386
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:05,160
I should be fighting for

387
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,200
House of Sunset Drizzle's benefits.

388
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,519
House of Sunset Drizzle

389
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:08,599
doesn't get its reputation

390
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:10,480
from fighting for benefits.

391
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:24,839
Marquis came here
to seek an alliance on the surface.

392
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:27,680
But ever since he set up
Wang Xiaoshi to release Guan Qi,

393
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,799
we were already
being tied to this situation.

394
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,160
What he generously said today

395
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:34,359
was hoping that I won't blame him.

396
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,240
Choufei.

397
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:39,839
Remember.

398
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:41,440
Don't get involved with any officials

399
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,759
and don't rely on support.

400
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,640
This is the rule
of House of Sunset Drizzle.

401
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,759
I understand

402
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:56,440
what you say, Mengzhen.

403
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:14,400
When I met you on the roof that day,

404
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,319
I knew you were extraordinary.

405
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,480
Forgive me for being rude.

406
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:22,839
This lance's name is Blazing River.

407
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,880
When we went to capture Guan Qi,

408
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,640
I brought it along.

409
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,160
I came back alive because of it.

410
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,880
You also knew about Guan Qi?

411
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,400
Far more than that.

412
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:38,440
Many years ago,

413
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,680
the Capital wasn't split between the
Lei family and House of Sunset Drizzle.

414
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:45,960
The largest group
in the martial arts world

415
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:49,200
was Mitian Sect
with Guan Qi as their Holy Master.

416
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:52,599
Mitian Sect worked
with government officials

417
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,519
and bullied
the martial arts world people.

418
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,319
They were not righteous at all.

419
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,000
Especially Guan Qi.

420
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:01,119
He's extremely skilled in martial arts
but also violent and cruel.

421
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,319
Lei Sun gathered every expert
from all the martial arts world sects

422
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,079
to kill this man
who's impossible to be killed.

423
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,119
Many died in that battle.

424
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,200
But in the end,

425
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,640
Lei Sun was the one
who reaped the benefits.

426
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:17,680
He stepped on Guan Qi

427
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:19,720
and expanded Six Half Hall.

428
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:21,839
However, I didn't expect

429
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,519
Guan Qi to still be alive.

430
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,359
He even showed his neck to Lei Sun,

431
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,400
but Lei Sun didn't kill him.

432
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,759
Guan Qi did trouble
the martial arts world in the past.

433
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,240
He is also causing chaos
in the Capital now.

434
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:40,920
He is a big nuisance indeed.

435
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:44,559
Mr. Wo. Did you get your lance

436
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,279
to reenter the martial arts world?

437
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,519
Guan Qi

438
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,799
was supposed

439
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,559
to be dealt with
by people of our generation.

440
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:03,680
But I am old now.

441
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,400
I've retired for many years.

442
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,720
I am just an old man who likes to read

443
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:13,440
and hides his lance on the house beam.

444
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,640
I promised Cha Hua for many years

445
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:20,880
to find a tranquil and beautiful place
to live the rest of our lives.

446
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,319
I don't want to disappoint her.

447
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,200
Mr. Wo.

448
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,079
You've done what you were supposed to.

449
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,839
I was the cause of what Guan Qi did.

450
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,680
Just leave it to us to get rid of him.

451
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,839
Since you are no longer
in the martial arts world,

452
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,880
you should live a peaceful life
with Madam Cha Hua.

453
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,599
The martial arts world has us.

454
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:52,359
Yes.

455
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,480
I am old.

456
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,640
I should leave

457
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,400
the martial arts world matter
to the young people.

458
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,440
Both of you. This way, please.

459
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:01,319
Chief Elder Lei.

460
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,359
Mr. Su. We have arrived.

461
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,119
Minister Fu is here?

462
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,200
This way, please.

463
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,119
I invited both of you

464
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,920
because of Guan Qi.

465
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,559
You need to think of something for me.

466
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,759
Guan Qi escaped from your place.

467
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:49,839
You are responsible for it, right?

468
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,640
Wang Xiaoshi is your subordinate.

469
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,279
You are responsible too, right?

470
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,720
We came here today

471
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:00,440
to solve this trouble for you.

472
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,000
House of Sunset Drizzle
and Six Half Hall

473
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,440
will be gathering our experts

474
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,880
to suppress and kill Guan Qi.

475
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:08,400
Really?

476
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:09,880
When?

477
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,359
As long as you approve,

478
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,319
we can do it any time.

479
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,359
Of course. Hurry up.

480
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:16,880
That's enough.

481
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:19,799
Guan Qi is extremely skilled.

482
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,880
No one can find him when he is hiding.

483
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,119
So,

484
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,519
we want to use you as the bait.

485
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,000
Me?

486
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,559
You must be crazy.

487
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:29,599
That's impossible.

488
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,920
It's your idea, right?

489
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,720
Did the both of you come up with this
to make me look like a fool?

490
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,920
Sir, we dare not.

491
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:41,799
This...

492
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,759
We only have this choice now.

493
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:45,480
Nonsense.

494
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:47,240
I won't be going anywhere.

495
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:48,359
I'll be staying here.

496
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:49,640
I'm telling you.

497
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:51,039
If you can't find him,

498
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,319
he won't find me as well.

499
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:53,960
Let's see who can live longer.

500
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,200
Sir, this is a good place

501
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,680
but it's way comfortable out there.

502
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,960
The only way now is to act swiftly

503
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:03,200
so you can be relieved soon.

504
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,640
Go... Go back for now.

505
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,640
Let me think about this first.

506
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,880
House Master Su.

507
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:16,400
Chief Elder Lei.

508
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:31,039
I say.

509
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,519
Didn't I ask you two to leave?

510
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,279
My illness came back. I can't walk.

511
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,519
Chief Elder Lei.

512
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,640
Let's just sit here
and wait for Minister Fu's decision.

513
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,880
Sure.

514
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:45,319
I...

515
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,240
Get me a cup of tea.

516
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:56,839
What are you doing?

517
00:33:58,799 --> 00:33:59,599
Pouring him tea.

518
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,599
You...

519
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,360
Chief Elder Lei. Here.

520
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,400
Thank you.

521
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:19,920
House Master Su.

522
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,039
Madam. You should eat.

523
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,440
He didn't come for three days again.

524
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,280
I wonder why he is so busy.

525
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,239
Boil a pigeon soup tomorrow

526
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:13,800
and get someone to deliver it.

527
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,599
Ask him what's going on.

528
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,840
The last time he didn't come
for three days,

529
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,239
you didn't eat for three days.

530
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:21,440
What will you do
if you get sick from starvation?

531
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:25,199
Is it Minister Fu?

532
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,239
Go and have a look.

533
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:26,840
Yes.

534
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:40,800
Yue.

535
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:45,480
Yue.

536
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,079
Yue, what's wrong?

537
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:49,519
Is it Minister Fu?

538
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,639
Yue.

539
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,679
Move!

540
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:25,599
Move!

541
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:30,159
Move!

542
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:30,960
Stand aside!

543
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,119
What's going on?

544
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,119
There are so many soldiers.

545
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,880
I heard that a mad man

546
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
captured Fu Zongshu's concubine.

547
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,519
He also killed many soldiers.

548
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:47,079
It's not safe recently.

549
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:48,599
We should go out less.

550
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:50,840
Yes. We shouldn't walk around.

551
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:51,719
Let's go back.

552
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:52,239
Let's go.

553
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:52,800
We should leave.

554
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,320
If I don't let you go,

555
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,880
you won't feel at ease

556
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
for the rest of your life.

557
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,280
If you don't feel at ease,

558
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:31,639
my life

559
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,119
will be meaningless.

560
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,039
I promise you

561
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,079
to come back alive.

562
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:03,119
Fu Zongshu!

563
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,760
Darn...

564
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,280
Darn you!

565
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,119
Fu Zongshu!

566
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:15,840
Darn you!

567
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
You are not shouting it correctly.

568
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,320
Let me show you.

569
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:30,960
Listen carefully.

570
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:35,360
Fu Zongshu!

571
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,119
Darn you!

572
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,039
Your mistress is dying soon!

573
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,239
Why aren't you coming out?

574
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,079
Do you understand?

575
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,960
I'll shout.

576
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,599
Shout!

577
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,639
Fu Zongshu! Darn you!

578
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,559
Your mistress is dying soon!
Why aren't you coming out?

579
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,400
Fu Zongshu!

580
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:00,960
Darn you!

581
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,079
Your mistress is dying soon!
Why aren't you coming out?

582
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:06,119
Fu Zongshu!

583
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,840
Your mistress is dying soon!
Why aren't you coming out?

584
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:12,960
Fu Zongshu!

585
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:14,679
Darn you!

586
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:16,800
Why aren't you coming out?

587
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,920
Hurry up and save me!

588
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,119
Save me!

589
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:26,400
Save me.

590
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,679
Guan Qi!

591
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:42,519
Old man.

592
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:45,480
You look familiar.

593
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:49,400
Look carefully.

594
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:04,119
Blazing River Lance?

595
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:07,119
That's right.

596
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,840
Remember my face.

597
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,480
Find me to get your revenge

598
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:12,239
in your next life.

599
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:15,639
Do you think you can stop me?
