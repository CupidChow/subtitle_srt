(Shili Pavilion)

33
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,719
You've hidden the blade half of your life.

34
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:56,680
Sure enough, Chief Elder Lei
you don't give up that easily.

35
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,080
You even used your daughter.

36
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,360
I had no choice either.

37
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,039
Someone gave me the idea

38
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:09,400
to kill you if I want to survive.

39
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,800
Even if you succeed,

40
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:16,120
are you sure Youqiao Group
will let you off the hook?

41
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,800
Are you saying

42
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,759
I have no way to live anymore?

43
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,639
You do.

44
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:26,039
We can join hands
to bring Youqiao Group down.

45
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,919
That's the real way to survive.

46
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,840
Others don't give you the means
to survive in the martial arts world,

47
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:35,960
but your blade.

48
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,639
Kill them?

49
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,879
They're beyond my reach.

50
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,360
It's easier to kill you.

51
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,613

52
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,399
Wen Rou?

53
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,639
Is anyone out there? Open this door!

54
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,279
Let me go! Let me go!

55
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,720
I'm the Young Lady of the Six Half Hall.

56
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,600
If you touch us,

57
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,839
I'll kill you!

58
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,600
Let go.

59
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:12,920
Let her go!

60
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,120
It's nothing to be proud of bullying a young lady.

61
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,959
Wen Rou!

62
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,519
Wen Rou!

63
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,079
Wen Rou!

64
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:39,320
Wen Rou.

65
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,399

Wen Rou!

69
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,720
Chun, are you all right?

70
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,519
Don't come near me.

71
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,039
Chun.

72
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:06,440
Go to Shili Pavilion outside the Capital

73
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,120
to save Su Mengzhen.

74
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,840
What did you say?

75
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,759
Go to Shili Pavilion outside the Capital

76
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:13,919
to save Su Mengzhen! Go now!

77
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,159
Protect Wen Rou and Lei Chun!

78
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,360
They're in the alley!

79
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,480
Hurry!

80
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:55,399
It's disgraceful

81
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,440
to kill Mengzhen sneakily.

82
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,399
Chief Elder Lei,
you have no chance of winning now.

83
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,879
Just fall back and leave the Capital.

84
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:09,120
How can I leave after being
a martial artist for half of my life?

00:12:06,954 --> 00:12:08,243
(Shili Pavilion)

86
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,159
First Elder Di, what's the meaning of this?

87
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,279
If we fail to kill Mr. Su tonight,

88
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,039
Youqiao Group won't let us go.

89
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,240
I can only sacrifice Chief Elder

90
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,320
to protect the Six Half Hall.

91
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:05,679
I promised not to let her father die.

92
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,679
If you return like this,

93
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,279
no one at the Hall will be happy with you.

94
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,679
I'll try my best.

95
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,799
When the matter has ended,

96
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,360
I hope you can expose everything

97
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,879
about Youqiao Group.

98
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:30,279
Even if you don't come to me,

99
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,240
I'll surely come to you.

100
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:36,840
Let's go.

101
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,919
Chun, I'm coming in.

102
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:35,159
Chun, wear my clothes.

103
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,440
Chun.

104
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:53,120
Don't tell anyone

105
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,480
about what happened tonight.

106
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,759
Pretend nothing happened.

107
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,159
But that person...

108
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:04,200
Nothing happened!

109
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:07,519
Pretend

110
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,039
I was bitten by a dog.

111
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,640
(Chun)

112
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,079
Hurry, drink this medicinal concoction.

113
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,160
Your health has already deteriorated.

114
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,839
Just stay at the House

115
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:37,799
and take proper rest for several days.

116
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,759
Don't go anywhere.

117
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,480
The House of Sunset Drizzle's plan
is to take down the Six Half Hall.

118
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,480
Martial artists who pay attention to this fight

119
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,599
will show up tonight.

120
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:49,200
I can take it.

121
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,680
Besides,

122
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:56,319
we still have one important guest.

123
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,599
I can never stop you
from doing what you've decided.

124
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,839
To you,

125
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:10,039
everything else is more important than your life.

126
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,960
You already know this.

127
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,400
Where are you going again?

128
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:23,039
I'll have to face

129
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,279

Thank you.

144
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:42,160
The House Master will visit you a bit later.

145
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,160
What about Wang Xiaoshi and Bai Choufei?

146
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,799
The House Master,
Vice House Master Bai, and Mr. Wang

147
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:47,920
have returned.

148
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,839
They're well.

149
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:52,160
May I ask

150
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:55,680
if House Master Su
mentioned anything about last night?

151
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,400
Well...

152
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,680
Please tell me.

153
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,920
I heard Chief Elder Lei is dead.

154
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,279
I won't be in your way, then.

155
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:22,319
Wait.

156
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:25,240
What about Di Feijing?

157
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,759
Di Feijing is alive.

158
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,440
I heard he switched sides

159
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,559
and gave Chief Elder Lei a palm strike.

160
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:33,599
There were land mines buried under the pavilion.

161
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,319
Chief Elder Lei was blown up...

162
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,839
No one can find his body.

163
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,759
I'll excuse myself.

164
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:48,960
Chun.

165
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,680
Wen Rou,

166
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,920
I want to be alone.

167
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,680
Madam, the Chief Elder, and you

168
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:26,160
are my family.

169
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,759
If the martial arts world
is destined to be turbulent,

170
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,680
I will die

171
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:33,519
to protect my family.

172
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,240
That

173
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:39,079
is my small wish.

174
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:47,240
Chun, remember.

175
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:49,640
As long as I'm alive,

176
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:51,920
no one from the Lei family will die.

177
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:55,160
This is my life promise.

178
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:11,880
We've kept watch all night.

179
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,119
Are you all right?

180
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,799
Who on earth is that?

181
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:17,039
Did you see what he looks like?

182
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:17,920
What did he do to you?

183
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,680
Are you hurt?

184
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,680
No, we're fine.

185
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,160
Luckily, you came in time. We're fine.

186
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:31,000
How's Lei Chun doing now?

187
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:34,319
She didn't sleep all night,

188
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,839
and she only falls asleep now.

189
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Wen Rou,

190
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,720
I can feel something's wrong.

191
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,039
Can you be honest with me?

192
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:47,720
You look like...

193
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,799
I'm fine.

194
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:53,640
I'm just worried about Chun.

195
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,799
She just heard that her father is dead.

196
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:59,559
She is supposed to be the saddest one.

197
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,720
Yet, she still comforts me.

198
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:04,039
Since yesterday,

199
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,079
she didn't shed a tear.

200
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,920
I'm worried to see her enduring it like this.

201
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,359
Lei Sun wanted to kill Mengzhen.

202
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:17,000
We knew this day will come.

203
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:18,720
As her friends,

204
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,400
we can only keep her company.

205
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,000
But it's up to her

206
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:27,000
to overcome it.

207
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,039
Do you think I won't kill you

208
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,319
no matter what you did?

209
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,039
It's my fault to make the decision arbitrarily.

210
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:53,680
You can hit and punish me as you like.

211
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,400
It's not your place to decide in my stead.

212
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,160
Chief Elder,

213
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,799
the Youqiao Group wouldn't let you go

214
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,759
even if you had killed Su Mengzhen!

215
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,119
The only way to escape
is to pretend that you're dead!

216
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:04,160
Escape?

217
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:07,200
They have the world in their grasp.

218
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,119
Where can I run to?
Tell me where I can go!

219
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,119
Change your name and disguise yourself.

220
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,000
We'll go as far as we can go.

221
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,799
There are not many martial artists

222
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,480
who can kill you.

223
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,960
I'll always be by your side.

224
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,240
No matter who comes after you,

225
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,960
I'll protect you.

226
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,319
I'll kill as many as they come.

227
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,440
I'll kill until they don't dare to come

228
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:33,079
and stop searching for you!

229
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,160
I'm livid.

230
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:46,440
Are you trying to anger me to death
because I didn't die from the explosion?

231
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,880
Why should I change my name?

232
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,680
Why should I live in disgrace?

233
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:53,759
For Chun!

234
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,079
Even if we have to change our names

235
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:01,480
and live in disgrace,

236
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,279
Chun will still have a father and a family

237
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:07,119
as long as you live.

238
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,000
Chief Elder, head to Yangzhou first.

239
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:14,519
After this matter is over,

240
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:16,559
I'll bring Chun here.

241
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,680
Is this Beiying Forest?

242
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:26,480
It should be.

243
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,920
This is Lei Zhenlei's resting place.

244
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,599
It was my seventh year in the Capital.

245
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,319
At that time, the Six Half Hall

246
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,920
was still a branch of the Jiangnan Pili Sect.

247
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,440
Leader Lei Zhenlei wanted
to come to the Capital to see me.

248
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:00,160
I was worried he'd divide my power.

249
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:04,039
So I plotted his death.

250
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:08,839
It was raining heavily

251
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,519
that night.

252
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,920
I tried to bury him,

253
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:19,799
but I couldn't.

254
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,079
The rain kept washing the dirt away.

255
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,839
I watched his lifeless face

256
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:31,960
staring at me.

257
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:37,440
I stayed with him all night.

258
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,400
I only left the next day

259
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:46,039
after I managed to bury him.

260
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,440
Martial artists say

261
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:14,119
to find Di Feijing if you have no friends,

262
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:19,319
or if you have no one to understand you.

263
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:22,000
Once you've found Di Feijing,

264
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:25,400
he'll be your friend and your confidant.

265
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,839
Do you really treat everyone that nicely?

266
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:35,480
I'm sure

267
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,359
there's something that you prioritize.

268
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:41,960
Be honest with me.

269
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,960
After all these years,

270
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:49,319
are you protecting me, the Six Half Hall,

271
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:50,720
or Chun?

272
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,799
Which of these three

273
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,440
is the most important?

274
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:57,279
Chun's safety is more important

275
00:29:58,319 --> 00:29:59,319
than everything.

276
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,160
You kept defying my orders.

277
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,880
I won't believe it
if you tell me you're protecting me.

278
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:24,359
No matter how magnificent the Six Half Hall is,

279
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,240
it's only an object.

280
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:29,440
I won't believe it if you say
you're protecting it either.

281
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:31,720
But I believe you

282
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,759
when it's protecting Chun.

283
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,559
That's more than enough.

284
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:49,200
Lei Zhenlei gave me
his last words before he died.

285
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:53,000
He said since I've come this far,

286
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,160
I must not lose.

287
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,960
Once I lose,

288
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,480
everyone I killed would die in vain.

289
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:06,079
I've killed so many people

290
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:07,319
for the position I have today.

291
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,119
If I lose and leave,

292
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,160
their deaths, my efforts,

293
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,400
and my life will be in vain!

294
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,720
Chief Elder!

295
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,839
Don't try to stop me!

296
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:22,279
Don't follow me either.

297
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,279
Remember what you said.

298
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,960
Protect Chun!

299
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:52,960
Don't be scared.

300
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,279
Come.

301
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,559
Eat it.

302
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,119
We'll reach home
once you've finished eating.

303
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,880
I protect you

304
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,359
because I see you as my father.

305
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:10,280
I'll hold a feast
at Across The Sea Hall tonight.

306
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,480
I'll invite all the martial artists to have a drink.

307
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:17,400
You're not someone who likes to make a display.

308
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,400
Is there any other purpose for this feast?

309
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:23,639
Speaking of the guests,

310
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,199
some are good at forming associations,

311
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:26,639
and some are good at trading.

312
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:28,800
But they all have one thing in common.

313
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,760
They're used to setbacks
in the martial arts world.

314
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,440
So they know when to follow with the flow.

315
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,039
Some of them
originally support the Six Half Hall,

316
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,079
while some support the House of Sunset Drizzle.

317
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,679
We're waiting to see a new phase

318
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,519
in tonight's gathering.

319
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,000
You may put it that way.

320
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:47,199
But we must enjoy this liquor.

321
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,960
It was only last night that
we engaged in a huge fight.

322
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:51,920
You must at least rest for two days.

323
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:52,800
Otherwise, your health

324
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,079
won't be able to take it.

325
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,360
I'm not as healthy as before.

326
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,039
But my blood is still warm.

327
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:00,119
So we must enjoy the liquor while it's still warm.

328
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,800
Since you've decided,

329
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,400
we'll hold this feast.

330
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,880
The fight at Shili Pavilion has spread

331
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,079
throughout the martial arts world.

332
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:10,039
Those who watched on the sidelines
may have ill intentions.

333
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,000
They were watching us fight

334
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,280
to our doom.

335
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:15,000
We can use this opportunity

336
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,079
to show them

337
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:17,679
the capabilities of the House of Sunset Drizzle.

338
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,679
You're right.

339
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:22,199
There can only be peace

340
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,559
when the Six Half Hall completely surrenders.

341
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,480
We must increase our precautions.

342
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:29,760
It may not be just those Elders who'll come.

343
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,920
I don't believe Di Feijing would betray Lei Sun

344
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:35,559
or that Lei Sun is dead.

345
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,840
Chief Elder?

346
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:25,679
I knew you wouldn't die that easily.

347
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,840
Yes, I'm still alive.

348
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,519
But to live helplessly in secret,

349
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:34,440
my whole life is

350
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,320
no different from being dead.

351
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,760
Where's my coffin?

352
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:41,239
This is the one.

353
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,440
I've prepared one for myself too.

354
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:45,079
It's right behind.

355
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,960
I have no one to protect, so I prepared one.

356
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:50,480
No matter what you're planning to do,

357
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,880
count me in.

358
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:56,800
Summon all the Elders in the Capital.

359
00:36:58,199 --> 00:36:59,519
Carry this coffin

360
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:02,800
as a gift to Mr. Su.

361
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,519
Yes.

362
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,519
So they say,

363
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,239
in a flurry of white and red,

364
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,840
the Red Sleeve Blade cuts at the speed of light.

365
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:25,719
This fight

366
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,480
released such huge power

367
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,880
that caused huge waves in Jing Lake.

368
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,880
The perfect Shili Pavilion

369
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,679
was blown up into nothing.

370
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:45,519
The pitiful Lei Sun died on the spot.

371
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,280
After dominating
the martial arts world for many years,

372
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,679
he still can't escape

373
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:51,159
his fate.

374
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,519
Humans

375
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:54,360
can't escape from being old.

376
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,920
Moreover,

377
00:37:56,119 --> 00:37:59,000
it's the greatest red-sleeved swordsman
we're talking about.

378
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,239
But I heard

379
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:04,920
Lei Sun didn't die in his hand.

380
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:07,639
There was a traitor in the Six Half Hall.

381
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,000
He was betrayed.

382
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:12,519
I also heard

383
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:16,639
the House of Sunset Drizzle is holding a feast

384
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,800
to celebrate at Across The Sea Hall.

385
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,360
If this is the case,

386
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:22,519
the Six Half Hall has fallen.

387
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:24,199
Let's drink up.

388
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:25,239
Drink up.

389
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:26,159
Cheers.

390
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,719
I didn't expect to see you here.

391
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,000
Chief Elder has returned.

392
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,760
He's summoning all Elders

393
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,519
to meet at dusk today.

394
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:56,000
He's still alive?

395
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:57,840
He won't die that easily.

396
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Six Half Hall won't fall that easily either.

397
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,000
Come back with me.

398
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,639
Chief Elder is waiting for everyone.

399
00:39:16,622 --> 00:39:19,700
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

400
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:54,393
(Six Half Hall)

401
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:20,880
Congratulations!

402
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,559
Congratulations.

403
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:22,559
- This way, please.
- Congratulations.

404
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:23,280
Congratulations.

405
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,239
You're all here.

406
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:25,880
This way, please.

407
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,480
Mr. Yang, congratulations!

408
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,000
Congratulations.

409
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,960
Same to you. This way, please.

410
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,079
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

411
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,960
The House Master Su's Red Sleeve Blade

412
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:38,679
can even defeat Lei Sun.

413
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:40,199
He's truly capable.

414
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,519
After fighting for power
in the Capital for so many years,

415
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,320
the situation is going to change from now on.

416
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:49,320
The House of Sunset Drizzle
of this generation

417
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:50,639
is strong and capable.

418
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,519
It looks like they're going
to unite the martial arts world.

419
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,000
Congratulations, House Master Su!

420
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:11,880
Thank you for coming.

421
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:14,320
From today on, the House of Sunset Drizzle

422
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,199
will be in the same boat as you.

423
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,159
We hope to get your full support.

424
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:22,800
A toast to all of you here.

425
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,719
Cheers!

426
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:24,760
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

427
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:31,599
Please enjoy yourselves.

428
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,239
Drink to your heart's content.

429
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:35,920
All right!

430
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,840
Drink to your heart's content!

431
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,920
All right!

432
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,760
- Let's drink.
- Drink until you drop.

433
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,679
Let's drink.

434
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:41,519
House Master Su, cheers.

435
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,480
I'm Geng Yun, the Elder of Zishan Hall.

436
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:44,960
I'm Wang Shen, the Elder of Liuyun Hall.

437
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:46,199
We're here to drink to you.

438
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,719
Have a drink.

439
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:49,199
Let's drink up.

440
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,519
Drink up.

441
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:57,280
What do you think about this feast?

442
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,519
I'm happy for Mengzhen.

443
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,199
It was only yesterday that
Mengzhen was the dragon in the field.

444
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:08,880
Today, the dragon is flying in the sky.

445
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,480
He's the hero of this age.

446
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:14,000
I want to be like him too.

447
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,000
When Cao Cao shared
his thoughts about heroes,

448
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:23,880
he said, heroes are those

449
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
who have big ambitions,

450
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:28,440
excellent strategies, high wisdom,

451
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:30,280
and bear the poise of a ruler.

452
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,519
Many people think

453
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,679
being strong and domineering are heroes.

454
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,000
But I think

455
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,000
most heroes can take temporary setbacks.

456
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,440
They're brave, clever,

457
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,760
far-sighted, and adaptable
to different situations.

458
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:47,719
When the turbulence is surging,

459
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,239
they still look forward to life
after being defeated.

460
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,360
Only the wise can see through

461
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,800
the meaning of the world.

462
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Only the sage can see through himself.

463
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,480
You're extraordinary
to be able to see through both.

464
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:03,840
But I think otherwise.

465
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:05,719
I don't want to see through them.

466
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,760
A man must not be powerless.

467
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,119
I'll only be happy if I have power

468
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,800
and suffer if I lose it.

469
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:15,280
Even if fortune
and glory are unpredictable,

470
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:16,960
I still want to possess them.

471
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,519
My life would be worth it this way.

472
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:21,119
Being ambitious may not be a bad thing.

473
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,000
But one must not force or rush it.

474
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:26,400
Otherwise, I fear

475
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:28,920
it'll bring more misfortunes than blessings.

476
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,960
I don't care about either.

477
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:33,119
The most important thing is to be happy

478
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,480
and to follow your heart.

479
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:36,199
Don't ever make things difficult for yourself.

480
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:43,199
You subdued the Five Warriors

481
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,199
and defeated Lei Sun.

482
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,199
It's only a matter of time

483
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,360
for your reputation
to spread around the world.

484
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,400
A matter of time.

485
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,079
I really hope that day will come sooner.

486
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:56,199
But you're also involved in the fights.

487
00:43:56,599 --> 00:43:58,599
Don't you want to be a famous hero?

488
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:01,960
It doesn't matter if I become a hero.

489
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:03,639
In any case,

490
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,320
all of you want to be a hero now.

491
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:08,880
Then I'll just be the one
who creates the path for you.

492
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:14,760
A gift from Marquis Shentong
has arrived!

493
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,320
My master couldn't make it in person.

494
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,800
So he sent me to deliver this screen,

495
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,400
the Golden Sky Dragon Jade.

496
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:49,159
House Master Su, congratulations
on unifying the martial arts world.

497
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:53,079
The Marquis thinks too highly of me.

498
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,920
With this screen, I can sleep without worry.

499
00:44:56,039 --> 00:44:57,639
Send my thanks to the Marquis.

500
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:00,960
A gift from the Six Half Hall has arrived!

501
00:46:31,744 --> 00:46:35,301
♪With whom do I visit this restaurant?♪

502
00:46:35,541 --> 00:46:39,101

503
00:46:39,987 --> 00:46:43,549
