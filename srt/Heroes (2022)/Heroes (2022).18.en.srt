What?

35
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,560
Uncle.

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,719
Uncle.

37
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:45,400
That's right.

38
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:55,879
You cannot destroy me,
and I cannot destroy you.

39
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,599
Since your son is back,

40
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,120
why don't we arrange a marriage

41
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,680
for your son and my daughter

42
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,400
in exchange for a decade of peace?

43
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,000
We can also free up our hands
and deal with the Mitian Sect.

44
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,280
We old folks are discussing

45
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,719
the trade of our children, huh?

46
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,639
Ever since we roamed the martial arts
world with a blade in our hands,

47
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,840
the lives of our families

48
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,400
are strapped onto the handle itself.

49
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,919
Our fate and our children's fate

50
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,120
are inseparable.

51
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,599
You may be able
to decide for your daughter.

52
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,960
But I cannot decide for my son.

53
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,680
Aren't the marriages of our children

54
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,039
decided by us all along?

55
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:41,680
A marriage alliance between our children

56
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:44,080
so that we can bury the hatchet, huh?

57
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,759
Keep them safe. Take care.

58
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,319
You were coughing so violently just now.

59
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,680
You should have some dried fruits.

60
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,040
Miss Lei.

61
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,879
What are you guys trying to do?

62
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,879
You should blame yourself
for being born into the Lei Family.

63
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,759
Follow us.

64
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,839
We're the Mitian Sect.

65
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,399
Scram if you don't want to die.

66
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,839
If the Mitian Sect wants to ruin
the negotiation between the two sects,

67
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,120
you can capture me.

68
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,639
If you capture a little girl like her,

69
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,000
the reputation of your sect
will be jeopardized.

70
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,680
Take me and let her go.

71
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,040
Don't be scared.

72
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,279
Just wait for my return.

73
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,920
Tie him up!

74
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,519
You are clearly skilled
in martial arts.

75
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,360
Why did you let them take you away?

76
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,800
It's because I don't want you
to see any bloodshed.

77
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,399
Father said

78
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,759
that when a person roams the martial
arts world with a blade in his hand,

79
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,800
the lives of his family are
strapped onto the handle itself.

80
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,360
Bloodshed is unavoidable.

81
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:42,759
Your father is wrong.

82
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,279
We wield blades to protect people.

83
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,360
If we can't even protect our family,

84
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,959
there's no need to roam the world
with a blade in our hand.

85
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,399
What's the name of your blade?

86
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,839
Red Sleeve Blade.

87
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,120
You're excellent at wielding blades.

88
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,959
You will surely make a name
for yourself in the future.

89
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,639
Why don't you call yourself
Su Mengzhen, the Greatest Swordsman?

90
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,079
That's great.

91
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,319
I love a high-profile name as such.

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,800
(So, she bought my paintings)

94
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,639
(not because she liked them.)

95
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,480
(It was because of Su Mengzhen.)

96
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,120
Choufei?

97
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,279
Mengzhen.

98
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,519
This is where I keep the paintings.

99
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The wind is pretty strong.

100
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,720
I came here to see
if the windows were shut.

101
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,160
You can ask the servants to do that.

102
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,559
I can leave everything else
to the servants.

103
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,759
However, this place is like
a sanctuary to my heart.

104
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:38,440
I don't want people entering at will.

105
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,080
But you're different.

106
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,360
You can come here whenever you like.

107
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,840
Mengzhen, since this is your sanctuary,

108
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,039
I shouldn't stay here.

(Second Year of Song-Yuan,

Bai Youjin.

111
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,200
She didn't like my paintings
because of me.

112
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,200
She didn't ask me out
because of me either.

113
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,000
I was wrong.

114
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,559
I was entirely wrong.

115
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,200
Do you know?

116
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,320
The person she likes is Mengzhen.

117
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,200
It's Su Mengzhen.

118
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,080
I know.

119
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,120
I knew that Mengzhen
and the Young Lady of the Six Half Hall

120
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,240
were engaged since young.

121
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,080
However, I never expected

122
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,519
Tian Chun, whom we met at the riverside,

123
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,759
to be Lei Chun.

124
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,519
However, it was
because of that encounter

125
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,240
that I was unable to forget about her.

126
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:18,440
Bai,

127
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,919
I know you're not willing
to lose in any circumstances.

128
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,720
I know you'll do anything

129
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,440
to obtain the things you want.

130
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:27,919
But I think you can't force it

131
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,919
when it comes to a relationship.

132
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,440
That's right.

133
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,759
Relationships can't be forced.

134
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,240
Some women can only be touched once

135
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,200
in their entire lives.

136
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:47,679
You're right.

137
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,360
What are you saying?

138
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,120
Look at the state he's in right now.

139
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:52,799
His face looks disappointed.

140
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,960
His heart is disappointed too.

141
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,720
He only thinks
about disappointing things.

142
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:57,200
How could you agree with him?

143
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,480
Women deserved
to be touched every single day.

144
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,200
Once isn't enough.

145
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,639
You do make a good point.

146
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,120
So, according to you,

147
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,039
I can touch her heart once every day?

148
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:16,000
Can I succeed if I persevere?

00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,519
(Li's Candies)
get me some of the dried fruits

167
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,759
that Miss Lei prefers.

168
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:02,840
All right.

169
00:13:24,841 --> 00:13:31,240
♪Longing for it all your life, yet
not getting it in the end, so helpless♪

170
00:13:31,716 --> 00:13:37,720
♪Regretting my actions and coming
to terms with it after that, so helpless♪

171
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:45,320
♪Sighing this morning,
singing on the next, so helpless♪

172
00:13:45,771 --> 00:13:52,138
♪When will the bright moon shine on me?♪

173
00:13:52,622 --> 00:13:56,640
♪When will the bright moon shine on me?♪

174
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,280
(Pobanmen)

175
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,440
The liquor is on the table,
but the blade is in your hands.

176
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,639
Chief Elder Lei, did you call me here

177
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:41,440
to catch up with me?
Or are you here to kill?

178
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:45,720
To kill?

179
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,639
I think that's fine too.

180
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,639
Who are you trying to kill then?

181
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,679
Of course it's you.

182
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,679
If so, Chief Elder Lei,
you don't need to get your hands dirty.

183
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,679
I am but a mere good-for-nothing.

184
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,519
I'm not hindering you, am I?

185
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,759
Why are you still pretending?

186
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,120
Only you and I knew

187
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,639
that Guan Qi was still alive.

188
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,519
Marquis,

189
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,360
you've landed me in trouble
after you helped Guan Qi escape.

190
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,159
What?

191
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,679
Were you unhappy?

192
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,320
Chief Elder Lei, since
you've already known about it,

193
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:17,039
I guess I no longer need to pretend.

194
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:20,679
Every drinking session
in the world is the same.

195
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,399
When someone drinks,

196
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,080
someone else must stand and serve.

197
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,240
What if you have to
serve people non-stop?

198
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,759
Chief Elder Lei,

199
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:31,360
do you think you'll be happy about that?

200
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,399
The number of seats
in a drinking session

201
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:36,840
is already determined.

202
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,279
If you want to sit down,
you have to push someone off.

203
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:40,960
Let me ask you this then.

204
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:44,360
Who's willing to be pushed off
from their seats?

205
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,759
I've already given you
a chance before this.

206
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:50,440
It was at Pobanmen.

207
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,720
But you didn't turn up.

208
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,639
If you had killed Su Mengzhen back then,

209
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:57,919
people would have given you a seat

210
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,840
even if you didn't beg for one.

211
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,120
But now,

212
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:04,679
I suggest you try nothing funny.

213
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,840
I don't care what you're up to.

214
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,679
However, you better don't do anything
to the Six Half Hall.

215
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:14,480
If not, I'll report
what you had done to the higher-ups,

216
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,159
and you would have suffered
for nothing all these years, Marquis.

217
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,639
To live as a good-for-nothing

218
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,240
is at least better than dying, right?

219
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,039
Marquis, I believe

220
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,879
you know that the best.

221
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,759
On account
of your status as the Marquis,

222
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:41,519
I will pour you a cup of liquor.

223
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,000
Regarding what I said today,

224
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,279
you must heed them.

225
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,600
You must drink the liquor

226
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,759
that I poured too.

227
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,360
Your kind words

228
00:16:58,799 --> 00:16:59,919
and the liquor

229
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:02,039
sound warm to the ear

230
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,359
but scorching to the heart.

231
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:13,039
Chief Elder Lei, I will heed

232
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,039
your kind advice.

233
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:15,200
Farewell.

234
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:16,880
See yourself off.

235
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,160
First Elder Di.

236
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,960
Marquis.

237
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:52,039
He's an exceptional martial artist,

238
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:54,599
but he feigned madness and acted
like a fool for almost two decades.

239
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:57,640
He's truly a lunatic.

240
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,160
If there were someone

241
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:01,440
I would not like to be with alone,

242
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,440
he'd definitely be included.

243
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,039
Do you know

244
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,960
why the martial arts world
is restless lately?

245
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:12,839
One of the main reasons

246
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,240
is that he's trying
to climb up the ranks.

247
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,759
However, you know
the number of seats available

248
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:19,720
in Youqiao Group.

249
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:22,799
If he wants to climb up the rank,
he has to push someone down.

250
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,440
It's either me or Fu Zongshu.

251
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,200
If possible,

252
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:28,519
I want to get rid of him.

253
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,960
Even though the incident
with Marquis could be resolved,

254
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,480
there's another incident.

255
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,759
House of Sunset Drizzle's Messenger
Pigeon Group has been active lately.

256
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:38,079
It seems like

257
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,200
they're trying
to find something in the Capital.

258
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,599
They must be trying
to find our workshop.

259
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,400
Although Guan Qi is already dead,

260
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,000
if the House of Sunset Drizzle

261
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,400
is still up to something,

262
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,119
that means

263
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:55,640
Guan Qi had said something
he shouldn't before his death.

264
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,039
Chief Elder,

265
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:59,839
I think we should deliver
all the goods at once.

266
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,319
Lei Mei is going to return soon.

267
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:09,519
Go and receive her.

268
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:11,160
See if she did

269
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,400
bring back the Five Warriors
of Pili Sect.

270
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,319
If it's true,

271
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,920
we can still maintain the status quo

272
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:20,119
with the House of Sunset Drizzle.

273
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,160
Yes, I will go immediately.

274
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,640
Greetings, First Elder.

275
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,279
Where's Third Elder?

276
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:46,160
Third Elder has already
entered the Capital.

277
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,920
She said First Elder Di

278
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,240
will come and verify our identities.

279
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,279
First Elder Di, what do you think?

280
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:57,799
I welcome the five of you

281
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,400
on Six Half Hall's behalf.

282
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:01,759
Thank you, First Elder Di.

283
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:16,759
Third Elder.

284
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:18,160
Is Chief Elder around?

285
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,559
Chief Elder is waiting for you.

286
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,240
More to the left.

287
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,839
Here.

288
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,160
Chief Elder,

289
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:37,160
I brought back the people you asked for.

290
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:39,920
Over here.

291
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:41,079
Lower.

292
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,839
You did bring them back.

293
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,240
However,

294
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,559
I heard that you created some trouble

295
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:48,119
for Di Feijing at Xiaojie Bridge
outside of the Capital.

296
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,039
I did bring
some trouble for First Elder.

297
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:53,759
However, Chief Elder,
I got rid of a huge trouble for you.

298
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,119
It's okay now.

299
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,000
Tell me about it.

300
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,640
The Five Warriors of Pili Sect
are famous in the martial arts world.

301
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,240
However, not many people

302
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,920
have witnessed their skills in person.

303
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,880
I was trying to test their skills

304
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,920
on our way back.

305
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:14,160
However, they don't care to act

306
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,759
against thugs and hooligans.

307
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:19,680
They were only interested
when I told them that First Elder Di

308
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:21,519
was at Xiaojie Bridge.

309
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,920
I wasn't testing First Elder Di.

310
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,160
I was testing the five of them
using First Elder Di's power.

311
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,799
Besides,

312
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:35,519
Chief Elder, you will only believe

313
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:37,400
that the five people I've brought here

314
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,599
are the five people you were looking for

315
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,400
after I test their skills.

316
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,839
You have a silver tongue indeed.

317
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,079
Do you really think

318
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,200
that I don't know what you're up to?

319
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:56,519
You need to remember this.

320
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,400
Under my rule, Di Feijing

321
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,160
will always be my top subordinate
in the Six Half Hall.

322
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,079
That fact will never change
until my death.

323
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:04,599
Whether you're capable enough

324
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:06,720
to become my second-best subordinate
after Di Feijing

325
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,839
will depend on your own actions.

326
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:16,680
Chief Elder, you're right.

327
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:19,799
I'll do anything

328
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:21,839
you want me to do.

329
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,880
If so, Chief Elder, do you know

330
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:30,759
what I'm thinking right now?

331
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,359
This is what I'm thinking.

332
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,079
You said this before.

333
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:40,680
As long as I bring back
the Five Warriors,

334
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,599
you'll allow me to manage
the business in the North.

335
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,839
You wanted them

336
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,680
to take care of the business anyway.

337
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,960
Even if you don't allow me to manage it,

338
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,200
maybe

339
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,160
they'll tell me the secrets
to the business themselves.

340
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,039
If so, don't you think
it's better for you

341
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:58,359
to tell me about it directly?

342
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:04,400
You're

343
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:06,920
such a vixen.

344
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:16,960
I brewed this with Chinese figwort
and mulberry leaves.

345
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,440
Drink it while it's hot.

346
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:23,000
Be careful, it's hot.

347
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,480
You told me to drink it while it's hot.

348
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:33,240
I feel unnerved when I don't see you.

349
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,559
But when I ask you out,

350
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,119
I'm afraid you might
catch a cold outside

351
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:38,920
when the weather is this cold.

352
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,359
Although my Master passed down
the Red Sleeve Blade to me,

353
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,599
I'm better at wielding it.

354
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,880
Do you know why?

355
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,759
Because you're an extraordinary
martial arts talent.

356
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,559
You're a one-in-a-hundred-thousand
kind of rare talent.

357
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,880
Only you would be
kind enough to say that.

358
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,640
It's because

359
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,279
I was born with a weak constitution

360
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,160
while the Red Sleeve Blade
contained a scorching flame.

361
00:24:58,599 --> 00:24:59,680
That's why we're the perfect match.

362
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,440
You don't need to care
about the cold weather

363
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:05,000
or my body.

364
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,759
It's a good day as long as

365
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,200
we can see each other.

366
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,640
I bought some new flavors today.

367
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,400
Try them and see if you like them.

368
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:29,880
It's sweet.

369
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:33,440
Do you like it sweet?

370
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:35,839
I think the sour one is better.

371
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,799
All right. I'll remember that.

372
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:42,079
I'll buy the sour ones
for you in the future.

373
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,279
Your condition is getting worse.

374
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,559
Was it because of
the battle with Guan Qi?

375
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,039
I could only do so

376
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,599
when I faced Guan Qi.

377
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,279
I had to give it my all.

378
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,400
It's the same for your father too.

379
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,880
The martial arts world
is truly unpredictable.

380
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,359
However, this change

381
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,519
can steer both of you
toward a common enemy.

382
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,200
That's pretty good.

383
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,640
If both sects can bury the hatchet,

384
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,079
we might be able to be together.

385
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:29,880
It's all my fault.

386
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:31,519
You still caught a cold in the end.

387
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,319
Since you have a cold,

388
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,039
you should hug me more often
to get some warmth.

389
00:27:32,116 --> 00:27:35,014
(Discovery)

390
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,480
Were you upset?

391
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,480
You don't express
your inner feelings to many people.

392
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:50,720
If you keep it in like this,

393
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,200
you'll get sick eventually.

394
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:54,519
We're very close to locating

395
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
the Six Half Hall's firearms workshop.

396
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,200
Once we set it on fire,

397
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,279
she will be implicated
one way or another.

398
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,119
I have no idea what will happen

399
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,720
when we see each other again.

400
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:18,936
(Calligraphy and Drawings)

Candied hawthorns for sale!

402
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:29,759
Trinkets for sale!

403
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,720
Mr. Bai, long time no see.

404
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:48,839
You've produced these many
new paintings in such a short time?

405
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,240
This is truly eye-opening to me.

406
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,319
These aren't new paintings.

407
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,039
I drew them in the past.

408
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:54,160
I've brought all of them here.

409
00:28:58,599 --> 00:28:59,599
All these paintings

410
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,279
are of the highest quality.

411
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,640
If I hang them outside the shop,

412
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,640
I'm sure they'll sell for a fortune!

413
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,160
I'll give them to you

414
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,079
for free.

415
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,920
Whether you can
make a fortune out of them

416
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,119
all depends on you now.

417
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,559
But...

418
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,279
But why?

419
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:27,200
One's state of mind
is vital in drawing paintings.

420
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,119
It depends on one's sentiment.

421
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:30,960
Now, I have no sentiments

422
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:32,759
and no love.

423
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,119
I might not draw for a long time.

424
00:29:36,556 --> 00:29:37,385
(Second Year of Song-Yuan,
drawn by Bai Youjin)

425
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,920
As for the pen name Bai Youjin,

426
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I will never use it again.

427
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,000
What a pity.

428
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,359
Do you want the paintings or not?

429
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,319
I do!

430
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:54,000
Of course I'll take them!

431
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:54,920
However,

432
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,920
I cannot take them for free.

433
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:59,079
Mr. Bai, take this.

434
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,480
Mr. Bai,

435
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,359
please don't forget about me

436
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,079
when you're in the mood to draw again.

437
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:17,279
- Stop!
- Stop right there!

438
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:18,599
Stop running!

439
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:19,839
Stop right there!

440
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:21,359
Stop right there!

441
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:22,119
Get out of the way!

442
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,880
- Stop!
- Stop right there!

443
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:25,400
Get out of the way!

444
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:27,559
- Mr. Bai!
- Stop right there!

445
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,720
Mr. Bai, save me!

446
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:33,319
Mr. Fang,

447
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,880
you're Marquis Shentong

448
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,279
of the Capital.

449
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,599
How could you welch on your debt

450
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:40,400
when you'd lost so much money to us?

451
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,079
Who said I was welching on my debt?

452
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:43,160
I just

453
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:44,880
didn't bring
that much money with me today.

454
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:45,920
Besides,

455
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,160
my friend is here.

456
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:48,119
He can repay my debt for me.

457
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:51,720
You want to repay his debt?

458
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,680
Can you even afford to repay it?

459
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,519
You two better mind your words.

460
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,240
Do you know who he is?

461
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,200
He's the Vice House Master
of Sunset Drizzle.

462
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:03,519
Vice House Master Bai.

463
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,279
Vice House Master Bai.

464
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,000
Let's go!

465
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:11,720
Thank you, Vice House Master Bai.

466
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,279
Scram.

467
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,039
Thank you.

468
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,240
Hurry, let's go!

469
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:18,839
Mr. Bai!

470
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,400
Thank you for rescuing me just now.

471
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,319
As the saying goes,

472
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,960
fate has led us to meet each other.

473
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,759
Why don't you treat me to a drink?

474
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,519
It's right here.

475
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:31,440
Let's go.

476
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:32,680
Fate has led us to meet each other.

477
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,160
It's right here.

478
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,599
Let's go.

479
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,119
Here.

480
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:39,319
Mr. Bai, thank you for saving me today.

481
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:40,680
They would've chased after me

482
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,680
for a long time

483
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,119
without your help.

484
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:45,519
Please.

485
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,680
Here. Try this.
This liquor is excellent.

486
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,240
Marquis, you're great

487
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,400
at pretending to be
a good-for-nothing indeed.

488
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,880
Not at all.

489
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:03,119
Sorry for the embarrassing act.

490
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:04,440
Since that's the case,

491
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,960
I'll drop the act now.

492
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,559
Our encounter just now
wasn't a coincidence.

493
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:10,640
You did spend a lot of effort

494
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,640
in putting up that act.

495
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:15,559
Mr. Bai, you're intelligent indeed.

496
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:19,640
You do live up to your name
as the Vice House Master.

497
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,200
I'll cut to the chase then.

498
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:40,079
So, Marquis, is this where
you hide your dignity?

499
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:42,119
My dignity is worthless.

500
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,240
The things they're hiding in this place

501
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,599
are way more valuable.

502
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,519
This is Lei Sun's illegal
firearms workshop.

503
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,240
Guan Qi used to manage it in the past.

504
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,920
Lei Sun did all he could
to silence Guan Qi

505
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,400
because

506
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:57,799
he didn't want him
to tell anyone things he shouldn't.

507
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,759
Producing firearms illegally

508
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,759
is a crime worthy of death.

509
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:05,960
And the person backing him up

510
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,359
is Fu Zongshu.

511
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:13,799
Marquis, if you were speaking the truth,

512
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,160
why didn't you head
to the House of Sunset Drizzle

513
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,079
and tell Mengzhen about it?

514
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,519
Mr. Bai, are you mocking me right now?

515
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:24,759
You know this as well.

516
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,960
Mr. Su doesn't trust me at all.

517
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:30,079
He doesn't trust you?

518
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,000
What makes you think
that I'll trust you?

519
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,240
Yes.

520
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:37,839
Mr. Bai, you can choose not to trust me.

521
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:40,960
However, you should be able
to understand my feelings.

522
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,920
Although I have the title of Marquis,

523
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,359
no one

524
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,640
gives a darn about me.

525
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:59,480
Officials with some power
in the imperial court

526
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:01,720
can crush me easily like an ant.

527
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,519
I have a question for you.

528
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:05,920
Do you think anyone is willing
to live in the dark sewers

529
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:07,359
and face oppression all their lives?

530
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,559
Look at my name.

531
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,719
Yingkan.

532
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,440
Yingkan?

533
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,119
Does that mean

534
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,840
I can only stand and watch
while being able to do nothing about it?

535
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:35,360
And you,

536
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,400
Choufei,

537
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,679
you're already the Vice House Master
of the House of Sunset Drizzle.

538
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,760
But you have no subordinates or power.

539
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,119
You're facing oppression too,
just like me.

540
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,760
Aren't you fretting
about how to climb to the top too?

541
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,159
You...

542
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,159
You should be able to
understand my feelings!

543
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,719
You and I,

544
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,119
we're the same.

545
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,280
As long as an opportunity
is in front of us,

546
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,559
we have to grab hold of it.

547
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:16,920
We're facing Lei Sun

548
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,519
and Fu Zongshu.

549
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:20,639
We have the same goal.

550
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,760
If you help me out,

551
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,360
you'll be doing yourself a favor too.

552
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,760
Take a look.

553
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:00,880
It's nice.

554
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:05,559
When my mother was still around,

555
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:06,920
she would hang lanterns

556
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:08,760
around the courtyard during my birthday.

557
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:10,159
She would write riddles

558
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:11,599
and draw small animals on them.

559
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,920
They were great.

560
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:40,760
Mr. Wang, you're here again?

561
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,760
Mister, I didn't buy enough
lantern paper last time.

562
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:43,920
Please get me more of them.

563
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:46,280
Look, I have ready-made lanterns here.

564
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,039
I need to draw on the lanterns.

565
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,679
You don't have the diagrams
I'm looking for.

566
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:51,559
All right, I understand.

567
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:52,760
I'll get them for you.

568
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:53,800
- Give me a second.
- Take your time.

569
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,719
Give me a moment.

570
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,519
Mister.

571
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,760
Shuang?

572
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,559
Mr. Wang?

573
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:09,559
You're here as well?

574
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:11,440
Are you here
to buy some festive lanterns?

575
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:14,679
No. Today's the 49th day
of my father's passing.

576
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,119
I'm here to buy some white lanterns.

577
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:23,440
(Grave of Guan Qi)

578
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,000
In the past, Xiaoyao told me

579
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:34,920
that Father was a small business owner.

580
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,559
He did his business at Wei Village.

581
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,199
He always stayed there for a long time.

582
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,679
He didn't come back
even when Mother had passed away.

583
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:49,880
However, I later found out

584
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,960
that he had killed many people.

585
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,920
Please don't blame me
for being selfish, Mr. Wang.

586
00:37:58,239 --> 00:37:59,239
I just wish

587
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:01,159
to fulfill my filial duties.

588
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,480
Why would I blame you?

589
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:17,079
No matter what kind of person
your father was,

590
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:19,119
all children should fulfill

591
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:21,159
their filial duties.

592
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,960
We're the same.

593
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,039
Mr. Wang, you're carefree and frank.

594
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:33,159
I don't think we're the same.

595
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:40,519
My foster father was an escort.

596
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:42,400
He traveled all around the world.

597
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:44,679
That's why he entrusted me
to the care of Recluse Tianyi.

598
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:48,119
I don't have any impression

599
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:49,239
of my biological parents.

600
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,239
The only thing I remember was the scene
before my mother passed away.

601
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,960
She was murdered.

602
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,480
By the way,

603
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,639
did you say that your father

604
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,199
did his business at Wei Village?

605
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,639
That's right.

606
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,880
That's what Xiaoyao told me.

607
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,199
What's the matter?

608
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:18,400
It's nothing.

609
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:20,760
Wei Village is outside the Capital, right?

610
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,880
I wish to visit that place

611
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:25,039
and see what business
they're doing there.

612
00:39:26,618 --> 00:39:28,520
(Six Half Hall)

613
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:46,199
How did you know
that I was leaving today?

614
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:48,159
One should know
the underlying meaning of the words.

615
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,519
Why do I need to tell you?

616
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:52,840
It's better for you
to make things clear.

617
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:56,639
The five men under me
were transferred away all of a sudden.

618
00:39:57,239 --> 00:39:58,559
So I know something is up tonight.

619
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:00,400
Since that's the case,

620
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,239
I knew you would check it out.

621
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,599
It's great that you're smart.

622
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,599
But it's annoying
when you're trying to be a smart aleck.

623
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:12,400
Being smart and being a smart aleck
are worlds apart.

624
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:14,639
Whether I'm a smart aleck

625
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,840
depends on my guess.

626
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:19,079
Besides the Young Lady,

627
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:21,239
there are only two people
who can take Chief Elder's carriage.

628
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:24,079
Since the mats
are this close to each other,

629
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:26,559
I'm sure it doesn't belong
to First Elder Di.

630
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:29,719
Who do you think the second person is?

631
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:36,000
Your intelligence

632
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,079
does please me.

633
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,519
Tea for sale.

634
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,760
Mister,

635
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:53,840
would you like some tea?

636
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:56,199
Give me a cup of tea.

637
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:56,760
All right.

638
00:40:59,199 --> 00:40:59,760
Please.

639
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:03,920
Mister,

640
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:05,639
seems like Wei Village

641
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,480
is doing better than the other villages
outside of the Capital.

642
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,039
Sir, you have sharp eyes indeed.

643
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,559
Although Wei Village

644
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:11,639
is located
on the outskirts of the Capital,

645
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,800
it's the central point of many places.
The roads are in great condition too.

646
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:16,719
It's connected to both
the North and the South.

647
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:18,679
Naturally, our village flourishes

648
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,960
when many people pass by.

649
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:21,960
Is there any kind of business here?

650
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:22,760
We do have business here.

651
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:24,039
What kind of business?

652
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,159
We have goods delivery business,
grain business, accommodation business,

653
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:29,199
and several rice stores over here.

654
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,000
This place houses
the nearest granary to the Capital.

655
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:34,159
Okay, thank you.

656
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:35,400
Enjoy your tea.

657
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,400
Hurry!

658
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,760
Make sure the knots are tight.

659
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,639
Yes, sir!

660
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,120
(Yiji Rice Store)

661
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,920
Be careful with them.

662
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:04,519
Be gentle with them.

663
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,519
Hurry up.

664
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:14,599
You don't want to get off
even when you're already here?

665
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:16,760
We have to give ourselves some room

666
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:18,559
no matter when
we're facing people or doing business.

667
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:21,400
Why should I get myself involved

668
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,400
when this is such a risky business?

669
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:26,480
I can just observe them
from this distance.

670
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:31,039
I'll ask Dongtian to take over

671
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,159
once Lei Chong has finished
delivering this batch of goods.

672
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:36,360
Hurry up!

673
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:42,159
Vice House Master Bai.

674
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,480
Although I've not been here for long,

675
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:53,920
I see you all as my brothers-in-arm.

676
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,239
Tonight, there's something I have to do.

677
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:58,599
This will only help out
the House of Sunset Drizzle

678
00:42:58,599 --> 00:42:59,880
without any drawbacks.

679
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:02,880
Are you guys willing to follow me?

680
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,360
Vice House Master Bai,
we're willing to follow you.

681
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,519
All right.

682
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:18,400
After the deed is done,

683
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:20,559
House Master and I will surely
remember your contributions.

684
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:23,000
Thank you, Vice House Master Bai.
