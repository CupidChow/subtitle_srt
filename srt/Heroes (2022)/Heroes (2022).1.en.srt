for a business opportunity.

112
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,519
Someone will arrive by sea

113
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,839
and he will carry a white jade box.

114
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,759
That box belongs to Six Half Hall.

of opening it yourself.

117

Whoever can deliver it to me

118

will be a friend of Six Half Hall.

119

Glory and success
will be easily reachable.

120
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,600
Six Half Hall doesn't get
to decide everything

121

in this martial arts world.

In a flurry of white and red,

the Red Sleeve Blade
cuts at the speed of light.

128
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,679
Today, we will reenact the fight
between Sunset Drizzle's Su Mengzhen

129
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,519
and the Four Guardians of Six Half Hall.

130

Excuse me, Sir.

133
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,120
The premise is interesting,

134
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,240
but why is there a lack of audience?

135
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,000
The battle between Su Mengzhen
and Four Guardians

136
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:29,399
has been reenacted many times.

137
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,679
It's interesting,

138
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,639
but it has become mundane.

139
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,440
Also,

140
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,440
a real battle

141
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,679
is about to break out in Xiliu.

142
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,200
Who wants to watch a reenactment?

143
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,840
Great!

144
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,399
Well done!

145
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:51,159
Good.

146
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,960
It's raining heavily. Let's go.

00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,240
It's raining heavily. Let's go.

148
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
It's raining heavily. Leave.

149
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,679

154
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:51,840
Fill it up! Fill it up!

155
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:56,519
Here's your bread.

156
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,639
Brother, what kind of box

157
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,399
can turn the martial arts world
upside down?

158
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,759
I don't know the details.

159
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,120
I just know this box will come by sea.

160
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:09,120
Someone will hand it

161
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,080
to Su Mengzhen,
the Young Master of Sunset Drizzle.

162
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:15,000
Should he fail to receive it,

163
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:18,679
House of Sunset Drizzle
will fall in grace.

164
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,360
That person will carry

165
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,679
something that important with him?

166
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,720
Surely he won't be an easy target.

167
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,559
Fill your tummy

168
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:27,440
and we'll go look for him.

169
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,799
That person

170
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,080
will have to die here, in Xiliu.

171
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,559
Mister, can I sit with you?

172
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,840
(This green flower plant is the token.)

173
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,840
(Take it out in Zhaoye Tavern)

174
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:52,519
(and your contact will appear.)

175
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,279
My friend, you're a new face here.

176
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,759
Where do you come from?

177
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,960
I come by sea.

178
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,799
By sea?

179
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,399
He's the box carrier.

180
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,240
Hand it over now!

181
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:20,840
(A few thugs like you)

182
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:23,240
(think you can steal
Sunset Drizzle's property?)

183
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:23,559
Who?

184
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:24,919
Who's there?

185
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:28,360
(Scared?)

186
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:29,679
(You're a coward.)

187
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,320
Who are you?

188
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,039
Show yourself if you're a man!

189
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,399
(Not only are you blind,)

190
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,639
(you're also deaf.)

191
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,600
(You can't even tell
if I'm a male or a female.)

192
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:39,840
Come out now!

193
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,720
(Fine.)

194
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,879
I'm the daughter of Wen Wan,
Lord of Luoyang,

195
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,519
a disciple of Red-Sleeved Nun,

196
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:57,600
the Hanshan Swallow,

197
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,879
(Wen Rou)
Heroine Wen, Wen Rou.

198
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,600
(Wen Rou)

199
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,960
The snowy Mount Qingfeng.

200
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,840
You doofus!

201
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:15,559
My eyebrows!

202
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:30,200
Watch before you attack!

203
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,960
Don't attack your ally!

204
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,039
Light the candles!

205
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,679
He's here. Attack!

206
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:58,799
Don't attack your ally!

207
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,279
Stop fighting!

208
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,240
Light the candles!

209
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,519
Stop it!

210
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,279
He's already gone.
There's no point fighting.

211
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:15,240
Was it you

212
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:16,519
who hit me?

213
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:21,080
Was it you?

214
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,759
My tavern...

215
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,799
You are daft.

216
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,919
You were under attack,
but you never drew your sword.

217
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,039
Is your sword just an accessory?

218
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,399
Miss,

219
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:52,240
if you're not my contact,

220
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,399
why did you save me?

221
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,840
Aren't you supposed
to give this box to Su Mengzhen?

222
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,960
I'm his martial sister.

223
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,200
Of course, I'll help you.

224
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,559
I'm Wang Xiaoshi.

225
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,919
Xiao, Shi.

226
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,240
I'm Wen Rou.

227
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,120
Wen, Rou.

228
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:05,440
No need to thank me.

229
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,399
I'm in the martial arts world.
Protecting the weak

230
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:08,480
is my duty.

231
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,080
What's next for you?

232
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,960
Everyone knows about the box.

233
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,600
It seems like my contact is in danger.

234
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:15,639
I have to look for him.

235
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,000
See you.

236
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:19,919
Hang on.

237
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,200
You're heading to the dock.

238
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,559
Those after the box are there.

239
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,120
Your contact
is the least likely to be there.

240
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,320
I know.

241
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,200
I plan to capture some of them
and interrogate them.

242
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,759
A greedy hoarder

243
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,759
will attract ruthless killers.

244
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,519
And there are many killers
here in Xiliu.

245
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,720
They want your box

246
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,840
and your head.

247
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:51,720
Why don't you give me the box

248
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,559
to avoid unnecessary bloodshed?

249
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:54,440
No.

250
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,480
He's a stranger.
You can't give it to him.

251
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,240
You want this box?

252
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:06,880
Of course, I do.

253
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,559
Why does everyone want it?

254
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:11,200
It doesn't belong to any of you.

255
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:12,839
Because we're in the martial arts world

256
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,160
for a lasting legacy

257
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:16,279
and some achievements.

258
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,039
Here in Xiliu,

259
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,279
getting this box is a feat.

260
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,720
Everyone wants the box,

261
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,480
but you want the fame and glory.

262
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,400
Don't you think doing what others

263
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,720
are doing is quite insipid?

264
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:35,680
Why don't you...

265
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,079
Great idea.

266
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,400
But do you trust me?

267
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,559
You snuffed out the candles
in the tavern just now.

268
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,000
But you did not ambush me.

269
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,279
That proves
that you're a righteous person.

270
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,240
What did you say to him?

271
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:08,759
Why did he leave just like that?

272
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,440
Nothing.

273
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,799
I just gave him a better idea

274
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,519
to become famous than stealing this box.

275
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,839
The snowy Mount Qingfeng.

276
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:27,160
The dweller of Baixu Garden.

277
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,347
(Xue Xishen, House of Sunset Drizzle)

278
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,400
Who would have thought

279
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,039
that the disciple of Tianyi

280
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:48,240
would cross paths with the daughter
of Wen Family?

281
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,160
What a destiny.

282
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:50,799
Come.

283
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,759
Have some water.

284
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:53,119
- I don't care about destiny.
- Thank you.

285
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,119
Are we safe here?

286
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:56,880
This place is quite secluded.

287
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:58,240
Those people

288
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,319
won't find us in a while.

289
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,039
What's so secret about this box

290
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:04,720
that everyone will kill for it?

291
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:06,160
Its content

292
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,640
is none of my business.

293
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,920
I'm just a deliveryman.

294
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,440
House Master has fallen ill a year ago.

295
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,240
To prepare for the worst,

296
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,880
he asked me to write to Baixu Garden

297
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,839
so that this box can be delivered
to the Young Master, Su Mengzhen.

298
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,440
This box

299
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,400
is related to the survival
of Sunset Drizzle.

300
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,240
If something bad happens to Uncle Su,

301
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,359
won't the title fall onto Mengzhen?

302
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,559
A son will inherit

303
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,559
his father's title, naturally.

304
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,480
Sunset Drizzle does not have such a rule.

305
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,000
The title of Young Master
is just for show.

306
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,319
It's not a position within
the House of Sunset Drizzle.

307
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,960
The one underneath the House Master

308
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:42,640
is Delegate.

309
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:44,000
The Delegate, Hua Wucuo?

310
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,680
Su Mengzhen is renowned,

311
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,960
but Hua Wucuo is the real commander.

312
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,960
Both of them are good enough
to succeed House Master.

313
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,400
So many people came for the box

314
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,480
once it arrived at Xiliu.

315
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,279
It must be Hua Wucuo's doing.

316
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,920
Don't worry, mister.

317
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:01,599
I'll see to it that it's done.

318
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,680
Also,

319
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,680
my Master told me

320
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,599
to give this to you.

321
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,640
He said even if I die,

322
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,079
this flower has to live.

323
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:14,480
The green plant
that I coveted yesterday.

324
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:15,960
Today, I found it.

325
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,200
Please thank him on my behalf.

326
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,839
Xiliu is too dangerous for you.

327
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,200
Why don't you let me
keep the box for you?

328
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,000
It might be safer that way.

329
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,400
I don't think that's a good idea.

330
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:37,039
You're also
one of House of Sunset Drizzle.

331
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:38,440
You're a target too.

332
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:39,480
If someone finds us,

333
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,799
we can run faster than you.

334
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:44,000
Heroine Wen, are you saying
that I'm old?

335
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,640
Don't you worry.

336
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,720
I'm still good enough

337
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,559
for ordinary fighters.

338
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:52,880
Wang Xiaoshi.

339
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,200
What do you think?

340
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:01,960
(Make sure)

341
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:04,160
(you give it to him in person.)

342
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,359
Mister.

343
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:23,160
I can let you keep it.

344
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,400
We can head to the Capital together.

345
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,799
There's strength in number.

346
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,079
All right.

347
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,240
I'll stash this box

348
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,599
and then find some food.

349
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,960
There are two guest rooms
to the east of courtyard.

350
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:34,079
Dust them off

351
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:35,279
and you can spend a night there.

352
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,960
We'll move tomorrow.

353
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:38,519
Thanks, mister.

354
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:39,680
Thanks, mister.

355
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,400
You do not use your sword
when you fight.

356
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,759
What's so special about it?

357
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,720
My sword

358
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:00,279
is called Retainment. It's for my
Longing sword technique.

359
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,039
I cannot use it without a care.

360
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,680
A weird name you got there.

361
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,720
Longing? Retainment?

362
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,799
Longing for what?

363
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,640
Retaining what?

364
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:10,240
Longing for you.

365
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,240
Retaining our memories.

366
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:17,480
My Master told me that.

367
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:19,160
I merely recited it.

368
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:21,240
Oh,

369
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,960
why are you here in Xiliu?

370
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,720
For the adventure
in the martial arts world.

371
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:27,000
Do you have to come to Xiliu for it?

372
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,559
It's because Xiliu is close to the sea.

373
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,880
The martial arts world is like the sea.

374
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,200
It's boundless

375
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:38,359
and free.

376
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:42,920
Those who dwell
in the martial arts world

377
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:44,400
should be free,

378
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:46,279
to pursue what they want to do,

379
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:47,799
and to go where they want to go.

380
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:50,559
They won't be bound by the pedantry.

381
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,599
Most importantly,

382
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:53,880
Xiliu has the Sea Festival

383
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,680
and the parade.

384
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,559
They take place once every three years

385
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,759
and it's tonight.

386
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,680
If we didn't have to protect the box,

387
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,839
I would love to visit the festival.

388
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,480
There is this faint fragrance
to the sea breeze.

389
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:15,920
Wait, maybe it's not the sea breeze.

390
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:26,920
It comes from you.

391
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:30,200
I live in the mountain

392
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,119
and shower with herbs.

393
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,119
You smell good.

394
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:43,759
The rooms are all clean now.

395
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,559
Please put up with it for a night.

396
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:54,759
I'll check the rooms out.

397
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:13,240
My lady,

398
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:14,519
Xue Xishen got the box.

399
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:16,759
He said he would carry the box
to the Sea Festival parade.

400
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:18,279
He'll only hand it over

401
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,440
when he sees his family.

402
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,400
Sting.

403
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,240
Ghostblade.

404
00:24:55,192 --> 00:24:55,518
(Deng Cangsheng, Six Half Hall)

405
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:56,240
(Deng Cangsheng, Six Half Hall)
Two assassins

406
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,009
are escorting

407
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,519
(Ren Guishen, Six Half Hall)
a young lady.

408
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,880
It seems like

409
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,680
you hold a high rank in Six Half Hall.

410
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,160
What brought important people like you

411
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,519
to Xiliu?

412
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,759
Until now,

413
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,240
House of Sunset Drizzle and Six Half Hall

414
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:13,400
co-rule the martial arts world.

415
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,599
This white jade box

416
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:17,480
can toss it up.

417
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,759
Xue Xishen,

418
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:21,079
will you hand the box to me?

419
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,960
What are you thinking about?

420
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,119
I am the contact for the box carrier.

421
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,640
Can you kill him for me then?

422
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,519
We toil for a century

423
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,240
so that we can leave behind a legacy.

424
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:35,960
I will not commit

425
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,680
betrayal.

426
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:47,359
To die,

427
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:49,759
you just have to bleed out.

428
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:52,680
But what about your family?

429
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,319
Tell Xue Xishen

430
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,960
that I'll wait for him in the alley
next to the parade avenue.

431
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:07,920
I'll release his family
once I see the box.

432
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:08,880
Noted.

433
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:29,000
Master,

434
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:32,119
I can't hear the wind from Baixu Garden
in Xiliu.

435
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,559
Baixu Garden is different
from the mortal world.

436
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,359
The outside world can be treacherous.

437
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,599
People can change.

438
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:46,799
You need to be careful.

439
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,359
How can I remain unchanged then?

440
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,839
You can't.

441
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:53,559
But you can keep to your root.

442
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,079
The martial arts world is a stage

443
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:57,400
and an arena for heroes.

444
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,720
You will meet many people.

445
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,279
Mingle with

446
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,519
like-minded people,

447
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:05,559
and you will remain unchanged.

448
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:10,519
You're awake.

449
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,039
Wang Xiaoshi.

450
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:13,480
What happened?

451
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,079
You were drugged.

452
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,079
Xue Xishen spiked our drinks.

453
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:18,279
Drugged?

454
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,000
Drugged?

455
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,599
Where is the box?

456
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,200
He took it away.

457
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,440
Why are you still here then?

458
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,480
Chase after him!

459
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,400
Calm down.

460
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,480
Don't you want to go to the parade?

461
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,599
I'll bring you there.

462
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:34,359
Now is not the time for a parade!

463
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,200
The box is gone!

464
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,240
- We need to...
- Let's go.

465
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:37,400
I...

466
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,839
The clues are always hidden
where there are people.

467
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,359
(All rituals are ready.)

468
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,480
(Sound the bells and drums.)

469
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:38,960
(The offspring
is in their rightful places.)

470
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:41,599
(And I hereby announce,)

471
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,519
(the Gods are all drunk
from our offerings.)

472
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,400
(Now, carry the divine body.)

473
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,160
Xiliu is so festive now.

474
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,440
This is my first time to see such a parade.

475
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,119
Have a safe trip.

476
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,519
Let's go.

477
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:24,640
Come.

478
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,680
Don't you want to watch the parade?

479
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:28,599
Remember this.

480
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,960
Just watch the parade.
Don't go anywhere.

481
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,319
Let me handle the rest.

482
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:32,519
Where are you going?

483
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,279
I'll look for the box.

484
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,240
Wait for me.

485
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:35,319
I...

486
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,839
Get the box!

487
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,519
Hurry up!

488
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,480
Move aside.

489
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,480
An ambush?

490
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,440
You have no shame.

491
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:13,279
I'll do anything

492
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:14,880
for 10,000 taels of gold.

493
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,240
Give me the box.

494
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,599
Only if you have what it takes
to snatch it from me.

495
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:03,400
We are all doing business
in the martial arts world.

496
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:05,480
Bring me the box.

497
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:06,920
Yes, my lady!

498
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:43,519
It's already chaotic enough over there.

499
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:45,160
So please, don't make it worse.

500
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,240
If you want money,

501
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,119
grab a box of gold.

502
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,720
If you want fame,

503
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,519
I can let you be
an Elder of Six Half Hall.

504
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,759
Now, move aside.

505
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:57,799
I love fame.

506
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:00,720
One box of gold

507
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:02,559
and the Elder position

508
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,200
cannot compare

509
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,960
to the fame I'll achieve by intercepting
Six Half Hall's carriage.

510
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,159
There's a brawl!

511
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:22,480
Hand over the box!

512
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:27,719
Do you have the guts to take it?

513
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,239
This box

514
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:31,320
is a curse.

515
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,559
Whoever gets it will die.

516
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,440
What should I do?

517
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,639
I should have trained harder back then.

518
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,039
Wang Xiaoshi.

519
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:56,280
I have a surprise for you.

520
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:56,880
What?

521
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:58,400
Fireworks!

522
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,400
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

523
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,360
Hand over the box

524
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,039
and she will be spared.

525
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:32,519
Leave me, Wang Xiaoshi.

526
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,840
Don't give him the box.

527
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:38,559
A box is just an item.

528
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,480
Your friend here is alive and breathing.

529
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:00,639
Once you leave the mountain,

530
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:03,159
do not unsheathe the sword
whenever you want.

531
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,519
Master,

532
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,599
if I can't use the sword,

533
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,199
I just have to accept beating?

534
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,159
This sword is called Retainment.

535
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,000
Whenever its previous owners

536
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:16,000
unsheathed it for someone else,

537
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:20,920
their fate became intertwined.

538
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:55,880
Who still dares to come near?

539
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:34,960
My lady.

540
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:35,880
My lady.

541
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,199
We didn't get the box.

542
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,199
Elder Tuoba is dead.

543
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,440
Tuoba Yun is dead?

544
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:00,679
Those two young fighters are this good?

545
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,440
We won't be able to get the box.

546
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:06,079
Pardon my incompetence.

547
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,159
Set Xue Xishen's family free.

548
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:10,840
The plan has failed.

549
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,559
No need for unnecessary killing.

550
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:13,960
Yes, my lady.

551
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,079
You are a friend of my Master.

552
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,599
It shouldn't end like this.

553
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:31,039
I didn't

554
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:34,239
want to do it either.

555
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,679
In the martial arts world,

556
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:39,679
sometimes, you don't have a choice.

557
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,239
There are many powerful individuals

558
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,000
and they can break you

559
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,960
as easily as they break a matchstick.

560
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:50,760
And now,

561
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,760
you're involved in this.

562
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,039
More blood spill

563
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,800
is inevitable.

564
00:39:59,320 --> 00:39:59,960
I'm not afraid.

565
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:02,159
Worst comes to worst,

566
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,920
I still have my dagger.

567
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:08,559
Well said.

568
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:11,480
Well said!

569
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:09,960
That candle-snuffer.

570
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:15,440
You're very agile.

571
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,280
I'm glad you're my friend

572
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,519
and not my enemy.

573
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:19,960
Thank you for your help.

574
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:21,639
Help?

575
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:23,760
He helped nothing.

576
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,480
He intercepted
the Six Half Hall's carriage.

577
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:27,960
If we work together,

578
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,800
we can protect this box

579
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:31,679
and get out of Xiliu alive.

580
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,559
That will make us famous, won't it?

581
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:38,199
You might have escaped today

582
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:40,039
but there will be more

583
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,360
in the future.

584
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:43,360
For a rookie

585
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,239
like you,

586
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,159
I have an advice.

587
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,800
You can entrust the box

588
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:51,800
or

589
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,840
yourself to me.

590
00:41:58,639 --> 00:41:59,239
No.

591
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,079
I have to protect him.

592
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,599
Besides, you helped us.

593
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:03,800
In my eyes, you're one of us.

594
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,960
Why would you steal something
from your friends?

595
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,440
Fine, you don't need to give me the box.

596
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,159
But tell me

597
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:10,639
what's in it.

598
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:12,480
I can give it to you.

599
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,719
You can't give it to him, Little Rock!
[*In Chinese Xiaoshi sounds like Little Rock.]

600
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:15,880
That belongs to Mengzhen.

601
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,039
You can't hand it over.

602
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,679
It's empty?

603
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,599
If he had looked at the plant closely,

604
00:42:57,639 --> 00:42:59,000
he would have realized the real secret

605
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:00,840
was hiding within the pot.

606
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,000
You're so bold.

607
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,679
What if he found out?

608
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:06,840
He had lost touch with reality.

609
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:08,159
All he could see is the box.

610
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:09,440
He would never realize it.

611
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,440
More than ten gangs fought in Xiliu

612
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:14,119
for an empty box.

613
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:15,679
You had everyone fooled.

614
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,320
It's getting late.

615
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:19,400
Let's get moving.

616
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,039
I have been in Xiliu for so long,

617
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:04,800
but this is my first time
to gaze at the sea properly.

618
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:06,000
During the day,

619
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:07,960
seagulls will soar above the sea,

620
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,760
and at night, the sea surface reflects
the night sky.

621
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,119
Occasionally,

622
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,519
a school of glowing fish will pass by.

623
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,000
It's like the entire world is within

624
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,679
your reach.

625
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:21,480
I get the charm of the ocean,
but it's nothing

626
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:22,519
compared to the Capital.

627
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:25,280
It's the central hub of all parties
and all nations.

628
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,079
Now that is dazzling.

629
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:29,519
Have you made up your mind?

630
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,360
Will you go to the Capital with us?

631
00:45:33,159 --> 00:45:34,239
I should ask you that question.

632
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,320
I was trying to steal the box from you.

633
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,480
You would want me to tag along?

634
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:39,880
Like I said,

635
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,679
we're friends.

636
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,239
You helped me.

637
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:45,920
In Six Half Hall's eyes,

638
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,599
we're already partners in crime.

639
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:50,719
If you put it that way,

640
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,719
I guess I have no choice.

641
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,639
Stop looking for a reason.

642
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:55,360
In this martial arts world,

643
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,079
just finding each other is already
hard enough.

644
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:57,880
The way I see it,

645
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,679
the three of us

646
00:45:58,679 --> 00:45:59,960
are meant to meet here.

647
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:03,880
However,

648
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:05,519
we're traveling to the Capital soon,

649
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:06,639
but I still don't know your name.

650
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:10,280
Well,

651
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:13,679
let me show you this place.

652
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,880
The dead cannot hear our cries.

653
00:46:30,199 --> 00:46:31,559
And so the tomb-visitor
parts in silence under the evening rain.

654
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:34,639
Father, Mother.

655
00:46:36,039 --> 00:46:36,960
A toast to both of you.

656
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,480
What's the name next to them?

657
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:50,960
It's my name.

658
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,679
My parents and I got separated

659
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,639
in a war twenty years ago.

660
00:46:57,679 --> 00:46:59,760
They thought I was dead.

661
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:00,725
(In loving memory of
Bai Yanshu, Mrs. Bai, Bai Choufei)

662
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,239
So when my parents passed away,

663
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:02,760
the villagers

664
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,519
engraved my name on the tombstone too.

665
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:05,920
What's on it?

666
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:07,800
Bai something Fei.

667
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,162
(Chou)

668
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:28,480
Chou.

669
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,760
Bai Choufei.

670
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,760
Good choice.

671
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:34,239
(Bai Choufei)
A poem by Li Bai reads,

672
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,599
"As the dewy dusk settles into the hall,
the sense of brood cannot be dispelled."

673
00:47:37,639 --> 00:47:39,599
For as long as history exists,
we brood about politics and peace.

674
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:41,639
Those who brood are meant
for greater achievements.

675
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:43,679
You brood

676
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:45,119
but you still need to get back
on your feet.

677
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,280
You have a great name.

678
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,840
Father, Mother,

679
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:55,559
from now on,

680
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:56,760
I

681
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,159
will make a name for myself,

682
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,519
regardless of the stormy sea,

683
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,000
the bumpy road, or the uphill battle.

684
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,360
Mr. Bai and Mrs. Bai.

685
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:07,760
Your son, Bai Choufei,

686
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,880
has come to pay respect to you two.

687
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,920
Grant him your blessing so that
everything goes well.

688
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,119
Bless us so that our friendship
lasts forever.

689
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:14,760
Mr. Bai and Mrs. Bai,

690
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:16,000
from now on,

691
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,840
Bai Choufei
will be accompanied by friends.

692
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:19,079
Do not worry about him.

693
00:48:19,639 --> 00:48:20,639
We will take good care of him.

I have heard of this song.

00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,920
It's a famous hero ballad
in the martial arts world.

706
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:15,559
Red Sleeve Blade, Fast-Slow Pith.

707

All renowned individuals

708

our names

711
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,559
will be on it too.

712
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:25,840
Of course.

713
00:49:27,719 --> 00:49:28,280
Let's go.

714
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,079
Mister,

715
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:42,920
both my friends there
are very powerful too.

716
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,280
Can you include them in the song?

717
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,360
Miss,

718
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,320
are your friends

719
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,719
great heroes at the moment?

720
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:52,320
While they are not at the moment,

721
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,599
they have the talent, the skill,

722
00:49:54,679 --> 00:49:55,400
and the character for it.

723
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,800
One day, they will be great heroes.

724
00:49:58,679 --> 00:49:59,440
Miss,

725
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,639
you speak highly of your friends.

726
00:50:03,159 --> 00:50:03,800
I see.

727
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,119
Let me think.

728
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:08,360
Unfortunately,
I do not know your friends.

729
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,199
Can you give me
one or two words to inspire me?

730
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:13,960
Just say this,

731
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,480
the Earth-shattering Choufei

732
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,920
and the Unrivaled Little Rock.

733
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,079
Thanks, mister.
