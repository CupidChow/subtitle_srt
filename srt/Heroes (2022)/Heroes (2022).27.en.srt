Tell me.

54

Are you his accomplices?

Sir, you got it all wrong.

56
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,800
We're not his accomplices.

57
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,759
This wanted criminal is so bold

58
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,439
that he killed Minister Fu.

59

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,439
It's not easy to find such a deal.

62
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,199
The fewer people see these wanted posters,

63
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,199
the fewer people we'll have
to share the rewards.

64

Am I right?

65

That's right.

too highly of officers like us.

69

This person can escape unscathed
after killing Minister Fu.

What does this tell you?

75

It means this person
is very skilled in martial arts.

76

77

won't that spell trouble if you can't handle him?

a tenth of the reward.

Here.

192
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,120
Why did you order so many dishes?

193
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,519
Won't this be too wasteful?

194
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,879
After this meal,

195
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,600
we wouldn't know
where we'll have our next meal.

196
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,320
All right.

197
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,159
Here.

198
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:40,200
Don't look back.

199
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,679
Excuse me, what would you like to have?

200
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,840
What's wrong?

201
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,080
They're wearing officers' boots
and carrying officer blades.

202
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,360
They're the constables.

203
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,919
Tianshan is a small town.

204
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,519
Both of you are outsiders.

205
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,720
So it's easier to be spotted.

206
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,320
You're on the run after killing someone.

207
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,120
You dare to use the official road?

208
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,399
If we don't use the official road,

209
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:04,799
which road should we take?

210
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,440
That depends on
where you're running to.

211
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,960
All the local governments
within the borders of the Song

212
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,039
will receive your wanted posters

213
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,399
in less than half a month.

214
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,080
You can't escape,

215
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:19,720
unless you hide in the mountains, travel by sea,

216
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,799
or leave the pass.

217
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,039
Or else it'd be a matter of time

218
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,440
when you're caught.

219
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,360
If you're heading to Luoyang,

220
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,840
that's harder than dying.

221
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,480
So are we going to get caught today?

222
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:36,159
You're the only one on the wanted poster.

223
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,840
This lady is not related.

224
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,159
She can leave.

225
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,080
Over my dead body.

226
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:43,080
Both of us will leave no matter what.

227
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,840
She won't leave by herself.

228
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,480
I only killed those who deserved it.

229
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,840
But under such circumstances,

230
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,559
I'll retaliate if you force me.

231
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:55,639
Weapons have no eyes.

232
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,480
There are seven of us here.

233
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:10,919
At such a close distance,

234
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,080
are you confident?

235
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,919
Do you have a family?

236
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:24,200
I can't afford to drag anyone
in this kind of life.

237
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,440
You have none, but I do.

238
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,519
She's my woman.

239
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,919
I said I'll protect her forever.

240
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:34,440
If you want to take me,

241
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,080
don't get her involved.

242
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:37,519
If I want to kill you,

243
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,360
I won't drag your men into this.

244
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,960
What do you think?

245
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:43,480
Fair enough.

246
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,759
Stay there and keep your weapons.

247
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,679
Keep your weapons.

248
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,639
You dared to kill Fu Zongshu.

249
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:07,559
You have my respect.

250
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,000
But as an officer

251
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:11,519
who works for the imperial court,

252
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,639
I must catch wanted criminals.

253
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,360
If I do my duty,

254
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,480
my men and I can live.

255
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,960
You have my respect too.

256
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,120
If there's a chance,

257
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,960
I hope we'll see each other again.

258
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,720
Sir!

259
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,080
Little Rock, are you all right?

260
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,080
I'm all right.

261
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,960
Don't worry about me.

262
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,000
But...

263
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:58,320
Do you feel bad

264
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:00,440
that I injured the constable?

265
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,960
The truth is, he deliberately let me win.

266
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,440
That's precisely the reason

267
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,159
I granted his wish.

268
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,679
If I didn't injure him,

269
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,519
he and his men would have been
held accountable.

270
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,159
Sometimes, I wonder

271
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,679
if my life has been different

272
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:20,120
after killing Fu Zongshu.

273
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,919
I may need to do the things
I wouldn't do in the past.

274
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:27,519
But I have a sense of justice,

275
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:28,919
so I won't feel guilty about what I do.

276
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,240
Little Rock,

277
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,000
you've changed.

278
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,559
I'm glad you can come around.

279
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:40,840
Along this journey,

280
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,480
we've been found twice.

281
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,440
Let's not travel westward
to Luoyang anymore.

282
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,360
First, we don't know
if we can reach Luoyang city safely.

283
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,360
Secondly,

284
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,720
I don't want to drag
the Wen Family into this.

285
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,159
Where else can we go now?

286
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:56,120
Who's there?

287
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,080
Wait here.

288
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,039
I'll go and take a look.

289
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,039
Be careful.

290
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:02,000
Don't worry.

291
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,840
You're perfectly fine
after you took a strike from me.

292
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,240
Who exactly are you?

293
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:24,240
They say I have nine lives.

294
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,320
To let you go,

295
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,919
I've lost one of them to you just now.

296
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,291
(Nine Divine Dragon, Qi Shaoshang)

297
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:35,440
So you're the
Nine Divine Dragon, Qi Shaoshang.

298
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,399
Sorry for not recognizing you earlier.

299
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,320
Chief Elder Qi,

300
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,120
since when you were the Chief Constable?

301
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,360
Iron Fist resigned from his position.

302
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,799
So there's an opening
in the Four Great Constables.

303
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,480
Divine Marquis requested
that I took over temporarily.

304
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,720
What you did is a felony.

305
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:53,840
After you left the Capital,

306
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:57,480
the Ministry of Justice
issued an arrest warrant for you.

307
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:58,960
They distributed your wanted posters

308
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,200
over 500 li away.

309
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,879
Within the Song's border,

310
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,320
your wanted posters
will be everywhere soon.

311
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:06,840
What do you plan to do?

312
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:11,720
I'll find a hideout to lay low.

313
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,320
I'll decide

314
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:14,759
after this matter blows over.

315
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,240
Divine Marquis sent me here

316
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,279
to give you a direction.

317
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,919
Head to the north.
When you reach the border,

318
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,559
there's a place called Baimao Stronghold.

319
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:24,960
We have some friends

320
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,279
to help you cross the border.

321
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,080
It'll be a long journey.

322
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,679
So you'll suffer for a bit.

323
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,440
Divine Marquis must have made a great effort.

324
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,360
Now,

325
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,600
Divine Marquis is not the only one
who's concerned about you.

326
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,759
People with noble aspirations
will make way for you.

327
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,399
Speaking of which,

328
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:45,360
you have experienced the most
being on the run.

329
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,000
Do you have any words of advice?

330
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,879
Being on the run itself
isn't the most bitter part.

331
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,000
We may never know

332
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,679
when it will be the end of it

333
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,320
and we regain our freedom.

334
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,119
That's the most despair

335
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,039
about being on the run.

336
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,839
Do you regret it?

337
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,200
I know I shouldn't have done it.

338
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,759
But it was a righteous thing to do.

339
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,359
I would do it
even if it's punishable by death.

340
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,680
Even if I have to do it again,

341
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,440
or be reborn to do it again,

342
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:19,720
I'd still do it.

343
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:25,720
Many people want

344
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,880
to do what you did, but they couldn't.

345
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:30,839
The evil may be in power.

346
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,400
But this flame will never die.

347
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,359
Did you set out from the Capital?

348
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:39,920
After I left,

349
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,319
did anything happen
to the House of Sunset Drizzle?

350
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,559
How's Mengzhen?

351
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,799
Mr. Su and Divine Marquis
are in the Capital.

352
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,880
The two famous figures

353
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,400
among the government
and common people are working together.

354
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:55,440
You can rest assured.

355
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:56,640
I'm glad to hear that.

356
00:17:58,799 --> 00:17:59,799
I miss them.

357
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,319
Head north.

358
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,400
Stay alive.

359
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,039
There will be a day you'll reunite.

360
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:32,804
(Ministry of Justice. Dungeon)

361
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,359
Vice House Master Bai,

362
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:49,839
we meet again.

363
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,359
It's me. Remember?

364
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:53,359
Ren Yuan.

365
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,319
That's Ren Lao.

366
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,400
How unexpected.

367
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:00,480
You were soaring in the sky yesterday.

368
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,839
Now you become a prisoner again.

369
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,599
I thought

370
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:08,880
you brats would dissipate

371
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,119
along with Fu Zongshu after he died.

372
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:12,880
How can we do that?

373
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,279
If we become ghosts after we die,

374
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,640
we'd be the ghosts
pushing you to your death.

375
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,480
Vice House Master Bai,

376
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,119
we're here to serve you again.

377
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,880
You're such an upright person.

378
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,119
Have you heard
of waterboarding punishment?

379
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,759
The best face mask is made
from a human face mold.

380
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:47,319
Vice House Master Bai, here I come.

381
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,319
There. Relax.

382
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:53,400
I didn't expect you

383
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,559
to end up in our hands again.

384
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:56,799
Ordinary people

385
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:59,119
could only take five pieces the most.

386
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:03,400
We're just starting. No rush.

387
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:07,079
I'm sure you're better than ordinary people.

388
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,559
Vice House Master Bai,
please enjoy this experience.

389
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,599
Sure enough,
he's not like any ordinary people.

390
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,799
He's indeed above average.

391
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,079
Here.

392
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,559
Chancellor Cai.

393
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,640
It's not the scariest

394
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,880
when a person is fearless

395
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,640
when facing death.

396
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:58,359
The scariest part is despair.

397
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,799
You're not giving up now, are you?

398
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:07,559
Fang Yingkan and Lei Chun

399
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,839
recommended you to me.

400
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,880
I should thank them, then.

401
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,720
But you have
sufficient people working for you.

402
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:19,720
I won't make any difference.

403
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:23,799
Humans have many desires and are born selfish.

404
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:25,119
Someone like you shouldn't be risking

405
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,279
your life for others.

406
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:30,240
You should work for yourself.

407
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,759
Then give me a blade.

408
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:33,319
I'll kill you now

409
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,880
to work for myself!

410
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:36,880
Is that so?

411
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:39,079
Do you want to kill me now?

412
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,480
Let me ask you.

413
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,400
Are you the same

414
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:47,359
as Wang Xiaoshi?

415
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:49,640
To be successful,

416
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:51,960
you must know

417
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,640
what kind of person you are.

418
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,039
I can help you with this.

419
00:21:59,319 --> 00:21:59,839
Guards.

420
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,400
What did you feed me?

421
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,480
It's our first meeting.

422
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:28,440
Take this pill

423
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,880
as a gift from me.

424
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,000
How did I end up here?

425
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,319
That person will face a trial.

426
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,599
Even if you return,

427
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:40,160
he won't be able to wait for you.

428
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:33,799
Since you can't turn
into an animal when you're born,

429
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,799
there's no need to die like humans too.

430
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,039
Kill him.

431
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,640
Yes.

432
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:49,759
Chancellor Cai.

433
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:29,519
You want me to die?

434
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,599
It's easy.

435
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,559
You want me to bow to you?

436
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:36,960
Over my dead body!

437
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,240
Bai Choufei,

438
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:44,160
I shall remember your name.

439
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,240
The Chancellor showed you mercy
and said you should clean yourself up.

440
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,279
Chancellor Cai,
your method is incredible.

441
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,680
Just a small pill is enough

442
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,279
to make Bai Choufei so miserable.

443
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,680
Chancellor Cai, may I be bold to ask

444
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:44,400
how we should deal with Bai?

445
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:47,920
Your means were useless to him.

446
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:50,039
You need to adapt to changes
when carrying out punishments.

447
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,640
Feed him the Heart Devouring Pill daily.

448
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,920
Feed him the pill every two hours

449
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:56,680
until he can't catch his breath.

450
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:58,039
Make him feel weak,

451
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,319
have no energy to resist,

452
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,359
and suffer a living hell.

453
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:03,160
And

454
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,119
he would rather die.

455
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,680
We'll be able to create an animal this way.

456
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,720
I understand.

457
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:41,519
Come here.

458
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,240
Drink this medicinal concoction.

459
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:46,279
I hope it'll help you
stabilize your breathing.

460
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:49,039
Here.

461
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:00,039
Here.

462
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:02,359
Here.

463
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,039
Wipe it.

464
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:14,119
I have a piece of good news for you.

465
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:16,359
In a small town 200 li west

466
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:18,119
of the Capital

467
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:19,680
three days ago,

468
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,799
Nine Divine Dragon, Qi Shaoshang

469
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:25,119
ran into Wang Xiaoshi and Wen Rou.

470
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:26,960
He gave them

471
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,559
the direction to Baimao Stronghold in the north.

472
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:33,960
They're going to Baimao Stronghold?

473
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:34,680
Yes.

474
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:37,799
Don't you have an old acquaintance,

475
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,440
Official Liu Anshi there?

476
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,079
Maybe he can lend them a hand.

477
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,759
You can rest assured now.

478
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,720
Young Lady,

479
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,880
do you have a way
to save Mr. Bai from here?

480
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,920
This is the Ministry of Justice's dungeon.

481
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:25,400
Without Chancellor Cai's permission,

482
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,559
no one can let him out.

483
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,680
I feel so sorry for him.

484
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,279
I've never seen Mr. Bai like this.

485
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,559
They're feeding him the Heart Devouring Pill.

486
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,160
It was used

487
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,960
to deal with the captives during the battle.

488
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:42,839
Anyone who took it will hallucinate

489
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,559
like dreaming.

490
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:47,680
They dream about what they fear the most.

491
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,200
After taking too many of it,

492
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:52,039
they'll lose their mind.

493
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,599
They can't tell hallucination

494
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:57,240
from reality.

495
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,130
(Lingxiang Hall)

496
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,960
I've never seen Mr. Bai looking pitiful like this.

497
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,839
The House of Sunset Drizzle
is in a tragic state now.

498
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,000
Mr. Wang is on the run.

499
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,720
We don't know
how House Master Su's illness is.

500
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:21,680
Now, Mr. Bai is in the dungeon.

501
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:24,160
They even feed him raw meat.

502
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,119
Young Lady.

503
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,119
Young Lady, I'm sorry.

504
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,880
I won't mention it again.

505
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,079
Bai Choufei,

506
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,000
Su Mengzhen,

507
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,480
and Wang Xiaoshi are in misery.

508
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:45,720
What about my father?

509
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,839
Didn't he die miserably in their hands?

510
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,880
Am I not miserable

511
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:51,400
after being humiliated countless times?

512
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,640
Young Lady, I'm sorry.

513
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:57,409
(Lingxiang Hall)

514
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:00,160
No, it's my fault.

515
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,960
Everything in the past

516
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:05,440
is wrong.

517
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:13,880
Since you feel sorry
for the House of Sunset Drizzle,

518
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,839
go there

519
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,160
and do something for me.

520
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,774
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

521
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:23,519
Is there anyone here?

522
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,000
Open the door!

523
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,160
Open the door!

524
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:27,759
Open the door!

525
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:31,839
Miss, it's already late at night.

526
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:32,920
What do you want?

527
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,200
I'm a maidservant
from the Six Half Hall.

528
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,839
Young Lady sent me here
to meet House Master Su.

529
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,240
Mo,

530
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,000
what brings you here

531
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,480
at this late hour?

532
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,000
Young Lady sent me here.

533
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:54,480
She wants me to deliver
a message to House Master Su.

534
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,680
She said Mr. Bai is going through...

535
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,519
Don't be scared.

536
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,599
Just tell us.

537
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,079
Mr. Bai is worse off
than a dog in the dungeon.

538
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:12,000
They feed him with raw meat

539
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:13,400
and muddy water.

540
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,400
They even feed him
with Heart Devouring Pill.

541
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,240
He doesn't look like

542
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:20,400
a human now.

543
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:22,359
Also...

544
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,640
Young Lady also said

545
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,599
she's pleased

546
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:28,799
to see all of you like this.

547
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,640
She wants me to tell House Master Su

548
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:35,079
that she's happy.

549
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:47,960
Thank you.

550
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:49,960
Wuxie,

551
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:52,200
send Miss Mo off.

552
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,319
House Master Su,

553
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,160
she's not a bad person.

554
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,039
She's just...

555
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,160
She is just upset at the moment.

556
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,039
All right. Mo,

557
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:03,160
come with me.

558
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,680
Sir,

559
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,200
are you all right?

560
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,279
It's never this bad

561
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,400
in my whole life.

562
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,880
I feel ashamed.

563
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,200
I can't even help you.

564
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:07,880
I want to do something for you.

565
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,000
Help me close the door.

566
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:18,239
All right.

567
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,239
Sir? Sir!

568
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:39,559
Guards!

569
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,760
Get the physician!

570
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,920
Are you done?

571
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,599
Kill me if you can.

572
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,840
Mr. Bai.

573
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,119
Mr. Bai.

574
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,440
Chancellor Cai doesn't let you die.

575
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,320
So you can't die.

576
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:14,840
You must keep taking this pill
until Chancellor Cai says otherwise.

577
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:15,960
Don't worry.

578
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,719
There won't be any aftereffects.

579
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:18,679
Eat it.

580
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:21,800
Relax, Mr. Bai. Just relax.

581
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,480
Eat it!

582
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,301
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

583
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:37,519
Why are you here?

584
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:39,239
It's cold out here.

585
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:48,960
I sleep on and off all the time.

586
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:51,760
I can't tell if it's day or night.

587
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,719
Xiaoshi left the Capital.

588
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,119
Choufei is in the dungeon.

589
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,920
How many days had it been?

590
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:02,639
It's the fourth day.

591
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,440
Don't worry about Xiaoshi.

592
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:08,159
Divine Marquis' men will watch over him.

593
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,559
As for Bai Choufei...

594
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,639
Can we get the officials we know

595
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,039
to deliver a message?

596
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,559
Hard.

597
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,519
We don't get in touch with them frequently.

598
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,719
It's hard to ask for favors.

599
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:40,760
Set up a meeting for me.

600
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:41,679
With whom?

601
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:21,320

602
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:23,519
