He's inside.

00:02:35,345 --> 00:02:35,986
Sir!

36
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:38,746
Mr. Su.

37
00:02:41,266 --> 00:02:43,225
Wuxie, Xiaoyao,

38
00:02:45,146 --> 00:02:46,706
it's good to see both of you

39
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:48,625
while I'm still alive.

40
00:02:50,665 --> 00:02:51,706
I'm glad you're still alive.

41
00:02:52,825 --> 00:02:53,785
I'm glad you're still alive.

42
00:02:55,026 --> 00:02:55,665
As long as you're alive,

43
00:02:56,505 --> 00:02:59,186
we can avenge our fallen brethren.

44
00:03:02,505 --> 00:03:04,026
Don't forget our promise.

45
00:03:05,746 --> 00:03:07,186
"The fearless brings peace for many,

46
00:03:09,225 --> 00:03:10,866

47
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:16,266
Let's go.

48
00:03:18,026 --> 00:03:20,026
We make for the House of Sunset Drizzle.

49
00:03:48,266 --> 00:03:48,945
Bai!

50
00:03:50,785 --> 00:03:51,706
It's time to let go!

51
00:03:51,785 --> 00:03:52,505
Let go of what?

52
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:53,945
Your obsession.

53
00:03:54,665 --> 00:03:55,345
Never,

54
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:57,146
and I don't want to!

55
00:04:00,785 --> 00:04:02,586
Don't throw your life away
for your obsession!

56
00:04:03,065 --> 00:04:03,945
At this point,

57
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:05,785
there is nothing you can't let go of!

58
00:04:07,225 --> 00:04:08,785
Why should I let go?

59
00:04:16,066 --> 00:04:17,066
Back in Xiliu,

60
00:04:17,785 --> 00:04:19,345
you promised you'd fight by my side.

61
00:04:20,345 --> 00:04:21,305
But when you arrived in the Capital,

62
00:04:21,785 --> 00:04:23,066
when you met Su Mengzhen,

63
00:04:23,785 --> 00:04:24,785
you became his servant

64
00:04:25,545 --> 00:04:26,745
and forgot about our friendship!

65
00:04:27,105 --> 00:04:28,626
You'd even kill me for him now!

66
00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:29,826
You wish to take my life!

67
00:04:35,146 --> 00:04:36,345
If we had worked together,

68
00:04:38,105 --> 00:04:40,826
we would've had fame and glory.

69
00:04:42,466 --> 00:04:44,146
We can share

70
00:04:46,026 --> 00:04:47,745
everything I have now.

71
00:04:48,745 --> 00:04:49,345
Bai.

72
00:04:51,665 --> 00:04:52,946
You said you were worried

73
00:04:54,826 --> 00:04:56,105
that we'd be caged

74
00:04:57,225 --> 00:04:58,386
or stuck on a narrow passage,

75
00:04:59,225 --> 00:05:00,906
that we might fight until death

76
00:05:01,185 --> 00:05:02,626
or fight death together.

77
00:05:03,506 --> 00:05:05,185
But I want no part of your dominion!

78
00:05:05,946 --> 00:05:07,506
I only wish that we had never come here!

79
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:08,506
It's too late!

80
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:11,466
We can't turn back time.

81
00:05:21,826 --> 00:05:22,506
Little Rock?

82
00:05:22,946 --> 00:05:23,626
Cabbage?

83
00:05:24,985 --> 00:05:25,586
Wen Rou...

84
00:05:30,105 --> 00:05:31,026
I'm back.

85
00:05:36,706 --> 00:05:38,185
Someone else came back too.

86
00:05:57,545 --> 00:05:58,305
It's Mengzhen.

87
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:09,425
Mengzhen!

88
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,105
Mengzhen!

89
00:06:27,545 --> 00:06:28,826
I've waited long enough.

90
00:06:44,225 --> 00:06:45,266
Su Mengzhen.

91
00:06:46,225 --> 00:06:47,626
You're finally here.

92
00:06:58,706 --> 00:07:00,105
Take a look at yourself.

93
00:07:01,225 --> 00:07:02,826
You're like a living husk.

94
00:07:06,665 --> 00:07:07,305
Lei Chun.

95
00:07:09,425 --> 00:07:10,785
You are my wife.

96
00:07:12,105 --> 00:07:13,146
After all this time,

97
00:07:15,105 --> 00:07:17,345
you brought me nothing but a husk?

98
00:07:17,345 --> 00:07:19,545
When you thought
you had control over everything,

99
00:07:20,466 --> 00:07:21,826
that you enjoyed your glory,

100
00:07:22,305 --> 00:07:23,586
I took him in.

101
00:07:24,865 --> 00:07:26,026
I bet you never expected

102
00:07:26,626 --> 00:07:28,185
that the secret tunnel

103
00:07:28,545 --> 00:07:30,266
would lead to the Six Half Hall.

104
00:07:49,785 --> 00:07:50,586
Well,

105
00:07:52,665 --> 00:07:54,545
I must thank you for bringing him here.

106
00:07:56,386 --> 00:07:57,266
Su Mengzhen,

107
00:07:58,626 --> 00:08:00,425
it was such a shame
that I didn't kill you.

108
00:08:02,506 --> 00:08:04,386
It's not that you didn't try,

109
00:08:05,225 --> 00:08:06,906
you simply failed to kill me.

110
00:08:06,985 --> 00:08:07,785
Don't get so full of yourself.

111
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:10,466
Be mindful of what you receive.

112
00:08:11,466 --> 00:08:12,345
Lei Chun

113
00:08:12,345 --> 00:08:13,665
is not the same anymore.

114
00:08:14,706 --> 00:08:16,225
She is the Chancellor's foster daughter.

115
00:08:18,946 --> 00:08:19,865
In my heart,

116
00:08:20,506 --> 00:08:21,665
she will always be the same.

117
00:08:23,745 --> 00:08:24,706
I can look past

118
00:08:25,425 --> 00:08:26,386
your betrayal.

119
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:28,826
But you killed my brethren and friends.

120
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:30,225
For that,

121
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:32,545
I must make you pay.

122
00:08:33,585 --> 00:08:35,305
Wang Xiaoshi has met His Majesty.

123
00:08:36,146 --> 00:08:38,065
The Chancellor might already be in trouble.

124
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:40,746
Bai Choufei.

125
00:08:41,986 --> 00:08:43,226
You're just a spent pawn.

126
00:08:56,346 --> 00:08:57,106
Little Rock.

127
00:08:57,545 --> 00:08:58,825
You've talked to His Majesty.

128
00:08:59,585 --> 00:09:00,346
It seems

129
00:09:01,986 --> 00:09:03,026
kidnapping Wen Rou

130
00:09:03,785 --> 00:09:04,866
and using that dispatch order

131
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:07,185
were a waste of time.

132
00:09:08,746 --> 00:09:10,305
Having control over one's life and death

133
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,106
is too easy in the martial arts world.

134
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:15,226
I didn't understand it back then,

135
00:09:16,266 --> 00:09:17,705
but I get it now.

136
00:09:21,785 --> 00:09:23,065
We took an oath together

137
00:09:23,545 --> 00:09:25,226
and became sworn brothers.

138
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,545
But in the end,
you tried to kill Mengzhen,

139
00:09:28,746 --> 00:09:29,785
and I tried to kill you.

140
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:33,866
The martial arts world
shaped us into what we are.

141
00:09:41,626 --> 00:09:42,305
Bai.

142
00:09:44,185 --> 00:09:45,226
Mengzhen is back.

143
00:09:47,585 --> 00:09:48,425
You lost.

144
00:09:51,305 --> 00:09:52,185
Give up now.

145
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:54,346
You want me to give up?

146
00:09:54,746 --> 00:09:55,665
How do I give up?

147
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,825
Do you want me to kneel before you?

148
00:09:59,146 --> 00:09:59,785
Is that what you want?

149
00:10:21,626 --> 00:10:22,266
Little Rock.

150
00:10:24,986 --> 00:10:26,106
As long as I live,

151
00:10:28,146 --> 00:10:29,465
I can still win.

152
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:08,945
Why didn't you do it?

153
00:11:10,065 --> 00:11:11,226
He accidentally

154
00:11:11,226 --> 00:11:12,705
hurt his loved one with this sword.

155
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:14,746
He spent his life in regret.

156
00:11:16,945 --> 00:11:17,906
Before he passed on,

157
00:11:18,866 --> 00:11:20,626
he made one side of the sword blunt.

158
00:11:21,945 --> 00:11:24,106
He wanted the future wielders of the sword

159
00:11:24,986 --> 00:11:26,065
can show mercy.

160
00:11:27,226 --> 00:11:28,785
To retain the world and its people,

161
00:11:29,506 --> 00:11:31,065
to retain the times and you.

162
00:11:33,266 --> 00:11:34,506
I'm the wielder of Retainment.

163
00:11:36,146 --> 00:11:37,226
I have a heart of retainment.

164
00:11:39,506 --> 00:11:40,906
I want you to live.

165
00:12:04,585 --> 00:12:05,465
This...

166
00:12:08,785 --> 00:12:09,986
is for our brothers.

167
00:12:18,785 --> 00:12:19,746
We are even now.

168
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:27,945
From now on,

169
00:12:29,866 --> 00:12:30,705
consider

170
00:12:35,346 --> 00:12:36,785
we had never met each other.

171
00:14:23,746 --> 00:14:25,465
You are the House Master of Sunset Drizzle.

172
00:14:26,785 --> 00:14:27,665
I've brought you home.

173
00:14:33,705 --> 00:14:35,506
We fought by each other's side,

174
00:14:36,305 --> 00:14:37,986
but now we tried
to take each other's life.

175
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,065
Nothing is the same now.

176
00:14:45,705 --> 00:14:46,746
I failed.

177
00:14:48,545 --> 00:14:49,866
The monster he has become

178
00:14:51,065 --> 00:14:52,665
proves that I have failed.

179
00:14:54,626 --> 00:14:55,665
Before my father passed on,

180
00:14:57,425 --> 00:14:58,346
he told me

181
00:14:58,746 --> 00:14:59,705
that I should use Bai Choufei

182
00:15:00,185 --> 00:15:01,585
for my plot for revenge.

183
00:15:03,665 --> 00:15:05,425
But Bai Choufei got too ambitious.

184
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:08,106
I fell prey to my own scheme.

185
00:15:10,305 --> 00:15:11,465
In the martial arts world,

186
00:15:12,226 --> 00:15:13,825
he has dozens of aliases

187
00:15:14,425 --> 00:15:15,785
and failed numerous times.

188
00:15:16,425 --> 00:15:17,346
It took time and effort

189
00:15:17,945 --> 00:15:20,026
for him to get to the top.

190
00:15:23,825 --> 00:15:25,065
Those in power

191
00:15:25,906 --> 00:15:27,146
can't afford any failures.

192
00:15:28,506 --> 00:15:29,346
But tonight,

193
00:15:31,746 --> 00:15:32,746
there is no winner.

194
00:15:43,705 --> 00:15:44,746
After tonight,

195
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,146
the martial arts world
will no longer need you.

196
00:15:50,266 --> 00:15:51,425
You took the medicine.

197
00:15:53,065 --> 00:15:54,626
You must never disobey me

198
00:15:55,545 --> 00:15:57,146
or break my heart again.

199
00:15:59,346 --> 00:16:01,065
We can be together forever.

200
00:16:13,545 --> 00:16:18,346
At first, I intended to conquer the world.

201

But I had no choice
but to hide under the dirt.

I dreamt of ruling the world,

It hurts.

I thought the worst thing to happen to me

235
00:19:54,185 --> 00:19:55,425
was not having you.

236

But what pains me even more

is that you're not happy.

238
00:20:04,826 --> 00:20:07,786

Sir...

246
00:22:48,386 --> 00:22:49,866
When I first returned to the Capital,

247
00:22:51,265 --> 00:22:53,185
my only family was taken from me.

248
00:22:56,185 --> 00:22:57,705
Death had taken my father,

249
00:22:59,425 --> 00:23:01,265
but life brought me my two brothers.

250
00:23:02,546 --> 00:23:03,425
In hindsight,

251
00:23:04,386 --> 00:23:06,066
the happiest time of my life

252
00:23:07,705 --> 00:23:10,185
was the time I spent with my brothers.

253

254
00:23:25,185 --> 00:23:25,826
thank you.

256
00:23:32,866 --> 00:23:34,346
are in your care now.

Sorry.

Even now,

262
00:23:55,745 --> 00:23:56,985
I still can't go with you.

263
00:23:57,826 --> 00:23:58,665
Forget about me.

264
00:23:59,265 --> 00:24:00,386

272

My life

273
00:24:34,626 --> 00:24:36,025
has been less than meaningful.

274
00:24:36,745 --> 00:24:37,826
Don't be saddened by my passing.

275
00:24:39,906 --> 00:24:41,465

Do it!

279
00:25:11,106 --> 00:25:13,146
Why did you do it?

280
00:25:13,146 --> 00:25:15,945
Why?

281
00:25:18,665 --> 00:25:20,306

"I had no choice
but to cleanse the Imperial Court

and eradicate the treacherous officials.

301

That is to uphold
the code of the ancestors

stripped of his title and ranks.

305
00:28:21,586 --> 00:28:23,066
He will be banished as a peasant

306
00:28:23,306 --> 00:28:24,826
and exiled to the border frontier.

307

(When I was about
to reach the chess parlor,)

327

00:29:58,866 --> 00:30:00,225
(That felt great.)

340
00:30:01,306 --> 00:30:03,346
(It was as though time had stopped)

341
00:30:03,626 --> 00:30:04,906
(and we had the world to ourselves.)

342
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:08,265
(When we parted ways today,)

343
00:30:08,826 --> 00:30:10,626
(I noticed a zit on Mengzhen's face.)

344
00:30:11,546 --> 00:30:12,665
(It was under his left eye.)

345
00:30:13,066 --> 00:30:14,106
(It almost looked like a mole.)

346
00:30:16,626 --> 00:30:18,346
(We could never have enough time,)

347
00:30:19,465 --> 00:30:20,665
(and time flies like an arrow.)

348
00:30:22,225 --> 00:30:23,346
(But I like that.)

349
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:25,146
(I'll grow up)

350
00:30:25,586 --> 00:30:26,945
(and someday,)

351
00:30:26,985 --> 00:30:29,146
(I can wake up with Mengzhen
right next to me every morning.)

352
00:30:30,185 --> 00:30:32,066
(I can't wait for that day to come.)

353
00:30:35,146 --> 00:30:35,906
(Of course,)

354
00:30:36,665 --> 00:30:39,025
(I look toward
to our next meeting already.)

355
00:30:40,265 --> 00:30:41,346
(I hope the day comes soon.)

356
00:30:45,386 --> 00:30:47,066
(Wuxie sent a letter yesterday.)

357
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:50,826
(Mengzhen asked to meet me
at the chess parlor tomorrow.)

358
00:30:52,066 --> 00:30:52,705
(I'm excited.)

359
00:30:55,106 --> 00:30:56,425
(We'll meet again)

360
00:30:56,425 --> 00:30:57,346
(in mere hours.)

361
00:30:58,985 --> 00:31:00,505
(I can't help but smile a little.)

362
00:31:02,146 --> 00:31:06,306
(Mengzhen is probably
thinking about me too.)

363
00:31:47,465 --> 00:31:48,945
To retain the world and its people,

364
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,346
to retain the times and you.

365
00:31:53,505 --> 00:31:54,945
At the end of our journey,

366
00:31:56,945 --> 00:31:58,665
there is nothing I could save.

367
00:32:24,386 --> 00:32:25,225
You still have me.

368
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,146
I'll never leave you.

369
00:32:28,386 --> 00:32:29,425
Whatever the future holds for us,

370
00:32:30,745 --> 00:32:31,705
I'll be there for you.

371
00:32:35,546 --> 00:32:36,386
Xiaoshi.

372
00:32:38,185 --> 00:32:39,505
Bid your brothers farewell.

373
00:32:47,786 --> 00:32:48,985
The past can't be undone,

374
00:32:50,146 --> 00:32:51,546
so strive for a better future.

375
00:32:52,225 --> 00:32:53,346
The will of the fallen

376
00:32:54,265 --> 00:32:55,306
must never be forgotten.

377
00:32:56,066 --> 00:32:57,066

(Zhuoying Pavilion)

405
00:34:27,425 --> 00:34:27,985
Martial Uncle.

406
00:34:28,386 --> 00:34:28,906
Official Liu.

407
00:34:29,585 --> 00:34:30,306
Xiaoshi?

408
00:34:30,585 --> 00:34:31,386
Everything is in order.

409
00:34:36,666 --> 00:34:37,306
You flatter me.

410
00:34:38,866 --> 00:34:41,625
You saved the country and the people.

411
00:34:42,025 --> 00:34:42,746
You deserve our respect.

412
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:44,746
Chancellor Cai is no more.

413
00:34:45,186 --> 00:34:47,666
His Majesty will eradicate
his associates soon.

414
00:34:49,465 --> 00:34:50,266
But,

415
00:34:51,826 --> 00:34:52,746
are you really leaving?

416
00:34:52,746 --> 00:34:53,346
Yes.

417
00:34:54,465 --> 00:34:55,346
The world is vast.

418
00:34:56,666 --> 00:34:58,186
There are many places I haven't been to.

419
00:34:59,386 --> 00:35:00,386
I want to travel.

420
00:35:01,145 --> 00:35:02,666
But the House of Sunset Drizzle

421
00:35:03,025 --> 00:35:04,306
needs a leader.

422
00:35:04,985 --> 00:35:07,346
You are the perfect person for that job.

423
00:35:07,465 --> 00:35:09,465
I'm the worst leader they could have.

424
00:35:10,105 --> 00:35:10,945
I even burned my sword.

425
00:35:11,186 --> 00:35:12,585
The past

426
00:35:13,585 --> 00:35:14,786
is but a distant memory.

427
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:16,346
Martial Uncle.

428
00:35:17,545 --> 00:35:19,346
Let me be a free drifter.

429
00:35:20,266 --> 00:35:20,826
Very well.

430
00:35:22,306 --> 00:35:23,826
I can recommend a candidate.

431
00:35:24,585 --> 00:35:26,025
He will be a great leader.

432
00:35:27,505 --> 00:35:28,186
Who is it?

433
00:35:28,465 --> 00:35:29,386
I wrote him a letter.

434
00:35:30,186 --> 00:35:31,985
I trust his skill and character.

435
00:35:33,065 --> 00:35:34,346
He will arrive soon.

436
00:35:34,985 --> 00:35:37,386
You can decide if he is fit to lead.

437
00:35:39,105 --> 00:35:39,545
Very well.

438
00:35:42,706 --> 00:35:43,266
Sirs,

439
00:35:44,145 --> 00:35:46,945
this is where I bid you goodbye.

440
00:35:47,425 --> 00:35:47,985
Xiaoshi.

441
00:35:50,266 --> 00:35:51,065
Take care.

442
00:35:51,505 --> 00:35:52,266
Take care.

443
00:35:58,355 --> 00:36:00,090
(Eminence of Heavy Bearer)

444
00:36:06,025 --> 00:36:08,465
This boy is a true hero.

445
00:36:09,786 --> 00:36:13,065
He is one of a kind.

446
00:36:27,266 --> 00:36:29,105
Chancellor.

447
00:36:36,786 --> 00:36:37,945
There are some issues.

448
00:36:38,786 --> 00:36:40,145
I must leave my post for now.

449
00:36:41,105 --> 00:36:42,025
Is there anyone

450
00:36:43,425 --> 00:36:45,666
willing to be my liaison

451
00:36:46,025 --> 00:36:47,226
with the Imperial Court?

452
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:49,186
But...

453
00:36:50,505 --> 00:36:52,505
We are willing to serve you.

454
00:36:59,465 --> 00:37:00,065
Report!

455
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:04,266
Advisor, a letter from Wang Xiaoshi.

456
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:11,600
(Chou Shi House)

457
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:12,545
(I was once told)

458
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:14,945
(that the end of the path)

459
00:37:15,906 --> 00:37:17,105
(was only big enough for one.)

460
00:37:18,465 --> 00:37:20,226
(Only the victor can live.)

461
00:37:21,186 --> 00:37:22,386
(But I disagree.)

462
00:37:24,666 --> 00:37:26,025
(The world is vast)

463
00:37:26,505 --> 00:37:27,625
(and full of possibilities.)

464
00:37:29,145 --> 00:37:30,266
(Whether it's the House,)

465
00:37:30,786 --> 00:37:31,786
(the Trunk Tower,)

466
00:37:32,585 --> 00:37:33,945
(or a rural town,)

467
00:37:35,025 --> 00:37:36,786
(they are all parts of the journey.)

468
00:37:39,505 --> 00:37:40,386
(I took a stop.)

469
00:37:41,505 --> 00:37:42,666
(I must now move on.)

470
00:37:45,706 --> 00:37:46,545
(My friends,)

471
00:37:48,145 --> 00:37:49,025
(take care.)

472
00:38:42,408 --> 00:38:46,932
(Silence and no intrusion)

473
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:05,706
You two, dismissed.

474
00:39:06,145 --> 00:39:07,065
I must have a word with him.

475
00:39:07,906 --> 00:39:08,746
Yes.

476
00:39:27,945 --> 00:39:28,945
Wang Xiaoshi.

477
00:39:31,025 --> 00:39:32,266
I've heard about you.

478
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:36,786
The people think you're a revered hero.

479
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:40,425
Every man dies eventually.

480
00:39:41,985 --> 00:39:43,786
The only thing
that remains revered forever

481
00:39:44,585 --> 00:39:45,266
isn't a man

482
00:39:46,266 --> 00:39:47,505
or a hero.

483
00:39:51,105 --> 00:39:51,945
It's power.

484
00:40:04,266 --> 00:40:05,386
Chancellor Cai has power.

485
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:08,906
I can strip him of his title and ranks,

486
00:40:09,386 --> 00:40:10,465
but even if he's at

487
00:40:10,786 --> 00:40:12,266
the edge of the world,

488
00:40:12,666 --> 00:40:14,186
as soon as he says the word,

489
00:40:14,266 --> 00:40:15,985
a dozen of officers

490
00:40:15,985 --> 00:40:17,266
will say the same thing.

491
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:19,786
A revered figure indeed.

492
00:40:23,625 --> 00:40:24,706
Over time,

493
00:40:25,985 --> 00:40:27,105
the Imperial Court

494
00:40:27,786 --> 00:40:28,786
could be

495
00:40:28,786 --> 00:40:31,065
doing Chancellor Cai's bidding

496
00:40:31,786 --> 00:40:34,386
or perhaps they truly
want to serve the nation.

497
00:40:36,105 --> 00:40:37,746
I can't say for sure now.

498
00:40:45,386 --> 00:40:47,625
You deliver me a document.

499
00:40:50,065 --> 00:40:51,266
What good does it do?

500
00:41:27,786 --> 00:41:29,145
You came alone?

501
00:41:30,186 --> 00:41:31,266
Have you thought of the consequences?

502
00:41:32,065 --> 00:41:33,226
I didn't come alone.

503
00:41:34,145 --> 00:41:35,105
My brothers and I

504
00:41:36,465 --> 00:41:37,266
are here to take your life.

505
00:42:07,065 --> 00:42:07,945
My name is Wang Xiaoshi.

506
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:10,746
I killed the treacherous Chancellor Cai.

507
00:42:13,666 --> 00:42:14,425
Arrest me if you will.

508
00:42:19,786 --> 00:42:21,105

509
00:42:22,025 --> 00:42:23,226
will escort you to safety.

510
00:42:23,545 --> 00:42:24,625
The Blade of Zhang Ba, Luo Wuxia,

511
00:42:24,906 --> 00:42:26,105
will escort you to safety.

512
00:42:26,706 --> 00:42:27,786
I, Mountain Cleaver Yin Shengxue,

513
00:42:28,186 --> 00:42:29,545

514
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:31,746

00:42:32,025 --> 00:42:33,105
will escort you to safety.

516
00:42:33,706 --> 00:42:37,465
We will escort you to safety.

517
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,266
Has any of you seen
Chancellor Cai's murderer?

518
00:42:43,706 --> 00:42:44,386
No.

519
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,266
Start searching now!

520
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:49,186
Let's go.

521
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:49,786
Let's go.

522
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:06,266
Warriors.

523
00:43:10,786 --> 00:43:11,545
Thank you.

524
00:43:29,266 --> 00:43:29,985
What's wrong?

525
00:43:30,226 --> 00:43:31,386
I came for you.

526
00:43:31,706 --> 00:43:33,105
The others followed.

527
00:43:33,465 --> 00:43:34,465
I can't do a thing about that.

528
00:43:35,505 --> 00:43:36,625
What is that supposed to mean?

529
00:43:36,945 --> 00:43:38,746
This is only temporary.

530
00:43:38,985 --> 00:43:39,425
That's right.

531
00:43:40,065 --> 00:43:41,266
It's just a trip together.

532
00:43:41,545 --> 00:43:42,545
If you two take off

533
00:43:42,545 --> 00:43:43,545
and be on your merry way,

534
00:43:43,786 --> 00:43:44,746
no one will stop you.

535
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:47,425
Where are you going?

536
00:43:48,145 --> 00:43:49,746
You wouldn't be the next House Master.

537
00:43:50,465 --> 00:43:51,945
I can't stay in the House anymore.

538
00:43:52,266 --> 00:43:53,145
I figure

539
00:43:54,025 --> 00:43:55,025
I should travel.

keep you safe on the path.

543
00:44:00,226 --> 00:44:01,386

and full of possibilities.

545
00:44:03,025 --> 00:44:05,186
We'd like to widen our views.

546
00:44:05,945 --> 00:44:06,505
Sure.

547
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:07,746
Let's go.

548
00:44:08,025 --> 00:44:08,786
