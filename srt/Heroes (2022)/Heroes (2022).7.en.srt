(Hardship weathered.
Aspirations renewed. Part 1)

32
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,319
Wang Xiaoshi,

33
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,400
you are indeed tough.

34
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:24,479
Even the rope broke off.

35
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,400
But remember this,

36
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:29,000
the world belongs to us.

37
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,960
When I have my eyes on you,

38
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,039
you won't be able to escape.

39
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,080
Bai Choufei.

40
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:48,919
I have heard of this name in Xiliu.

41
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:51,039
Back then, you didn't even have a name.

42
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,039
You called yourself the Wanderer.

43
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,879
If you're the Wanderer,

44
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,800
you should wander around.

45
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,319
Why are you in the Capital?

46
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,840
As the Minister of Justice,

47
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,840
you ignored egregious crimes

48
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,960
to question my motive for coming
to the Capital.

49
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,080
I must say the Capital has a very unique
legal system.

50
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,680
If I'm happy,

51
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,879
you will walk as a freeman
even if you're a murderer.

52
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,599
If I'm not happy,

53
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:22,400
even touching the Bianliang's rampart

54
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,960
lands you the death penalty.

55
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,400
When it comes to the law,

56
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,520
I get to judge
whether you're a criminal or not.

57
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,280
Understood?

58
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,599
Why are you here in the Capital?

59
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,719
Even a Wanderer

60
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,000
wants to make a name for himself.

61
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,080
So why did you help Su Mengzhen?

62
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,719
If I help Su Mengzhen
claim the position,

63
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,360
I'll be a contributor to the
House of Sunset Drizzle.

64
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:48,560
It won't be long
until I have my breakout.

65
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,319
You will achieve that goal too

66
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,719
if you kill Su Mengzhen.

67
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,120
Why didn't you kill him?

68
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,360
If you want to be famous,

69
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,080
you need to be selective.

70
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,280
If you're willing to do anything,

71
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,919
what different are you from livestock?

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,800
Witty, aren't you?

73
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,079
Understood.

74
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,879
Here, Mr. Bai.

75
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,839
Relax.

76
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,079
Sit tight.

77
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,560
Bai Choufei,

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,959
the Capital is not a place where you can
come and go.

79
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,600
Cool your head off.

80
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,959
The world belongs to us.

81
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,160
When I have my eyes on you,

82
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,279

There's no place to hide.

85

Don't worry.

86
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,839
The official won't let him die just yet.

87
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,560
You must be hungry.

88
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,120
Come.

89
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,120
Have some.

90
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,879
I deboned it myself.

91
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:13,399

Oh,

99
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,160
head to House of Sunset Drizzle tomorrow.

100

Su Mengzhen just became its Master.

101
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,600
We need to send him a gift

102
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:55,839
to congratulate him.

103
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:56,480

110
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,000

anything.

Are you here for the performance?

115
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,040
I hate people like you.

116
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,560
All performers here are females.

117
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,399
Can't the audience be a female too?

126
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,600
What is she called again?

127
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,279
It's...

128
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:10,279
Come.

129
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,839
Miss,

130
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:17,120
are they to your liking?

131
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,560
No.

132
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,600
The one I'm looking
for has a slim waist.

133
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,759
I heard she dances very well.

134
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:24,920
Dance?

135
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,560
But our performers here
are good at dancing.

00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,480
Yes!

137
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,559
We know how to do it too.

138
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,000
Not them.

139
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,919
She's also very pretty.

140
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
We only have the finest beauties here.

141
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,399
So you want...

142
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:44,440
She has a very big head.

143
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,440
A very big head?

144
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:50,320
Does she...

145
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,559
That's her!

146
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:56,080
If you want to see me, Miss,

147
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,759
come up here yourself.

148
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,200
I will.

149
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,399
I'm not scared of you.

150
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,360
Move along.

151
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:10,960
When men come here
to watch my performance,

152
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,679
they drink liquor.

153
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,639
But since you're here, Miss,

154
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,639
why don't we replace liquor with water?

155
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,919
You're into this, Miss?

156
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,200
You're a seductress.

157
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,639
No wonder you're good at luring men.

158
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,639
Lie down there.

159
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,840
Don't do anything.

160
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,240
What are you looking for, Miss?

161
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,879
Just tell me.

162
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:03,000
Where is that brat?

163
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:03,840
That brat?

164
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,279
Which one?

165
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,000
The one who left his clothes here.

166
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,519
Oh, I remember.

167
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:10,679
However,

168
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,679
I only remember
what he looked like without clothes.

169
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,840
After he put on clothes,

170
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,000
he left.

171
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,600
You...

172
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,440
What did you do to that dummy?

173
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,480
Dummy?

174
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,840
He's not dumb.

175
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,279
He told me
whatever I told him to tell me.

176
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,000
So adorable.

177
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,039
You're lying!

178
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,480
I was with him last night.

179
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,600
You weren't there.

180
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,159
How do you know I am lying?

181
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:33,720
Little Rock is not like that!

182
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,480
That depends on
what kind of women he meets.

183
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,000
For someone like me,

184
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,000
he'll say whatever to please me.

185
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,279
You!

186
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,399
There are many ways
for a woman to seduce a man.

187
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:05,679
Throwing tantrums is not one of them.

188
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,840
But I like to.

189
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,399
And I will completely trash this place.

190
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,200
My, my. You're flustered.

191
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,720
Are you in love with him?

192
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:16,840
No, I'm not!

193
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,360
I'm a close friend of his.

194
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,080
Now, stay away from him!

195
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,159
And if I don't want to?

196
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,120
You are shameless!

197
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,000
Go destroy everything.

198
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:32,960
I'll watch.

199
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,720
I...

200
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,679
You're evil!

201
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,240
Let go of me.

202
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,080
You hear me?

203
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,000
Let go of me.

204
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,440
Do you know who my martial brother is?

205
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,399
He will raze this place to the ground.

206
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:51,360
Let go of me! Let me down.

207
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:53,240
Now!

208
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,200
One, two. Go.

209
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:57,679
You...

210
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,600
You're just bullying me.

211
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,720
Wait here.

212
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,480
I'll bring my backup.

213
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,679
Do you know who he is?

214
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,799
Floor Manager Yang of Sunset Drizzle.

215
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,960
We're close.

216
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,120
They bully me!

217
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,039
It's her there!

218
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:14,960
She's that evil woman.

219
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,200
Sorry for the trouble, Miss Xiaoyao.

220
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,480
No worries.

221
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,360
What is wrong with you?

222
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,600
Why are you taking her side?

223
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,799
She bullied me.

224
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,559
Why did you apologize to them?

225
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:39,840
Stop staring at me.

226
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,039
Teach her a lesson!

227
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:43,759
Why are you taking me away?

228
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:45,960
They bully me. They are in the wrong!

229
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:47,030
(House of Sanhe)

230
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,759
Stop dragging me. Let go!

231
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,799
Bad Advisor,

232
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,440
why didn't you help me?

233
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,840
Everyone in the Capital

234
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,720
knows you're the martial sister
of Su Mengzhen.

235
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:58,759
Someone notified me

236
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:00,200
as soon as you started this ruckus.

237
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,080
Now, follow me.

238
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,039
They even accused me of wrongdoing.

239
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,720
Unbelievable!

240
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:04,960
You're not that much better.

241
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,799
You almost destroyed
the entire building.

242
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:08,679
You deserve it.

243
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:10,240
I'm not here to cause a scene.

244
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,159
But that beguiling woman
seduced Little Rock.

245
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:13,919
He didn't come home last night.

246
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,840
Even Cabbage went missing.

247
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,519
I'm here looking for them.

248
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,279
And that woman was there to piss me off.

249
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,440
Look what she can do
and compare it to what you can do.

250
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,200
Also,

251
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,159
do you think both of them have the money
to visit House of Sanhe?

252
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,960
All right. It's been two days.

253
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,799
Come back with me.

254
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:29,919
No, thanks.

255
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:32,120
I don't want
to give Mengzhen more trouble.

256
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:34,759
Just because you're not there
with Mengzhen

257
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:36,399
doesn't mean
you are giving him less trouble.

258
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,960
Fine, I get it.

259
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,720
I will go back and keep him company.

260
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,879
But Little Rock and Cabbage...

261
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:42,879
I'll help.

262
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,519
I'll help you find them.

263
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:46,720
All right.

264
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:48,000
You're a good friend.

265
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:04,360
Who are they?

266
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,240
They are from the Ministry of Justice.

267
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
Ren Lao.

268
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,759
Ren Yuan.

269
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:14,480
We came under
the Minister of Justice's order

270
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,000
to visit House of Sunset Drizzle's
new Master.

271
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,519
I see.

272
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,720
Come in, please.

273
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,639
No need.

274
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:28,159
You are holding a funeral
for the previous House Master.

275
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:29,279
We shouldn't go inside.

276
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,759
Please invite Mr. Su out.

277
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,320
All right. Give me a moment.

278
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,960
Invite Master out.

279
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,120
Please tie their horses to a post.

280
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,759
House Master, the people from
the Ministry of Justice came

281
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:08,559
looking for you.

282
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:14,919
People come to me
even if I don't want to see them.

283
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:31,258
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

284
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:35,960
Greetings, Mr. Su.

285
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,559
While I am the new House Master,

286
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:42,360
I'm just an ordinary person
in the martial arts world.

287
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,879
I can't possibly accept the gift
from the minister.

288
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,000
If the House Master of Sunset Drizzle
cannot accept it,

289
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,759
then no one
in the martial arts world can accept it.

290
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,679
Whether you have the right or not

291
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,080
to accept the gift from the minister,

292
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,759
is out of our

293
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:00,919
and your control, Mr. Su.

294
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,120
All right.

295
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,720
I shall accept it.

296
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,679
Just accept it?

297
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,919
Today is the day you're inaugurated
as the new House Master.

298
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,440
No need to be humble.

299
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,960
Let us celebrate this occasion!

300
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,879
Exactly! Why the long face?

301
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,000
Light it up.

302
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,679
The previous House Master
just passed away.

303
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,480
If we light this firecracker up,

304
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,840
you two will be happy

305
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,200
but my friends inside won't be.

306
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,240
Mr. Su.

307
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,400
If you do this,

308
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,680
we can't answer to the minister.

309
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:11,920
My minister is waiting
to hear the festivity.

310
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,680
Then he should come here himself.

311
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,599
Mr. Su.

312
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,799
May I remind you that your friends
are still in the ministry's custody?

313
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:23,400
If you don't light this firecracker,

314
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,480
they might have a rough time.

315
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,599
Light it up.

316
00:17:41,045 --> 00:17:43,631
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

317
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,599
You...

318
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:19,119
Congratulations on your new post
from the minister!

319
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:23,400
Please tell him

320
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:24,839
that I will visit him

321
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,960
when I have the time.

322
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,640
That's what we want to hear.

323
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,400
And don't just visit the minister.

324
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,160
Your friends want you to visit them too.

325
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,559
Little Rock and Cabbage

326
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:41,279
are both incarcerated
in the Ministry of Justice.

327
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,240
One eyewitness saw last night

328
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,640
that they were taken away
in the Syrup Alley.

329
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,279
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

330
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,279
I just received the intel.

331
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,920
They are too dumb to wipe their mouth
after sneaking a bite.

332
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,400
What kind of crime can they commit?

333
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:54,640
They are related to the Sunset Drizzle.

334
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:56,680
Capturing them is just a power move.

335
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:59,519
Mengzhen, you have to save them.

336
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,039
They just came to the Capital.

337
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,720
They were planning
to serve Sunset Drizzle.

338
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,240
But out of a sudden,
they are imprisoned.

339
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,119
This is tricky.

340
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:10,759
I'll find a solution.

341
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,160
Let's go, Wen Rou.

342
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:18,680
I'm not done yet.

343
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,240
Little Rock.

344
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,759
Why did you drag me here?

345
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,920
House of Sunset Drizzle has a rule.

346
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,240
Never deal with the politicians.

347
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:34,720
The previous House Master set this rule.

348
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,960
This is the core

349
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,119
of the problem.

350
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,920
They arrested Wang Xiaoshi
and Bai Choufei,

351
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,960
threatened Mengzhen,

352
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,359
and even lit up the firecracker
for a sect in mourning.

353
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:45,279
They went overboard.

354
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:46,880
I cannot take this silently.

355
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,519
Enough.

356
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:50,680
The Ministry of Justice is barbaric

357
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,279
but that doesn't mean
you should stoop to their level.

358
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,240
You have an identity.

359
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:55,519
Behave.

360
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:57,920
Fine.

361
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,039
I'll follow the rules.

362
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,359
Follow the rules?

363
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:09,519
Something bad will happen.

364
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:22,759
Stop.

365
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,440
Put it here.

366
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,400
Yes, Miss.

367
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:28,200
Stop.

368
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:30,519
What are you doing?

369
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,039
We are carrying the Minister of Justice.

370
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:34,160
Who dares to stop us?

371
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,720
I'm looking for the minister.

372
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:37,839
He sent House of Sunset Drizzle
the most gracious gift

373
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,400
and I shall return the favor today.

374
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,400
Sir, she said she's here
to present a gift.

375
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,519
Protect the minister!

376
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,440
Protect the minister!

377
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,000
Did you receive my gift, dear minister?

378
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,680
Do you like it?

379
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,519
It's like Chinese New Year!

380
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,680
I have been an official for many years

381
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,960
and this is the first time
someone blasted my carriage off.

382
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:29,279
You're young, Miss Wen, and ferocious.

383
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,519
Courtesy demands reciprocity.

384
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,680
When Uncle Su passed away,
you lit firecrackers.

385
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,279
And now, I used fireworks
to decorate your carriage.

386
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,480
Favor returned.

387
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:39,119
Audacious.

388
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,960
Aren't you worried
that I will arrest you?

389
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,240
What are you waiting for?

390
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,279
Arrest me already.

391
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,200
Spare me from this cold weather.

392
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,440
We are now out in the cold.

393
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,279
I'm young

394
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:49,160
so I'll be fine.

395
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,839
But at your age,

396
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,400
catching a cold is a serious business.

397
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,759
I know your plan.

398
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,279
You want to go to the dungeon

399
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,759
to visit your friends.

400
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,920
I won't arrest you.

401
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:10,200
You're the daughter of Lord of Luoyang.

402
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:12,920
I have to respect your father.

403
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:19,759
The young Miss Wen

404
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:20,880
enjoys the cold weather.

405
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,759
Have fun.

406
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:26,480
Let's head back.

407
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:27,160
Yes, sir.

408
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:34,839
You will be handsomely rewarded.

409
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,200
Thanks, sir.

I want to save you two

413
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,839
but I'm too useless.

414
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,920
I can't.

415
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,599
You must be having a rough time
in prison.

416
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,240
I hope this firework

417
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,039
will give you the motivation
to stay strong.

418
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:34,039
I will figure out a solution.

419

We can.

We have to.

423
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:54,440
We need to find a way.

What can we do?

426
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:06,359
At least...

427
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,279
At least we can wait for Mengzhen.

428
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:14,200

00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,480
Come.

509
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:53,160
What brought you

510
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,200
here?

511
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:56,279
Just a small matter.

512
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:59,319
Two friends of mine went into prison.

513
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,440
I want to know what they did.

514
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:03,640
If it's just delinquency,

515
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,079
like a brawl,

516
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:07,480
maybe you can go easy on them?

517
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,680
House of Sunset Drizzle
will owe you this favor, of course.

518
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:17,039
Why does it sound like you're bribing me

519
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,119
for their release?

520
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,440
I can't do that.

521
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,440
I'm a lawful minister.

522
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:25,039
Mr. Su,

523
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,759
have you seen those guards
by the entrance?

524
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,279
I heard

525
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,880
two kids from god knows where

526
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,240
went into a fight.

527
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,240
Where are we?

528
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,200
The Capital.

529
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,720
What is that one thing
about the Capital?

530
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,720
Law above all else.

531
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,599
Come. Let's not just talk.

532
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,559
Have a crab.

533
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,400
Eating a crab

534
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,599
takes skills.

535
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,640
You use a pair of scissors
to crack the crab legs,

536
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,440
a spoon to scoop out crab roes,

537
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:58,960
and a skewer to pick out crab meat.

538
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,759
You have to follow this protocol

539
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:03,480
to enjoy the best of it.

540
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,160
I'm all about following rules.

541
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,720
Sir, you serve the country

542
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:13,559
and I want to do the same.

543
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,160
Let me help you.

544
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,160
I do need help here.

545
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:27,440
There's one person,

546
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,519
the Feisty Official.

547
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:30,799
He's too frank

548
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,319
for his own good.

549
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:34,119
And I,

550
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:35,000
out of kindness,

551
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,200
sent him to the northwest
so that he can retire.

552
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:38,759
But he

553
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,160
abused my kindness
and started creating problems.

554
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:42,799
He said I ostracized him.

555
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,599
Thinking about it gives me a headache.

556
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:51,440
Can you go to the northwest for me?

557
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:57,079
Sir,

558
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,920
may I know

559
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,960
what my friends did?

560
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:04,000
You know what?

561
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,799
Help me

562
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,599
and I'll help you.

563
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:20,519
Since the northwest proves to be
a great source of your trouble,

564
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,039
I shall visit there on your behalf.

565
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,720
Thank you, Mr. Su.

566
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:27,599
I can set them free

567
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,160
but

568
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,640
they cannot enter
House of Sunset Drizzle.

569
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:36,799
Just their freedom is good enough.

570
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,839
We'll do as you wish for the rest.

571
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:53,000
Here. Comfort yourself.

572
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:54,319
Comfort yourself.

573
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:00,880
That must be awful.

574
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,079
You must have said so many
untruthful words.

575
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:06,319
Many, indeed.

576
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:08,240
So many that this place hurts.

577
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,720
I worry about you.

578
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,880
I have to go to the northwest.

579
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,920
The northwest?

580
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:18,319
They are targeting Liu Anshi,
the Feisty Official.

581
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,519
They want to eliminate
all bold and honest

582
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,319
officials.

583
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,160
If they want to kill him,

584
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:27,880
then I have to go

585
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:30,319
and evacuate Official Liu
to somewhere beyond the border.

586
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:34,240
That's the you I know.

587
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,799
Take care of Sunset Drizzle.

588
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Others should be non-issues.

589
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,920
Except for one thing.

590
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:41,160
Wang Xiaoshi and Bai Choufei?

591
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,400
What will you do with them?

592
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:45,759
Since the Ministry of Justice

593
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:47,720
prohibits them from entering
House of Sunset Drizzle,

594
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:51,119
we cannot go against
the ministry's order.

595
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:54,960
We can ask them to leave the Capital.

596
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,200
But I

597
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,400
don't want them to leave.

598
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:00,839
Besides,

599
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:03,799
they don't want to either.

600
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,440
They'll only have a hard time
if they stay.

601
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,599
Ministry of Justice is after you

602
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,880
and so is Six Half Hall.

603
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,039
Don't stare at me.

604
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,079
I'll arrange it

605
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,559
so that they will not suffer as much.

606
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,559
We'll wait until you return safely

607
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,159
and we'll decide.

608
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,639
Also, one more thing.

609
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,920
Do not let Wen Rou meet them.

610
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,320
My martial sister

611
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,360
is a handful at times.

612
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,960
I'm bad at dealing

613
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,480
with your martial sister as well.

614
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,559
Bai.

615
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:19,679
It's raining.

616
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,400
Bai.

617
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:36,800
Bai, what are you doing?

618
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,199
Bai, what are you doing?

619
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:43,320
Little Rock,

620
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:46,079
we have to live.

621
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:48,800
Vainglorious career? Freedom?

622
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:50,639
We have to live in order to dream.

623
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:52,760
I don't want to die here.

624
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,679
I don't want to die here.

625
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:55,639
- Bai.
- I...

626
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:58,119
- I don't want to die here.
- Bai.

627
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,480
I don't want to die here.

628
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,199
Bai!

629
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,559
I...

630
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,039
Get up.

631
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,280
Get up now!

632
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:07,320
Come.

633
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:09,559
Bai, wake up!

634
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:11,400
We will live.

635
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,480
We will.

636
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,719
Hopefully one day,

637
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:52,119
our name

638
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,000
will appear in the song.

639
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:55,400
Of course.

640
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,920
One day,

641
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,679
I will rewrite the rules
of the martial arts world.

642
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:03,639
Cabbage, you're shooting for the stars!

643
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:04,960
Yes, I am.

644
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,960
I will become one of the strongest.

645
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:14,679
I will right injustices

646
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,239
and punish the wrongdoers.

647
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,599
I want to inspire those who can fight

648
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:20,280
so that they can help the weak.

649
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,000
- It's fine if I can't make a sound.
- It's fine if I can't fly.

650
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:29,239
- When I do, I'll make the loudest noise.
- I'll soar to the highest.

651
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,639
- Sir.
- Sir.

652
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,519
They are here.

653
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:56,719
So how big of a favor

654
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:58,639
did you two give to Su Mengzhen

655
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:01,800
that he would get on his knees
and beg me for your release?

656
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,719
Don't freeze there.

657
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,679
Eat.

658
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,199
I promised Su Mengzhen.

659
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,639
I can set you two free

660
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,599
but you are not allowed

661
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,119
to step into House of Sunset Drizzle.

662
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,199
I will show you two the way forward.

663
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:33,960
You'll know soon.

664
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:41,679
But remember this,

665
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,360
when I show you
the way forward, you walk it.

666
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,440
If you don't,

667
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,119
you'll die.

668
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,199
Someone's out.

669
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,800
The first time in forever!

670
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,960
Don't come back!

671
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:10,679
Never.

672
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:15,880
The first time in forever!

673
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,599
I have earned the god's favor!

674
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:28,040
(Ministry of Justice)

675
00:39:48,944 --> 00:39:50,835
(Ministry of Justice)

676
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,132
(Ministry of Justice)

677
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,840
Di Feijing of Six Half Hall.

00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:05,880
Finish this cup

679
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,960
and you will be part of Six Half Hall.

680
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,960
This is your way forward.

681
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,800
I didn't expect Six Half Hall

682
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,199
to work closely with
the Ministry of Justice.

683
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:20,480
And if we don't want to join?

684
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:26,599
If we join Six Half Hall,

685
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:28,000
what's in it for us?

686
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:31,119
You will be offered the Elder position.

687
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,960
It'll take an ordinary person

688
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,000
at least two decades
to get to that position.

689
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:38,239
But for you two,

690
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,440
it's but a matter of a swig.

691
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,280
I appreciate your offer, First Elder Di.

692
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,440
This is my answer.

693
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,280
(Ministry of Justice)
His answer

694
00:41:13,295 --> 00:41:14,184
(Ministry of Justice)

695
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:15,280
(Ministry of Justice)
is my answer.

696
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,440
When you're young and inexperienced,

697
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,559
you don't have much choice.

698
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,119
Since you turned Six Half Hall down,

699
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:29,159
the Capital will not welcome you two.

700
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,280
Please leave as soon as possible.

701
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,880
We get to choose if we want to leave

702
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,960
or stay here.

703
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:37,079
First Elder Di,

704
00:41:37,269 --> 00:41:37,729
(Ministry of Justice)

705
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,800
(Ministry of Justice)
in the martial arts world,

706
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,280
are there any sects other than

707
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:43,840
Six Half Hall
and House of Sunset Drizzle?

708
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,400
There are.

709
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,440
But not many.

710
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,320
They occupy hardly a corner.

711
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:50,159
That's already more than I imagined.

712
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,119
As long as

713
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,000
we have a roof above us,

714
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,599
it's good enough.

715
00:41:56,621 --> 00:41:57,896
(Ministry of Justice)

716
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:06,320
Resilient.

717
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:08,639
I will dedicate this toast to you two.

718
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,199
May you

719
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,719
make many good friends

720
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:16,679
and that everyone knows your name.
