(Trouble remains and the House stands,

32
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,199
I heard you refuse

33
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,840
to meet anyone

34
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,439
or speak

35
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:18,800
after you received a piece of news.

36
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,960
What's the news?

37
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,295
(Wang Xiaoshi is alive.)

38
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,520
Wang Xiaoshi is still alive.

39
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,360
About this,

40
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,360
only you can do something about it.

41
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,680
There's nothing I can do to help.

42
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,560
Then why did you come here?

43
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,080
I came here

44
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,800
with a bad news

45
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,599
to tell you.

46
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,240
But it's better

47
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,759
that you don't know.

48
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,919
What could be worse than this?

49
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,800
Tell me.

50
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,639
Your bride,

51
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,759
the Chief Elder of the Six Half Hall,

52
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,439
is missing.

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,560
We can't find Su Mengzhen's body,

54
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,919
and Lei Chun is missing.

55
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,199
I think this isn't

56
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,039
a piece of good news for you.

57
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,719
What will come, will come.

58
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,439
What will leave, will leave.

59
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,120
I trust you'll be prepared.

60
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,159
The person you met at Xiliu

61
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,439
is dead.

62
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,639
Little Rock.

63
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,639
Bai!

64
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,039
Bai, come back!

65
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,319
What can you give me?

66
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,479
Everything you want.

67
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,199
But how far would you go

68
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,560
to get what you want?

69
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,280
Bai, come back!

70
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,839
Come back, Bai.

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,199
I'll sever all ties.

72
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,439
I'll become stone-cold and heartless.

73
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,040
Bai, come back!

74
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,480
After drinking this liquor,

75
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,600
we will no longer be brothers.

76
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,480
If our weapons
meet in the future, don't hold back.

77
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,279
Bai, come back!

78
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,480
Money and life are better

79
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,560
than fame and power.

80
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,759
With power over people's lives,

81
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,319
no one dares to disrespect you.

82
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:49,319
Bai, turn back!

83
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,480
I want to be the real Bai Choufei.

84
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,240
Turn back.

85
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,759
Turn back!

86
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,696
(Wang Xiaoshi is alive.)

87
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,040
Advisor,

88
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,360
let's gather all
the scattered members in the Capital.

89
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,360
There are still survivors
of the House of Sunset Drizzle!

90
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,639
We'll charge ahead

91
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,000
to avenge House Master

92
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,360
and retake the House!

93
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,519
- Yes! Retake the House!
- Yes! Retake the House!

94
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,240
Take it back!

95
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,279
House Master is dead.

96
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,879
But his body is still with Bai.

97
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:42,319
Even if we need to risk our lives,

98
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:45,000
we must take back House Master's body!

99
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,519
- Yes! Take it back!
- Take it back!

100
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,519
Last night,

101
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,399
Mr. Su sent me to light up the incense.

102
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,959
He was luring me away on purpose.

103
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,480
I guess

104
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,600
Advisor has received
a similar instruction, right?

105
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,759
All of you are the residents at the House.

106
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,639
But you were all transferred out today.

107
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,759
I think Mr. Su deliberately
made that arrangement too.

108
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,000
The order to transfer us out

109
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,519
was passed down before dawn.

110
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,240
So do you understand Mr. Su's intention?

111
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,800
He wanted us to live.

112
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
If we live, so is the House of Sunset Drizzle.

113
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,240
If we barge in

114
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,639
to fight Bai Choufei to the death.
What happens after that?

115
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,319
Who's going to avenge Mr. Su?

116
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,680
So are we still going
to take back the House,

117
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,040
which was taken away from us?

118
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,639
This area is called the Trunk Tower.

119
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,800
Only ordinary people and peddlers

120
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,920
are living around here.

121
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,040
Since it's both noisy and quiet,

122
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,399
it'll be the best hideout.

123
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,000
Everyone should hide and stay alive for now.

124
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,879
As for revenge,

125
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:59,199
we'll discuss this
after Wang Xiaoshi's return.

126
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,800
Mr. Su used to say

127
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,199
that Wang Xiaoshi's return
would be a turn of events.

128
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,480
He may not be around anymore.

129
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,519
But I believe in

130
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,240
what he said.

131
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,279
As I said,

132
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,680
the only man who can kill me is myself.

133
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,120
But I was wrong.

134
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,120
There is another one who can.

135
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,480
Who is it?

136
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,600
You.

137
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,720
Didn't you say you're invincible?

138
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,160
Come back!

139
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,920
Come back now.

140
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,680
Come back.

141
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,199
Please come back.

142
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,959
Come back.

143
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,840
Please come back.

144
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,759
Only a dying old cat

145
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,879
would find a place to hide.

146
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,799
I can't find you.

147
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,559
I really can't find you.

148
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,320
Do you see this person?

149
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,879
I've seen her many times before.

150
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,039
She'd just sit there every day.

151
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,360
I don't even know what she's waiting for.

152
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:09,720
If you look at her,

153
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,159
she's definitely a madwoman.

154
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,279
I'm not sure if she's mad.

155
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,200
But she must be a pitiful person.

156
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,399
She may look like this now.

157
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,600
She used to live gloriously.

158
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,200
She was the stunning actress, Zhu Xiaoyao.

159
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,600
Many people spent a fortune

160
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
to just take a glimpse of her.

161
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,840
How pitiful.

162
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,000
Xiaoyao,

163
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,360
the wind is strong out here.

164
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,639
Let's wait inside.

165
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:51,919
We don't know when Mr. Wang will return.

166
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,399
If we wait inside,

167
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:59,080
what if we miss him?

168
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,000
Sunset Drizzle is ruined.

169
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,919
So is the House of Sanhe.

170
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,759
Where else can we wait for him?

171
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,200
I'll just stay here.

172
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,399
I want to see him
come back alive for myself.

173
00:12:00,863 --> 00:12:04,378
(Wang Xiaoshi is safe.
Close to the Capital.)

174
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,000
All right.

175
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:11,240
As long as you are alive.

176
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:17,080
But I don't know if it'll do you good

177
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,399
to return at this time.

178
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,879
Official Liu, we've arrived.

179
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,163
(Qinglong Temple)

180
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:07,720
Mr. Zhuge, it's been a while.

181
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,960
You must be tired

182
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,240
from the arduous journey.

183
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:14,720
It's a hard and long journey,
but we managed to get through.

184
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,720
Didn't you say Wang Xiaoshi
will return in your letter?

185
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:21,919
He said he's a wanted fugitive.

186
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:24,279
It was inconvenient for him to travel with us.

187
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:26,399
So he entered the Capital himself.

188
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,000
I guess he's visiting his old friends.

189
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:40,159
Xiaoyao?

190
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,399
It's me.

191
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,000
It's you. It's really you.

192
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,120
It's me, Xiaoyao.

193
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,039
It's really me.

194
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,679
Xiaoyao.

195
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:04,919
What happened to your face?

196
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,480
You're really alive.

197
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,879
Luckily, you're alive.

198
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:18,799
Yes.

199
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm alive, and I've returned.

200
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,480
Great. That's great.

201
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,759
Xiaoyao, stop crying.

202
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,840
Tell me

203
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,240
what exactly happened.

204
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,600
Tell me.

205
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:44,960
What happened?

206
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,200
Mr. Su

207
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:04,440
is dead.

208
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,720
Advisor!

209
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,120
Look who's back!

210
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,159
Advisor!

211
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,879
I'm glad you're back.

212
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,559
I'm glad you're back.

213
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:03,879
It must be hard on you.

214
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,640
Come. Let's go inside.

215
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,559
We haven't found Mr. Su's body yet.

216
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:27,200
We only found this crimson robe.

217
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:31,319
This robe keeps people together.

218
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:34,359
We can't go back to
the House of Sunset Drizzle anymore.

219
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,839
When Mr. Su was alive,

220
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,480
he wanted us to wait for your return.

221
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:39,640
Now that you've returned,

222
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,920
it'll be up to you to decide what to do next.

223
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,500
(Eminence of Heavy Bearer)

224
00:17:58,599 --> 00:17:59,599
I didn't expect

225
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,359
my martial brothers, Tianyi and Thirteen Doom,

226
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,880
would die in the north.

227
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,599
How fate had played a joke on us.

228
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,279
People of our generation
have become a thing of the past.

229
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,799
And it's time for a new era
in the martial arts world.

230
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:19,279
I just didn't expect

231
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,200
Su Mengzhen, the Greatest Swordsman

232
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,599
would just die like this.

233
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,920
Wang Xiaoshi deeply respects Su Mengzhen.

234
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,000
This matter will be

235
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,359
a huge blow to him.

236
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,920
In a flurry of white and red,

237
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,160
the Red Sleeve Blade cuts at the speed of light.

238
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,680
I guess we can never see the splendor

239
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:43,359
of the Red Sleeve Blade anymore.

240
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,640
If it weren't for Su Mengzhen,

241
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,359
I would have died in Chancellor Cai's hand.

242
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:51,680
With his death,

243
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:55,519
the Youqiao Group has taken over
the House of Sunset Drizzle.

244
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,599
No other power in the martial arts world

245
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:59,759
can fight with them anymore.

246
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,680
We've found the evidence

247
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:05,960
to bring down Chancellor Cai.

248
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,960
We should present the evidence
as soon as possible.

249
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,799
Let's wait a bit.

250
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,039
Firstly, we must be prudent in this matter.

251
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,960
We need to make a careful plan

252
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,079
to ensure that the evidence

253
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,799
is safely handed over to His Majesty.

254
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:26,640
Secondly, I want to wait for Wang Xiaoshi.

255
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:28,400
I think he would want

256
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,079
to carry this out in person.

257
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,829
(Maple Bridge)

258
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:26,079
I've prepared quality liquor for your return.

259
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,559
The Capital has changed too much.

260
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,160
There's one thing I want to ask you in person.

261
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,359
I have something to ask you too.

262
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,839
I only have one question to ask

263
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,640
and one thing to say.

264
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,519
I also hope your answer is one word.

265
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,200
Are you

266
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,440
still my brother?

267
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,400
You have to answer my question

268
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,200
before I can tell you my answer.

269
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,200
Did you

270
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,839
betray Mengzhen?

271
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:28,279
I asked if you were still my brother!

272
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:29,279
Did you betray Mengzhen?

273
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:29,960
Yes!

274
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:36,599
But you already knew that.

275
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
Every martial artist knows that.

276
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,880
Without Mengzhen, the House of
Sunset Drizzle wouldn't exist.

277
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,880
Now that you've taken over
the House of Sunset Drizzle,

278
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,200
do you adhere to the House's rules?

279
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,279
You betrayed Mengzhen
and went against your superior.

280
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,799
Are you still my brother
who'll live and die together?

281
00:21:58,039 --> 00:21:59,839
You collude with corrupt officials
and oppress other martial artists.

282
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:01,160
Are you still a member of the House?

283
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,440
What's wrong with colluding
with corrupt officials?

284
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,119
So what if I joined the Youqiao Group?

285
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:07,960
I have power now.

286
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:09,680
I make the House of Sunset Drizzle

287
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,880
even more glorious.

288
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,680
Su Mengzhen was too conservative
and lived a life worse than death.

289
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,960
Otherwise,

290
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:20,400
it wouldn't be my turn to replace him.

291
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,160
I killed him

292
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,079
to relieve him from pain.

293
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,599
Did you come to me
with those righteous speeches

294
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,640
just to ask me these?

295
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:52,799
I heard you came back with a crowd

296
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,440
from the north.

297
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,359
Many people want
to follow you after you return.

298
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,160
Don't tell me

299
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,160
you're trying to seize my power

300
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,119
in the name of avenging Su Mengzhen.

301
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,559
Let me ask you one last question.

302
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,440
Did you kill Mengzhen?

303
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,440
So what if I did,

304
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:20,680
and so what if I didn't?

305
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,319
If you did,

306
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,599
I'll avenge his death.

307
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,359
If you didn't,

308
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,359
hand him over to me.

309
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,839
Answer me!

310
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:29,519
Yes!

311
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,240
I did it myself.

312
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:35,400
He's dead for sure.

313
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:56,039
Where is his body?

314
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,359
Why would I tell you that?

315
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,160
I guess you didn't know where he is.

316
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:05,799
Go and find him.

317
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:09,480
Tell me if you find him.

318
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,119
Why did

319
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,240
we turn out like this?

320
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:28,400
What's wrong with that?

321
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,880
I have power now.

322
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:32,480
When one has power,

323
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,839
his word is everything.

324
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,880
If you want people
to take your words seriously,

325
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,119
come and defeat me.

326
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:48,843
(Letter of Passage)

327
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,920
Those who are sensible

328
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:55,759
will leave the Capital with the Letter of Passage.

329
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,519
You have died once.

330
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:01,279
You must stay alive.

331
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:03,640
Don't meddle in the Capital's business anymore.

332
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,319
Bai!

333
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:08,119
Why did we become like this?

334
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:09,519
It's because of you!

335
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,279
Wang Xiaoshi,

336
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,480
because you died!

337
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,640
When I was tortured in the dungeon,

338
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:26,480
I still had a glimmer of hope.
I hoped for your return.

339
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:33,799
But they told me you were dead.

340
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,119
Since you were dead,

341
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:39,720
I no longer

342
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,519
had to insist on justice and morality.

343
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,559
There's no turning back for me.

344
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,759
I can never turn back now!

345
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,640
But you...

346
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:53,680
Why did you come back?

347
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:55,400
Why?

348
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,759
Seeing you turned like this,

349
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:03,839
I'd rather that I was dead.

350
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:27,079
You want my answer, right?

351
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,240
Mengzhen will not die in vain.

352
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,359
I'll avenge

353
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,400
him.

354
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,880
This is my answer.

355
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,519
Mengzhen asked

356
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:25,720
if we'd like to protect
the martial arts world together

357
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,480
and give martial artists freedom.

358
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:29,599
I hate feeling restricted.

359
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:30,640
Of course, I'm willing to.

360
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,279
You love freedom.

361
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,559
But what you just said is the path of martyrs.

362
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,519
Mr. Wo,

363
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,519
someone is bound to take care

364
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:47,519
of some things in the world, right?

365
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,920
When someone holds a sword
to go on a killing spree,

366
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:51,599
someone will bathe in blood
for stepping in.

367
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,200
(Mengzhen,)

368
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,519
(I've returned.)

369
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,039
(I've traveled to many places)

370
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:01,000
(and experienced many things.)

371
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:03,839
(I wanted to come back and tell you about it.)

372
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,000
(But you're no longer here.)

373
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:10,440
(After I left the Capital,)

374
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,319
(I headed north.)

375
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:14,319
(I saw a vast snowfield there.)

376
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:17,000
(It's just as you said.)

377
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:20,839
(As a human, we're really small.)

378
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,359
(Many things happened in the north.)

379
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,119
(I killed Fang Yingkan and Thirteen Doom.)

380
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:29,359
(I avenged my parents' deaths)

381
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:31,400
(and got rid of evil
for the sake of the martial arts world.)

382
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,200
(The world isn't)

383
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,200
(as simple as paying back.)

384
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,440
(Some people lost their lives.)

385
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,160
(Master is dead.)

386
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,759
(Wen Rou also left me.)

387
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,400
(I really miss them.)

388
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,759
(I've been thinking)

389
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,640
(about what kind of martial arts world
is the best for a long time.)

390
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,559
(I came to the Capital from Xiliu.)

391
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,200
(I've been on the run in the north.)

392
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:02,400
(And I finally returned here again.)

393
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:05,440
(I've been to places I should be.)

394
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,799
(I've also met)

395
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,519
(many people.)

396
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:12,599
(Now I finally have a vision)

397
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,960
(of the martial arts world in my heart.)

398
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:17,759
(Mengzhen,)

399
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,240
(I'm curious)

400
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:23,160
(if the martial arts world you imagined)

401
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,480
(is the same as the one I had in mind.)

402
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,799
(It's a pity)

403
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:31,319
(that I'll never know the answer.)

404
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:34,559
(Without my brothers around,)

405
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:37,279
(I feel)

406
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,119
(so alone.)

407
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,559
Xiaoshi.

408
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,480
Xiaoshi is here.

409
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,039
Martial Uncle. Official Liu.

410
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:54,759
Good.

411
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:55,519
Everyone is here.

412
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,640
You're back.

413
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,680
Have a seat.

414
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,519
All right.

415
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:05,160
Please keep watch.

416
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:06,799
Don't let anyone enter.

417
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:15,279
Martial Uncle.

418
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,683
(Chancellor, Palace Secretariat.
Urgent: Eliminate the vagabonds)

419
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:28,640
Just a few words on a piece of paper

420
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:30,759
have got your father

421
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:32,880
and hundreds of martial artists killed.

422
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,359
With power in Chancellor Cai's hand,

423
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,680
it's indeed a murderous sword.

424
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:41,839
To obtain this evidence,

425
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,200
many died in the north.

426
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,400
Martial Uncle,

427
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,079
shouldn't we hand this evidence over

428
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:47,960
to His Majesty

429
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,000
and let him punish
Chancellor Cai for his crime?

430
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,799
That's what Divine Marquis
and I planned to do.

431
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:53,799
But the problem is

432
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,079
how we hand it over to His Majesty.

433
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:59,000
Chancellor Cai has been
wielding power in court for decades.

434
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,000
His power is deeply rooted
with countless informers everywhere.

435
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:05,519
If we submit it as a memorial to His Majesty,

436
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:08,680
I'm afraid it won't reach His Majesty at all.

437
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,079
Can you seek an audience with His Majesty

438
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:17,079
and deliver it to His Majesty in person?

439
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:18,640
I may have returned to the Capital.

440
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,559
But I have yet to be reinstated.

441
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:22,279
So how can I seek
an audience with His Majesty?

442
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:24,559
You're the famous Feisty Official.

443
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,400
Do you have any ideas?

444
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:27,279
Me?

445
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,559
But I'm also a man
dismissed from the position.

446
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,720
Is there any way

447
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,640
that allows me to meet His Majesty

448
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,880
for half an hour?

449
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,559
Half an hour?

450
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,200
Even Her Grace may not meet

451
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,920
His Majesty every month

452
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,519
for half an hour.

453
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,240
To meet His Majesty,

454
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,519
there may be a way.

455
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,640
The first day of next month, at Dafo Temple.

456
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:26,079
Is this area called Trunk Tower?

457
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,079
Do you see this wooden tower behind me?

458
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,240
It's called Trunk Tower.

459
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,319
People in this area call it that

460
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,599
for convenience.

461
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:35,920
After I finish this meal,

462
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,519
I think it should be all right
if I go and take a walk outside, right?

463
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,559
I don't think anyone
in this area would remember me.

464
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,559
Sure, you can.

465
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,079
There are only common folks on this street.

466
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,400
It's been a while
since they removed your wanted poster.

467
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,359
I think it should be all right.

468
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,000
Sir, please have a taste.

469
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,559
(Letter Writing)
What is taking him so long to return?

470
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:16,840
(Letter Writing)
Everyone is waiting for him.

471
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,119
This is frustrating.

472
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:20,079
He'd be here every day at this hour.

473
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,599
What could have happened?

474
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:22,920
Well, we'll just wait.

475
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,747
- What else can we do then?
- Excuse me.

476
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,120
(Letter Writing)

477
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,280
Why are you all lining up here?

478
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,559
Well,

479
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,679
there are not many people
who are literate in this area.

480
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,800
When we want to write a letter,

481
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:32,280
we'll come here.

482
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,480
But the stall owner just went out.

483
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,400
See? Everybody has been waiting all day.

484
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,519
- Yes.
- We've been waiting all day.

485
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:40,360
How about this?

486
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:42,719
I'll use this stall
and help you write your letters.

487
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,079
Are you literate?

488
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,559
I guess so.

489
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:48,159
- That's great.
- Great.

490
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,186
(Letter Writing)

491
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,320
Then I say it out,
and you'll write it down.

492
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,159
Okay, you can start now.

493
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,719
You can write that everyone at home is fine.

494
00:34:57,079 --> 00:34:58,079
So don't worry.

495
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,840
Yes, that's enough.

496
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,639
Thank you.

497
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,599
That's him.

498
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:16,960
Here you go.

499
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:18,400
Thank you.

500
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:19,800
It's my turn now.

501
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,400
All right.

502
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,079
Thank you.

503
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:42,320
Where did he go?

504
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:45,039
Let's split up and search for him.

505
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,239
- Yes.
- No need.

506
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,960
Why are you following me?

507
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:54,400
If I may be bold to ask. Are you Wang Xiaoshi?

508
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,840
If you have something to say,
be straightforward.

509
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,360
Mister, don't get us wrong.

510
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:00,880
We meant no harm.

511
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:02,280
It's just that you look

512
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,320
so similar to Wang Xiaoshi.

513
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,840
I am Wang Xiaoshi.

514
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,800
Why are you following me?

515
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,199
When you killed
the corrupt official Fu Zongshu

516
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,800
for the sake of the people,

517
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:19,480
I, Tang Qimei, have long admired you.

518
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,960
I came forward
because I want to follow you

519
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:23,039
and be at your service.

520
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,039
I'm Liang A'niu, who belongs to no sect.

521
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:26,199
What I have is strength,

522
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,239
and I'm pretty good at fighting.

523
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,320
From today on,

524
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,440
I'm willing to follow your lead.

525
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,719
I, Zhang Laosan of Tianji Group,

526
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,239
am willing to follow you.

527
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:35,920
I'm Liang Se of Fa-Meng Association

528
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,480
and am willing to follow you, Mr. Wang.

529
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,039
I'm Zhang Xuan.

530
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:38,960
He Xiaohe.

531
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,519
- We're willing to follow you, Mr. Wang.
- We're willing to follow you, Mr. Wang.

532
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:43,639
I'm only a wanted fugitive in hiding.

533
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:45,519
Why do you want to follow me?

534
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,920
I accept your kind intention.

535
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:48,400
But please go back.

536
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,039
Mister,

537
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:51,519
all of us

538
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:53,639
are martial artists
stranded in Trunk Tower's area.

539
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,199
But over the years,

540
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,519
the Youqiao Group has been acting wantonly.

541
00:36:58,039 --> 00:36:59,480
It's tough for martial artists.

542
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,360
All of us have been waiting for someone

543
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:04,519
to seek justice for the martial artists.

544
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:06,639
- That's right, Mister.
- He's right.

545
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:07,719
That's right, Mister.

546
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,519
Any news from Wang Xiaoshi?

547
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,039
House Master,

548
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,519
we've kept a close watch
on Wang Xiaoshi for days now.

549
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,519
Every day, he just wanders around the town,

550
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:25,519
writes letters,
and checks people's pulses.

551
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:26,360
Sometimes,

552
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,280
he'd teach the children
in the street how to write.

553
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:30,440
As for the rest,
he didn't do much of anything else.

554
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:33,239
House Master,

555
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,440
many people indeed
flocked to where they stay

556
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,880
due to admiration,

557
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,880
and wanted to follow his lead.

558
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:38,039
I think

559
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,880
they're targeting you.

560
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:42,039
Then let them come.

561
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,280
Let them gather

562
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,920
so it'll be convenient for me to kill them all.

563
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,519
Experience and observe
the people to win their hearts.

564
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:56,800
It's really the Wang Xiaoshi I know.

565
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:00,679
Since he likes to use this approach,

566
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,719
I can give it a try too.

567
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:11,960
Do you think buying
people's hearts will work?

568
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,679
If House Master Bai
says it'll work, it means it'll work.

569
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:17,679
Yes.

570
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:26,519
- Mister.
- I change my mind.

571
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:27,480
- I'll go first.
- Why did you leave?

572
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,320
Mister, three bowls of noodles.

573
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:43,039
He killed his brother
and usurped the House Master's position.

574
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,519
Yet, he's pretending to be nice here.

575
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:45,519
It's disgusting.

576
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,519
Keep it down.

577
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,000
What do you mean by that?
Have you lived long enough?

578
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:54,400
I meant nothing by that.
Leave after you finish eating.

579
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:56,519
I have something urgent at home.
I'm in a rush to close the stall.

580
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:59,000
You can tell me what it is.
I can help you.

581
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:00,360
No need. I don't deserve it.

582
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,679
Cabbage who can't fly!

583
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,519
The smelly stool is what he is!

584
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:11,719
Let him go!

585
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:12,840
- What are you doing?
- I think you've lived long enough!

586
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:17,400
Let him go!

587
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,039
Kid, why did you do this to me?

588
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,920
His father was your subordinate.

589
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,320
But you had him killed

590
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,320
over a small mistake.

591
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,760
His mother sobbed her heart out.

592
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:33,239
Yet, your subordinates violated her

593
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:34,039
and killed her.

594
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:36,719
That's why he turned out like this.

595
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,519
Why?

596
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:39,039
Are you not going

597
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:40,000
to let a poor child go?

598
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,519
Kid, don't be scared.

599
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,519
I'll seek justice for you.

600
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:52,239
Give it to me.

601
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:56,199
Here,

602
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:58,400
take this money.

603
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:00,000
Go back and buy something delicious.

604
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,800
Do you know this child's parents?

605
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,800
We're all poor people
under the care of the House.

606
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:15,519
His family often ate here.

607
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,760
We got close after a while.

608
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,159
Don't worry.

609
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,760
When I return,
I'll get to the bottom of this.

610
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,000
Give it to me.

611
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,639
This money is for you.

612
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:31,360
What's the meaning of this?

613
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:32,480
Nothing.

614
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,719
The noodles are delicious.

615
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:35,039
It's a reward from the House.

616
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,280
I made noodles for you

617
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,159
for the sake of the House of Sunset Drizzle.

618
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:40,760
You can give rewards elsewhere!

619
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,880
Let's go back.

620
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,000
Mister, may your business prosper.

621
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:02,039
I want you to kill

622
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,800
the noodle stall owner

623
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,760
and those who badmouthed me

624
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,719
within a month.

625
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,480
Yes.

626
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,519
Oh.

627
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:13,000
That kid too.

628
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:15,400
Capture him

629
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:18,039
and use some interesting methods

630
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,280
to have fun with him for a month.

631
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:22,760
After one month,

632
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:25,199
send him to his parents
in the underground world.

633
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,920
- Yes.
- Yes.

634
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:36,760
Why?

635
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,679
Do you think I'm doing something wrong?

636
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,719
No.

637
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,519
They deserve to die anyway.

638
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,159
Even death isn't enough.

639
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,360
Death isn't enough.

640
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,280
Those who are loyal to me

641
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,519
will have a bright future.

642
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:52,199
But those who oppose me

643
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,920
will end up like them.

644
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,360
Are these people here to follow

645
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,840
in the name of Wang Xiaoshi?

646
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,679
Yes.

647
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,519
If this goes on,

648
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:25,039
this courtyard won't be able
to accommodate them anymore.

649
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,199
Is our food enough?

650
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,960
What about money?

651
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,719
They are all our compatriots.

652
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,039
They've been waiting all day.

653
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:35,320
We have to provide good hospitality.

654
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,639
I've managed
the House of Sanhe for many years.

655
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:39,639
Don't you know how much it had made?

656
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,519
Don't worry about it.

657
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,159
Luckily, you're here.

658
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,880
It's time to ask Wang Xiaoshi
what his plans are.

659
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:50,280
Let's go.

660
00:42:58,519 --> 00:42:59,360
Xiaoshi.

661
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,159
You've returned for some time now.

662
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,039
These days,

663
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:06,880
you've been helping the neighbors.

664
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:08,400
All of us can see that.

665
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,039
Can you tell us

666
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:11,199
if you have any plans?

667
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,679
Xiaoshi?

668
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,039
It's for you.

669
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:20,840
Time is pressing.

670
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,960
I don't know if it suits you.

671
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,159
It's very beautiful.

672
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,159
Thank you.

673
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:28,480
Try it on.

674
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,519
I brought back
a piece of evidence from the north.

675
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:32,679
It's a chance
to bring Chancellor Cai down.

676
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,719
I'm planning to meet His Majesty

677
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,280
and hand over this evidence
to him in person.

678
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,480
It'll be on the first day of next month.

679
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:42,400
This is a good idea.

680
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:44,039
If we can bring down Chancellor Cai,

681
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:46,360
Youqiao Group's foundation
will start to rock.

682
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,519
It'll be easy to solve the matters
of the martial arts world.

683
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:51,719
These days,

684
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,159
I've been helping out and talking

685
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,199
to the neighbors.

686
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,039
I heard many of their thoughts.

687
00:43:57,519 --> 00:43:59,000
I'm planning to discuss it with you now.

688
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,039
Let's not talk in the room.

689
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:02,960
Those people in the yard
have been waiting for you all day.

690
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:06,159
You have to show up when the time comes.

691
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,320
We mustn't take
their kindness for granted.

692
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,159
Go and talk to them.

693
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:12,760
All right.

694
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:21,760
He's coming out.

695
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,400
He's here.

696
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:23,320
Hero Wang.

697
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:26,400
- Hero Wang.
- Mr. Wang.

698
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,400
- Hero Wang.
- Hero Wang.

699
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,519
- Mr. Wang.
- Hero Wang.

700
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:33,679
You must be tired.

701
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,480
Let's find a place to sit.

702
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,519
- All right.
- Let's sit.

703
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:39,480
There isn't enough space.

704
00:44:39,639 --> 00:44:40,760
Just find any comfortable spot.

705
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:42,239
You can lean on anyone or anything.

706
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,519
I know you came here to see me.

707
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:49,039
So I'll tell you

708
00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:51,239
what I have in mind.

709
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,880
You might be here

710
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,159
because I've gained a bit of fame

711
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,880
from assassinating Fu Zongshu.

712
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,119
Or perhaps some of you are here

713
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,079
because you have received kindness

714
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,400
from my brother, Su Mengzhen,
and the House of Sunset Drizzle.

715
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,360
And I'm Su Mengzhen's sworn brother.

716
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,039
It doesn't matter what your reasons are.

717
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,039
I believe we all gather here

718
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:13,000
because we hope
to see the martial arts world

719
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,000
in a different manner.

720
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,719
Over the past few days,

721
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,320
I've been spending time

722
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,920
with the neighbors

723
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,199
and helping them write prescriptions
and treat their illnesses.

724
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,400
I help the illiterate write letters

725
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:27,639
and teach the children how to read.

726
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:30,119
So I've come to know many things.

727
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,559
When some people face a gang faction,

728
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,159
they only hope to get beaten less.

729
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:36,519
Some only hope their petitions

730
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:39,239
could be sent to the palace
so justice can be redressed.

731
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,920
The children study

732
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,480
because they hope

733
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:46,199
they can travel the world
in the future someday.

734
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:47,840
That's why I think

735
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,559
this is also a part
of the martial arts world.

736
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,000
In this world,

737
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,039
it's not only for people
who carry weapons like us.

738
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,559
The people I just mentioned.

739
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,159
They're also living
in the martial arts world.

740
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:04,519
Someone once told me this.

741
00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:08,320
It's also a part of the martial arts world
when two people are together.

742
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,320
So I hope

743
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,119
the strong can protect the weak.

744
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,039
When the weak become capable,

745
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:18,480
they will naturally protect
the people around us.

746
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:21,280
This is the belief
of the martial arts world.

747
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,320
When

748
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,559
we no longer yield to the power,

749
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,400
are not afraid of being oppressed,

750
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:30,559
and complain against injustice without fear,

751
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,760
it means the martial arts world
is free from restraint.

752
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,760
- Well said!
- Good speech!

753
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,840
- Good!
- Well done!

754
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:41,840
Nicely put!

755
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:44,679
All of us gather here

756
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,639
because we want to know
what's on your mind.

757
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:48,360
I'm sure

758
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:50,519
all of us here heard

759
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,079
what you just said.

760
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:53,800
- Yes.
- We did.

761
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,519
The House of Sunset Drizzle
may no longer be around.

762
00:46:56,679 --> 00:46:59,320
But we're all still here!

763
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:03,920
- You're right!
- We're still here!

764
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:06,760
We must pass down
the spirit of the martial arts world.

765
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,639
Xiaoshi,

766
00:47:09,639 --> 00:47:11,159
how about you take the lead

767
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,880
and establish a new sect today?

768
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:17,320
All of us will follow in your lead.

769
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,440
- We'll follow you!
- Follow you!

770
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:34,320
We'll call it Trunk Tower then.

771
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,480
Isn't this a building?

772
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,559
Shouldn't it be "the House of Trunk"?

773
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:40,760
It sounds more imposing.

774
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,079
No.

775
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,199
The House of Sunset Drizzle is a "House".

776
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,920
We'll just call it Trunk Tower!

777
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:54,079
All right!

778
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:59,239
Trunk Tower that
curbs the violent and assists the weak.

779
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:04,079
Trunk Tower that
curbs the violent and assists the weak.
