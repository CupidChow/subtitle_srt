(Well Prisoner, Looming Danger. Part 2)

32
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,599
Mister, another bowl.

33
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,000
Coming right up.

34
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,480
The noodles are good,
but the oil isn't good.

35
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:02,439
It lacks something.

36
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,040
Please enjoy.

37
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,799
Do you have families in the Capital?

38
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,039
They're all gone.

39
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,680
They all died in that well.

40
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,319
What is this place?

41
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,520
Xiaocaomen Street.

42
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,479
We ran down four streets.

43
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,120
We're now outside
Six Half Hall territory.

44
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,800
Do you have somewhere you want to go?

45
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,000
I have two friends.

46
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,639
But I don't know

47
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,800
if they're still in the Capital.

48
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,360
But I remember where they live.

49
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,680
Can you lead me the way?

50
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,280
I want to see them.

51
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,039
Sure.

52
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:45,960
It's over there. Hurry.

53
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,120
Mister, here's the compensation
for the damages later.

54
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,439
First Elder.

55
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,639
Did you see that person?

56
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:11,439
Yes.

57
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,800
Wang Xiaoshi
of the House of Sunset Drizzle

58
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,520
was with him.

59
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,000
He was the one who defeated our men.

60
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,240
Wang Xiaoshi.

61
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,919
Chief Elder,

62
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,879
our men saw Guan Qi.

63
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,039
Guan Qi was with Wang Xiaoshi.

64
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,759
Wang Xiaoshi?

65
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,599
Was it Su Mengzhen's idea
to let Guan Qi out?

66
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,639
I don't think so.

67
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,199
If Su Mengzhen were behind this,

68
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:48,759
he would have come to his aid.

69
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,120
But our men only saw

70
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,680
Wang Xiaoshi take Guan Qi
to have noodles.

71
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,000
It didn't seem to be planned.

72
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,240
Besides, there wasn't any movement

73
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,639
from the House of Sunset Drizzle.

74
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,120
When the sun is up,

75
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,680
I must head to the minister's residence.

76
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,960
Su Mengzhen must be behind

77
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,840
Guan Qi's release.

78
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:10,599
Right?

79
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,280
I asked if I was right!

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,680
Chief Elder.

81
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,360
It has to be him.

82
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,120
I didn't expect you to be a tough lad.

83
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,399
People would do all they could

84
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,680
to live.

85
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,120
Mister,

86
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,199
you had seven bowls of noodles.

87
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,199
You're quite heavy to carry now.

88
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
No matter how full I am,

89
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,959
I still can't get rid of my hatred.

90
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:45,639
Mister,

91
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,879
I've been meaning to ask you.

92
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,439
Why did Lei Sun imprison you?

93
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,480
Lei Sun?

94
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,199
That treacherous man.

95
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:58,040
When I was at my peak,

96
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,519
he was nothing.

97
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,199
And that Fu Zongshu...

98
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,199
Fu Zongshu?

99
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,199
Mister, do you know Fu Zongshu too?

100
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,839
That snake, Fu Zongshu.

101
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,439
It was Lei Sun and Fu Zongshu

102
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,240
who worked together to harm me!

103
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,639
They imprisoned me in the well!

104
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,079
Now, I'm out of there.

105
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,000
I can never forget this resentment.

106
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,879
I must settle scores with them!

107
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,240
Mister, you are fine now?

108
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,000
I never said I wasn't fine.

109
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,600
Mister,

110
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,360
is your friend staying here?

111
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:50,759
Yes.

112
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:57,959
Coming!

113
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,000
Who are you looking for?

114
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,439
Kid, are your parents at home?

115
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,560
Who on earth are you?

116
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,759
Why did you barge in here?

117
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,040
My apologies.

118
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,160
We're looking for...

119
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,759
Mister, what's your friend's name?

120
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,279
Kai, who is it?

121
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,720
It's already late.

125
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,879
- What's wrong?
- He...

126
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,360
Yan Hefa,

127
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,279
it's been so long.

128
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,680
- You're old now.
- Kai.

129
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,120
Come here.

130
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,560
Come here.

131
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,120
Yan Kai?

132
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,439
You're all grown up.

133
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:00,959
I used to carry you when you were young.

134
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:01,759
Have you forgotten?

135
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,439
Your father used to say

136
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,879
you might be small built,
but you had a huge temper.

137
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,399
And you would definitely be
a tough person when you grow up.

138
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,800
Kai!

139
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,360
I guess he's not that tough anyway.

140
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,439
- Why did you kill him?
- Kai!

141
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:19,920
He's only a kid!

142
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,839
Kai.

143
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,040
His parents betrayed me.

144
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,319
It's only right for me to kill them
for revenge.

145
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,839
I'm going to kill you!

146
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:35,519
Guan Qi!

147
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,560
Why did you attack me?

148
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,360
I only killed an ant.

149
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,120
He's a person!

150
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,439
Not an ant!

151
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:48,319
I'll kill anyone I can!

152
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,759
I'll be killed

153
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,920
if I can't kill them!

154
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,720
The strong should survive
while the weak should die.

155
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,079
It's the order of nature!

156
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,519
I don't care about nature's order!

157
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,759
You lost two of your family members.

158
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,160
You can say my anger
has subsided a little.

159
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,639
Now, we can sit

160
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,360
and settle our scores.

161
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,039
Chief Elder Lei, come and join me.

162
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,840
I have failed you.

163
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,000
Please punish me.

164
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,039
Did anything go wrong in the north?

165
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,759
No.

166
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,879
Then it's all good.

167
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:01,799
Guan Qi has escaped.

168
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,200
Who?

169
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:08,720
Guan Qi.

170
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,039
Guan Qi of Mitian Sect?

171
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:19,320
Didn't...

172
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,279
Didn't I tell you to kill him?

173
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,600
Why is he still alive?

174
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,919
I pursued Guan Qi under your order.

175
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,720
But no matter what,

176
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,840
he's still my wife's younger brother.

177
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,960
So I imprisoned him in the dungeon
at the bottom of the well.

178
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,879
I planned to imprison him for life.

179
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,240
But someone
from the House of Sunset Drizzle

180
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,039
broke him out last night.

181
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,080
I...

182
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,120
Would this happen
if you had killed him earlier?

183
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,799
We're done for

184
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,120
if someone took him away.

185
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,559
Go.

186
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,679
Tell Su Mengzhen

187
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,360
of the House of Sunset Drizzle

188
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,720
to hand him over.

189
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,279
If he refuses,

190
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:10,840
I'll tear his building down!

191
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,000
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

192
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,639
Sir,

193
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,799
how about you go into hiding?

194
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,879
Why should I?

195
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:25,679
I'm a minister,

196
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,519
and he's a nobody.

197
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,519
Mister, how are you feeling?

198
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
You must feel baffled

199
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,919
that you're being imprisoned now.

200
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,519
Why did you attack me yesterday?

201
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,039
I shouldn't have freed you.

202
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,240
I should have locked you up.

203
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:40,720
All by yourself?

204
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:44,120
Lei Sun sent more than 100 men trying

205
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:47,360
to lock me up at the well back then.

206
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,600
I almost escaped.

207
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:52,919
That's right.

208
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:55,559
The remains in the well

209
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,159
were my doings.

210
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:00,480
The kid with the bells

211
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,519
wasn't my child too.

212
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,559
I lied to you.

213
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:07,399
You're a mad man.

214
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,559
It's useless.

215
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,240
No one can live

216
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,960
after they go against Guan Qi.

217
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:43,679
Any news about last night?

218
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,559
Someone saw Wang Xiaoshi has

219
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:47,159
a skirmish with those
from Six Half Hall.

220
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,879
Someone was next to him at the time.

221
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,919
But strangely,

222
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,519
the man had chains
on his hands and legs.

223
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,159
Who was that man?

224
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,440
As far as I know,

225
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,960
only one person makes Lei Sun anxious.

226
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:58,679
But

227
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,240
logically speaking,

228
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,919
this person should have been dead.

229
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,200
Guan Qi?

230
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:10,840
Yes.

231
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,840
Guan Qi was
the Holy Master of Mitian Sect.

232
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,759
They say
this man has high martial arts skills,

233
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,320
which had reached supernatural power.

234
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,120
If this is the case,

235
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,360
I'm afraid Xiaoshi
won't be able to take on him.

236
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:25,279
Besides,

237
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,960
Messenger Pigeon Group found out

238
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,759
that Lei Sun went to see Fu Zongshu.

239
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,039
It doesn't matter

240
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:31,279
if Wang Xiaoshi
deliberately released Guan Qi or not.

241
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,759
Trouble will come to our House soon.

242
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:36,919
I need to see someone to confirm it.

243
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,559
If that's Guan Qi,

244
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,159
I think he'll be on my side.

245
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,120
You must leave the House now.

246
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,120
If the Ministry of Justice
can't find the person they want,

247
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:47,840
they'll make things difficult for you.

248
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,000
Mengzhen,

249
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:51,799
I have a plan.

250
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,799
Since Lei Sun tried
to drag us into this,

251
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,399
we can return them the favor.

252
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:17,840
Well, what a surprise.

253
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:20,360
Isn't this
Vice House Master Bai Choufei?

254
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,559
Different. Absolutely different.

255
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,240
It was only yesterday
you were at rock bottom.

256
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:27,159
Today, you've become
an important person.

257
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:27,758
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

258
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:29,240
Are you here to search
the House of Sunset Drizzle

259
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,279
with all these men?

260
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,399
A criminal of the Ministry of Justice,
Guan Qi, has disappeared.

261
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,159
Someone proved

262
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,159
that it's related to Wang Xiaoshi
of the House of Sunset Drizzle.

263
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,480
We're here to capture Wang Xiaoshi

264
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:42,159
and bring Guan Qi back.

265
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:45,480
It looks like your trip is in vain.

266
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,480
Do you think Wang Xiaoshi

267
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:50,440
would return here openly

268
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,679
if he broke
the Ministry of Justice's prisoner out?

269
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:54,720
But

270
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,320
I know where he is.

271
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,399
So long as you promise

272
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,159
not to hold
the House of Sunset Drizzle accountable,

273
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,679
I'll tell you their hideout.

274
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:05,519
Do you take me for a fool?

275
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:07,840
You and Wang Xiaoshi
are close companions.

276
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,320
You would never sell him out.

277
00:15:09,336 --> 00:15:11,260
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

278
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,200
You did say

279
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,240
I'm the Vice House Master
of the House of Sunset Drizzle.

280
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:16,879
So I must do everything

281
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,279
for the House's sake.

282
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,919
No matter.

283
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:22,360
Since the Vice House Master
has shown his sincerity,

284
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:24,279
we would certainly have to agree.

285
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,960
But Vice House Master Bai
is now a respectable man.

286
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,519
We must watch over him.

287
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,759
We'll be attending

288
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,759
to Vice House Master Bai personally.

289
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,519
I asked you here

290
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,360
to confirm one matter.

291
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,600
Was it Guan Qi last night?

292
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,120
This piece of information
will get out eventually.

293
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:18,200
So I'll just be frank with you, Mr. Su.

294
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,759
Yes, it was Guan Qi.

295
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,679
Are you here to question me?

296
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,279
If that's the case,

297
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,759
I'd like to ask you one thing.

298
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:32,039
Why was it Wang Xiaoshi

299
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,840
who rescued the person
we imprisoned in secret?

300
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,799
If I had known Guan Qi was
the one imprisoned,

301
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,279
I'd rather release
500kg of wolf's bane

302
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,279
to poison him to death

303
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,639
than meet him.

304
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,120
You've always had my admiration,

305
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,919
because you're the only thinker

306
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,360
in the Six Half Hall.

307
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,159
Tell Lei Sun

308
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,840
not to cause us any trouble.

309
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:59,120
Without our help,

310
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,120
you won't be able to solve this problem.

311
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,960
Are you saying

312
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:05,400
you're going to work with us?

313
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,000
You have no other choices

314
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,559
if you want to defeat the evil, Guan Qi.

315
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,759
I have no choice either.

316
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:20,640
Mr. Su,

317
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,519
if you want me to live longer,

318
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,400
you should stop saying

319
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,920
that I'm the only thinker.

320
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,920
The Messenger Pigeon Group stated

321
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,240
that they might have come here.

322
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,920
Let's go in and have a look.

323
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:49,119
Everyone, be careful.

324
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:50,599
Wait.

325
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,519
Someone is coming out.

326
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,480
Move it quickly.

327
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,000
Yan Hefa,

328
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,079
if you can't find my blade,

329
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:23,480
I'll let you die miserably.

330
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,240
Do you know why I killed his family?

331
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,480
I treated him as my best friend

332
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,000
and let him succeed
as the Holy Master of Mitian Sect.

333
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,200
It was a never-ending glory.

334
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,039
Am I right?

335
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:41,000
Say something.

336
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:43,720
Yes.

337
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,000
After that, I brought him along
to do business with me

338
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,680
and made a huge profit.

339
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,759
But what did he do?

340
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,640
Ungrateful person.

341
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,079
He told Fu Zongshu
and Lei Sun of my whereabouts.

342
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,599
Right?

343
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,079
Yes.

344
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,680
So I killed your family for revenge.

345
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,599
Was I right for doing that?

346
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,799
Hey, don't push it.

347
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:08,920
Am I right?

348
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,559
Yes.

349
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:14,880
Move.

350
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,039
Lad, I don't want to kill you.

351
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:30,319
But you talk too much.

352
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:31,920
I'm afraid I can't control myself.

353
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,079
So just keep quiet for a while.

354
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:38,559
Yan Hefa.

355
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:42,160
Shouldn't you say something?

356
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:45,440
I betrayed you.

357
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,279
I deserve to lose my wife

358
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,920
and my son.

359
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:52,680
I deserve to die miserably.

360
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:54,599
You're

361
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:57,240
my benefactor.

362
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,000
Yet, I betrayed you.

363
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,240
I'm worse than an animal!

364
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,759
I'm worse than an animal.

365
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:13,319
I'm worse than an animal.

366
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:17,960
I'm worse than an animal.

367
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:25,279
I'm worse than an animal.

368
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,680
I'm worse than an animal.

369
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:31,759
But

370
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,799
no one wants to live like an animal.

371
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:56,960
There's no rush.

372
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,920
Heaven is fair, impartial,

373
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,400
and treats everything alike.

374
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,960
Everything should be abandoned
once it's useless. Humans, too.

375
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,960
If he's useless,

376
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:06,279
I can kill him.

377
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:23,319
Run!

378
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:24,200
Are they your subordinates?

379
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:24,759
Run!

380
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:26,599
Run!

381
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,000
Are they here to save you?

382
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,839
It's been long
since my blade tasted blood.

383
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:34,079
I'll use them to feed its thirst.

384
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:40,799
What are you trying to say?

385
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:41,920
Guan Qi,

386
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:43,720
stop killing innocent people.

387
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,440
Didn't you want to kill Fu Zongshu?

388
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,240
I'll help you

389
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:48,440
as long as you let them go.

390
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,079
Help me kill Fu Zongshu?

391
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,240
You have a point.

392
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,559
Go now.

393
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,519
Go.

394
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,559
Leave!

395
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,440
I can promise you.

396
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:05,400
But

397
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,319
my blade refuses.

398
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:10,599
Guan Qi！

399
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,440
I've told you.

400
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:41,279
I'll kill anyone

401
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:43,160
I can.

402
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,599
I'll be killed

403
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,079
if I can't.

404
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,000
It's such a simple reason.

405
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,839
Why can't you understand?

406
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:52,319
Guan Qi,

407
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,160
I'll kill you myself.

408
00:22:58,319 --> 00:22:59,319
Kid,

409
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,839
you surely are stubborn.

410
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,680
I'm a little scared of what you said.

411
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:08,319
That means I can't let you live anymore.

412
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,320
(Six Half Hall)

413
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,279
I didn't know Guan Qi

414
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:21,839
is at Six Half Hall.

415
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:24,759
Of course, Guan Qi isn't here.

416
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:26,079
Vice House Master Bai

417
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:27,680
put himself at risk

418
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,839
to protect the House of Sunset Drizzle.

419
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:33,240
Put himself at risk?

420
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:35,039
I like the sound of that.

421
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:38,720
But it's not a good plan
to put yourself in danger.

422
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,799
Vice House Master Bai, did you trick us

423
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,880
because you miss your meal
at the dungeon?

424
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,759
Wang Xiaoshi and Guan Qi
are indeed here.

425
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:49,839
Why aren't you searching around?

426
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:51,559
You're still stubborn
when death is in front of you.

427
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,559
What evidence do you have
that they're here?

428
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:54,559
Of course, I have evidence.

429
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:58,039
I planned the strategy
to break Guan Qi out.

430
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:59,119
Wang Xiaoshi was responsible
for breaking him out.

431
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:01,559
But think about it.

432
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,559
We don't even know Guan Qi.

433
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:04,599
Why would we want to save him?

434
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,200
Moreover,

435
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:08,119
Guan Qi was imprisoned
at the Ministry of Justice.

436
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,359
I'm sure you know
what kind of place that is.

437
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,640
Is it a place we can go in and out
as we please?

438
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:17,680
It was because someone
ordered us to do so.

439
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,319
And this person

440
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,680
is at Six Half Hall.

441
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,640
Chief Elder Lei,

442
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:26,599
just admit it.

443
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,279
You're speaking nonsense
because you're cornered.

444
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,319
Chief Elder Lei, don't worry.

445
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,920
I'll take this mad person away.

446
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,200
Wait.

447
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:37,319
Why don't you hear

448
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:38,359
what Chief Elder has to say?

449
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,440
All right.

450
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,759
You said I ordered you
to rescue Guan Qi.

451
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:57,200
What?

452
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,759
Didn't I have men at Six Half Hall?

453
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:01,359
Of course, you have.

454
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:04,200
But you said it must be done in secret.

455
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:05,559
In secret?

456
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
What secret?

457
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,400
If you keep denying it,

458
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,680
I'll have to reveal everything then.

459
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:17,200
Because you're related to Guan Qi

460
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,839
through marriage.

461
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,079
Guan Qi has disappeared for eight years.

462
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:32,880
When you learned Guan Qi was held
in the Ministry of Justice's dungeon,

463
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,319
that's how
the rescue operation took place.

464
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:38,559
They say you need to mix truths and lies

465
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,279
to make a credible lie.

466
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:43,519
You came up with such nonsense
because you're at your end's wit.

467
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,799
I'll just be frank with you.

468
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,960
Guan Qi was not rescued

469
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,440
from the Ministry of Justice's dungeon.

470
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,599
So what you said
was a bunch of nonsense!

471
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,839
Both of you just firmly said

472
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,799
Wang Xiaoshi rescued Guan Qi
from the Ministry of Justice's dungeon.

473
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:05,799
That's why you wanted to seal off
the House of Sunset Drizzle.

474
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,680
Then you said

475
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,279
Wang Xiaoshi rescuing him
from the dungeon

476
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:09,519
was a bunch of nonsense?

477
00:26:32,195 --> 00:26:33,167
(Xiaoxuan Pavilion)

478
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,680
Why is it so quiet today?

479
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:37,279
Cabbage!

480
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,440
Little Rock!

481
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,519
Time to wake up!

482
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,920
(One day apart seems like ages.
I look forward to seeing you.)

483
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:12,079
When

484
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,279
I first saw you and Wang Xiaoshi arrived

485
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,759
in the Capital,

486
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:19,799
I knew you'd cause trouble

487
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:22,519
sooner or later

488
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,039
if I let you live.

489
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:30,839
Chief Elder,
you cannot kill Bai Choufei.

490
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:31,759
Out of my way!

491
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:32,440
Father!

492
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,319
Why are you here? Go away.

493
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,400
Out of my way!

494
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:41,480
He's my friend.

495
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:16,799
Chief Elder.

496
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:18,839
We must join forces with Su Mengzhen

497
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,119
if we want to subdue Guan Qi.

498
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,119
If we kill him,

499
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,319
the alliance will never happen.

500
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:50,880
Where's Wang Xiaoshi?

501
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,039
I'm delighted that my wife
came to see me.

502
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,680
But you came asking

503
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,279
about another man.

504
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,319
You've hurt my feelings.

505
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,400
Just so we are clear.

506
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,759
I'm not your wife,
so don't address me that way.

507
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,240
Where exactly is Wang Xiaoshi?

508
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,200
Last night,

509
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:09,680
we drank all night.

510
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,319
With the company of beautiful ladies,

511
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,440
I think

512
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,880
he's still drunk in some lady's room.

513
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:17,079
I'll try to remember.

514
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,039
Who are you fooling?

515
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:19,440
You have no idea where he is.

516
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,119
I don't need
to waste time talking to you.

517
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:21,960
Wait!

518
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:25,480
He came here asking for a perfume pouch,

519
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,000
and you came here asking for him.

520
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,039
How interesting.

521
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,079
What did you do to Wang Xiaoshi?

522
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:37,920
He kept pestering me.

523
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,000
I found him annoying,

524
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,599
so I locked him up somewhere.

525
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,319
You...

526
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,599
How about this?

527
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,839
Go somewhere with me.

528
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,440
If I'm happy,

529
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,039
I'll tell you

530
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:50,519
where he is.

531
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,000
What do you think?

532
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,160
Thank you for saving me.

533
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,680
I'll buy you a drink next time.

534
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:01,279
No need to thank me.

535
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,519
It was Di who got you
out of trouble today.

536
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,279
I didn't do anything to help at all.

537
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:08,319
But not many people
in the martial arts world know

538
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,559
about the relationship
between the Lei family and Guan Qi.

539
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,160
You must have memorized

540
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,359
everything at the White Tower.

541
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,160
But aren't you afraid of dying

542
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,440
under my father's blade
for being reckless?

543
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,119
Thank you for worrying about me.

544
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,799
If I hadn't come,

545
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,240
I wouldn't have met you.

546
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,279
I wouldn't have known
your name is Lei Chun.

547
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:29,160
So I'm buying you this drink

548
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,960
no matter what.

549
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,519
All right.

550
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,759
I look forward to the four of us
getting together again.

551
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:41,559
I'll take my leave, then.

552
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,039
Clever.

553
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:58,000
He's indeed clever.

554
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,920
He's clever,

555
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:02,680
but cleverly feigning ignorance.

556
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:04,519
His intention is written
all over his face.

557
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:07,680
I know.

558
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,200
I'll find a chance
to make it clear to him.

559
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,119
Chief Elder.

560
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:22,319
You

561
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:25,440
rarely go against my wishes.

562
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:27,519
You know what is right.

563
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:29,759
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able
to stop you.

564
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:31,720
As for Bai Choufei,

565
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:33,200
letting him live

566
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,599
may not necessarily

567
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,319
be a loss for us now.

568
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,119
Bai Choufei is meticulous,

569
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,839
and Su Mengzhen thinks highly of him.

570
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:43,920
We must kill him.

571
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:45,759
But if we kill him now,

572
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:48,240
it'll only make
the House of Sunset Drizzle more united.

573
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,640
Rather than kill him,

574
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,119
we can tempt him.

575
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,599
What do you think
about Chun trying to rescue Bai Choufei?

576
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,720
I suppose Chun and Bai Choufei

577
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,119
are true friends.

578
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:04,279
I don't mind them
making friends with each other.

579
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:06,799
Just let them continue their friendship.

580
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,880
Perhaps,

581
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:14,759
Su Mengzhen will mind it one day.

582
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:24,705
(May You Have Great Future)
Hurry up!

583
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,680
Hurry up!

584
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,200
Do you always come to places like this?

585
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,240
I always come
to the entertainment quarters.

586
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:40,799
I've already seen everything
that's interesting

587
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,880
and played what is fun.

588
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,240
Something is still lacking.

589
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,240
Look at those wrestlers.

590
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,680
Those who went up to fight

591
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,359
were big and tall women.

592
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,000
It's still not interesting enough.

593
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,519
Today,

594
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,039
I'd like to see you

595
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,480
go and fight.

596
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,240
You're outrageous.

597
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,359
I'll never go up there.

598
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,480
I see.

599
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:04,759
That's too bad, then.

600
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:07,079
If I become unhappy

601
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,480
because I can't watch what I want,

602
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:11,640
I'd forget

603
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:12,759
where Wang Xiaoshi is.

604
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,680
You're despicable!

605
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:20,519
See that woman on the stage?

606
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,000
It's been ten days.

607
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:23,880
She never lost once.

608
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,400
If you can defeat her,

609
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,440
I'll tell you

610
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,079
whatever you want to know.

611
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:36,160
- Hurry up!
- Good!

612
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,240
Start the fight!

613
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:43,640
- Beat her!
- Beat her!

614
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,759
Fight!

615
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:46,559
Hurry up and fight!

616
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:48,160
You're so thin.

617
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:49,160
If I sleep next to you,

618
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,680
I'm afraid I might squash you to death.

619
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:53,000
Beat her!

620
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,079
She looks pretty.

621
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,519
I don't think you're good enough

622
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,559
to marry someone like her.

623
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,799
Come on!

624
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:01,039
Beat her!

625
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:01,680
Begin it already!

626
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,000
Come on! Hurry up!

627
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,795
She looks thin. Can she fight?

628
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,039
Start the fight now!

629
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,360
She has no strength.

630
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,519
Great!

631
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,960
Nice!

632
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:42,679
Can you even fight?

633
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,119
If you can't, get lost!

634
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,840
If you lose, just come home with me!

635
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,599
My dear,

636
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,519
you can't keep this on.

637
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,239
You must at least win one round.

638
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,719
So I can be happy.

639
00:34:58,719 --> 00:34:59,519
She can still fight?

640
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,280
Nice!

641
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,519
Awesome! Nice!

642
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:44,559
Pin her down!

643
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:56,199
Great!

644
00:35:57,159 --> 00:35:58,159
Not bad! Well done!

645
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:03,440
Awesome! Incredible!

646
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,800
Nice technique!

647
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,320
Put in more effort.

648
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,320
Get up!

649
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,079
What are you doing? Get up!

650
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,639
- Get up!
- Get up!

651
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:58,079
- Get up!
- Get up!

652
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:15,440
If I become unhappy

653
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:16,679
because I don't see what I want,

654
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,639
I'd forget where

655
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,679
Wang Xiaoshi is.

656
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,440
You can do this!

657
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:45,760
Hang in there!

658
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,159
Wonderful!

659
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,159
Nice technique!

660
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:14,159
Awesome! Incredible!

661
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:15,440
Ladies and gentlemen!

662
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,119
See?

663
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,639
This is my wife.

664
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,039
I wonder which generous man

665
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:23,000
sent his wife to fight in the ring!

666
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,840
You can't put it that way.

667
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,400
It's true happiness
when everyone is happy!

668
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:30,159
Am I right, my dear?

669
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,360
That's incredible!

670
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:36,199
- Incredible!
- Awesome!

671
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:01,400
Stop right there!

672
00:40:01,434 --> 00:40:02,649
(Fu's Residence)

673
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:03,599
What is your purpose here?

674
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,679
It's a gift

675
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:13,880
for Minister Fu.

676
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,960
What's inside?

677
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,960
What's inside?

678
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:50,760
What's inside?

679
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:00,400
I can hear something.

680
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:07,679
I can hear someone inside.

681
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,119
Why is someone inside?

682
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,079
Let's check it out.

683
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:11,079
Let's open it.

684
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:30,800
What is this?

685
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:31,920
It's a thunder crash bomb!

686
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:40,360
Don't come near me. Go away!

687
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:42,079
Don't come close!

688
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,119
Get away from me!

689
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:47,039
Water!

690
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,679
Any water? Water!

691
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,679
Any water!

692
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,679
Help me!

693
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,360
Any water?

694
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:55,639
Don't run. Help me!

695
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:56,800
It's going to explode.

696
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,400
Over there. There's a water crock there.

697
00:41:58,559 --> 00:41:59,360
There's water inside.

698
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,880
Thank you, my friend.

699
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:12,800
You're welcome.

700
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:15,159
Capture the assassin!

701
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,519
I'm not an assassin.

702
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:18,840
I don't care if you're one.

703
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,639
We'll talk after we take you with us.

704
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,920
My dear,
you have great martial arts skills.

705
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,800
Are you happy now?

706
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,360
Of course, I'm happy.

707
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:41,159
I've watched such a spectacular fight.

708
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:41,920
Since you're happy,

709
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,159
tell me where Wang Xiaoshi is.

710
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,280
It looks like
you're really concerned about him.

711
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:51,559
Fine. I'm a man of my words.

712
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:53,719
Judging by this hour,

713
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:56,320
you might still see him alive

714
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:58,159
if you head to
Minister Fu's residence now.

715
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,519
Minister Fu's residence?

716
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:01,320
Why would Wang Xiaoshi be there?

717
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,000
Are you lying to me again?

718
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,519
You'll find out

719
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:06,639
if you go there.

720
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,519
How pitiful

721
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:16,079
to live like a puppet.

722
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:45,159
Something's wrong.

723
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,079
