32

Little Rock.

33
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:57,120
Do you know why I have
never left the Baixu Garden?

34
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,920
Is it because of Thirteen Doom?

35
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,200
The Baixu Garden
is a place of tranquility.

36
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,800
Carefree Sect has rarely got involved
in matters of the martial arts world.

37
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,560
But Thirteen Doom
sided with the Youqiao Group.

38
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,800
He brought shame to our sect.

39
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,319
His betrayal also led to the
defeat of Fang Geyin's militia group.

40
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,919
As his martial brother,

41
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,879
I vouched to cleanse
the sect of this evil.

42
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,800
I traveled far and wide,
and eventually found Thirteen Doom.

43
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,199
He's a martial arts prodigy.

44
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,400
He almost lost his mind
while he trained to master martial arts.

45
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,960
At that time,

46
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,319
he just mastered the Arrow of Sorrow.

47
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,039
I was his martial brother,

48
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,000
but I was no match for him.

49
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,000
When I was about to die by his arrow,

50
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,319
to my surprise,

51
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,439
someone took the arrow for me.

52
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,280
Maybe it was Jing?

53
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,360
Who would have thought?

54
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,479
The first person to die

55
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,080
by Thirteen Doom's
newly-mastered technique

56
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,560
was Jing.

57
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,000
He was engulfed in anguish.

58
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,560
He hated himself.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,039
He hated me even more.

60
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,159
He blamed me for Jing's death.

61
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,520
A thought often comes to my mind.

62
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,560
If I hadn't insisted on

63
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:27,199
cleansing the sect of his evil,

64
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:31,599
perhaps Jing would still be alive.

65
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:33,520
Therefore,

66
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:37,879
I set a rule for myself.

67
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,639
I vowed never to leave the Baixu Garden.

68
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,560
Thirteen Doom

69
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,759
must have heard about
my departure from the mountain.

70
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,159
That's why he came.

71
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,840
The grudge between us

72
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,840
must be put to an end.

73
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,000
Thirteen Doom didn't come alone.

74
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,039
The wielder of the Blood River Sword is with him.

75
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,759
Marquis Shentong?

76
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,039
Your father's death
was a mystery for us all.

77
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,280
You went missing as well.

78
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,759
Chancellor Cai took
your foster brother, Fang Yingkan,

79
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,960
in the name of the Imperial Court.

80
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,319
People from the martial arts world

81
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:17,199
thought it was the Court's decision.

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,120
But in hindsight,

83
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,680
Chancellor Cai did so

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,160
to silence any doubts about his intention

85
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:24,199
and

86
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:27,079
to cover up the truth
about your father's death.

87
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,360
Not only was he adopted
by Chancellor Cai,

88
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,480
but he also admitted

89
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,879
to pushing my father into the sinkhole.

90
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,279
This grudge is not over between us.

91
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,360
There is no way I'll leave.

92
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,160
Hurry.

93
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:51,199
What happened?

94
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,000
Come, lie down.

95
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,240
Quick. Save Official Liu.

96
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,279
Official Liu?

97
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,759
Here,

98
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,839
drink it while it's warm.

99
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,680
That scoundrel.

100
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:09,399
He knew about the roads
Official Liu would be taking.

101
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,279
I was worried he might
intercept Official Liu along the way.

102
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,439
Our only advantage is haste.

103
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,680
We'll take the shortcut

104
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,519
and pick up Official Liu.

105
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,959
According to the owner of the wine store,

106
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,160
this is the last location

107
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,900
where Official Liu

108
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:32,800
(Kunlu Mountain)
sent the message.

109
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,360
Judging by the pace they move at,

110
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,439
they should arrive in
Baimao Stronghold tomorrow at noon.

111
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,120
But there is no place along the road

112
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,720
for them to spend the night.

113
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,439
It's almost nightfall.

114
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,639
The only place with shelter

115
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,279
is this place.

116
00:05:48,294 --> 00:05:48,720
(Yangjiapuzi)

117
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,079
Yangjiapuzi?

118
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:50,920
Yes.

119
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:53,360
The place is already abandoned.

120
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,639
No one lives there.

121
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,120
There are some walls for shelter.

122
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,560
If my guess is right,

123
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:01,040
Official Liu will spend the night there.

124
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,800
I'll go.

125
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,800
I'll follow the river.

126
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,240
If I go now,

127
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,000
I can reach there before the enemies.

128
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,240
No, Big Beard! You're hurt.

129
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,079
I'll go!

130
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:10,759
- I'll go!
- I'll go!

131
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:11,240
I'll go.

132
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,680
- I'll go!
- I'll go!

133
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,240
Enough!

134
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,000
Now is not the time for argument.

135
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,879
Stop fighting.

136
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,360
I'll go.

137
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,759
We can't let you go.

138
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,240
You just got married.

139
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,199
Think about your wife.

140
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,600
His wife gives him the permission.

141
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:35,959
He is my husband.

142
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,240
It's his job to do great things.

143
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,519
If you made him stay in this bunker,

144
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,879
he'd be useless

145
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,240
and incapable in my eyes.

146
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,240
It's almost nightfall.

147
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,199
You should go back.

148
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:56,120
Little Rock, protect Official Liu.

149
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:58,519
Little Rock, you must come back.

150
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,560
Don't worry.

151
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,759
Take care of Master for me.

152
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,920
Go back now.

153
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,360
I must go now.

154
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,240
Go on.

155
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,079
First Elder Di?

156
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,600
Wang Xiaoshi?

157
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,360
Your death made a wave in the Capital.

158
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,399
I'm surprised to see you here.

159
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,480
I'm alive and well.

160
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,519
What are you doing here?

161
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,319
For something I once mentioned to you.

162
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,160
It's about Chun.

163
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,560
I know

164
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,759
who hurt Miss Lei.

165
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,879
It's Fang Yingkan.

166
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,959
I came

167
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:21,079
to avenge Chun.

168
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,439
Fang Yingkan hurt Chun.

169
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,360
It doesn't matter where he is.

170
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,759
I'll make him pay for that.

171
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,319
I applaud you

172
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,000
for your sense of honor.

173
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,159
I don't mind telling you.

174
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,720
The person I'm meeting

175
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,080
is Fang Yingkan's target.

176
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,559
Our interests align.

177
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,879
Would you come with me?

178
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,159
You'd better not run into him
during your rescue mission.

179
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,200
He is just as strong as the two of us.

180
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,720
But I will get to him.

181
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:50,240
We should split up.

182
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,080
If I run into him,

183
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,639
I might be able to stall him for you.

184
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,600
Very well.

185
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,919
How are my two brothers?

186
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,159
They are well.

187
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,240
Don't worry.

188
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,759
Wang Xiaoshi,

189
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,759
your brothers have done so much

190
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,919
so you could stay away
from the trouble of the Capital

191
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,519
to have a peaceful life

192
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:13,279
and live well.

193
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,200
They will be glad to know

194
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,440
you are still alive.

195
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,360
If we could be friends
back in the Capital,

196
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,840
it'd probably be great.

197
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,360
Whatever happened in the past,

198
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,159
I'll still be your friend.

199
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,519
This is where we part ways.

200
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:30,960
Take care.

201
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,120
Take care.

202
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:00,960
Sir.

203
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,600
Let's make camp here tonight.

204
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,919
If we go further ahead,

205
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,919
we might not find shelter at all.

206
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,440
This is Yangjiapuzi?

207
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:10,360
Yes.

208
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,639
Who would have thought?

209
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,559
After all we've gone through,

210
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,360
we ended up
taking shelter in this place.

211
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,120
The night wind in the north is strong.

212
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,759
Find shelter from the wind.

213
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:21,519
Let's go.

214
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,480
Let's find a proper shelter
to spend the night.

215
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:24,240
Sure.

216
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,080
Let's go.

217
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,360
Sir, it's too cold.

218
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,320
Let's make a fire.

219
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,120
(Liu Anshi)
We are out in the wilderness.

220
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:47,519
(Liu Anshi)
A fire will attract unwanted attention.

221
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,320
Forget it.

222
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,600
You brought us to this forsaken place.

223
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,720
And you called this a proper shelter.

224
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,960
I searched the whole place,

225
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,639
but there wasn't

226
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:57,600
a standing house here.

227
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,399
By the way,

228
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,639
judging by the state of this village,

229
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,759
there must have been
a battle or a plague here.

230
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,000
There was a battle here.

231
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:09,600
A battle?

232
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,919
When? We've never heard about it.

233
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,080
It wasn't a glorious victory.

234
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,080
Ordered by the Chancellor,

235
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,759
a nameless troop

236
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,000
came here

237
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,000
and attacked Fang Geyin's militia group.

238
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:26,200
It's been many years.

239
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,080
Souls of the brave have passed on.

240
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,480
The evildoer
is still alive and in control.

241
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,159
I blame myself for not doing more.

242
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,759
Someone is here.

243
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:39,720
Sir.

244
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,639
Let's check it out.

245
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:41,200
Let's go!

246
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:47,240
Isn't this

247
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,519
- Wang Xiaoshi?
- Wang Xiaoshi?

248
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:50,240
Tang Baoniu and Fang Henshao?

249
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:56,200
What are you doing here?

250
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,000
That's my line. Why are you here?

251
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,159
My Master has sent me to pick up Official Liu.

252
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:02,000
We were assigned to protect Official Liu.

253
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,320
We need someone to be our guide.

254
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,399
Great. Where is Official Liu?

255
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,159
He's inside.

256
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,159
- Come.
- Come.

257
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,320
Official Liu, I am Wang Xiaoshi.

258
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,120
My Master, Recluse Tianyi,

259
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,080
ordered me to pick you up.

260
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:17,080
Mr. Su and Tianyi told me about you.

261
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:18,840
These two here

262
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,120
have often talked about you too.

263
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,600
You were a hero to this nation

264
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,159
but were banished to the border.

265
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,720
I feel sorry for you.

266
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,399
Don't be, Official Liu.

267
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:29,519
Official Liu,

268
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,639
Chancellor Cai's soldiers know
the route you're taking.

269
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:33,279
I rode as fast as I could to reach here.

270
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:34,399
I have an idea.

271
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,279
We must take another route
to Baimao Stronghold

272
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,480
to avoid being spotted.

273
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,679
Yes, we'll follow your lead.

274
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,840
Bad news. A large group
of soldiers is coming this way.

275
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,000
Come with me.

276
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:45,559
Follow me, Official Liu.

277
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:46,039
Let's go.

278
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,200
Come.

279
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:18,039
Marquis, the luggage is still warm.

280
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:19,440
They couldn't have gone far.

281
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:20,360
Pursue!

282
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,399
Protect Official Liu and go!

283
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,159
We'll stall them!

284
00:14:58,919 --> 00:14:59,879
Wang Xiaoshi?

285
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,240
It's you again.

286
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,440
It takes a lot to kill you.

287
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,440
You must pay for my father's death!

288
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,000
I'll make you pay!

289
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,240
So, you know.

290
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,519
My brother.

291
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,320
He's not the only one I killed.

292
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:15,159
You will die by my hand as well.

293
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,279
Wait and see.

294
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,399
You will pay for your crime.

295
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,000
Let's go.

296
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,120
Little Rock?

297
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,480
Stay still, Miss.

298
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,480
Move, and you will die.

299
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,480
I told you many years ago.

300
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,159
If you step out of the Baixu Garden,

301
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:47,720
I'll hunt you down

302
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,120
to the edge of the world.

303
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:51,720
Even after so many years,

304
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,799
you still haven't moved on.

305
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,159
I can only move on

306
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,679
when you're dead.

307
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,000
Very well.

308
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,759
This is between the two of us.

309
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,160
Leave the others out of this.

310
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,680
The bunch of you
are waiting for Liu Anshi,

311
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,279
am I right?

312
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:22,640
Then, you shall all die.

313
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:26,680
Marquis.

314
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,279
If we head for the Baimao Stronghold,

315
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:29,359
we can still make it in time.

316
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,599
Even if they got away,

317
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,799
we'd dispatch troops anywhere

318
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,359
with your order.

319
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:35,160
They won't get away so easily.

320
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:39,680
Ambush!

321
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,799
Marquis!

322
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,440
Watch out, Marquis!

323
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:48,880
We are at the northern border.

324
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,599
Just how many
masterful warriors are here?

325
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,480
Show yourself!

326
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:27,000
Di Feijing!

327
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:29,279
What's got into you this time?

328
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,640
You know very well

329
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,759
what you've done.

330
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,599
Are you here to avenge your Young Lady?

331
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,279
Just how many are waiting

332
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,759
to have revenge on me?

333
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,960
I'll be the last.

334
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:48,200
You die

335
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,160
when the debt has been paid.

336
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:51,680
You want to fight me alone?

337
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,440
Kill him!

338
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,599
(Di, you see me as your family.)

339
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,039
(I see you as my family too.)

340
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,680
(With my last breath,)

341
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:28,920
(I'll protect the Six Half Hall)

342
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,119
(and my family.)

343
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,759
(You don't have to take on
everything by yourself.)

344
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,279
(At least, I'm still here with you.)

345
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:50,640
(Remember your promise.)

346
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:52,359
(Protect Chun!)

347
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:54,640
(Feijing.)

348
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:57,200
Feijing.

349
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:02,799
Chun.

350
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,319
(Chun.)

351
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:41,960
(There was this saying.)

352
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,759
(The best way to live in the martial arts world)

353
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,079
(is by having a grand ambition)

354
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
(and protecting the loved ones.)

355
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:52,519
(Chun,)

356
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:55,279
(I've reached the edge of the world.)

357
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,960
(The mountains are tall, and the sea is endless.)

358
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:00,319
(It feels great to have a dream here.)

359
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:04,200
(That's the end for me.)

360
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:07,079
(Take care.)

361
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,320
(Baimao Stronghold)

362
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:23,880
Where is everyone?

363
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:42,599
Let's check inside.

364
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,079
Buddy, what happened here?

365
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,680
Wen Rou!

366
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,319
What's wrong?

367
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:55,119
Wen Rou!

368
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,160
Wen Rou!

369
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,440
Big Beard!

370
00:22:59,279 --> 00:22:59,960
Big Beard!

371
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:00,799
What happened?

372
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,519
There are two groups coming after Official Liu.

373
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,160
The other group

374
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,680
only sent one man.

375
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:11,119
He carried a bow.

376
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,559
Yuan Xian, Thirteen Doom.

377
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,319
He took Recluse Tianyi and Wen Rou.

378
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:18,880
He wants us to trade

379
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,759
Official Liu's evidence

380
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,680
for their lives.

381
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,119
Official Liu is without followers.

382
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,440
You two must stay with him.

383
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,319
I'll go alone.

384
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:36,880
Xiaoshi.

385
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,359
There is no military order.

386
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,440
It existed at one point.

387
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,440
But after so many years,

388
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:46,480
that order

389
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:47,519
might have

390
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,160
already been sabotaged.

391
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:54,640
After such a long search,

392
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:57,279
and after so many entrusted their hopes to us,

393
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,680
all of it

394
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,200
turned out to be a mistake.

395
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,079
Even if we had the evidence,

396
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,319
I would never hand it over.

397
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,039
But Master and Wen Rou have been captured.

398
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,759
I must save them
even if it means sacrificing myself.

399
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:16,680
Take care of Official Liu.

400
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,279
Who are you?

401
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:52,200
Who is in my way?

402
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:54,279
I'm not defeated yet!

403
00:24:58,319 --> 00:24:59,720
There are only very few who could have

404
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,079
given you those wounds.

405
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,960
Karma finds its way.

406
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:05,440
Yingkan,

407
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:08,279
you have lost your sight.

408
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,279
Karma?

409
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:12,400
You should see
what happened to the other guy.

410
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,160
You fools!

411
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:18,960
All of you are fighting for precious loved ones.

412
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:21,440
So what if I violated a girl?

413
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,480
He traveled across the land just to kill me!

414
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:25,839
You people repel me.

415
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:28,160
You did everything for yourself.

416
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:29,440
Of course you wouldn't understand!

417
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,480
Who

418
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,240
do we live for

419
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,200
if not ourselves?

420
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,640
I will only care about myself.

421
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:39,480
No one matters more than myself!

422
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,480
You'd do anything for your own gain?

423
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:44,880
You abandoned
your humanity and conscience.

424
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:47,279
You'd even kill the man who raised you!

425
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,920
I killed him because of you!

426
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:54,240
You should have never come into this world.

427
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,000
Without you,

428
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,400
his might,

429
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,359
his power, and his reputation

430
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,799
would have been mine to take.

431
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:05,559
But after you were born,

432
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:09,039
he treated you better than anyone.

433
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,599
He gave you everything. But what about me?

434
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:13,599
What about me?

435
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,440
I might as well

436
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,240
take everything from him

437
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:19,799
rather than let you inherit it.

438
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,559
Chancellor ordered

439
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,160
to have Fang Geyin's entire family killed.

440
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,960
Why weren't you killed?

441
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:33,599
He raised you.

442
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:36,319
Instead of repaying his kindness,

443
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:38,400
you only thought about
taking everything he had.

444
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,599
A scoundrel like you

445
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:41,799
doesn't deserve a family.

446
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:43,640
Like father like son.

447
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,480
You're just as annoying as your father.

448
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,279
When I was 11 years old,

449
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:51,720
with my first kill,

450
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,279
blood dripped from my blade to my hand.

451
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:56,759
I felt no fear at all.

452
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:59,079
I even tasted his blood.

453
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,000
The taste

454
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,079
was so savory.

455
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,680
It was at that moment

456
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,039
that I realized I was different.

457
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,519
Perhaps some people are born

458
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:14,880
to have nothing but darkness.

459
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,839
I am one of them.

460
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:20,319
So,

461
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,519
I don't care

462
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,200
if he was my father! I'll kill anyone

463
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,319
who stands in my way!

464
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:26,559
There is nothing to be said.

465
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:29,079
I consider it injustice

466
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,079
that you're still alive after all the evil

467
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:32,000
you've done.

468
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,519
Let's put an end to this

469
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,720
with our swords.

470
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,119
That's more like it.

471
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:39,400
After all the self-righteous talks,

472
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,160
victory belongs

473
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:45,559
to the better swordsman.

474
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,240
(Chancellor, Palace Secretariat.
Urgent: Eliminate the vagabonds)

475
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:43,079
The military order has been hidden

476
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,079
inside the Blood River Sword all this time?

477
00:28:58,279 --> 00:28:59,039
You lost.

478
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,000
Cold weather for cold-blooded murders.

479
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:49,240
Xu Xiaoyi.

480
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,319
You are going to die here.

481
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,319
Jing died

482
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:56,119
in the same cold weather.

483
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,599
You've killed countless.

484
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,759
You're a fiend!

485
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,880
You're a monster!

486
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,960
If I am a monster, so is he!

487
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,279
He killed my wife!

488
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:05,599
I'm going to die anyway.

489
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,200
I won't waste my time arguing

490
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,240
about the past.

491
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,279
Xu Xiaoyi.

492
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,359
This is all your fault!

493
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,720
Jing was my friend too!

494
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:22,519
I had to watch her

495
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,039
die in front of me.

496
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,440
I will never forget that.

497
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,440
You've wronged him.

498
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:37,920
Master feels guilty for her death

499
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,039
because his friend
took an arrow for him.

500
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:41,519
Master has a conscience.

501
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:42,720
That's why he feels guilty.

502
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,160
But you have no right to take revenge on him!

503
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:47,759
You sided with the Youqiao Group

504
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:48,960
and did their bidding.

505
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,839
You would even kill your own martial brother!

506
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:53,279
Jing's death

507
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,000
was to punish you for all the sins

508
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,680
you had committed!

509
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,480
Silence!

510
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,279
If he hadn't come after me,

511
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,559
Jing wouldn't have died!

512
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:04,480
You're my martial brother.

513
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,400
Why would you want to kill me?

514
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,359
Was it because of Fang Geyin?

515
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,480
Or was it because of
your so-called comrades?

516
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,720
Did you even share a bond?

517
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,559
Did you grow up together?

518
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:22,640
Xu Xiaoyi!

519
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,000
They meant nothing to you!

520
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:27,720
I was supposed

521
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,039
to be your brother and family!

522
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:31,680
The people I killed

523
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,039
meant nothing to me!

524
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:34,640
Nothing to you?

525
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,519
Is that how you see human lives?

526
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:44,039
That means I was right
to chase you out of our sect.

527
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,839
You had no place in the Carefree Sect!

528
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:48,279
You had no place
in the martial arts world!

529
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,799
You are my hostage.

530
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,839
How dare you spat at me?

531
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,599
I could kill you for that.

532
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,839
We should have settled the score long ago.

533
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,079
Kill me if you want.

534
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:08,799
Do it.

535
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,079
I'll decide when to kill you!

536
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,960
I still need both of you alive.

537
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,119
I still

538
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:23,400
need what I came for.

539
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:32,279
Young lady, do you have a death wish?

540
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,359
Little Rock.

541
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,200
You're finally here.

542
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:31,640
Thirteen Doom.

543
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,640
You killed my mother

544
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,720
and sided with the Youqiao Group.

545
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:37,920
I must end you right here.

546
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,799
Let's see if you're
strong enough for that.

547
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,519
Be careful!

548
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,200
Do not let him fire his arrows!

549
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,319
If he does, you're doomed!

550
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:18,960
The Blood River Sword.

551
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:08,760
You've mastered
the Blood River Sword Skill.

552
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:11,199
What good does it do?

553
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,280
My arrows are ready.

554
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:15,440
I can take their lives right now.

555
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,519
You have three choices.

556
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:20,320
One,

557
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,960
take my life as I fire the arrows,

558
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,280
but the other two will die.

559
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:30,679
Two,

560
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:32,639
choose to save

561
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:35,280
either one of them.

562
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:55,320
Three,

563
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:57,800
hand over what I asked.

564
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,960
I'll let all of you go.

565
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:00,440
Old fool!

566
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,039
Don't make him choose.

567
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:03,039
This is between the two of us.

568
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:04,519
Come at me if you must!

569
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,199
Make the choice.

570
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:20,519
Die!

571
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,039
Master!

572
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:08,719
Master!

573
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:09,960
Master!

574
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:12,800
Master!

575
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:14,239
Master.

576
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:16,039
Master, I'm sorry.

577
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,840
I have failed you.

578
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,679
My boy.

579
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,239
Don't be sad.

580
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,719
This...

581
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,800
This isn't your fault.

582
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,320
This is...

583
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:40,400
Master.

584
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,039
This is the best I could ask for.

585
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:48,880
Master!

586
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:55,039
Your father

587
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,719
may rest in peace now.

588
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,760
I am relieved.

589
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:04,719
Both of you...

590
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,000
You must...

591
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,199
Live on.

592
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:16,360
Master!

593
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,480
Master!

594
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:21,400
Master!

595
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:25,039
Master!

596
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:27,519
Master!

597
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:31,880
Master!

598
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:51,519
Master!

599
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:55,840
Master!

600
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:00,280
Master!

601
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,719
Master!

602
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:08,039
Master!

603
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:27,272
(Here lies
the beloved Master: Recluse Tianyi)

604
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,440
Master.

605
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:39,800
I won't leave unless I defeat you.

606
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:41,960
But I learned everything from you.

607
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:43,519
There is no way I can beat you.

608
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:47,039
Nothing is impossible.

609
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,239
Give it a few years.

610
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:50,039
You must stand a chance against me.

611
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:51,400
A few years more?

612
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,199
Think about

613
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,519
the pepper soup from
the village three li from here.

614
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:59,519
The flour rolls and
sliced tofu skin for the stew.

615
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:01,039
Spicy and savory.

616
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,719
There's more!

617
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,840
Ten li from here is Yangquan.

618
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:09,039
A wine store there
brews one of the very fine wines.

619
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:11,639
A hundred li from here,

620
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,519
there is a big city.

621
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,760
There are gates after gates.

622
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,000
The street is seemingly endless.

623
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:22,000
You can have any food you want there.

624
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:24,480
I'll train as hard as I can.

625
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:25,480
After I beat you,

626
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,519
I'll visit those places myself!

627
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,039
That's more like it.

628
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:32,239
Master, you like pepper soup?

629
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,320
I had tried it a few times.

630
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:36,400
It's good.

631
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,840
When I get off the mountain,

632
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,920
I'll buy some for you.

633
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:42,280
Make sure you get the soup

634
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,480
from Madam Wang's shop ten li from here.

635
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:45,480
I'll travel 100 li

636
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:46,480
if I have to.

637
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:56,079
Just go.

638
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:57,800
Don't turn back.

639
00:40:58,639 --> 00:40:59,480
Master!

640
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,320
Keep your legs warm!

641
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:04,039
Listen to my advice.

642
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,760
Use the stove at night!
