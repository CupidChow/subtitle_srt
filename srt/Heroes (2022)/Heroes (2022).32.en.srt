I like the look in your eyes.

00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,680
It suits you.

35
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,359
Thanks to you, Chancellor.

36
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,439
Do you still remember

37
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,959
what you promised me in the dungeon?

38
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,599
I always kept my word

39
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,280
to my subordinates.

40
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:03,959
If I'm happy with you,

41
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:06,920
you can have anything you want.

00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,919
or taking over Fang Yingkan's place?

45
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,840
You can just tell me.

46
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,680
As a martial artist,
I don't know about officialdom.

47
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,319
It'll be hard

48
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,479
for me to take Marquis' position.

49
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,479
Now I've started working for you.

50
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,520
The martial arts world is yours now.

51
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,439
As for Six Half Hall
and the House of Sunset Drizzle,

52
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,639
it doesn't matter
whether I possess them.

53
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,319
What do you want then?

54
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:35,919
What can be more tempting than these?

55
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,599
I want

56
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,919
Lei Chun.

57
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,680
I've been in love
with Lei Chun for a long time.

58
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,439
I've wanted to have her as my wife.

59
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,319
Given the circumstances,

60
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,639
it has become an obsession.

61
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,120
Father, I'm afraid
that won't be appropriate.

62
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:07,960
How so?

63
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,599
I know you like Su Mengzhen.

64
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,400
But he killed your father.

65
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,199
You can never be with him anymore.

66
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,199
And I will help you
strengthen Six Half Hall.

67
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:19,280
Isn't this what you ever wanted?

68
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,039
Your ambition is more than that.

69
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,240
You want to climb up.

70
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,520
You said you didn't care
about the martial arts world.

71
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,840
Yet, you want to be
the most powerful person.

72
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,400
Even if Father gives you Six Half Hall,

73
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,439
they will not bow to you.

74
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,560
You can only be
its master if you marry me.

75
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,919
When that time comes,

76
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,560
the House of Sunset Drizzle

77
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,360
and the martial arts world
will be in your grasp.

78
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,879
Then not even Father
can threaten your position.

79
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,319
Isn't that so?

80
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,520
Stop arguing.

81
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,240
How about this?

82
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,520
I'll agree to this betrothal.

83
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,360
Thank you for granting
this marriage, Chancellor.

84
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,639
Father.

85
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,199
The truth is, I've been thinking.

86
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:04,520
You may be the Chief Elder
of the Six Half Hall.

87
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:07,000
But you're still a woman.

88
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,080
There are some things
you're not capable of.

89
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,159
If he becomes your husband,

90
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,199
he can do them for you.

91
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:18,720
It can put my mind at ease this way.

92
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,560
Besides,

93
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,000
I can see he's sincere toward you.

94
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,319
You can meet someone

95
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,160
who's devoted to you.

96
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,439
Many people dream of this.

97
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,600
You must be grateful.

98
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:36,480
Don't worry.

99
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,040
As long as you marry me,

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,800
the Six Half Hall will forever
belong to the Lei family.

101
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,960
(Live by Zhu's maxim)

102
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,100
(Live by Zhu's maxim)

103
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,040
Chancellor.

104
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,079
Chief Elder Lei Chun has

105
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,839
a point.

106
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,360
Bai Choufei is an ambitious man.

107
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,600
Now, he has the Six Half Hall.

108
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,600
What if he controls
the whole martial arts world?

109
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,000
Wouldn't that be...

110
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,519
People from the martial arts world

111
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,680
value friendships the most.

112
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,879
Bai Choufei

113
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,199
is deviant and ungrateful.

114
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,600
People won't support him.

115
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,680
He'll never reach

116
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,480
the day you just said.

117
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,879
Moreover,

118
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,040
he's someone with desires.

119
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:43,600
It's easy to manipulate
someone with desires.

120
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:46,319
So he must stay by my side

121
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,240
to obtain what he wants.

122
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:50,839
You see.

123
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,800
I've handed over Lei Chun to him today.

124
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,600
He's a smart person.

125
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,800
He'd understand.

126
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,000
- Chancellor, you're indeed wise.
- Chancellor, you're indeed wise.

127
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,519
Today is a good day.

128
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:16,480
When I arrived,

129
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,839
I noticed the scenery
at Plum Blossom Garden looked beautiful.

130
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,959
Do you want to take a walk with me?

131
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:55,879
Lei Chun.

132
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,839
I have loved you

133
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,680
since I first met you on the river.

134
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,319
There's no one else
in my heart since then.

135
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,560
I went to River Chu to save you.

136
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,639
I even dared
to face immense danger for you.

137
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,079
You should know

138
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,040
I'm not marrying you

139
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,920
because of Six Half Hall.

140
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,920
It's because I truly like you.

141
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,800
So what if you do?

142
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:23,279
In River Chu,

143
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,839
I made use of you at first.

144
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,279
So I owed you.

145
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,639
But then I went back and saved you.

146
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,279
We were already even then.

147
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,720
I hate being ordered around.

148
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,360
But you knew I don't love you,

149
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,959
and I can't go against Chancellor Cai.

150
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,040
Yet, you forced me to marry you.

151
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,600
You're despicable.

152
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,439
I'd use even more despicable means

153
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,480
to get what I want.

154
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,439
You can hate me.

155
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,040
I don't care

156
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,319
if more people hate me.

157
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,639
But as long as you hate me,

158
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,519
you can never draw a line between us.

159
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,439
I don't hate you.

160
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,120
I have

161
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,120
neither love

162
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,360
nor hatred for you.

163
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,480
I know you still like Su Mengzhen.

164
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,279
But Su Mengzhen is a useless person now!

165
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,519
He can't do anything to me!

166
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,639
Think clearly about your position.

167
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,440
Only I can be by your side.

168
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,360
I don't care whether
you want to marry me or not.

169
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,480
But you can only be mine.

170
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:49,039
This is freshly made.

171
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,360
The flatbread Wen Rou
makes is truly fragrant.

172
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,960
Come and eat.

173
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,000
Come.

174
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,799
Wen Rou has almost recovered.

175
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:02,159
It's time for you to prepare to leave.

176
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:06,440
You should go
while the snow isn't heavy yet.

177
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,519
The heavy snow will block
the mountain passage in a few days.

178
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,679
You wouldn't be able to leave then.

179
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,480
Master,

180
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,240
about Official Liu...

181
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,799
Everything is going smoothly
on Official Liu's side.

182
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:16,720
So don't worry.

183
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,639
Someone will escort him back too.

184
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,080
We have enough hands
at Baimao Stronghold.

185
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:25,519
If anything happens, we can handle it.

186
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,960
Master, it turns out
you're well prepared.

187
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,279
It feels like you're trying
to chase me away.

188
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
How I wish I could
make you stay a little longer.

189
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,879
But you're a wanted criminal now.

190
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,480
It's still too dangerous for you.

191
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,720
So you must leave.

192
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,200
Before I leave,

193
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,679
there's one thing I want to fulfill.

194
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,519
It's sticking to the pot. Add more oil.

195
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,320
Let me pour some more.

196
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,960
There's no temple here.

197
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,200
When the locals want to pray,

198
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:17,960
they'll come and pray here.

199
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,919
They say your dreams will come true
if you make a wish here.

200
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:23,360
Really?

201
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:24,799
I'm going to pray too.

202
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:37,840
What do you wish for?

203
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,960
I hope everyone will be safe and sound.

204
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,120
Wen Rou,

205
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,200
do you still remember

206
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,279
what we talked about at the sinkhole?

207
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,279
Of course, I do.

208
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,080
You said we'll go to different places

209
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,399
to gaze at every starry sky.

210
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,879
You said we can find
the North Star in every starry sky.

211
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,360
- You'll accompany me
- I'll accompany you

212
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,759
- under every starry sky.
- under every starry sky.

213
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:06,799
Wen Rou.

214
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,240
I was terrified

215
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,200
when you were unconscious.

216
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,639
I've never felt

217
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:18,000
this panic-stricken before.

218
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,840
That's why
I prayed to Heavens for your safety.

219
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,399
If you can survive this ordeal,

220
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:26,879
I'm willing to sacrifice
my hands, feet, heart,

221
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,360
and even my life

222
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,080
in exchange for your safety.

223
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,519
Now, you've survived.

224
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,519
I'm all yours now.

225
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,799
They say we need

226
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,600
to be well prepared

227
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,480
to confess and to propose.

228
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,399
But after going through everything,

229
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:54,919

00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:25,919
From the incident at River Chu,

263
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:27,240
you've been wanting
to take revenge on Su Mengzhen.

264
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,519
Now, you'll marry me

and sleep by my side.

266
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,279
Su Mengzhen will be heartbroken.

267
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,360
How pitiful.

268
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:44,440
You look like you have everything.

269
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,360
But the truth is,

270
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,960
you've lost everything long ago.

271
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,759
Even if I lost everything,

272
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,480
don't I still have you?

273
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:08,120
Come.

274
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:09,720
Have a drink.

275
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:18,240
Drink!

276
00:14:40,157 --> 00:14:45,160
(Memorial Tablets of the Lei family)

277
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:53,440
Father.

278
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,600
Mother.

279
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,440
I'm getting married.

280
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:02,080
I was forced

281
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,159
to marry him.

282
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,840
But if I don't,

283
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,720
Chancellor Cai

284
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,039
will uproot the Six Half Hall.

285
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,600
At this stage,

286
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,600
I have no one to depend on.

287
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:26,600
You still have me.

288
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,399
I tried to persuade
your father to leave before.

289
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,360
But he refused to listen.

290
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:38,000
Tonight,

291
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,759
I'm here to persuade you to leave too.

292
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:42,399
After you leave,

293
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:44,399
I'll bear all the difficulties

294
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,879
at the Hall.

295
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,399
Di,

296
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,320
I can't let you shoulder everything.

297
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:54,879
Chun,

298
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:58,360
the tug of war is between wild beasts.

299
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,840
You can negotiate with Chancellor Cai

300
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,679
and Bai Choufei too.

301
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,320
But there are no rules

302
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,039
in the world of beasts.

303
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,240
You're not a beast.

304
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,360
No matter how you pretend to be one,

305
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,799
you're not one.

306
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:14,799
You're different from them.

307
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,200
Chun, what are you doing?

308
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:24,360
Get up.

309
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:35,519
Di,

310
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,519
I've always understood

311
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,320
your intentions over the years.

312
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:42,919
Today,

313
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,440
I want to tell you something.

314
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:53,919
I want you

315
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,320
to leave Six Half Hall.

316
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,080
What did you say?

317
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,679
You treat me as your family.

318
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,559
So do I.

319
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,680
When Bai Choufei becomes
the Chief Elder of Six Half Hall,

320
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,079
you'll find it a great insult.

321
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:15,559
Perhaps,

322
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:17,039
you already had the intention
of killing Bai Choufei.

323
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,480
But if you kill him,

324
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,559
you're likely to die.

325
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,000
And Six Half Hall won't be safe anymore.

326
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,079
After Father passed away,

327
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,119
you told me

328
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,880
that we must exercise restraint
in whatever we do.

329
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,240
Now, you're unable to restrain yourself.

330
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,359
Now, I'm the Chief Elder.

331
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,519
Let me bear

332
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:47,319
the Six Half Hall's resentment.

333
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,319
I'll use it

334
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:53,559
to protect the Six Half Hall

335
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:55,799
and my family.

336
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,200
Feijing.

337
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,559
Go.

338
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:30,559
All right.

339
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:33,160
I'll go.

340
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,316
(Six Half Hall)

341
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,371
(Double Happiness)

342
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,112
(Double Happiness)

343
00:19:29,193 --> 00:19:31,418
(Double Happiness)

344
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:39,784
(Double Happiness)

345
00:19:40,332 --> 00:19:41,527
(Happiness)

346
00:19:47,691 --> 00:19:49,769
(Double Happiness)

347
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,280
(Double Happiness)

348
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:31,334
(Six Half Hall)

349
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,799
Where are you planning to go

350
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,519
after leaving the Six Half Hall?

351
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:49,720
To be honest,

352
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,200
I haven't given it a thought.

353
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:56,000
I used to disagree with you.

354
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,519
But I'm a little reluctant
to let you go now.

355
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,000
No matter where you go,

356
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,559
you'll always be the First Elder.

357
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,440
I've found out

358
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,079
what you asked me to look into.

359
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,319
Who did it?

360
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,559
It was Marquis Shentong, Fang Yingkan,

361
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,240
who attacked Miss Lei
and Miss Wen that night.

362
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,839
I heard Fang Yingkan

363
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,680
handpicked several soldiers
from Daliu Barracks a few days ago

364
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,960
and took them to the north.

365
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:26,839
Yes.

366
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:31,720
Now, I know where I should go now.

367
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:38,319
Sir,

368
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:40,559
your flatbread and pepper soup.

369
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,000
Enjoy your meal.

370
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,240
Are you only having flatbread,
First Elder?

371
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,920
The journey to the north is cold.

372
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:51,920
You should prepare better food

373
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,839
before you leave the Capital.

374
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:55,519
This flatbread

375
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:59,039
is the best thing in the world for me.

376
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:02,000
It was because
I ate a flatbread like this

377
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:05,039
that changed my life.

378
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,079
First Elder, you have my admiration

379
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:12,960
for doing this for the Lei family.

380
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,376
(Bianliang)

381
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,280
(Liquor)

382
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:12,005
(Double Happiness)

383
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,044
(Double Happiness)

384
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,519
The first combing,
may you be together for life.

385
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:30,160
The second combing,
may you be blessed with longevity.

386
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:33,599
The third combing,
may you be blessed with many children.

387
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:35,880
The fourth combing,
may you be blessed with good fortune.

388
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:38,920
May you meet
the right person when needed.

389
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:43,119
The fifth combing
brings academic success

390
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:47,200
and wealth to your offspring.

391
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,119
Miss Wen Rou is the most beautiful bride

392
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:51,519
I've ever seen.

393
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:52,519
She's indeed beautiful.

394
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,839
It's such a joyous occasion.

395
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,880
What's the matter?

396
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,039
I miss my father.

397
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:02,839
When I was at home,

398
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,359
he kept pushing me to get married.

399
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:05,559
But I refused.

400
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,480
Now I'm getting married.

401
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,240
Yet, he's not by my side.

402
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,468
(Double Happiness)

403
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:16,200
Wen Rou.

404
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,559
Master.

405
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,119
Let's go.

406
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,119
Why are you here?

407
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:26,400
Good.

408
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,200
Very good.

409
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,319
I have something to tell you.

410
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:33,759
Sit.

411
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,359
I raised Little Rock

412
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:47,799
and taught him martial arts.

413
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,440
I see

414
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,839
Little Rock as my son.

415
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:58,240
Now that you're getting married.

416
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,839
I'll treat you

417
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,759
as my daughter too.

418
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,000
This is what I have in mind.

419
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,680
Since your father is in Luoyang

420
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,640
and unable to send you off.

421
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,400
At this time,

422
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,119
let me send you off.

423
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,839
Take me as your father.

424
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:19,279
I don't know if you're willing.

425
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,240
I do.

426
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,759
Thank you, Master.

427
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:24,359
No need to thank me.

428
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,160
Good.

429
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,680
Very good.

430
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:34,920
The time has not arrived yet.

431
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,160
I'll talk to you then.

432
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,030
Do you want to know
what Little Rock was like as a child?

433
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,110
I do.

434
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,200
Have you seen
that monkey climbed up a tree?

435
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:47,750
Little Rock would chase

436
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,310
the monkeys all day long

437
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,310
all over the mountain.

438
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,070
The monkeys were so scared

439
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
that they'd run up the trees
whenever they saw him.

440
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,310
Are you nervous?

441
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,120
It's more nervous
than meeting His Majesty.

442
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,790
The bride

443
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,990
sets out.

444
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:23,680

You look beautiful.

452
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,640
You're only allowed
to see me from now on.

453
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:25,590
Xiaoshi,

454
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,990
you must treat my daughter well.

455
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:29,960
Understand?

456
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:32,720
Master, don't worry.

457
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,200
