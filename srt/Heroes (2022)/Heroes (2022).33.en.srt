I'm looking into your eyes.

36

There's a spark in your eyes,

37
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,039
just like the stars on top
of the vast plains.

38
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,360
And your curved brows,

39
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,080
they're just like
the black mountains from afar.

40

Your little nose

41
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,160
is just like a tiny crescent.

42
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,639
Your red lips

are just like the lush sunset.

a tiny crescent in the sky.

55
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,079
we will surely find that place.

Today is your wedding.

65
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,519
Why are you drinking alone?

66
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,480
The person I love doesn't love me.

67
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,079
I have her body, but not her heart.

68
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,000
What else can I do besides drinking?

69
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,879
Once a woman

70
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,000
falls in love with someone,

71
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,680
no one else

72
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,279
can compare with that individual,

no matter how excellent he is.

74
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's not that you're not good enough.

75
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,279
It's just that she
couldn't forget that person.

76
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,000
You cannot force a relationship.

77
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,519
I thought you only
have eyes for revenge?

78
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,800
You actually know something
about relationships?

79
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
I feel empty inside

80
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,360

84
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,240
No one can compare to him.

85
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,079

to taint each other again.

How many places
have you gone to in search of me?

94
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,080
Could it be

95
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,440
that you're afraid that
I might die silently?

96
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,360
What nonsense are you saying?

97
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,399
Can you say something
auspicious for once?

98
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,320
Only an old cat will go into hiding

99
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:26,360
before dying.

100
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,440
A person like me

101
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,120
will announce my death to the world.

102
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,279
You don't need to worry.

103
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,600
The hall is so cold.

104
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,120
What are you doing here?

105
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,200
You should return to your room.

106
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,080
The wedding of Bai Choufei and Lei Chun

107
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,360
must be lively, huh?

108
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,960
Why are you asking that all of a sudden?

109
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,080
In my imagination,

110
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,480
I would hold my wedding with Chun

111
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,200
in this very hall.

112
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:07,639
After the wedding ceremony,

113
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,240
I would bring her to the highest spot

114
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:12,919
and observe the stars and moon together.

115
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,399
How did their wedding go?

116
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:20,759
Tell me about it.

117
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,200
I wish to listen.

Chancellor Cai is marrying
his foster daughter off.

119
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,159
It was a grand ceremony.

120
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,480
Almost the entire Capital
has heard of it.

121
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,039
Plenty of people were vying
to present their gifts to them.

122
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:39,279
Belts made from jade,

123
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,360
silverware, and red silk products,
they have everything.

124
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,279
There was even a pair of Jade Ruyi
from the Eastern Han Dynasty.

125
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,039
The Vice Minister of Revenue

126
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:48,080
couldn't find it even though
he hired someone to locate it for him.

127
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,240
But now, Chancellor Cai

128
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:52,120
is offering it as dowry
for his foster daughter.

129
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,480
I heard that he can purchase
half of the entire Capital

130
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,879
with the value of dowries
he had prepared.

131
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:00,879
What about Bai Choufei?

132
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,759
What gifts did he present to Lei Chun?

133
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,399
It's nothing more
than the ordinary ten tokens of love,

134
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,879
like earrings, bangles,

135
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:11,120
rings, and perfumed sachet.

136
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,759
He's inferior to me.

137
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,519
Stop overthinking it.

138
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:27,600
You should return to your room.

139
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,159
I'm waiting for my guests.

140

when they are here.

142
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,200
We will meet Su Mengzhen soon.

143
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:13,960
Are you unhappy?

144
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,480
Do you think this is meaningful?

145
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:19,840
What do you mean?

146
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,279
I'm parentless.

147
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,960
Su Mengzhen is my sworn brother.

148
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,639
It's perfectly reasonable

149
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,279
to show my new wife to my brother

150
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,840
now that I'm getting married.

151
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:37,559
Later,

152
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,039
when we see Su Mengzhen,

153
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,679
you shall do the things

154
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,639
I ask you to.

155
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,480
What gives you the right?

156
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:47,600
Is it because I'm your wife?

157
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,240
Do you think I care about the title?

158
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:53,360
You may not care,

159
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,279
and I may not have the right to do so.

160
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,200
However, Su Mengzhen is terminally ill.

161
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:00,840
If you don't listen to me,

162
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,200
I might kill him on the spot.

163
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,759
Do you think

164
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,720
I still care about him?

165
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,759
Fine then.

166
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,840
I'll see if you still care about him

167
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:17,080
when I kill him

168
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:18,960
later.

00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:11,841
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

171
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,519
You traitor.

172
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,159
How dare you come back?

173
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,840
I'm the Vice House Master here.

174
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,960
Why can't I come back?

175
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,639
By the way,

176
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,399
I'm already the House Master.

177
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:31,240
You guys agreed with me

178
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,000
when I removed

179
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,159
Su Mengzhen from his post.

180
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,039
So,

181
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,600
are you guys going to treat
your House Master with disrespect?

182
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,240
My foot!

183
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:41,360
Do you think a despicable scum like you

184
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,879
can be our House Master?

185
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,320
I won't let you enter,

186
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:47,039
(House of Sunset Drizzle)
as long as I'm around!

187
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,360
You are the only Keeper alive.

188
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:52,960
Are you in a hurry
to join the rest in the underworld?

189
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,240
Try me then!

190
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:54,636
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

191
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:55,200
Stop!

192
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:03,759
Advisor.

193
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,399
Long time no see.

194
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,559
Let them in.

195
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,960
Advisor, are you sure about that?

196
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,159
They're weak in numbers.

197
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:12,360
We still have many
elite warriors in the House.

198
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,080
We can take him down
if we join hands now!

199
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,639
I will avenge my brothers today!

200
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:16,240
How dare you!

201
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,320
This is the wish of the House Master.

202
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,840
Pardon us for the rudeness.

203
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:24,840
Mr. Su is waiting for you

204
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,440
inside the hall.

205
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:29,279
Please.

206
00:15:40,137 --> 00:15:43,949
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

207
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:16,240
Mengzhen, I knew you couldn't

208
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,120
attend our wedding
because you're sick.

209
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,519
However, as your younger brother,

210
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I need to show you my respect.

211
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:24,200
I've brought your sister-in-law here

212
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,080
to greet you.

213
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,440
Come, serve the tea.

214
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:34,080
Mengzhen, you treat me
like one of your own.

215
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:36,279
The eldest brother always
acts as the surrogate father.

216
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,159
So you

217
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,480
should serve Mengzhen the tea.

218
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,759
This is the most basic courtesy.

219
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:48,080
We mustn't go against it.

220
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,720
Here's your tea, Mengzhen.

221
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:46,279
Come.

222
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,200
Mengzhen, this is the present
I prepared for you.

223
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,640
Chun,

224
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,960
you have to tell him
who chose the present for him.

225
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,759
Mengzhen,

226
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,799
both of us

227
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,119
chose this present for you.

228
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:37,599
Do you like it?

229
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,680
I like it very much.

230
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,799
It's not because of its unique texture.

231
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:45,440
It's because it's round and complete.

232
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,039
I will accept this present.

233
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:56,039
I like it very much.

234
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,039
Thank you.

235
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:58,079
I'm glad that you like it.

236
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,079
I've fulfilled my duties.

237
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,559
You may speak

238
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,559
to your brother.

239
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:12,079
I will wait for you outside.

240
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,279
I've finished your tea.

241
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:38,920
I've already

242
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:40,960
accepted your present too.

243
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:44,440
Since you've fulfilled
your filial duties,

244
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,680
I believe that you
respect me as your elder.

245
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:51,079
As your elder brother,
I have several pieces of advice.

246
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:54,640
Tell me then.

247
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,160
There are no hurdles
we cannot pass in life.

248
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:00,319
The only thing trapping yourself

249
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:02,160
is your heart.

250
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,680
You're the only one
who can break free from it.

251
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,039
Actually, you can realize that
once you take a step back.

252
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:13,559
And.

253
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:17,279
You got yourself a virtuous wife.

254
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,160
You're the head of a family now.

255
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,480
You're no longer a wanderer.

256
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,960
You need to solve

257
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,400
your own issues.

258
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,319
Do not drag other people into it.

259
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,440
I'm speaking to you.

260
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,839
Did you hear me?

261
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,759
I did.

262
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:37,839
That's not enough.

263
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,519
You need to remember my words too.

264
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:42,559
I will remember them.

265
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:45,799
Now that I got myself a virtuous wife,

266
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,960
I will surely treat her well.

267
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:04,581
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

268
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,180
I thought you're concerned about me.

269
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,490
So you're only afraid
that I might kill Su Mengzhen?

270
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,490
Don't worry.

271
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:37,860
It's not time yet.

272
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:40,730
Depart.

273
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,340
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

274
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,250
House Master!

275
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:14,700
House Master!

276
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,530
We don't have any good news lately.

277
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,620
Taking advantage
of Youqiao Group's backing,

278
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,530
Bai Choufei raised
a group of suicide warriors.

279
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:42,730
They're known as

280
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,010
Case 108.

281
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,210
Many of our hidden branches

282
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,380
were found

283
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:50,700
and destroyed.

284
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,530
It's more than that.

285
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,380
When our men try to fight back,

286
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,140
the officers from the Ministry
of Justice would imprison them.

287
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,250
He and Chancellor Cai

288
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,450
are trying to hoodwink the public!

289
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,970
Advisor, we have to think of something.

290
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,770
The more terrible the situation is,

291
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,380
the more I'm worried about Mr. Su.

292
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,730
I'm also worried that
Bai Choufei might attack Mr. Su.

293
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,450
How dare he!

294
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,730
I would've killed him if you guys

295
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:15,700
hadn't stopped me today!

296
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,340
Do you think I don't wish to kill him?

297
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,140
Sir?

298
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:31,340
Sir.

299
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,660
It's late now.

300
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,050
What are you doing here?

301
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,730
It's been tough on you guys
for the past few weeks.

302
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,340
Bai Choufei

303
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,450
is no longer my brother.

304
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,860
Now, he only has eyes for himself.

305
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,940
He won't share his powers
with someone else.

306
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,010
He wasn't satisfied with being

307
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,180
the Vice House Master when he was here.

308
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,700
Now,

309
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,420
he can no longer tolerate my presence.

310
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:02,970
He came this morning

311
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,770
to look for a chance to strike.

312
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,180
I will surely kill him

313
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,970
if he dares to show himself again!

314
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,010
Even if I can't kill him,

315
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:12,810
I will protect you.

316
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,700
I won't let him hurt you.

317
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,530
Wukui, I've told you before.

318
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:26,970
Although you guys are my subordinates,

319
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,180
you guys are also my friends.

320
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,290
You guys are not my suicide warriors.

321
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,580
Do not die for me.

322
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,490
I want you all to live for me.

323
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,730
Bai is an impatient person.

324
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,620
Now, all we need to do is to wait.

325
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,580
We'll wait for the turning point,

326
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:01,490
and for someone to come.

327
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,450
Waiting for someone to come?

328
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,620
Who do you mean?

329
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,100
(Wang Xiaoshi is still alive)

330
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,420
-Wang Xiaoshi?
-Wang Xiaoshi?

331
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,530
Is Wang Xiaoshi still alive?

332
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,340
(Wang Xiaoshi is still alive)

333
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,140
He's still alive!

334
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,290
Groom,

335
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,380
Recluse Tianyi told you
to leave with your wife

336
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,700
immediately after the wedding.

337
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,660
But you've been dragging it out.

338
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,140
And now, you're following me

339
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,250
to send supplies to the sentry posts.

340
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:37,940
Are you not planning to leave?

341
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,420
I'm already married.

342
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,810
I don't need to listen
to my Master all the time now.

343
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:41,290
What?

344
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,180
I know my Master is worried about me.

345
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:46,140
But I think I will depart

346
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,810
after Official Liu arrives here safely.

347
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,490
At least I can help him out

348
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:50,730
if there's any danger.

349
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,380
You're pretty sensible.

350
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:54,660
Don't tell my Master about it.

351
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:55,700
I'll stay for a few more days.

352
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:56,970
Don't worry.

353
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,210
I'm happier when you aren't leaving.

354
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,010
Brothers, time to eat!

355
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:05,900
Why is there no response?

356
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:07,810
They must be starving.

357
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:09,490
Front Tooth, time to eat.

358
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:11,580
Front Tooth?

359
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:18,490
Front Tooth!

360
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,730
Buddy!

361
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:29,860
Buddy!

362
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,290
Who did this?

363
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,810
Who did this?

364
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,290
Which scum did it?

365
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,210
It's Thirteen Doom.

366
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:38,810
Who's Thirteen Doom?

367
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,380
He's extremely skilled at martial arts.

368
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,340
He's my Martial Uncle.

369
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,100
I don't care who he is!

370
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,140
I'm going to kill him
and avenge my brothers!

371
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,140
Thirteen Doom!

372
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,450
Big Beard!

373
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,050
Calm down and listen to me.

374
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,490
Thirteen Doom isn't the only one here.

375
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:51,660
Look at the ground.

376
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,180
It's full of horse tracks.

377
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,250
I'm sure there were
plenty of enemy pursuers!

378
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:56,450
You have to hurry
and contact the other sentry posts.

379
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,860
Tell Official Liu to stay alert.

380
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,290
I'll return to Baimao Stronghold
and notify my Master.

381
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:00,380
Do you hear me?

382
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,450
Just go!

383
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:04,180
Okay!

384
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:43,770
How many villages are there nearby?

385
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,810
Marquis, there are only 13 villages

386
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,180
within a 300-li radius.

387
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:49,940
Miaogao Village, Kunlu Mountain,

388
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:51,180
and Napo Village,

389
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,380
we've searched
11 of them on our way here.

390
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:54,490
There are only two villages left.

391
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,380
I'm sure Liu Anshi is an old fox

392
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,210
since he can survive
in the imperial court for so long.

393
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,380
Search the last two villages.

394
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,210
If you still can't find him,

395
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:04,210
get some men

396
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:05,530
to impersonate the Liao people

397
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,140
and search for him across the borders.

398
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:07,580
Yes, Sir.

399
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:32,490
Mr. Thirteen, I knew it was your doing

400
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,770
when I saw the arrow.

401
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,490
Is Father still worried about me

402
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,660
even though he has given me
his pass and soldiers?

403
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,050
Mr. Thirteen, did he
send you here to follow me?

404
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,490
Liu Anshi has the assistance
of martial artists.

405
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,860
My martial brother,
Xu Xiaoyi, is assisting him.

406
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:53,450
Although there are no villages
within a 50-li radius,

407
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,050
there are sentry posts.

408
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,900
It was his arrangement.

409
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,810
Their base is in Baimao Stronghold.

410
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,900
I'll leave the credit for you to claim.

411
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:07,050
However, you need
to keep Xu Xiaoyi for me.

412
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,180
This is rare indeed.

413
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:13,250
Mr. Thirteen, you're actually
not hindering me this time.

414
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,340
Let me thank you in advance then.

415
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,660
According to the Chancellor,

416
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,210
since I'm already here,

417
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,210
if you have the pass with you,

418
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,450
you should hand it over

419
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:26,140
and let me

420
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,860
return it to him.

421
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:35,530
Marquis, you should hurry up.

422
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:36,700
Yes, Sir.

423
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,530
Let's head to Baimao Stronghold.

424
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:40,290
Yes, Sir.

425
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:28,290
Show me the map.

426
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,660
We're 40 li away from Baimao Stronghold.

427
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,140
We need about four hours to reach there.

428
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:49,140
Marquis, just now,
Thirteen Doom was...

429
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:50,380
You don't need to worry.

430
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,700
I was already used

431
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,100
to his insults long ago.

432
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:58,250
If not, I wouldn't be able
to survive until now.

433
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,660
However, one day,

434
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,380
I will settle my scores with him.

435
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,340
Yes, Sir. I was worried for nothing.

436
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,730
- Please pardon me.
- It's fine.

437
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,210
Marquis,

438
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,180
speaking of which,

439
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,580
how could evidence of the Chancellor's
crime exist in this place?

440
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,420
20 years ago,

441
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,250
the Liao army invaded the border area.

442
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,340
The places we'd been through

443
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:31,180
were all taken over by the Liao people.

444
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,380
Even so, the imperial court
wasn't willing to dispatch any troops.

445
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,770
Back then, a renowned martial artist

446
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,250
formed a volunteer army,
fought against the Liao people,

447
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:39,860
and quelled the chaos in the area.

448
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,580
They pushed back the Liao Army.

449
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,940
After that, the imperial army
took their time

450
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,900
to sway their way here.

451
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,660
However, the order they received

452
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,940
was to kill the group of
martial artists.

453
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:57,050
Chancellor was the one
who gave the order.

454
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,140
So, it's the military order?

455
00:31:59,250 --> 00:31:59,860
That's right.

456
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,810
The military order itself
is the proof of his crime.

457
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:06,290
Only few people know about this.

458
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,530
If the imperial court hears about this

459
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,700
and receives the military order,

460
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:14,210
Chancellor will be in danger.

461
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:15,380
However,

462
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,290
it's been so many years.

463
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,450
I don't think
the military order is still intact.

464
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,290
It's hard to say.

465
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,490
Back then, the soldiers
who received the order

466
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,940
might have hidden it away

467
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,290
as they were afraid
their dirty deeds would be exposed.

468
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,530
However, it isn't that easy

469
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,050
for ordinary people

470
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,420
to locate the military order.

471
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,340
However, if Liu Anshi
does get his hands on it,

472
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,730
we might be able to find it for real.

473
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,770
If we can capture Liu Anshi,

474
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,490
and, if he does have the military order,

475
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,940
Marquis, what do you plan to do?

476
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,140
What do I plan to do?

477
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,420
You saw

478
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,010
Thirteen Doom's arrogant demeanor
for yourself just now.

479
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:01,050
Can't you tell what I'm going to do?

480
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:03,940
Understood.

481
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,420
Where is Official Liu?

482
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:50,730
We just received news this morning

483
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,180
that Official Liu is on his way here.

484
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,490
He'll reach Baimao Stronghold

485
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,490
in one or two days
if the weather isn't harsh.

486
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:56,940
He's coming back?

487
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,620
You look so flustered.

488
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,940
What exactly happened?

489
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,530
Someone assaulted
one of our sentry posts.

490
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,100
Everyone there was killed.

491
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,660
How about Li San and Hammer?

492
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:06,980
I don't know.

493
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,370
They left immediately

494
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:09,370
after they delivered the news to us.

495
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,730
How dare they!

496
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,020
Ask your men to hide.

497
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,020
Do not let them engage the enemies.

498
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:16,810
All right.

499
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,100
I need to notify
Recluse Tianyi about this.

500
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,930
I hope he and Little Rock
can deal with this situation.

501
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,580
Your knees will give up on you

502
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,460
if you keep on kneeling.

503
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:35,580
I've heard about
such punishments before.

504
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,620
When they stand up
after kneeling on the icy floor,

505
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,500
the skin on their knees
will stick to the floor.

506
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:45,330
That liquor stall is your sentry post.

507
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,850
If I go forward,

508
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,730
I'll reach your base, Baimao Stronghold.

509
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:53,620
You see.

510
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:56,580
I do not like violence.

511
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:58,850
I can release you all

512
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,580
as long as you tell me the truth.

513
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:08,770
Release him.

514
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:24,540
Leave!

515
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,140
Hurry!

516
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,370
That's the wrong direction.

517
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,290
You should head to the lake.

518
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:37,980
I'll let you live

519
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,460
if you can cross it.

520
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,290
Are you leaving or not?

521
00:36:58,810 --> 00:36:59,330
San.

522
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:34,930
Next!

523
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,020
You'll let us live

524
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:40,770
if we can cross the lake?

525
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,100
Of course.

526
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,210
I'm a man of my words.

527
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,210
Untie me.

528
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:05,890
Big Beard?

529
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,100
Big Beard!

530
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,770
Seems like your buddies

531
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,810
were pretty unfortunate.

532
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:03,810
Now,

533
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,140
it all depends on your action.

534
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:08,140
I'll tell you!

535
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,140
I'll tell you everything!

536
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:12,850
I'll tell you everything!

537
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:25,100
Tell me everything then.

538
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:30,410
Official Liu has crossed the border pass

539
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:32,290
and returned to
the country two days ago.

540
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:33,810
He'll reach
Baimao Stronghold by tomorrow!

541
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,730
How could I be sure

542
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,770
that you weren't lying to me?

543
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,250
I'm the messenger!

544
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,890
Official Liu sent me
a messenger pigeon before he departed!

545
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,370
I have the letter with me!

546
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,100
I'm serious!

547
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,500
It's inside my clothing!

548
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:56,850
That's right.

549
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:02,930
This is it.

550
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:05,500
I didn't lie to you.

551
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:09,620
All right.

552
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,330
Since you've helped me out,

553
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,100
I will consider you my friend.

554
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,100
I won't kill you.

555
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,370
Thank you, Sir!

556
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,060
Thank you, Sir!

557
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,100
We're friends now.

558
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,210
Cross the lake.

559
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,020
Sir,

560
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,660
I thought you said you wouldn't kill me?

561
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:28,460
I said I wouldn't kill you.

562
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,370
I didn't say Heaven wouldn't.

563
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,250
You go against your promise!

564
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:34,890
You go against your promise!

565
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,620
You're a crook!

566
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,180
Heaven and Earth will hunt you down!

567
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:46,890
Marquis,

568
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,890
should we continue
heading northward? Or...

569
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,500
We will continue heading northward

570
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,370
and apprehend Liu Anshi.

571
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,460
Thirteen Doom

572
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,620
wants to kill someone
from Baimao Stronghold, right?

573
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:04,020
We should let him enjoy himself then.

574
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:05,500
Yes, Sir.
