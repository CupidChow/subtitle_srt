Wait.

33
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,820
I didn't expect

34
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,540
to see you again.

35
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,980
Are you leaving the Capital?

36
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,020
I'm a defeated man.

37
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:46,980
There's no place

38
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,820
for me in the Capital anymore.

39
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,060
So it's time for me to leave.

40
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,820
Don't feel bad about it.

41
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,900
I know

42
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,420
you delivered the box.

43
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,540
But my defeat

44
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,380
has nothing to do with you.

45
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,500
We fought during the day

46
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,260
because we had different stands.

47
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,460
You're right about that.

48
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,980
I'm not familiar with you anyway.

49
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,380
Since we run into each other,

50
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,580
let me send you off.

51
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,620
It's all right.

52
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,620
I'm leaving the city late at night

53
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,780
because I want peace and quietness.

54
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,420
Farewell.

55
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,700
Jiansan?

56
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,220
There's a price to life and death.

57
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,740
All scores must be settled.

58
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,540
I'm also on the list.

59
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,020
I was only listed
several years later than you.

60
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,020
Chief Elder only let me do one thing.

61
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,020
Help you to do the dirty work.

62
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,620
Help you

63
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,660
rise in position.

64
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,420
But...

65
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,300
But you're useless.

66
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,540
A good-for-nothing.

67
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,260
I...

68
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,500
If they had put their hopes on me,

69
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,820
none of these would happen today.

70
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,060
It's time to return
the slap you gave me.

71
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,780
It's

72
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,620
you again?

73
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,060
We shouldn't go after enemies
who are already helpless.

74
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,780
Mengzhen had let him go.

75
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,300
How can you be so ruthless?

76
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,420
After meddling in
the House of Sunset Drizzle's affairs,

77
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,100
you're now meddling
in Six Half Hall's business, huh?

78
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,820
Are you seeking death?

79
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,220
You can try.

80
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,100
Senior.

81
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,420
Come.

82
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,420
I thought

83
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,340
the Capital was

84
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,140
a land of heroes.

85
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,460
I only realize

86
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,340
that it's also
a field of life and death.

87
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,060
I guess

88
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,060
it's better to live freely.

89
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,140
You shouldn't have come to the Capital.

90
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,620
You shouldn't have...

91
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,500
Karma...

92
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,380
Karma...

93
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,380
You shouldn't...

94
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,060
He looks like
the old House Master, right?

95
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,420
Yes.

96
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,260
Sir.

97
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,100
I sit here

98
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,580
to watch the morning glow
he used to enjoy.

99
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,380
House Master,

100
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,980
I'm here to bid you farewell.

101
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,860
I'll leave after the old House Master's
funeral ceremony

102
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,780
is over.

103
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,380
All right.

104
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,340
Where do you plan to go

105
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,340
after leaving the House?

106
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,660
The martial arts world is vast.

107
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,060
I'll eventually find a land of peace.

108
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,540
Go to Yingzhou.

109
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,540
I have a residence by the Longtan Lake.

110
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,140
A pinewood structure

111
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,300
with white cotton paper windows.

112
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,340
When you open the window and look out,

113
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,020
you'll see a lake as far as the horizon.

114
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:23,740
Rest assured.

115
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,620
I bought it
with Father's private savings.

116
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,500
No one will say anything about it.

117
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,220
I'm indebted to you, House Master.

118
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,860
Thank you for taking care of him

119
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,860
while I was away all these years.

120
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:01,780
Sir,

121
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,740
why didn't you persuade her to stay?

122
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,540
You gave her a residence

123
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,020
and kept thanking each other.

124
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,900
I find it a little...

125
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,300
I only realize today

126
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,900
that the House of Sunset Drizzle

127
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,500
gives excellent treatment

128
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,780
to our old subordinates who left.

129
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,260
We treat them so well.

130
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,780
Do you know

131
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,500
what caused

132
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,620
my illness?

133
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,140
When the Su family fought against Liao,

134
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,300
the experts of Liao
went after their lives.

135
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,900
Your martial uncle was grateful
to the old House Master

136
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,420
for helping Hanshan Sect in the past.

137
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,540
So he lent a hand.

138
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,100
He rescued you
and broke through the enemy's siege.

139
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,740
In the end,

140
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,740
he died in the hands
of Liao's Greatest Expert,

141
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,380
the world's sixth martial artist.

142
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,540
Master Shiwu.

143
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,060
My physique is caused by

144
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,780
this palm strike.

145
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,060
But if martial uncle didn't take
that blow for me,

146
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,620
you'd have no chance of feeding me
with medicinal concoction every day.

147
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:00,660
Yingzhou

148
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,780
is Master Shiwu's burial place

149
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,780
and it's also resting place of Lianxin's father.

150
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,180
After Master Shiwu died,

151
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,940
my father brought Lianxin here.

152
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,420
She has devoted herself all these years.

153
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,380
It was no longer gratitude between us.

154
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,340
It's family.

155
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,540
Where did they go?

156
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,660
Rouge! Powder!

157
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,780
Rouge! Powder for sale!
Come and take a look!

158
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,420
You scared me!

159
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,780
I've looked everywhere for you.

160
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,500
What's this?

161
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,300
So? Do you like it?

162
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,540
That'll teach you a lesson
for wandering off.

163
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,620
You're not even familiar
with this place.

164
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,500
You better watch out for kidnappers!

165
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,300
Give it to me.

166
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,540
What?

167
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,340
Money.

168
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,500
Consider it a gift for us.

169
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,900
Fine. Here you go.

170
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,020
Come and take a look
at the new designs!

171
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,300
Mister,

172
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,340
here's the payment.

173
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,220
Oh, no. I can't accept this.

174
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,660
These are just some playthings.

175
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,580
If you like them,

176
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,540
you can just take them.

177
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,380
I can't do that.

178
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,340
You're running a business here.

179
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,420
You must accept this money.

180
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,420
Please come again.

181
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,100
Let's go.

182
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,500
Are you close with that stall owner?

183
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,380
Judging from
the owner's respectful manners,

184
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,540
we'll know how often

185
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,660
Miss Wen bullies them.

186
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,740
I never do that.

187
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,660
That will be you.

188
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,540
This street is under
the House of Sunset Drizzle's control.

189
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:35,940
So

190
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,860
the House takes really good care
of the people here.

191
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,460
It's not strange that they know me.

192
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,300
The House takes care of this street?

193
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,820
Not only this street.

194
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,020
It's the whole region.

195
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,900
It looks like it's a huge organization.

196
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,860
It's the same with Six Half Hall too.

197
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,180
Their territories are all over
the Capital.

198
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,940
The areas in Old Caomen Street

199
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,340
are Six Half Hall's territories.

200
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,620
Our people aren't allowed to enter.

201
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,980
The Capital has two divided powers.

202
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,460
I didn't expect
the territories would be divided too.

203
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,500
That's not all.

204
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,300
The House of Sunset Drizzle is led
by benevolence and righteousness.

205
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,580
It has power and protects the people.

206
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,180
But Six Half Hall is led by profits.

207
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,020
It's a huge organization too.

208
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,140
Many people join them too.

209
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,620
Make way! Make way!

210
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:19,820
Make way!

211
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,380
Make way!

212
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,900
Eat this flatbread.

213
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:24,740
Eat it.

214
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,420
Get out of the way!

215
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,260
Madam, are you all right?

216
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:35,980
I'm all right.

217
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:36,940
Madam.

218
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,460
Are you all right?

219
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,020
Madam, here.

220
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,580
I'm all right.

221
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,300
Madam, are you hurt?

222
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:42,980
I'm fine.

223
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,500
Madam,

224
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,380
why don't you sell
the dirty flatbreads to me?

225
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,120
(Madam Cha Hua)

226
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,820
You have such a kind heart.

227
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,300
Since the flatbreads are dirty,

228
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,780
why would you want to buy them?

229
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,100
They don't worth that much anyway.

230
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,980
I can go back and bake again.

231
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,340
Thank you for your help.

232
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,100
Thank you.

233
00:13:59,540 --> 00:13:59,900
It's nothing.

234
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,220
Cabbage, where are you going?

235
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,420
I'm going to ask for compensation
for the flatbreads.

236
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,460
It's Six Half Hall's territory ahead.

237
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,540
We can't go there.

238
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,140
Come and take a look!

239
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,540
Sales! Sales!

240
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,820
Delicious wonton!

241
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,420
Fresh from the pot!

242
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,700
First Elder Di.

243
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:31,700
I'm Mo Yan.

244
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,380
(Mo Yan, River Cutting Sword)
I've long heard of your prestige.

245
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,340
(Mo Yan, River Cutting Sword)

246
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,140
(Mo Yan, River Cutting Sword)
So I'm here to pay you my respect.

247
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,540
The sunlight hurts my eyes.

248
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,340
I'm Mo Yan.

249
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,820
I'm here to pay my respect
to you, First Elder Di.

250
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,860
You're not from the Capital?

251
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,300
I used to make a living on the water.

252
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,540
From Xiliu to Kushuipu Dock,

253
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,380
this region is under my territory.

254
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,780
You're not an average manager, then.

255
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,540
Those from afar are guests.

256
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,220
Since you're here to talk business,
we'll talk at the Hall.

257
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,380
I'm used to traveling alone.

258
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:04,980
So I have no carriage.

259
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,420
I shall take a ride
on your carriage, then.

260
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,700
I'm truly flattered by your words.

261
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:11,860
Elder Di,

262
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,060
this way, please.

263
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,140
To be honest with you,

264
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,100
those making a living on the water
have short lives.

265
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,420
The reason why I came to the Capital

266
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,060
was to find a place

267
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,900
for my men to settle down.

268
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,020
It's hard to make a living on water.

269
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,860
As long as we're under your care,

270
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,260
it won't be hard anymore.

271
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,420
We're aware
of Six Half Hall's regulations.

272
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,540
We've set aside 35 percent
of our income over the years.

273
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:36,820
The carriage behind us

274
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,980
carries a gift.

275
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,340
It's prepared especially for you.

276
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,540
Oh?

277
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,420
We rescued an injured person

278
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,100
from the river.

279
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,140
It wasn't easy to save his life.

280
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,700
He claimed he was part
of the Six Half Hall

281
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,300
and called himself Zhe Tianchou.

282
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,940
He said he knew a huge secret
of the Six Half Hall.

283
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,780
He insisted that I send him

284
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,780
to the Chief Elder.

285
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,700
But I know the rules.

286
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,780
Before sending him to the Chief Elder,

287
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,020
I must let him see you first.

288
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,420
Thank you, Mr. Mo.

289
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,380
To be honest,

290
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,060
you didn't find me.

291
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,540
I was the one who found you.

292
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,780
I know Zhe Tianchou is in your hands.

293
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,740
I wrote the letter recommendation

294
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,700
for you to see me myself.

295
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,900
Zhe Tianchou is a traitor
of Six Half Hall.

296
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,780
He almost put our Young Lady's life
in danger at the river.

297
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,220
Yet, you thought you found a gem.

298
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,460
First Elder Di.

299
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,700
I'll just walk the rest of the way.

300
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,140
Thank you for the ride, Mr. Mo.

301
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,580
First Elder, have mercy on me!

302
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,660
First Elder, please!

303
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,660
Please spare me, First Elder.

304
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,220
First Elder, spare my life!

305
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:52,900
First Elder.

306
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,420
First Elder,

307
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,220
I was only following orders.

308
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,580
Why must I die?

309
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,860
Whose order do you obey?

310
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,860
I sent you to Young Lady

311
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,220
to let you obey her orders.

312
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,700
Since you come back alive,

313
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,260
you'll have to obey when you see me.

314
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,340
We'll take good care

315
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,260
of your family.

316
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:17,940
You can go in peace.

317
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,140
Thank you, First Elder.

318
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,700
Let's get out of here.

319
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,020
Today,

320
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,180
I'm going to take you
to a restaurant in the Capital.

321
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,740
They have foods
you've never eaten before.

322
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:51,660
(Protect the People)

323
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,140
Really?

324
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,140
- Where is it?
- Over there.

325
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:53,660
It's over there.

326
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:56,860
You can go ahead.

327
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:57,900
Where are you going?

328
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,900
I need to buy something.
I'll meet you there later.

329
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,700
Come back quickly.

330
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,940
Come on. Is it really delicious?

331
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,540
This is the restaurant I talked about.

332
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,020
Let's go in.

333
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,460
(Guizhen restaurant)

334
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,580
Mister, do you want to buy anything?

335
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,940
I sell pretty much different things.

336
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,620
Have you chosen anything you like?

337
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,100
I know you're not a vendor.

338
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,420
You're operating a gambling stall.

339
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,820
You're very observant.

340
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,820
You're not
a government official, right?

341
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,260
If I were from the government,

342
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,420
I wouldn't waste time talking to you.

343
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,180
The government bans gambling.

344
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,980
So we could only operate in secret.

345
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,820
But this game doesn't hurt anyone.

346
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,340
It's only for leisure.

347
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,780
Both adults and children can play too.

348
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,220
Do you want to play one round?

349
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,860
Mister,

350
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,380
this is a huge amount.

351
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,220
But everything

352
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,460
at my stall combined

353
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,940
doesn't worth as much as this.

354
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,860
Why don't you pick one item?

355
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,460
I'm not here to make a bet with you.

356
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,380
I want to make a bet with fate.

357
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,980
The money is yours,
no matter who wins or loses.

358
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,300
This is a great deal.

359
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,660
I'm thankful
for being blessed with fortune.

360
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,700
Thank you very much.

361
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,860
The head shows a word.

362
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,220
The tail shows "Chun".

363
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,460
If you get seven Chun,
you'll hit the jackpot.

364
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:30,980
But Mister,

365
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,460
what is it that you want to bet

366
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,900
with fate?

367
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,540
It's my first time here.
So I want to know my fortune.

368
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,580
I want to see what journey

369
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,980
heaven has in store for me.

370
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:42,980
That's easy, then.

371
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,340
"The Emperor Star walks ahead.
The Capital is with him.

372
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,420
The divine army creates a path
to win a victory."

373
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,460
You can start now.

374
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,680
Cabbage!

375
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,540
(Guizhen Restaurant)
Run!

376
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,180
Run!

377
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,940
Don't just stand there! Run!

378
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,060
- Come on!
- Stop right there!

379
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:05,380
After them!

380
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:05,980
Stop right there!

381
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,300
- Stop right there!
- Make way!

382
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,420
- After him!
- Stop running!

383
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,220
- Run faster!
- Stop!

384
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:10,860
Stop right there!

385
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,580
Don't run!

386
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,620
Bai, she caused trouble again!

387
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,780
- Stop right there!
- Run!

388
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,460
Faster! Run faster!

389
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,380
We don't have to run.

390
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,460
We can just fight them.

391
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,100
Stop right there!

392
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:17,780
They don't know martial arts!

393
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,140
We can't pick on them!

394
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,180
- After them!
- Run!

395
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,700
Stop running!

396
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,140
Stop!

397
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,940
- I dare you to stop running!
- Stop right there!

398
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,780
They're in front! After them!

399
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,220
- Stop!
- Faster!

400
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:30,860
Over there!

401
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,340
Split up!

402
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,180
They're over there! After them!

403
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:34,540
Over there!

404
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,140
Hurry!

405
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,700
- We'll split up!
- Over there!

406
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,220
After them!

407
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:37,900
Over there!

408
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,860
Stop right there!

409
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:43,940
Stop!

410
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,060
After him!

411
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,580
Don't run!

412
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,300
Stop right there!

413
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:49,860
Make way!

414
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,580
- Stop!
- After him!

415
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:52,860
All of you stop right there!

416
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,660
Stop coming after me.

417
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,820
I'll retaliate if you keep this on!

418
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,540
After him!

419
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,380
Oh, come on!

420
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,820
- Stop right there!
- Stop running!

421
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,340
Hold it right there!

422
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,900
I don't want to fight back!

423
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,820
- Stop!
- Stop right there!

424
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:06,700
Stop running.

425
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,460
Stop running already!

426
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,220
- Stop!
- Don't run!

427
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,540
Hey, stop right there!

428
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,580
Stop!

429
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,340
Stop!

430
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,660
Stop!

431
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,660
After her!

432
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,860
Stop right there!

433
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,220
You can't escape now.

434
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,100
You better stop running.

435
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,460
Why aren't you running anymore?

436
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:49,780
Come at me.

437
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,180
Let's go!

438
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,060
Stop right there!

439
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:09,980
Hey, stop running!

440
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,420
Stop right there!

441
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:16,700
Don't run!

442
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,860
He's in front! After him!

443
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,110
(Zhu Xiaoyao)

444
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,460
Men in the Capital would come in

445
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,700
through the door to see me.

446
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,780
It's rare to see someone coming in

447
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,940
through the window.

448
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:45,580
My apologies.

449
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,580
I came into the wrong room.

450
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,540
I'll take my leave now.

451
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,940
You've seen my body.

452
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,220
Yet, you want to leave just like that.

453
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,140
I didn't do it on purpose.

454
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,660
I mistakenly barged into your room

455
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,580
because I had no way to go.

456
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,060
I won't tell anyone about this.

457
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,220
I work in a brothel.

458
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,860
So I'm not afraid of anyone finding out.

459
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,620
But it'll be a different case for you.

460
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,100
You just helped Su Mengzhen take over
the House of Sunset Drizzle.

461
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,900
In an instant, you climbed into my room
through the window.

462
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,420
If this incident gets out,

463
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,820
I'm afraid it'll affect
the House of Sunset Drizzle's image.

464
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:24,780
You know me?

465
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,620
Everything that happened
in the Capital always spreads

466
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,460
to the House of Sanhe.

467
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,300
This is the most famous
entertainment quarter in the Capital.

468
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,980
I'm the actress here, Zhu Xiaoyao.

469
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,180
House of Sanhe?

470
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,180
You haven't heard of me?

471
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,900
I know it now.

472
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,860
My apologies, Miss.

473
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,980
Since the House of Sanhe
is a famous place,

474
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,980
can I look around?

475
00:23:59,260 --> 00:23:59,700
You...

476
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,700
You're already here and looked at me.

477
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,700
If you leave now,

478
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,620
they'll think I treat you poorly.

479
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:06,980
I...

480
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,300
Fine.

481
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,260
I'll sit.

482
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:13,980
I'll only stay for 45 minutes.

483
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,020
All right.

484
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,100
Have a seat over there.

485
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:23,860
Wen Rou.

486
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,380
Where's Little Rock?

487
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,100
I don't know.

488
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,420
Don't tell me they caught him.

489
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,020
What do you take him for?

490
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,500
They can't do anything to him.

491
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:34,900
But you, on the other hand,

492
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,980
it's your fault
for causing trouble all day.

493
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,140
I'm a martial artist.

494
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,060
I have to fight for justice.

495
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,460
This isn't fighting for justice.

496
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,740
You just like to meddle
in other people's business.

497
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,300
Am I wrong?

498
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:46,780
Enough already.

499
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,380
Since you're done blaming me,

500
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,620
let's find Little Rock.

501
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:50,780
Come on.

502
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,020
Where should we find him?

503
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,660
Let's search over there.

504
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,460
Sir, please be careful.

505
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,420
Over here. Be careful.

506
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,900
Don't forget to find me next time.

507
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,780
- Marvelous!
- Careful.

508
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,220
Splendid!

509
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,100
Are you here to achieve
something great in the Capital?

510
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:20,780
To achieve great things

511
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,100
in the Capital?

512
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,100
Is it the Capital's rule?

513
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,900
Of course, not.

514
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,100
The bright Capital.

515
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,580
Everyone comes here
to reach for the sky.

516
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,660
This "rule"

517
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,060
is embedded in their hearts.

518
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,860
The Capital has its rules.

519
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,580
I have mine too.

520
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,940
Fame is only a brief moment to me.

521
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,300
What I want is different from the rest.

522
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,020
Why did you help Su Mengzhen then?

523
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,780
Helping him was coincidental.

524
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,500
Every encounter is coincidental.

525
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,700
Let's say

526
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,460
you and me.

527
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,220
Parting is also inevitable.

528
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,540
Let's say.

529
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:03,860
Now.

530
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,220
Since you don't let me leave
through the door,

531
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,580
I'll leave through the window, then.

532
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:07,820
Farewell.

533
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,260
What is it now?

534
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,580
Sure enough, good times end fast.

535
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,500
When a woman grows old,

536
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,340
her beauty fades.

537
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,660
She can't keep her heartless lover too.

538
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:29,940
Wait.

539
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:30,500
Wait.

540
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,580
Don't cry.

541
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,660
I'm not the reason you cry, right?

542
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,380
What do you want me to do?

543
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,420
You didn't even drink

544
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,980
a sip of liquor since you came here.

545
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,100
I've lost all my face

546
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,140
as a famous actress.

547
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,860
It's just a drink, right?

548
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,060
I only have to drink, right?

549
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,380
See? I finished it.

550
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,620
The liquor is good.

551
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,580
It can trigger one's passion.

552
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,860
Well, not really.

553
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,900
It gives a person
the courage to speak up.

554
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,460
If you drink more,
you can sleep all night.

555
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,140
It doesn't trigger one's passion.

556
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:24,020
That's because you didn't drink it
with the right person.

557
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,420
What did you say?

558
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,740
Come closer,

559
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:31,900
and I'll tell you.

560
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:34,740
I can't.

561
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,540
I have to go.

562
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,140
You drugged me.

563
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,940
I added henbane seed to the liquor.

564
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,540
Rest assured.

565
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,420
It's not poison.

566
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,740
The Capital is an enchanted den.

567
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,180
There are many women
who are deceivers.

568
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,540
Since you've fallen into my trap,

569
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,940
you'll be more cautious next time.

570
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:11,980
What exactly do you want?

571
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,620
Me?

572
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,060
I want you

573
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,740
to know women.

574
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,660
If you were not a woman,

575
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,740
I would have beaten you.

576
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,380
I want to go back.

577
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,500
I won't stop you

578
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,700
if you can crawl out.

579
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:43,580
I can do it.

580
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,300
You're unarmed.

581
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,420
Yet, you went too far in insulting me.

582
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:01,820
Don't stop me.

583
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,620
Don't grab me.

584
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:04,940
Let me go.

(Shuang)

586
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,740
Are you letting him spend
the night here?

587
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,660
If he doesn't wake up all night,

588
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,460
I can only take him in.

589
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,020
Since he occupied your bed,

590
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,180
I'll prepare another room for you.

591
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,300
I can just sleep here.

592
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,460
We've been searching everywhere for him.

593
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,060
He's nowhere to be found.

594
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,340
Let's go back and stop searching.

595
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,380
How could you do this?

596
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,420
It's already dark.

597
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,780
Don't you worry about him?

598
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,740
I've already told you

599
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,340
that those people
won't be able to hurt him.

600
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,860
Aren't you worried
about where he'll sleep tonight,

601
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,540
if he's cold,

602
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,340
or if a snake bites him
in the abandoned temple?

603
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,860
What? Before he came to the Capital,

604
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,660
he lived in the wild.

605
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,900
He can sleep anywhere.

606
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,100
Why are you concerned
about where he'd sleep

607
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,100
or if he's cold?

608
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:31,780
Interesting.

609
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,380
I'm not worried about him.

610
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,100
I brought him to the Capital.

611
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,780
I need to take good care of him

You're fishy.

615
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,860
Why are you worried
about me concerning him?

Don't tell me...

Yes.

Do you feel good?

I don't remember anything.

What exactly did I do?

I can't remember a thing!

00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:44,420
Wait.

679
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,980
Bai, why didn't you help
me explain it to her?

680
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,700
She was the one...

681
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:48,740
I...

682
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,540
She drugged me.

683
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,380
You're a man now?

684
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,900
She drugged me.

685
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,420
The first thing to be a man

686
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,140
is not to find excuses.

687
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,380
She really drugged me.

688
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,500
There's no point telling me this.

689
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,780
You have to explain it to Wen Rou.

690
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,420
Put your clothes on.

691
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:05,460
I...

692
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,500
Bai,

693
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,860
I was really drugged.

694
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,860
All right, I know.

695
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,300
She did it!

696
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,660
Yes, I know.

697
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,420
Do you think

698
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,660
he's similar to the man
you told me about before?

699
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,580
He came in through the window too.

700
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,420
He was as interesting as him too.

701
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,460
They may be alike.

702
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,420
But they're not the same person.

703
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,820
In life,

704
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,460
isn't it for leisure

705
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,700
to chase after the shadow?

706
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,300
Besides, this leisure is pretty amusing.

707
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,780
Please take a look.

708
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,580
We're back where we were
if we take this way.

709
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,660
I want to show you something.

710
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,420
Mister.

711
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,540
Mister, you're back.

712
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,100
I've been waiting for you.

713
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,500
It's a game in the Capital.

714
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,820
I was making a bet just now.

715
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,540
But you and Wen Rou interrupted it.

716
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,340
Come and take a look!

717
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,540
Mister, you were betting on your future.

718
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,580
Whether it'll be good or bad,

719
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,660
it's all in your hands.

720
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,380
Out of the way!

721
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,220
Make way!

722
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,260
Are you Wang Xiaoshi and Bai Choufei?

723
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,940
I'm Wang Xiaoshi.

724
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,580
I'm Bai Choufei.

725
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,380
What can I do for you?

726
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,300
A bunch of kids.

727
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,820
Are you trying to pull
some tricks in front of me?

728
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:49,980
I'm Ren Lao
from the Ministry of Justice.

729
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,100
I was ordered by Minister Fu

730
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,460
to bring you two back with us.

731
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:54,980
Ministry of Justice?

732
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,420
May I know

733
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,140
what crime we committed?

734
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,460
Just keep quiet.

735
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,620
You'll know after you come with us.

736
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:15,740
Take them away.

737
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,020
The Emperor Star is not seen.

738
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,940
The imperial city is divided into two.

739
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,500
The Flirting Star hides The Power Star.

740
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,220
How can misfortune turn into a fortune?

741
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,180
So many uncertainties.

742
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:58,770
(Ministry of Justice)

743
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,660
We have new prisoners?

744
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,540
Nice beating!

745
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,420
You don't see the sky
from the dungeon.

746
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,940
Mother sews quilts
and clothes at home.

747
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,020
You beg the King of Hell
to take you away.

748
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,940
Yet, the King of Hell
fears the punisher!

749
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:16,860
Move it!

750
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,060
Come to me!

751
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,620
Sir, the dungeon is full.

752
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:27,820
Where's your Second Master?

753
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:28,820
He's currently occupied.

754
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,140
That means there'll be a space soon.

755
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,140
The dungeon was full,

756
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,500
so I had to make some room.

757
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,500
We brought these two in

758
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,860
at the command of Minister Fu himself.

759
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,380
Good.

760
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,140
Smooth and tender skin.

761
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:08,540
Smell nice too.

762
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,820
Very nice.

763
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,700
Take them in.

764
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,220
- Get in!
- Move it!

765
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,300
The shameless Little Rock.

766
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,780
The stupidest Choufei.

767
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,900
You didn't come and explain yourself
when I gave you a chance.

768
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,940
Don't ever think about meeting me again.

769
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:49,620
Miss,

770
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,780
I'm done clearing
all the tables and benches.

771
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,420
You're the only one left here.

772
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,300
You're the bench.

773
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,820
You've waited all night.

774
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,220
But no one showed up.

775
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,620
It's quite pitiful.

776
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,580
I'll leave the bench to you, then.

777
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,460
It's all right.

778
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,260
Thank you.

779
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,460
It looks like we've offended someone.

780
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:28,780
You're right.

781
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,020
We offended the Six Half Hall.

782
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,580
But it was the Ministry of Justice

783
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,380
that captured us.

784
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,780
The situations in the Capital
are truly complicated.

785
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,180
I ran into Hua Wucuo last night.

786
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,780
He said if someone wants to live freely,

787
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,380
the last place to come is the Capital.

788
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,060
Sure enough.

789
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,380
Little Rock,

790
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,100
you have to be cautious.

791
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,740
If they separate us,
we'll need to act accordingly.

792
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,740
Fu Zongshu is in charge here.

793
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,140
He's in charge of criminal law

794
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,260
and controls the martial arts world
for the imperial court.

795
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,420
He's a ruthless person.

796
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,060
You must deal with him carefully.

797
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,140
The minister is here.
He wants to see you.

798
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:35,140
One by one.

799
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,660
You first.

800
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,300
Little Rock.

801
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,540
Hurry up.

802
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:50,460
Come on.

803
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,300
Sir.

804
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,100
Pay your respect
when you see the minister.

805
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,500
Hold him up.

806
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,060
Get up.

807
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,820
Is there no law in the Capital?

808
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,220
What crime did I commit?

809
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,380
Wang Xiaoshi.

810
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,980
Birth parents are unknown.

811
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,420
Your adoptive father,
Wang Tianliu, sent you to study

812
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,940
under Recluse Tianyi
in Baixu Garden since young.

813
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,820
You're the only disciple
of the Carefree Sect.

814
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,980
The white jade box you delivered

815
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,100
had caused a disturbance
in the martial arts world.

816
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,900
What was your purpose?

817
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,380
You got it wrong.

818
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,860
I was not the one who caused the unrest.

819
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,100
But those who think they have power
in their hands.

820
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,700
How stubborn.

821
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,100
I shall see
if you can remain this stubborn

822
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,180
after the torture.

823
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,140
Take care of him.

824
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:58,420
Yes, Sir.

825
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,980
What crime did I commit
to being tortured?

826
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:11,860
Release me!

827
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:15,820
Wang Xiaoshi,

828
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,380
you should feel honored

829
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,300
to have us serve you.

830
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,740
Mr. Wang,

831
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:25,340
some people stained their fingers
from dyeing cloth.

832
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:27,900
Guess how did I get

833
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,980
these red stains.

834
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,460
I got it from skinning human skin.

835
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,820
Are you even human?

836
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,380
Calm down, Mr. Wang.

837
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,180
Calm down.

838
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:35,780
Let me do it.

839
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,460
Wang Xiaoshi, what's your relationship
with Su Mengzhen?

840
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,340
We met by chance.

841
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,220
Met by chance?

842
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,180
Is it worth it
to risk your life for him?

843
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,060
What benefit do you get from that?

844
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,500
What benefit must I get
to fight for justice?

845
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,700
I'll ask you one more time.

846
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,900
What's exactly
your relationship with Su Mengzhen?

847
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,020
Does the Baixu Garden want to join

848
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,220
the martial arts world
in the Capital too?

849
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:11,820
It has nothing to do with Baixu Garden.

It'll be the same answer
no matter how many times you ask!
