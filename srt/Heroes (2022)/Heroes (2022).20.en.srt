(The Storm is Not Over. Part 2)

32
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,480
If you do want to bet on my life,

33
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,879
I'm not afraid of you.

34
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:16,080
The martial arts world of the Capital
is just like the gambling.

35
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:20,319
Only those who are eligible
can join the gambling table.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,800
Mr. Su is the proud son of the heavens.

37
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,800
He's eligible to get a seat.

38
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,800
Lei Sun owns the Six Half Hall.

39
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,520
He's eligible too.

40
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,879
Although all of us despise Fu Zongshu,

41
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,520
he does govern the Ministry of Justice.

42
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,520
We have to give him a seat.

43
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,599
As for the last seat,

44
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,080
naturally, it belongs to me.

45
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,080
Mr. Bai, who else do you think

46
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:00,039
has the right

47
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:02,120
to get a seat on the gambling table?

48
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,879
My brother, Wang Xiaoshi,

49
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,439
could retreat unscathed
even after battling Guan Qi.

50
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,879
No other martial artists could do so.

51
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,919
So, he has to get a seat.

52
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,159
Unnoticed, even when his hair turned white.

53
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,719
Di Feijing is the only one.

54
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,800
Even if he doesn't own the Six Half Hall,

55
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,919
he should get a seat.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,919
As for those officials

57
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,719
who govern the martial arts world
in their comfortable homes,

58
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,840
we mustn't forget about them.

59
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,000
As for the last seat...

60
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,080
Vice House Master Bai,
I know you have high aspirations.

61
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,960
Naturally,

62
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,000
you would want the last seat.

63
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,280
Of course I do.

64
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,639
You can only win the game
if you get a seat here.

65
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,680
On this gambling table of the Capital,

66
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,800
it's not that easy for you to win.

67
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,879
You'll be countered easily.

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
If you want to win,

69
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,360
you have to eliminate everyone.

70
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,759
How do I do that?

71
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:22,560
There are 32 cards on the table.

72
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,879
Only two of them are stand-alone cards.

73
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:28,040
However, those two cards cannot
form a pair with other cards.

74
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,399
They can only form a pair with
each other and grant a score of 9.

75
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,319
That's how you eliminate everyone.

76
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:37,000
The stand-alone cards
are just like you and me.

77
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,160
You're not doing well within
the House of Sunset Drizzle.

78
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,480
As long as your idea
goes against Su Mengzhen's,

79
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,120
you won't be able to do anything.

80
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:45,720
And I,

81
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,360
as long as those officials are around,

82
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:51,399
I can only pretend to be a dog.

83
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,439
I've been holding this card
with me for a long time.

84
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,279
Vice House Master Bai,

85
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:06,319
I've been waiting for
the appearance of the other card.

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,360
So, will you be the owner

87
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,240
of that card?

88
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,920
So, you wish to drive a wedge
between me and Su Mengzhen?

89
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,680
I suggest you give up.

90
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,199
We are sworn brothers.

91
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,560
Even if there's only one spot

92
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,519
left in the martial arts world,

93
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,079
he will be my final rival,

94
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,759
not you.

95
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:40,120
You got yourself
a decrepit house in the outskirts

96
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,839
and hired 50 people to risk their lives for you

97
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,959
and assassinate people.

98
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,199
Now, you're trying to tell me
about your righteous dream?

99
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,519
Marquis,

100
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,240
you're so pitiful.

101
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,480
Everyone on the gambling table

102
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,240
treats each other as enemies.

103
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,720
Only cattle travel in herds.

104
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,879
A tiger always travels alone.

105
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,800
You might be one of the cattle,

106
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,800
but I'm not.

107
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,439
But, I need to remind you of one last thing.

108
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:17,040
No one can stop me

109
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,720
when I intend to bet on my life.

110
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,560
Chun?

111
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,600
Why are you here?

112
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:47,920
Father.

113
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,800
I really don't want you

114
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:04,160
to see me in this state.

115
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,319
The martial arts world

116
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:10,279
is a business field.

117
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,600
We could only leave everything to fate.

118
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,000
It's a pity that I've lost this time.

119
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,800
It's a terrible loss.

120
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,040
Is there no way to turn back right now?

121
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,680
Not even

122
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:29,040
an inch.

123
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,240
To be honest,

124
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,159
I may seem like I'm leading
the Six Half Hall on the surface,

125
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,919
but I'm just a pawn.

126
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:45,240
Our true master is the Youqiao Group.

127
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:48,399
The firearms that
I was smuggling to the north

128
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,440
belonged to them.

129
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,840
Now that I've got myself into trouble,

130
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,320
I have to take responsibility for it.

131
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,879
Even if the Youqiao Group lets me off,

132
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,600
Su Mengzhen won't let me off.

133
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,600
I know.

134
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,480
You hate me for selling
illegal firearms to the Liao people.

135
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,360
But I didn't do it of my own accord.

136
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,039
Who's willing to get themselves
into trouble of their own accords?

137
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,919
I cannot reject them.

138
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,600
If I reject them,

139
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,279
not only will we be slain,

140
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:29,159
but the entire Six Half Hall will be eradicated!

141
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:31,759
We'll end up just like the Mitian Sect!

142
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,039
They own the entire imperial court.

143
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,799
I can't go against them.

144
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,159
My daughter,

145
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:47,960
back then, I canceled your engagement

146
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:51,200
with Su Mengzhen,

147
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,440
because I was afraid
that they might fear our power

148
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:57,799
if you two got married.

149
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,279
I'm sorry.

150
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:05,039
I've let you down.

151
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,960
Father, this isn't your fault.

152
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:13,600
And, I was prepared for this since long ago.

153
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,240
When I was very young,

154
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:18,320
you told me

155
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,919
that when one roams
the martial arts world with a blade,

156
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,200
the lives of their entire family
are tied to the handle itself.

157
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:30,799
It's a pity

158
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,840
that I'm too old now.

159
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,360
Now,

160
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,000
if I had a chance,

161
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,679
I would give up everything here

162
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,879
and leave the Capital.

163
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:52,679
It's a pity.

164
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,279
There's no chance now.

165
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:00,639
It's too late.

166
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:06,679
Father, if you're truly willing
to leave the Capital,

167
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:09,080
I can head to the House of Sunset Drizzle

168
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,000
and talk to Su Mengzhen about it.

169
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,679
I'll beg him to let the Six Half Hall off.

170
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:36,919
Marquis!

171
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,399
- Marquis!
- Stop pulling my shirt.

172
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,720
Marquis, slow down.

173
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,799
We have a rare guest today.

174
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,679
Who is this?

175
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,240
This is my rival.

176
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,240
You guys may leave.

177
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,759
What are you doing here?

178
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,559
I have no time for idle chat.

179
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,679
Do you still remember
the wrestling match

180
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:10,559
you promised me?

181
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,879
So, you're here
to settle your debt with me?

182
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:15,600
It depends on

183
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,759
who the winner is.

184
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,440
If you defeat me today,

185
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,759
it'll be an embarrassment for me.

186
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,240
This is interesting.

187
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,679
Marquis, you're a daring man.

188
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,320
Don't tell me you're
chickening out of the match?

189
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:30,559
Of course not.

190
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,000
Why would I chicken out?

191
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:33,559
I'm in a great mood today.

192
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,279
I'll play with you.

193
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,679
See you on the battlefield.

194
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,960
You're an amateur.

195
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,399
I won't bully you.

196
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,559
I'll wear a blindfold for the match.

197
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,519
Look, he's wearing a blindfold.

198
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,440
Great!

199
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,120
Good job!

200
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:40,639
Great match!

201
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,519
Great!

202
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,960
Attack!

203
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:12,840
Fight!

204
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:14,960
Fight him!

205
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,840
Come on!

206
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,519
Fight him!

207
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:28,960
Throw him to the ground!

208
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,240
Put your back into it!

209
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:30,960
Hang in there!

210
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,919
Put your back into it!

211
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:32,840
Come on!

212
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:39,799
I thought this was a wrestling match?

213
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,200
The man is cheating!

214
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,159
How could he use hidden weapons?

215
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:43,039
He went against the code of martial arts.

216
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:43,879
How could he do this?

217
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,840
My goodness.

218
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,039
He's really despicable.

219
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,840
He cheated!

220
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,720
Despicable.

221
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,679
It's fine as long as I can win.

222
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:53,679
Who cares about playing fair?

223
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,679
He's so despicable. What a cheater.

224
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:56,799
This is not fair at all.

225
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,039
Get down!

226
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:59,240
It's not glorious even if you win.

227
00:14:59,279 --> 00:14:59,960
Indeed!

228
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,799
Precisely! He's turning himself
into a laughing stock!

229
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:02,840
What's with the hidden weapon?

230
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,600
You guys better stop laughing.

231
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:07,360
This wrestling match is between us.

232
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,879
There is no rule for the match.

233
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,080
It's fine as long as I can win.

234
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:11,919
What kind of stupid logic is that?

235
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,120
Come on.

236
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:14,399
I don't know

237
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,639
where you'll get cut this time.

238
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,480
Great!

239
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:24,919
Great!

240
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,159
You actually asked a girl to wrestle for you!

241
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,840
This punch is for Wen Rou!

242
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,879
Great!

243
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,440
Teach him a lesson!

244
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,120
Precisely!

245
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,159
Teach him a lesson!

246
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,559
- Throw him to the ground!
- Again!

247
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,279
Continue!

248
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,039
- Throw him to the ground!
- Beat him up!

249
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:42,919
Great!

250
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,799
How dare you attempt
to drive a wedge between my brothers?

251
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,159
This is for my brothers!

252
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,600
The last kick is a warning to you.

253
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,399
You better stay the heck away from me.

254
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,759
I don't care what devious plan
you have in mind,

255
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:07,799
but you better don't involve
the people around me.

256
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:20,200
Great!

257
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,320
Fang Yingkan!

258
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,000
Where's Little Rock?

259
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,679
Dear, you're not here to see me?

260
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:53,039
Look at me.

261
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:54,519
I'm injured,

262
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,879
yet you're not concerned about me.

263
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:57,399
Why should I be concerned about you?

264
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:58,600
You committed the evil act yourself.

265
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,720
You deserved to be injured.

266
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,879
I won't let you off

267
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:02,919
if you hurt Little Rock.

268
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,079
Wen Rou.

269
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,279
Little Rock!

270
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,119
What are you doing here?

271
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,039
I was worried about you.

272
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,319
Are you hurt anywhere?

273
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,240
I'm fine.

274
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,759
Let me take a look.

275
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:15,200
I'm truly fine.

276
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,480
I won't be hurt.

277
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,599
Don't worry about me.

278
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,119
I've been starving the entire day.

279
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:21,160
Let me treat you to a meal.

280
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:22,160
All right.

281
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:47,264
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

282
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,440
When the Six Half Hall's carriage
came inside,

283
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:57,960
I thought it was Chief Elder Lei

284
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,200
or First Elder Di.

285
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,440
But it's none of them.

286
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,279
So it's you, Miss Lei Chun.

287
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,039
What are you doing here?

288
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,000
Advisor.

289
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:13,680
Lei Chun of the Six Half Hall seeks
an audience with House Master Su.

290
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,319
Follow me.

291
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,640
Thank you.

292
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,839
I think this is the first time

293
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:47,480
you've spoken to me in that manner.

294
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,839
I have to, given the fact

295
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,759
that I'm inside
your Across The Sea Hall.

296
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:54,680
Why aren't you looking at me?

297
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:56,440
We made a promise to each other

298
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:59,440
that we are not
to talk about the two sects.

299
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:03,079
But I'm afraid
I have to break that promise today.

300
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm representing my father

301
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,680
to negotiate a deal with you.

302
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:15,880
You should know

303
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,960
about what I hate the most.

304
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,680
I know.

305
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,880
That's why I'm saying this today.

306
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:26,759
Even if it has come to this situation,

307
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:30,839
I don't wish to use our bond

308
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:31,759
to push you.

309
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,599
Today,

310
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,119
you should treat me
as a member of the Six Half Hall.

311
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:52,960
Fine.

312
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,279
Under Lei Sun's support, the Six Half Hall

313
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,200
produced illegal firearms

314
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,279
and sold them to the Liao people.

315
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,880
In my eyes, that's a heinous deed.

316
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:04,519
He betrayed the nation
and colluded with the enemies.

317
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:06,119
I will never allow that.

318
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:09,480
Father was just following orders
for the business in the north.

319
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,039
Moreover, Fu Zongshu

320
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,680
has already severed his ties
with the Six Half Hall.

321
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:14,960
Even if you force my father
to a dead corner,

322
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,880
you won't be able
to destroy the Youqiao Group.

323
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You're a hero.

324
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,119
You cannot go against
the principles of righteousness.

325
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,839
But, as a daughter,

326
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:34,000
I cannot abandon my father.

327
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,279
What do you wish for me to do?

328
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,319
Release my father.

329
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,119
Recall every member
of the Messenger Pigeon Group

330
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,599
you planted around the Six Half Hall.

331
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,680
Recall all of the invisible sentries
you planted in the Capital.

332
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,839
Mengzhen.

333
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,839
I don't wish
to make things difficult for you.

334
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,599
Father has already promised me

335
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:13,000
that he will retire from the Six Half Hall

336
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,119
and leave the Capital.

337
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:17,599
He will never return here again.

338
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,000
Who will lead the Six Half Hall

339
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,839
after Lei Sun's departure?

340
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:37,960
Di Feijing.

341
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,599
What about you?

342
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:49,119
I'm his daughter.

343
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:52,359
Naturally, wherever he goes,

344
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:55,799
I'll follow.

345
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:14,720
You should know

346
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:17,359
that I never wanted
to make things difficult for you.

347
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:19,559
I will promise you that.

348
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,240
Even if you were to forsake

349
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,319
our bond one day,

350
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:29,880

(Discovery)

371
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:43,319
Chun went to
the House of Sunset Drizzle.

372
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,200
I know.

373
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,440
After all,

374
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,920
I even attempted sadfishing.

375
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,480
You tricked Chun and made concessions
in order to gain an advantage.

376
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,359
Can we really kill Su Mengzhen?

377
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,599
Tomorrow night,

378
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,640
I shall deliver a letter to Su Mengzhen
under Chun's name.

379
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:08,359
I will ask him

380
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,839
to meet Chun at Shili Pavilion
outside of the city.

381
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:14,440
He always drops his guard
in front of Chun.

382
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,440
We might be able

383
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,440
to kill Su Mengzhen.

384
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,440
Chun.

385
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,079
Stay at home for the next few days.

386
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,079
Don't go anywhere.

387
00:25:42,578 --> 00:25:52,703
(Lingxiang Hall)

388
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,400
First Elder.

389
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,039
You guys may leave.

- Yes, First Elder.
- Yes, First Elder.

391
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:13,920
After you kill Su Mengzhen,

392
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:18,480
Sunset Drizzle will surely sacrifice
everything to get revenge.

393
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,559
By then, the entire Capital
will be filled with blood.

394
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,440
Is that truly what you wish for?

395
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,799
Didn't you say that we must

396
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,359
maintain the peace
between the two sects?

397
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:36,680
Maintaining the peace
between the two sects

398
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,880
is my wish too.

399
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:47,400
Chun,

400
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:49,559
do you remember what I told you

401
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,480
regarding how I joined the Six Half Hall?

402
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:56,000
My parents passed away

403
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,960
on a winter day 20 years ago.

404
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,000
I was sick too.

405
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:04,160
I could only stay on the snowy ground

406
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:07,720
and wait for the cold to claim my life.

407
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:13,519
Back then, I thought

408
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,680
that it was fine for me to die

409
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:19,440
as I didn't have a family.

410
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,119
After that, I encountered
Chief Elder and Madam.

411
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,440
They gave me a pancake

412
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:28,359
and helped me to survive.

413
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:31,039
After that, they gave me a small house

414
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,559
and told me

415
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,519
that it was my home.

416
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,759
Since then, I lived in the Six Half Hall.

417
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:41,920
Madam, the Chief Elder,

418
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:43,319
and you

419
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,759
are just like my family members.

420
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:49,440
Some people have huge aspirations

421
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:51,480
while some have small wishes.

422
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:54,279
If the martial arts world
is destined to be chaotic,

423
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,160
I, Di Feijing,

424
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:59,200
will risk my life to protect my family.

425
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:00,920
That

426
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:04,599
is my small wish.

427
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:06,319
Di,

428
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,319
I'm just like you.

429
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,759
I wish to protect my family too.

430
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:13,079
However, to me,

431
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,079
Su Mengzhen

432
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:19,039
is a part of my family.

433
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:42,090
(Lingxiang Hall)

434
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:16,039
This tavern belongs to Mr. Long
of the House of Sunset Drizzle.

435
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,440
What are you doing here

436
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,920
instead of running for your life?

437
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,599
I'm here to have a drink with you.

438
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,680
Chief Elder Lei, I have no reason
to have a drink with you.

439
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:27,759
Yesterday's enemies

440
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:31,000
might become today's friends.

441
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,440
The key lies in the opportunity.

442
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,559
It's impossible for us to become friends.

443
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,759
Chief Elder Lei, if you wish to drink,

444
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,200
you can drink by yourself.

445
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:41,839
I won't keep you company.

446
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:43,039
Since we have no common topic,

447
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,000
it's meaningless
for us to drink together.

448
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,240
You see, liquor never chooses its drinker.

449
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,480
It's always the drinker
choosing the liquor.

450
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,519
If you wish for a meaningful conversation,

451
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,279
you need to pick the right liquor.

452
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,480
Even so, I don't need you
to teach me how to pick it.

453
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,319
People like you and I

454
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,359
both aspire to reach the sky.

455
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,039
We have a blade in our hands

456
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,640
and we can harden our resolve
to get things done.

457
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,480
However, Su Mengzhen is different.

458
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,079
He still pursues the path of righteousness.

459
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:10,960
With Su Mengzhen around,

460
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:14,640
you will never reach the height
you aspire to reach.

461
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,279
It's not that you're not capable enough.

462
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,960
It's just that you picked
the wrong leader to follow.

463
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,680
In the martial arts world,

464
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:28,119
if anyone can challenge my sect

465
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:29,759
and kill the Five Warriors of
the Six Half Hall,

466
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:32,359
it's something you can brag about,

467
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,240
right?

468
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:34,519
Look at you right now.

469
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,720
You could only swallow that bitter drink

470
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,720
while defending
your pathetic path of righteousness.

471
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:43,440
This concerns
my House of Sunset Drizzle alone.

472
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:44,759
It has nothing to do with outsiders.

473
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,039
If you wish to use this matter
to drive a wedge between us,

474
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,480
I suggest you give up.

475
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:57,039
This is the funniest joke

476
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,519
I've heard today.

477
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:03,079
Your House of Sunset Drizzle?

478
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:05,960
Is the House of Sunset Drizzle even yours?

479
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,440
It belongs to Su Mengzhen.

480
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:18,720
You might only be able
to take over the House of Sunset Drizzle

481
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,480
after Su Mengzhen's death.

482
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,799
By then,

483
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,039
you can make the call

484
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,400
for anything

485
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,440
and everything.

486
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,279
Only then,
it would be satisfying to drink.

487
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,317
(Chou Shi House)

488
00:31:41,318 --> 00:31:42,898
(Virtuous)

489
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,279
Cabbage didn't come home last night again?

490
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:04,559
It's been three days.

491
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,240
He wasn't at Madam Cha Hua's house too.

492
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,319
I don't know where he spent the night at.

493
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,720
We can't let this situation continue.

494
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,119
Let's search for him.

495
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,079
In the Capital,

496
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:15,039
it's either you stay in an inn

497
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,160
or a liquor house.

498
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:18,799
We will surely find him
if we search them one by one.

499
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,480
Great timing.
I was looking for you guys.

500
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:31,759
What's the matter, Long?

501
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:33,720
Choufei has been drinking alone
in my tavern lately.

502
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:35,240
I don't think we should let him be.

503
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,640
You two should persuade him to stop.

504
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,400
- Thank you, Mr. Long.
- Thank you, Mr. Long.

505
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,400
- Let's go.
- Sure.

506
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,799
Cabbage,

507
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,119
are you okay?

508
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:55,640
Of course.

509
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,680
We don't even know

510
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,440
where you have been staying

511
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,319
and if you slept well
for the past few days.

512
00:32:58,319 --> 00:32:59,680
How could we not worry about you?

513
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,920
I just didn't return
to Ugly Rock House for a few days.

514
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,279
There's nothing to worry about.

515
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,960
I know.

516
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,160
Mengzhen is a stubborn person.

517
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,359
You're a stubborn person too.

518
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:10,519
When two stubborn people
are together, they will surely argue.

519
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:12,160
But you guys should get over it
now that the argument is over.

520
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,559
You two are sworn brothers, you know?

521
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,000
Little Rock, you should try
and persuade him.

522
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Wen Rou, you should stop.

523
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:24,039
We should let Bai
tell us what's on his mind.

524
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,440
I don't plan

525
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:31,079
to return to
the House of Sunset Drizzle.

526
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,079
What?

527
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,279
You're not returning to Sunset Drizzle?

528
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,880
Where else can you go then?

529
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:37,000
Will you leave the Capital?

530
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,680
You know well enough

531
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,759
how prideful you are.

532
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:40,720
No other places
can accommodate your lofty ambitions

533
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,680
except for the Capital.

534
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,519
But even when I'm at
the House of Sunset Drizzle,

535
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:44,759
I cannot realize my ambitions.

536
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,319
Why not?

537
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:47,720
You're already the Vice House Master.

538
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,319
If there's a misunderstanding
between you and Mengzhen,

539
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,720
you two can try to talk it out.

540
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,079
Vice House Master?

541
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,079
I have to get Mengzhen's permission

542
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,240
before I do anything,

543
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:58,359
even though I'm the Vice House Master.

544
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,039
Su Mengzhen is the number one
martial artist in the world.

545
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,599
No one dares to doubt him.

546
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,839
If that's the case,

547
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,000
I want to be
the number one martial artist too.

548
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:08,639
Cabbage,

549
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,280
I'm too disappointed in you.

550
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:12,920
I can understand that you
and Mengzhen have conflicting opinions.

551
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,199
I can understand that you want
to be the number one martial artist.

552
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,719
However, I cannot understand

553
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,920
why you cannot appreciate
what Mengzhen had done for us.

554
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,760
It's easy to say noble words.

555
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,239
However, such words are meaningless.

556
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:24,360
Mengzhen made no bones
about your mistakes

557
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,239
because he saw you as his family.

558
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,639
Not only did you
not appreciate his effort,

559
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,920
but you're also leaving out of spite.

560
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:31,960
Which part was he wrong about you?

561
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,159
That night,

562
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,440
if Mengzhen didn't make it
in time, you would've...

563
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,880
If he didn't make it in time,

564
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,119
I would've died, right?

565
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,719
But listen up,

566
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,400
I would rather die
in Di Feijing's hands that night

567
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,559
than to be saved by him.

568
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,360
To me, it's a humiliation.

569
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,239
You're totally unreasonable.

570
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,159
You can say whatever you like about me.

571
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,000
I don't care.

572
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,079
Fine.

573
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,480
I've already said what I needed to say.

574
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,159
You can do whatever you want.

575
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:14,160
(Lingxiang Hall)

576
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:16,920
Stop right there.

577
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,719
I'm sending some snacks to Young Lady.

578
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,519
No.

579
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:21,960
Chief Elder said
Young Lady cannot leave the room.

580
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,559
But he didn't say anything
about not letting others in.

581
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:26,000
Miss Mo, please
don't make things difficult for us.

582
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,119
You can leave it here.

583
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,599
We will deliver it to her.

584
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,880
Do you think you're capable enough
to take care of Young Lady?

585
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:32,199
Or do you think you're capable enough?

586
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,079
I won't make things
difficult for you two.

587
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,280
I've brought you two
a pot of excellent liquor.

588
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,519
You guys should have a sip
since it's so cold out here.

589
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,679
I'll leave the room

590
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,119
before you guys finish the liquor.

591
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,440
No one else will know
if I keep quiet about it.

592
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:50,719
Just hold this.

593
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,960
You too.

594
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,880
If so, Miss Mo, please hurry up.

595
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,000
All right. Thank you.

596
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:07,599
It smells great.

597
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:19,069
(Six Half Hall)

598
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:02,400
Have you made up your mind?

599
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:04,559
I have.

600
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,920
Will you leave the Capital?

601
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,079
Of course not.

602
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:12,239
You said this before.

603
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,079
A fresh flower in the dark
is no better than a flint.

604
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:18,639
If you wish to be the flint,

605
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,280
I cannot stop you.

606
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,480
After you hand in the resignation,

607
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:28,599
the three of us shall drink again.

608
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:31,480
We're just not working
for the same sect.

609
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,920
However, we still
need to drink together.

610
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:36,719
We're sworn brothers, aren't we?

611
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:46,599
All right.

612
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:51,360
My lady.

613
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:53,159
I'm sorry. I must be mistaken.

614
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,199
You two, over here.

615
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:54,800
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

616
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:09,000
Scout out the front.

617
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,039
Let's go!

618
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,280
Chun,

619
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:23,280
what's the matter?

620
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,400
Mengzhen is in danger.

621
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:25,559
We need to hurry up.

622
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:32,280
Chun, follow me back.

623
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:39,440
Di,

624
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,159
you said you would help me out.

625
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,360
You said you would help me out
no matter what happens.

626
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:45,960
I'm sure you have a way
to stop Father, right?

627
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:48,320
You have a way, right?

628
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,880
You guys mustn't kill Mengzhen.

629
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:53,800
If you kill Mengzhen,
everything will be too late!

630
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:00,440
Di!

631
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:01,679
Di!

632
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,639
Di!

633
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,760
Di!

634
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,119
You mustn't kill Mengzhen!

635
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:09,320
Di, let me out!

636
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,360
Keep an eye on Young Lady.

637
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
- Without my order,
- Di Feijing!

638
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,719
- no one is to enter or exit at will.
- Let me out!

639
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,480
Yes, sir!

640
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,800
Let me out!

641
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,400
Let me out!

642
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:24,988
(This is our final farewell)

Wake up!
