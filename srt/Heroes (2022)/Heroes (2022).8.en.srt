(Zhenyuan Escort)

33
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:49,439
Hello.

34
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,719
We saw a vacancy notice
at the escort agency's entrance.

35
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,840
Do you think we're good enough?

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,280
That's great.

37
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,280
We happened to be short-handed.

38
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,239
How do I address you two?

39
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,719

We can't hire those

Third Elder?

75
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,319
Since you couldn't get those two

76
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,120
to join us,

77
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,199
why didn't you kill them right away?

78
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,319
I can't kill them.

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,960
If I don't make a move,

80
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,680
the House of Sunset Drizzle
can't recruit them.

81
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,879
They'll leave
after staying in the Capital

82
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,159
for several days.

83
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,120
If I make a move,

84
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,159
the House of Sunset Drizzle
will take action.

85
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,159
When that happens,

86
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,840

87

Instead of finding ways
to eliminate them,

88
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,319
you always keep the peace.

89
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,719
I wonder if Chief Elder

90
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,519
is happy about it.

91
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,160
How would I know that?

92
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,560
You know best

93
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,399
if he's happy or not.

94
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:37,680
Did he really say that?

95
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,040
Every word is true.

96
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,839
He was directing it at me.

97
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,040
He has no right

98
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,639
to speak such nonsense to me.

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,360
If he doesn't have the right,

100
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,800
who else has the right?

101
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,360
You have to listen
to whatever Di Feijing says.

102
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,079
Be it good or bad.

103
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:02,399
You have to listen despite being harsh.

104
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,399
Understand?

105
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,360
Everything you say is right.

106
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,040
As a subordinate,

107
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,319
I should listen to First Elder.

108
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,199
I have to listen,

109
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,000
despite being happy or not.

110
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,639
That's more like it.

111
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,399
Besides, he didn't say anything wrong.

112
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,399
You know best

113
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,319
what I'm thinking.

114
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,120
Let me see if I get this right.

115
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,519
You want to kill these two.

116
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,240
But you know
First Elder thinks highly of them,

117
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,000
so you let him recruit them first.

118
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:40,560
If he fails to recruit them,
you'll kill them.

119
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,480
Then you won't be criticized for that.

120
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,839
I find your cleverness

121
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,079
and your beauty

122
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,680
very likable.

Excuse me. You dropped your things.

Excuse me!

128
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,360
Wait up!

129
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:21,920
Wait!

130
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,040

131
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,160
How did it go?

132
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,079
I failed.

133
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,959
Mr. Wang ran too fast.

134
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,240
He chased me down three streets

135
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:35,959
and gave it back to me.

136
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,600
You're such a fool.

137
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,040
You can't even handle this matter.

138
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,160
My apologies, Miss.

139
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,160
Forget it. You can go now.

140
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,920
How much did you put inside?

141
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,519
Two gold taels.

142
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:53,720
What a lousy trick.

143
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,600
With the characters they possessed,

144
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,160
do you think they'll keep

145
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,759
any gold they find in the street?

146
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,439
I have no other way to help them.

147
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,079
Martial brother forbids me
from seeing them.

148
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,480
I can't spoil the rule.

149
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,240
Even if you don't want
to spoil the rule,

150
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,800
you didn't have to come up
with such a foolish idea.

151
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,639
Then do you have any bright ideas?

152
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,560
Of course, I do.

153
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,519
Come, little beggar.

154
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,759
Eat something.

155
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:23,319
Thank you.

156
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,240
I'm starving.

157
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,480
It's your fault.

158
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:45,879
You chased him for three streets

159
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,000
and insisted on returning the money.

160
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:49,600
What's wrong with you?

161
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,279
You must do something.

162
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,319
Look at them.

163
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,279
They have nothing to eat
and no place to stay.

164
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,920
They still have injuries.

165
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,839
I know. Just calm down.

166
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,120
I've already made the arrangements.

167
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,920
Really?

168
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,040
Where?

169
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:11,560
Is it the kid who finds
everything tasty?

170
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,480
Or is it that strong porter?

171
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,319
You must believe in me.

172
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,279
Our House of Sunset Drizzle's
strong force

173
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,720
is that old grandmother.

174
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,360
When I first came to the Capital,

175
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,639
I said I wanted
to achieve something great.

176
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,040
Now, look what happened.

177
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,120
We can't even hide our dagger.

178
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,399
We don't have a place to take shelter.

179
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,399
We only left two copper coins.

180
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:37,000
We can't even afford a meal now.

181
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,039
I may not be able to see you.

182
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,279
Madam?

183
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,519
- Madam?
- But I recognized your voices.

184
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,039
You saved me before.

185
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,600
I haven't had the chance to thank you.

186
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,799
Here, have some flatbread.

187
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,480
- Here, take it.
- Madam, I can't accept it.

188
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,399
See that?

189
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,360
Madam, here's the payment.

190
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,440
It's all right.

191
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:59,080
Take it as me giving them to you.

192
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,039
Eat it.

193
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:02,799
Thank you, Madam.

194
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,759
- Eat it.
- Thank you, Madam.

195
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,480
I heard

196
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
you have no place to stay.

197
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,559
We haven't found one yet.

198
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:13,200
I have an empty room at my home.

199
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,480
It may be shabby.

200
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,399
But it's clean.

201
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,799
If you don't mind,

202
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,279
you can stay there first.

203
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,679
But we have no money.

204
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,600
About the rent...

205
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,840
You can pay for it later.

206
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,399
Young people eventually will find a job.

207
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,279
Come with me.

208
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,120
Thank you, Madam.

209
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,159
Come on.

210
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,320
Madam, let us help you carry these.

211
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,960
Let me take this.

212
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:38,399
Let's go.

213
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,039
Be careful.

214
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,759
Don't you find your arrangement crude?

215
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,919
Well, you see.

216
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,679
The cruder it is,
the less obvious that it was arranged.

217
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,639
The Ministry of Justice
and the Six Half Hall are watching.

218
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,480
We can't make it

219
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,879
too obvious.

220
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:58,200
What if they're in danger?

221
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,519
With them joining hands,

222
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,879
no one in the Capital

223
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,559
can do anything to them

224
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,440
except your martial brother and Lei Sun.

225
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,679
Wait up!

226
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,039
Hurry!

227
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:23,240
Is it this place?

228
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:30,759
We're finally here.

229
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:31,879
Yellow,

230
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,360
I'm home.

231
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:36,320
Be careful, Madam.

232
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,120
This is the room.

233
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,080
I have a nephew in the village.

234
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,440
He'd stay here
when he comes to visit me.

235
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,600
The sheets and bedding are clean.

236
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:57,840
You can stay without worries.

237
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,879
If you need anything,

238
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,000
my room is just the opposite.

239
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,960
You can tell me.

240
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:04,799
- Thank you, Madam.
- Thank you, Madam.

241
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,480
I thought we were going
to live in the streets.

242
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,600
I didn't expect we'd live in
such a good place.

243
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,200
You're right.

244
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:19,320
Candied Hawthorne!

245
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,679
Delicious candied Hawthorne!

246
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,840
Come and take a look!

247
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:32,360
The Capital
looks prosperous and beautiful.

248
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:34,919
In reality, it's hidden
with corruption and evil deeds.

249
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:36,840
Not only there's the unscrupulous force

250
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,840
like Six Half Hall
in the martial arts world,

251
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,320
but there's also
the treacherous Fu Zongshu.

252
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:43,960
Little Rock,

253
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:46,200
I'd have eaten the meat

254
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,840
if you hadn't stopped me.

255
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,080
I want to live.

256
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:51,679
Bai,

257
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,279
that would never happen.

258
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:54,879
It will happen.

259
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,039
You said the Capital is hidden
with corruption and evil deeds.

260
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,000
But to me,

261
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,080
it's a wall.

262
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,799
It's the Capital's iron law.

263
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:09,120
A rule where the strong
suppresses the weak.

264
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,240
Anything could happen

265
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,240
if we want to survive
in this environment.

266
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,039
As for you,

267
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,320
why do you still want to stay

268
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:22,799
despite knowing
how corrupted the Capital is?

269
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,240
My Master asked
if I remembered my origins

270
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,559
before I descended the mountain.

271
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,720
Do you still remember your parents?

272
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,240
Do you have any recollection?

273
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,360
I can't recall.

274
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:38,200
Then

275
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,120
do you want to know about them?

276
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,519
What will happen if I know?

277
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,399
If you know,

278
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:51,360
you won't be able

279
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,279
to live freely anymore.

280
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,480
I'll choose not to know about it first.

281
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,200
I want to live freely.

282
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,440
Never mind.

283
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,879
You can live freely
and make something of yourself

284
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,320
after you've completed

285
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:08,879
the task I gave you.

286
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,320
I lied to him.

287
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,480
When I was young,

288
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:19,480
there was always an image in my mind
that never went away.

289
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,759
There was a woman
under someone's foot.

290
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,279
The person who stepped on her

291
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:25,240
said the same thing

292
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,039
as Fu Zongshu.

293
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,840
The world is ours!

294
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:33,159
There's nowhere you can escape.

295
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,200
That woman is...

296
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:36,639
She was my birth mother.

297
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:53,480
Mother!

298
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,960
So was it Fu Zongshu
who killed your mother?

299
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,720
I'll remember that face forever.

300
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:04,399
It wasn't him.

301
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,399
But they have the same tone of voice.

302
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:10,960
I didn't know

303
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,279
you had such a tragic experience.

304
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:15,559
I always thought you
were a happy and ordinary person

305
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,200
with great martial arts skills.

306
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,639
You said the Capital is like a wall.

307
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,399
I think so too.

308
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,200
Now, this wall is in front of me.

309
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,120
It's in the way of my freedom.

310
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:32,000
I refuse to leave now.

311
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,559
I want to stay

312
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,799
and break that wall myself.

313
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:37,919
Rest assured.

314
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,600
When I reach the peak
of the martial arts world,

315
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,159
I'll break

316
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,399
this wall for you.

317
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,480
How are they doing now?

318
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,080
I wonder if they'll sleep well.

319
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,519
Where did these mung beans come from?

320
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,440
I scattered them.

321
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:30,440
Why?

322
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:32,240
To prevent those from Six Half Hall

323
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,840
and the Ministry of Justice
from attacking us at night.

324
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,759
The moment they're here,

325
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,200
we'll know right away.

326
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,720
They won't even let us sleep in peace.

327
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,159
That's right.

328
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,559
It's worrisome now that we're awake.

329
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:50,320
Since I'm no longer sleepy,

330
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,600
I'll go out for a walk.

331
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,902
(Mr. Wo)

332
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,920
Blazing River Lance, Mr. Mo?

333
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,519
I didn't expect to see you here.

334
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,039
I'm indebted to Su Zhemu.

335
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,640
I couldn't refuse when his son asked me

336
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,119
to protect these two.

337
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,880
I fought Guan Qi for you in the past.

338
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,000
So you're indebted to me too.

339
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,720
Can you not kill these two

340
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:08,200
if I ask you?

341
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:14,480
Of course.

342
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,039
I'll return this favor to you.

343
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,079
But I have a bottom line.

344
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,559
These two

345
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,559
must not knock on the door
of the House of Sunset Drizzle.

346
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,559
If they do,

347
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,599
they must die.

348
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,039
No one can stop me when that happens.

349
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:26,000
The wind comes from afar.

350
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,000
Sometimes, we can feel the vastness
of the world by listening to it.

351
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:31,519
We'll also understand

352
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,960
no matter how big the trouble is.

353
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,039
It's nothing but dust.

354
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,640
Listening to the wind to ease the mind

355
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:43,599
is a good habit.

356
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,960
Listen to the wind to ease the mind.

357
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:51,799
No matter how troublesome it is.

358
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,759
It's nothing but dust.

359
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,440
What is there to worry about
at a young age?

360
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:00,440
Young people have worries too.

361
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,440
What about you, Mister?

362
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:03,799
Do you have worries?

363
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,720
Yes, I do.

364
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,960
When I wasn't home,

365
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,039
my wife rented a room to two poor lads.

366
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:13,200
Of course, I'm worried.

367
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,039
Good morning, Mr. Wo.

368
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,759
Good morning, Mr. Wo.

369
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:41,880
We didn't visit you
because you weren't home yesterday.

370
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,680
Thank you for taking us in.

371
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,799
I met this lad last night.

372
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:47,519
But who are you?

373
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,519
My name is Bai Choufei.

374
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,960
Bai Choufei?

375
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,799
Wang Xiaoshi?

376
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,279
I only recall

377
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,920
my wife renting a room to two poor lads.

378
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,400
I didn't know she hired two helpers.

379
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,039
Mr. Wo, we haven't paid the rent.

380
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,279
So we wanted to clean the courtyard

381
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:08,000
and do some chores.

382
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,920
My wife and I aren't fussy.

383
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:12,279
You don't need to do these chores.

384
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:13,960
If you had the time to do this,

385
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:15,799
why don't you find a job?

386
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,119
When you travel the world,

387
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,640
you're bound to run into problems.

388
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,759
But the Capital

389
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,119
is not much different from other places.

390
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,799
You get what you earn.

391
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:30,759
What skills do you have?

392
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:33,960
We know some martial arts.

393
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:35,960
If these skills are useful,

394
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:38,279
you won't be in a dire strait.

395
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,279
Anything else?

396
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:40,799
When I was in the mountain,

397
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,160
I always listened
to different bird calls.

398
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,240
I can imitate a couple of bird calls.

399
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,440
The entertainment quarter has people
who are good at talking.

400
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,720
They amuse people

401
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,799
and describe things vividly.

402
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,720
They can earn some silvers from that.

403
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,599
But it's not an easy job.

404
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,519
I used to pick medicinal herbs
in the mountains with my master.

405
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:05,599
So I know medicinal ingredients.

406
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:06,960
I can help you with this.

407
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,039
My friend just set up an apothecary.

408
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:10,920
He happens to be short-handed.

409
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,480
You can work for him.

410
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,400
What about you?

411
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:16,599
I...

412
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:18,200
I know painting and calligraphy.

413
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,039
I can set up a painting stall.

414
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,119
That will work too.

415
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:23,960
We have unused inkstone and papers.

416
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,519
You can use them.

417
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:27,599
- Thank you, Mr. Wo.
- Thank you, Mr. Wo.

418
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:35,920
Sir.

419
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,825
(Wang Xiaoshi plans to work
at an apothecary)

420
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,680
Do we own any apothecary?

421
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:53,599
Sir, not at the moment.

422
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:55,400
I want you to buy one.

423
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,240
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

424
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,680
Sir, please take a look.

425
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,957
(Huichun Apothecary)

426
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,759
Mr. Wo introduced you here?

427
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:35,200
Yes.

428
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:36,960
That's great.

429
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,559
I've already prepared
the medical chest for you.

430
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:40,680
Here you go.

431
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,559
It's yours to use from now on.

432
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:44,240
Thank you, Mister.

433
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:47,240
Xiaoshi, come and see this.

434
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,079
This is where we dispense
our prescriptions.

435
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:51,519
Hello, Mister.

436
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:52,440
- Hello, there.
- Hello.

437
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:54,839
They will be your fellow workers now.

438
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,559
Mr. Wo! Madam!

439
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:24,720
We're home.

440
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,720
Madam,

441
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,599
let me help you.

442
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,960
No need.

443
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:29,960
Just take a seat.

444
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,119
You can do any chores

445
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,799
except cooking.

446
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,640
- But...
- This is my territory.

447
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,880
Call us if you need any help.

448
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,440
- Mr. Wo.
- Mr. Wo.

449
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,160
Madam can't see well.

450
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,440
Is it all right for her to do it alone?

451
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,319
She said it's her territory.

452
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,440
No one is allowed to go in.

453
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,440
It has always been this way
all these years.

454
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,440
She's stubborn about it.

455
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,160
Sit and have a drink.

456
00:24:59,609 --> 00:25:00,992
(On Marquis Liu)

457
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:03,119
"On Marquis Liu."

458
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:04,799
I've read this before.

459
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:08,480
Since you've read it,

460
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,240
tell me what you think about it.

461
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,839
It was written by Su Shi

462
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:16,599
commenting on Zhang Liang.

463
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,160
The key is tolerance.

464
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,880
To tolerate
what average people couldn't.

465
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,559
It's said when Zhang Liang was young,

466
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,920
he was humiliated in many ways
by Huang Shigong.

467
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,279
He received "The Art of War by Taigong"
after that.

468
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,759
He made great achievements in battles

469
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:29,359
for the Emperor Gaozu of Han.

470
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:31,759
It's a story about Zhang Liang putting
the shoes on for Huang Shigong.

471
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:33,319
Zhang Liang had such a success

472
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,119
because he encountered a Taoist hermit.

473
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,960
If Zhang Liang encountered
an ordinary person,

474
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:40,559
it would only be a waste of time

475
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,079
no matter how hard he practiced.

476
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:47,039
It's said people are similar
to their words.

477
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,240
When we listen to people speaking,

478
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:50,680
we'll be able to know
their state of mind.

479
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:53,200
You mentioned "tolerance" just now.

480
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,799
What you saw is "opportunity".

481
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:58,079
Don't these show

482
00:25:58,279 --> 00:25:59,480
your current state of mind now?

483
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,079
Food is ready!

484
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:05,559
Come and take them.

485
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:11,240
Here you go.

486
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:11,960
Let me do it.

487
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:16,519
Be careful, Madam.

488
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,960
Let me help you.

489
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:19,960
Here, Mr. Wo.

490
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:21,519
Madam, these are yours.

491
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,200
Bai, here you go.

492
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:23,759
Thank you.

493
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:24,720
Let's eat.

494
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:25,359
Let's eat.

495
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,839
Mr. Wo, eat more.

496
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,160
This is great.

497
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,319
It's been so long
since it's been this lively.

498
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,599
It's delicious.

499
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:37,240
I'll have to ask you

500
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:39,799
to help me take care of them
for some time.

501
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,839
I'm not even taking care of them.

502
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,920
I only took them in at most.

503
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,920
If these young men have no aspirations,

504
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:51,880
I'm afraid you won't even bother
about them.

505
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,599
That's right.

506
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,799
Have you heard of Youqiao Group?

507
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:58,559
I've heard of it before.

508
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:00,160
But some people

509
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:02,720
don't believe in its existence.

510
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:03,880
Some even say

511
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,480
Youqiao Group
is a community of interests.

512
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,279
There are government officials

513
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,480
and martial artists among them.

514
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,119
They're fickle and always play tricks

515
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:13,039
as they manipulate
the martial arts world in secret.

516
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:15,599
It's all for the wealth in the world.

517
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,240
Do you believe in this rumor, then?

518
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,599
It doesn't matter what I believe.

519
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,799
When you're my age,

520
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,799
there are limits to what you can do.

521
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,119
But you,

522
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,640
are you prepared

523
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,680
since you brought this up?

524
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:34,920
Youqiao Group is the bridge

525
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,359
between the Emperor and the ministers.

526
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,839
I'm sure

527
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,440
they're the hidden enemies.

528
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,200
You and my father are old friends.

529
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,079
His last wish is to have me protect
the martial arts world.

530
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:48,559
I hope I'll be able
to meet Official Liu Anshi

531
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:49,960
and find some clues

532
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:51,480
during my trip to the North.

533
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:56,039
The martial arts world is lucky
to have a new generation like you.

534
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,720
But long edge breaks easily.

535
00:27:59,039 --> 00:27:59,839
You must be cautious.

536
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:01,880
You knew

537
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,599
I've been frail since young.

538
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,839
I won't live long.

539
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:07,640
But I can at least guide the way.

540
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,240
We should hand over the burden
of protecting the martial arts world

541
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:11,720
to someone more promising.

542
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:14,920
Take care.

543
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,039
Mr. Wo, take care.

544
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:37,519
There's a faint smell of grass

545
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,839
in the rain.

546
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:42,880
It feels like I'm back at Baixu Garden.

547
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,720
But what I had in mind

548
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,119
is if it rains until tomorrow morning,

549
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,839
I won't be able to set up
my painting stall.

550
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,400
There's always a solution
to every obstacle.

551
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:57,279
There's no need to worry,

552
00:28:57,799 --> 00:28:58,559
young man.

553
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,759
Please take a look.

554
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:40,480
Too bad.

555
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,960
It's too bad.

556
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:45,440
What do you mean?

557
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:46,880
You see.

558
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:48,599
The mountain

559
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,160
and river look vivid.

560
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:51,799
The brush strokes
are vigorous and powerful.

561
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,839
They're indeed the highest quality.

562
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:55,240
It's too bad.

563
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,880
Look at your surroundings.

564
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,519
Please enlighten me.

565
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:02,359
Mister, see this?

566
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:04,839
Your paintings

567
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,839
are elegant pieces of artwork.

568
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,759
But there are only common people

569
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:10,559
in this market.

570
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:12,599
No one would understand your works.

571
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:15,000
If you paint here,

572
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,759
you should paint a beauty taking a bath,

573
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:19,599
a couple playing in the water,

574
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:21,200
or you could also paint

575
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:22,680
Goddess of Fertility

576
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:24,119
and God of Wealth.

577
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:25,359
If you make it more colorful,

578
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,160
won't it be lively to hang it at home?

579
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,319
I don't know how to paint those.

580
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:32,839
I only know how to paint
what I imagined.

581
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,839
If people paint those
for the sake of money,

582
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,319
that means they have no ambition.

583
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,960
Not even a wen?

584
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:41,000
You won't paint at all?

585
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:41,559
No.

586
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,400
Mister, you're one ambitious man.

587
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:47,039
My name is Wang Er.

588
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:48,480
To be honest,

589
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,240
you can say I have
some experience in this field.

590
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,319
I have a gallery
in the south of the city.

591
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:55,079
I always collect paintings
from new painters.

592
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:58,519
No one shows any interest
in your paintings here.

593
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,640
It's really pitiful.

594
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,880
I'll buy them all for eight wen.

595
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,720
I'll hang them at my gallery.

596
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,519
When someone buys it at a high price,

597
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,000
we'll do a 30-70 deal.

598
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:10,160
You'll take a 30%,
and I'll take a 70% profit.

599
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:16,279
It's fate

600
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,519
that we meet each other here.

601
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:19,000
How about this?

602
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:19,880
A 40-60 deal?

603
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,559
You'll take 40%, and I'll take 60%.

604
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,160
All right.

605
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:33,640
Since you make friends with me,

606
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,400
I'll treat you well.

607
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:39,640
Here you go.

608
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:40,880

611
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,400
Yes, Mister?

612
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:46,119
Did you prepare this prescription?

613
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,440
Yes, is there any problem?

614
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,720
No, not at all.

615
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:51,440
I only wanted

616
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,960
to say that you have
very nice handwriting.

617
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,359
My Master writes very well.

618
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,559
I learned it from him.

619
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,440
Can you write some for me too?

620
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,799
I'll hang it in the shop
to make it look more tasteful.

621
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:06,039
Sure.

What do you think about Zhao Bi's poem?

625

It's all right.

626
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,319
Many hang poems

627
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:28,759
in their apothecaries.
So it's nothing new.

628
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:30,519
We'll write

629
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:32,240
something else.

630
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,319
How about we write those?

631
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,000

Miss,

638
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,559
are you here
for prescriptions or consultation?

639
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,359
Consultation.

640
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,079
This way, please.

641
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:23,960
I want him.

642
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,599
All right.

643
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,160
Xiaoshi? Xiaoshi.

644
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:30,880
She's here for consultation.

645
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:34,440
Check her pulse.

646
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:43,839
Your pulse is stable.

647
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:46,240
You're pretty healthy.

648
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:48,799
But is there anything wrong?

649
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,839
I can't sleep well.

650
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,519
Sleepless nights
are usually caused by internal heat.

651
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,799
Do your hands and feet feel warm?

652
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,920
Well, no.

653
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:00,799
Without you next to me,

654
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,000
no one can warm them for me.

655
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,160
How could they be warmed?

656
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,880
Can you keep it low?

657
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,639
You're already mine.

658
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,239
- I...
- Are you afraid of people listening?

659
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,800
Just don't treat me like one.

660
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:17,599
I...

661
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,280
I'll prepare a prescription for you

664
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,400
My dear, your pulse is strong and fast.

665
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,280
Don't tell me you suffer
from internal heat

666
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:28,559
and have sleepless nights too.

667
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:29,440
No! I...

668
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:30,880
I sleep very well.

669
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:33,280

670
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,519
Since you said I'm all right,

671
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:38,639
why don't

672
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,320
you prepare a prescription for a tonic?

673
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,400

Mister, the truth is...

677
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,480
I guess it's not ordinary.

678
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,119
Xiaoyao, you bought
so many herbal ingredients.

679
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,599
I guess he'll make some money.

680
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:11,400
Since you care about him,

681
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,960
why don't you just tell him?

682
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,280
There are times people suffer hardships
in the martial arts world.

683
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,400
There's no need to make it obvious.

684
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:20,880
Xiaoyao, you treat him so well.

685
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:24,760
It's rare to meet someone
as amusing as him.

686
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,360
I have fun when I see him.

687
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:28,559
So I'd naturally treat him well.

688
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:36,280
Where are you going at this late hour?

689
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,760
I have something urgent.

690
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,000
My father delivered a letter
from Luoyang.

691
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,519
He wants me to take care of something.

692
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,800
You'll have to let me out.

693
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,679
What?

694
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:48,360
Your father delivered a letter to you?

695
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,559
Here it is.

696
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,285
(Rou, you left home to set out
to the Capital...)

697
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,880
Your father did send a letter to you.

698
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:00,840
This is worrisome.

699
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:02,599
I almost got in the way
of something important.

700
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:04,719
But

701
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:07,360
you can't just go like this.

702
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:08,239
How about this?

703
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:09,599
Wait here for a while.

704
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,039
I'll prepare some money
for your journey.

705
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,519
It's all right.

706
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:13,559
Martial brother told me

707
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,360
to take good care of you.

708
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,159
So wait here.

709
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,159
I'll be back soon.

710
00:36:29,137 --> 00:36:30,418
(Moon)

711
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:43,320
Will you look at this?

712
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,360
I also received a letter just now.

713
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,760
It's from your father too.

714
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,639
He said the previous letter,

715
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,360
which is the one you received,

716
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,360
should be ignored.

717
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:53,639
He said the Capital is chaotic now.

718
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:55,840
He wants us to watch over you

719
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,519
and not let you leave Xiaoxuan Pavilion.

720
00:36:58,199 --> 00:36:58,840
That's impossible!

721
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,679
I have the letter here.

722
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,559
You can read it.

723
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,040
(After my daughter, Wen Rou arrived
at the Capital...)

724
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:08,880
You...

725
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,480
What?

726
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,360
You...

727
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,280
Me?

728
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:12,679
What's wrong?

729
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:14,360
You copied my handwriting! Shameless!

730
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,840
The cat is out of the bag, huh?

731
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,639
Go back to your room.

732
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:20,159
I refuse!

733
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,199
Let me go!

734
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:26,000

- Watch Miss Wen.

736
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:29,880
Yes, Sir!

00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,480
Please take a look.

759
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:45,880
The paintings
aren't interesting to look at.

760
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,719
It's time to go back and make dinner.

761
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:47,239
Let's go.

762
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:09,760
Mister.

763
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:14,400
What a pitiful sight.

764
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,400
I feel sorry

765
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,360
when I see you.

766
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:21,519
I guess none of the paintings were sold.

767
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,360
Business is hard this year.

768
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:27,159
Your paintings are still at my gallery.

769
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:28,000
Just wait.

770
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:30,639
All right.

771
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,880
I've been waiting anyway.

772
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,400
A talented person
needs to have the right tools.

773
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:44,159
It's taboo for a painter
to have a bad brush.

774
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,639
Get a new one.

775
00:40:52,344 --> 00:40:53,760
(Huichun Apothecary)

776
00:40:57,639 --> 00:40:59,559
Mister, I'll come and open
the apothecary early tomorrow.

777
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,760
You can sleep longer.

778
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,360
My burden is lightened with you around.

779
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,880
I'll pay your salary tomorrow.

780
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,599
Thank you, Mister.

781
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:05,719
Take care.

782
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,480
Come and take a look!

783
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:44,000
Candied hawthorn!

784
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:47,039
Candied hawthorn!

785
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,320
You're off work?

786
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,519
Yes.

787
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:50,320
How did it go today?

788
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,360
I didn't sell a single painting.

789
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,280
The bristles are almost gone.

790
00:41:58,159 --> 00:41:58,920
I'm getting paid tomorrow.

791
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:00,559
I'll buy you a new brush.

792
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:03,519
Finally, a piece of good news.

793
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:06,039
Come on.

794
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,119
Let's go home and eat.

795
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,559
A fire broke out at the apothecary!

796
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:12,920

797

00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:16,039

799
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:17,280
Let's check it out.

800
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,559
Put out the fire! Put it out!

801
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:20,440
Help!

802
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:27,360
- Make way.

803
