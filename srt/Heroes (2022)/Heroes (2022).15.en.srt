33

Wen Rou insists on coming back with me

34
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,480
to help you pack.

Madam,

36
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,799
I feel sad that you're leaving.

37
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,799
Madam,

38
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,879
what's wrong?

39
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,199
Madam.

40
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,560
Where's Mr. Wo?

41
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,960
He won't be able to let it go

42
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:23,039
if he doesn't kill Guan Qi.

43
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,280
I let him go.

00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:32,879
Little Rock!

45
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,039
Watch Madam!

46
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,479
Madam,

47
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,639
it'll be all right.

48
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:11,639
Mr. Wo.

49
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,920

Mr. Wo.

56
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:10,040
When someone holds a sword
to go on a killing spree,

57
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,480
someone will bathe in blood
for stepping in.

58
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,480

64
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
I'm sorry.

65
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,959
I failed to protect Mr. Wo.

66
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,079
You're back?

67
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,040
As long as you're back.

68
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,240
As long as you're home.

69
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:32,159
Place him in the main hall

70
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:35,440
with his head to the door.

71
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,679
Put a light at his feet.

72
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,399
Little Rock,

73
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,559
go to the roof

74
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,440
and remove the tiles.

75
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,320
So he can see the sky

76
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,480
with his body not touching the ground.

77
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,240
One sickly man

78
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,600
and one useless old man.

79
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,440
Let's see how long you two can last.

80
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,919
Chief Elder Lei's martial arts skills
are equal to mine.

81
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,639
As long as there's tea,

82
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,799
he should be able to live
for a long time.

83
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:29,840
I have food and water.

84
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,720
I'll compete with you to the end.

85
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:33,759
Sir!

86
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:36,440
Sir.

87
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,480
Why are you panicking?

88
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,440
Guan Qi has caused Second Madam...

89
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,279
Did he kill her?

90
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,360
She lost her mind.

91
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,679
But many other died.

92
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,679
Let them die.

93
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,559
It has nothing to do with me.

94
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,080
There was a dead old man too.

95
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,639
Wang Xiaoshi carried him away.

96
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,080
Sir.

97
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,120
Guan Qi is going on a killing spree

98
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,679
and causing an uproar in the Capital.

99
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,080
Yes, he can't find you

100
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,080
if you hide here.

101
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:07,799
But if this goes on,

102
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,200
it'll alert the imperial court.

103
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:14,639
I'm afraid no one can afford
to take the responsibility.

104
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:22,840
Sir,

105
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,960
Guan Qi is behaving recklessly

106
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,000
without restraints.

107
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,639
If we let him continue
with the killings,

108
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,360
the Six Half Hall
and the House of Sunset Drizzle

109
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,200
won't be able to save all the citizens,

110
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,240
no matter how powerful we are.

111
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,919
This matter is serious.

112
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,559
We mustn't waste our time anymore.

113
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,480
You'll have to guarantee my safety.

114
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:01,919
We will make sure you're safe.

115
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,879
It's your favorite braised meat.

116
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,639
I braised it while
waiting for your return last night.

117
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,879
So you could eat before you leave.

118
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,399
Fu Zongshu has agreed to be the bait

119
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,639
to lure Guan Qi out.

120
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,000
Where do you plan to surround him?

121
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,519
House of Sanhe.

122
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,519
What House Master meant

123
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,639
was Guan Qi is highly skilled.

124
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:09,279
It's useless sending
many average martial artists.

125
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:11,080
So the House of Sanhe
will evacuate most people.

126
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,000
I'll play the qin with five customers.

127
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,279
The three of us,

128
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:17,279
Di Feijing, and Lei Sun

129
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,759
can definitely subdue Guan Qi.

130
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,879
Are we going to subdue him only?

131
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,240
He killed so many people.

132
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,639
If we kill him,

133
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,200
we might kill a bad person
or a good person.

134
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:31,000
I don't see why not.

135
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,240
But Guan Qi knows the secret
of Youqiao Group.

136
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:36,279
We must keep him alive in our hands.

137
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,120
If we think so,

138
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:40,279
Lei Sun would think the same too.

139
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,159
After we subdue Guan Qi,

140
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,480
the next fight will start right away.

141
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:46,799
If we want things
to go smoothly tonight,

142
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,120
everyone must work together
with one heart.

Mr. Su, Chief Elder Lei,
and the rest are here.

146

Have you completed
the task I assigned to you?

147
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,140
Please rest assured.

148

It's all arranged.

(Jifang Garden)

150
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,610
You're skilled in playing qin

151
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,300
and excellent at shooting.

152
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,820
Miss Xiaoyao is indeed unparalleled.

153
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,970
Zhu Xiaoyao's identity
is a secret to our House.

154
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,610
Unexpectedly,
your informers are everywhere.

155
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,420
A spy is highly valued
before exposing himself.

156
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,540
Once he makes a move,

157
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,700
he's no longer a spy.

158
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,820
The greatest value
of an informer is staying alive.

159
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,820
Once he's dead,

160
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,300
it's useless
even if he knows many secrets.

But you must not tell anyone about it.

Why are you glaring at me?

166

I'm not Guan Qi.

167
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,740
I suggest you be cautious.

168
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,740
We can't afford any mistakes now.

169

knows this is a trap.

00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,700
Guan Qi is not a fool.

172
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,420
Are you certain he'll come?

173
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,300
He wasn't afraid
of breaking into your residence.

174
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,100
He'll come anyway

175
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,940
as long as he can kill you

176
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,860
despite knowing it's a trap.

177
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,300
Now

178
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,980
you should open a window.

179
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,780
Your noodles are here.

180
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,180
I heard Minister Fu's concubines

181
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,780
either died or lost their minds.

182
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,460
But look at him.

183
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,430
He went to the House of Sanhe
the moment he had time.

184
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,830
I can't believe he dares to come out.

185
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,070
I thought someone wanted to kill him.

186
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,350
But he's the imperial court's minister.

187
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,670
No one would dare to kill him.

188
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,070
I do.

189
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,220
I'm the one who wants
to kill Minister Fu.

190
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,000
(House of Sanhe)

191
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,260
Is he coming or not?

192
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,460
We're waiting for a killer.

193
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,220
It'll be fortunate if he doesn't come.

194
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:30,980
I'll leave things to you now!

195
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,500
Get ready now.

196
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:53,630
Sir.

197
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,350
Sir, we're over here.

198
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,670
Over here, Sir.

199
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,540
Be careful.

200
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,590
Watch your step, Sir.

201
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,590
Sir, let me help you.

202
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:07,830
Hurry.

203
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,390
Quickly now.

204
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,910
Get in.

205
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,180
Close the door. Let's go.

206
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,530
(Splendid Beauty, Jifang Garden)

207
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:56,910
Red Sleeve Blade?

208
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,870
You're Su Mengzhen?

209
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,430
If I'm not Su Mengzhen,

210
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,700
how can I hold you down in one move?

211
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,260
You should've finished your move

212
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,700
in one go just now.

213
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,500
I never resort to sneaky attacks.

214
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,630
How rare.

215
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,780
In this world,
anyone who fights you face to face

216
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,070
is considered a man of noble character.

217
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,500
Most people
prefer attacking behind the back.

218
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:25,110
Some don't even need
to do it themselves.

219
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,350
Am I right,

220
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,390
brother-in-law?

221
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,150
It would be even better to subdue you

222
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,430
without any fighting.

223
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,110
You've already killed me once.

224
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,260
But I let you live once too.

225
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,070
If you're willing
to go back into the well,

226
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,540
I can let you live again.

227
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,870
He won't.

228
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,150
He'll kill you for sure.

229
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,780
After spending eight years in the well,

230
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,500
there are many talented people
in the martial arts world.

231
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,590
Brother-in-law,

232
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,430
you're old now.

233
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,670
I'm afraid you have no say now.

234
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,390
It doesn't matter if I don't have a say.

235
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,150
Your fate has been decided today.

236
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:20,070
Wang Xiaoshi, did you hear that?

237
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,980
I'll kill anyone

238
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,940
I can.

239
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,430
I'm not the only one

240
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,180
who follows this principle.

241
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:30,910
I don't talk nonsense

242
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,110
in a fight.

243
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,070
Zhu Xiaoyao is one of yours, right?

244
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,500
What's the meaning of this?

245
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,310
What's your intention?

246
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,310
You saved Guan Qi again and again.

247
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,350
Are you waiting for him to turn around

248
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:18,740
and kill every one of us?

249
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,740
Listen.

250
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,350
There are no heroes
who die a tragic death

251
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,780
or unfortunate good men in this world.

252
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,350
Dispatch the men!

253
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,180
Search Guan Qi and Zhu Xiaoyao
all over the Capital.

254
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,670
Did you instruct

255
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:36,980
Zhu Xiaoyao to take Guan Qi away?

256
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:45,900
(Splendid Beauty)

257
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,420
(The House of Sunset Drizzle)

258
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:06,140
(Apothecary)

259
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:28,980
Zhu Xiaoyao went missing with Guan Qi?

260
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,380
Our hard work

261
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,110
was for nothing.

262
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,140
They say a person lives

263
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,460
for 30,000 days.

264
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:46,140
There are some nights
you don't wish to go through.

265
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,220
Zhu Xiaoyao has worked for you
for many years.

266
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,030
Haven't you found out her identity?

267
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,740
I know she was a member
of the Mitian Sect.

268
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,110
But I had no idea

269
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,270
she's still loyal to Guan Qi
after all these years.

270
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,460
When someone works for you for so long,

271
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,980
it doesn't matter

272
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,590
what kind of past she had.

273
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,590
If she had bad intentions
all these years,

274
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:25,790
Red Sleeve Blade wouldn't exist
in the martial arts world.

275
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,030
At first,

276
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,140
I thought she could stop

277
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,870
Lei Sun from killing Guan Qi.

278
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,790
Yet, Guan Qi escaped because of this.

279
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,940
It was my fault.

280
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,140
Try this one.

281
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,980
They're freshly picked.

282
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:58,630
Not bad.

283
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,350
Xiaoyao.

284
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,270
Did you buy the medicinal herbs?

285
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:49,940
Yes.

286
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:54,350
I bought cogon grass
and cypress leaves separately.

287
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,030
I also bought medicinal powder
to stop bleeding.

288
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,420
Is he still unconscious?

289
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,660
I'm not worried
about his external injuries.

290
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,790
But Guan Qi would have died

291
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,460
from Di Feijing's palm strike

292
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,940
if he wasn't highly skilled
in martial arts.

293
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,660
Xiaoyao, you must be tired
from watching him all night.

294
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,180
Why don't you get some rest?

295
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,070
I'll take care of him.

296
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,380
All right.

297
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,740
If you were not mad

298
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:51,900
or a killer,

299
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:54,980
would my life

300
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,630
be different?

301
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:46,990
Shuang,

302
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,110
you've been with me
about seven to eight years, right?

303
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,510
That wasn't long.

304
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,950
I planned to stay with you all my life.

305
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,470
When a boy grows up,

306
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,990
he can't grow up among women.

307
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,510
The martial arts world is vast.

308
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,470
The House of Sanhe isn't a place

309
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,340
for you to settle down.

310
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,910
Now that your father has returned.

311
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,660
I want to send both of you far away.

312
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,260
If it weren't for you,

313
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,110
I wouldn't have lived until today.

314
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,660
If I leave at this moment,

315
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,590
I'll never hold my head high.

316
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,300
I didn't have a home in the first place.

317
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:39,110
If it weren't for that man in the room,

318
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,740
I wouldn't have lived until today too.

319
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,630
You filthy little thing,

320
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:52,470
I've experienced this too.

321
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,300
When the customers see you cry,

322
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,950
they'll feel sorry for you.

323
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,220
My dear,

324
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,740
come to me.

325
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,860
Leave if you want to live.

326
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,780
(For a long time,)

327
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,510
(I feel like a nobody.)

328
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,300
(That day)

329
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,470
(was the only time)

330
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,260
(someone gave me the hope.)

331
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,780
(So even if violent killings
and dangerous situations)

332
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,430
(followed wherever he went,)

333
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,630
(I was willing to stay by his side.)

334
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,740
Why did you stop?

335
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:24,860
My feet are cold and painful.

336
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,860
You must never betray me
if you stay with me.

337
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,030
Understand?

338
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,220
I'll never betray you.

339
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,860
I saved him

340
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,510
and raised you

341
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,550
because of this past.

342
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,990
But I'm not only indebted
to your father.

343
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,860
I'm also indebted to Mr. Su.

344
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,820
I kept thinking

345
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,140
if I had to repay them one day,

346
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:06,340
I could only give them my life.

347
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,630
That's why I always say

348
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,700
that life is short and bitter.

349
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,860
It's more important
to find leisure in life.

350
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,390
None of the men we dispatched last night

351
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,820
found Zhu Xiaoyao's trail.

352
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,510
As far as I know about Zhu Xiaoyao,

353
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,260
she may be hiding

354
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,030
in these several locations.

355
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:39,070
Zhu Xiaoyao is a spy and meticulous.

356
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,860
Would she hide in the places

357
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,070
you could think of?

358
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,590
She doesn't know

359
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,390
what I know.

360
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,390
I have all the information

361
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,180
about the House's spies.

362
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:57,260
I'll hand over Lawless to you.

363
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:57,520
(Lawless)

364
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,070
We must take his life
while he's injured.

365
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,110
If we wait until Guan Qi has recovered,

366
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,700
no one can subdue him anymore.

367
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,990
So we must find him as soon as possible.

368
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,660
But the Capital is huge.

369
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,860
I'm afraid it'll take forever.

370
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,070
But we still need to find them.

371
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:24,070
We'll try to alert them.

372
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,140
We'll search these places

373
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,740
and let her know on purpose.

374
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:28,780
If we do this,

375
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,860
she'll rush to send Guan Qi
out of the Capital.

376
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,740
It's inconvenient for Guan Qi
to move around with his injuries.

377
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,590
They might leave the Capital
in a carriage.

378
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:39,140
(Maxing Street)
The gate is what we must guard.

379
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:39,710
(Maxing Street)

380
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:52,040
(Yiji Inn)

381
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,230
(Clouds of Visitors)

382
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,340
Is Madam all right?

383
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,390
She's in her room.

384
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,140
I lit a calming incense for her.

385
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,470
I hope she can sleep well.

386
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:02,110
Yellow, you want to avenge
Mr. Wo's death too, right?

387
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:03,700
I'm useless.

388
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:08,630
I don't even know
where the person who killed Mr. Wo is.

389
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,220
I have an idea.

390
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,070
What is it?

391
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,660
Yellow, let's go.

392
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,650
(House of Sanhe)

393
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,630
Yellow, hurry!

394
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:47,780
Yellow.

395
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,550
Yellow?

396
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,300
Come here.

397
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,820
Can we really find Guan Qi

398
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,070
with this method?

399
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,910
Bai is leading the men
to search for them.

400
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,140
I suddenly thought of this method.

401
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:02,510
So I wanted to give it a try.

402
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,180
If we can find Guan Qi,

403
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,070
I'll end this matter myself.

404
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,860
Yellow, let's go.

405
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:16,820
I know I can't stop you from going.

406
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,740
But I'm really scared.

407
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,510
All of you can't even defeat Guan Qi.

408
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,430
If you meet him alone...

409
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,590
I was the one who released Guan Qi.

410
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,070
He killed Mr. Wo

411
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:29,780
and so many people.

412
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:30,990
If I don't seek revenge,

413
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,550
it'll be hard for me

414
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,430
to live after this.

415
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,340
I understand.

416
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,510
But you must promise me

417
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:39,390
that you'll come back.

418
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,630
I promise.

419
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:49,990
I'll come back.

420
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:56,910
