(A bond broken up by storms, the returning

32
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,959
I'm sure you're not just here

33
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,719
to reminisce

34
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,959
about our past ties.

35
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,120
I'm here

36
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,439
to ask you for a favor.

37
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,960
I wish to save Bai Choufei,

38
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:14,360
and I need your favor to save him.

39
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,199
I expected you to do so.

40
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,759
Last night, I told Mo to tell you

41
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,639
about the pathetic state he is in.

42
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,879
And now,

43
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,759
you're here to beg me.

44
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,159
Wang Xiaoshi has fled to an unknown place.

45
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,120
We don't know if he's alive or dead.

46
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:34,560
Bai Choufei is suffering in the dungeon.

47
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,639
It's my responsibility to take care of them.

48
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,159
I came here

49
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,400
because I truly had no other choices.

50
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,039
What makes you think that I will help you out?

51
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,479
So what if Xiaoshi is missing

52
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,120
and Choufei is imprisoned?

53
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,120
What would that have to do with me,

54
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,159
House Master Su?

55
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,400
We're no longer related to each other.

56
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,199
The life and death of your brothers

57
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,520
are none of my concern.

58
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,080
Do you wish to save your brother that badly?

59
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,479
Let's make a deal then.

60
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,080
Once the deal is done,

61
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,159
you'll turn into the person you hate the most.

62
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:34,680
All right.

63
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,840
What do you want?

64
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,639
What can you give me?

65
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,080
Your father,

66
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,199
he once wanted to take over
the House of Sunset Drizzle.

67
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,479
I can give it to you.

68
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:00,080
Do you think I would care about that?

69
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,919
Now that I think about it,

70
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,520
you did nothing for me

71
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,599
in the past.

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,759
You didn't even apologize to me

73
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,319
when you killed my father personally.

74
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:22,879
What's the matter?

75
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,839
Are you not used to it when
I'm bringing up old scores with you?

76
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,439
When we were still together in the past,

77
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,639
all of those meant nothing to me.

78
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,079
Now that we're unrelated to each other,

79
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,199
I have to bring up every old score I can find!

80
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:44,839
Back then, you saved me from the Mitian Sect.

81
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,519
And I had loved you for so many years.

82
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:50,319
Today,

83
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,639
I'll return everything to you.

84
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,519
From now on,

85
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,120
you and I

86
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,439
are even!

87
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,759
You can do anything to me

88
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,800
if it makes you feel better.

89
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,839
But please don't hurt yourself.

90
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,160
Su Mengzhen!

91
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,199
I hate you!

92
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:51,800
I've loved you for so many years!

93
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:55,279
You killed my father with your own hands!

94
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,720
Look at the state I'm in!

95
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,439
Even now, you still want me to help you out!

96
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,879
It was you!

97
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,240
You were the one who ruined our hope!

98
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,120
Let go of me! Don't touch me!

99
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,800
Let go of me!

100
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,480
Chun,

101
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,120
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,399
I'm sorry.

103
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,319
Mengzhen?

104
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,399
Mengzhen!

105
00:07:18,386 --> 00:07:23,677
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

106
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,199
Sir!

107
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,279
Come and help us out!

108
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,879
Sir, come.

109
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,319
Prepare some hot water,

110
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,120
peanuts, lilies, and stemona tuberosa.

111
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,959
Take good care of your House Master.

112
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,879
All right. Understood.

113
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:36,879
Sir.

114
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,120
All right. You may leave now.

115
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,159
Where did you gather the courage to see her?

116
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,879
You knew that she hated you to the core.

117
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,879
I thought you were bleeding

118
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,120
because she stabbed you.

119
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,679
If that could reduce her hatred for me,

120
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:03,320
I would rather she had stabbed me.

121
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,919
When you accumulate
too much hatred in your heart,

122
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:09,039
you'll suffer a breakdown eventually.

123
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,159
When your father was still around,

124
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,720
whenever he encountered a difficult situation,

125
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,440
he would light a lamp

126
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,200
and drink throughout the entire night.

127
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:43,679
Di.

128
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:49,159
Say, what do you think is the hardest thing

129
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,039
about sitting in this position?

130
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:54,039
It's to find a reason.

131
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,679
The Six Half Hall was the culmination
of your father's blood, sweat, and tears

132
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,919
for several decades.

133
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,720
Protecting Six Half Hall

134
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,399
was the reason that kept him going for so long.

135
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,000
What about you?

136
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,159
What's your reason?

137
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,159
It's hatred.

138
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:14,639
Chun,

139
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:17,200
I know you wish to avenge your father.

140
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,000
However, if you keep harboring hatred

141
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:21,559
inside your heart and acting ruthlessly,

142
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,440
you'll suffer a breakdown eventually.

143
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,080
You don't need to shoulder
so many burdens by yourself.

144
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:27,440
At least,

145
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,879
I'm still here.

146
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,679
I can do the things
you want to do on your behalf.

147
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,200
If you wish to kill someone,

148
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,919
I'll kill them for you.

149
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,320
Di, killing someone isn't that hard.

150
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,120
I've killed plenty of people when I was in Pili Sect.

151
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:49,840
All of them dropped dead
after one blow to the head.

152
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:56,559
Chun, you're drunk.

153
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,919
I'm not drunk.

154
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,000
Di,

155
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,679
I know how kind you are toward me.

156
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,559
I know you're willing to kill someone for me

157
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,519
and protect me for the rest of my life.

158
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,080
However,

159
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,279
no one can stay protected
for the rest of the life.

160
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,840
If one day,

161
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,799
I'm forced to a dead corner,

162
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:36,120
(when no help is available,)

163
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,159
(and when I don't even know
if I can survive the ordeal,)

164
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,919
no one can protect me!

165
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,320
And that includes you!

166
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,320
So, you cannot ask me to let go of my hatred.

167
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,159
(I have something)

168
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,840
(to confirm with you.)

169
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,840
During the battle of Shili Pavilion,

170
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,679
I kept Chun and Miss Wen

171
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,159
inside the branch.

172
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,759
However, someone assaulted the branch

173
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,200
and killed everyone.

174
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,919
You were the one who saved them.

175
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:36,759
I need to know

176
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,000
what happened that night.

177
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,919
When I was there,

178
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,679
(Miss Lei and Wen Rou)

179
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,759
(were attacked by a masked man.)

180
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,919
(I don't know the details,)

181
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,960
but Wen Rou said they were fine

182
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:53,200
when I asked her about it.

183
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,639
A masked man?

184
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,639
It was a white mask.

185
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,039
I couldn't see his face,

186
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:04,240
but his aura felt familiar.

187
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,200
Who are you?

188
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,559
I'm Bai Gaotang.

189
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:38,639
I'm your new cellmate.

190
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,480
From today onward,

191
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,559
we'll be buddies.

192
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,399
Buddy,

193
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,559
you look like a decent person.

194
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:56,080
What crime have you committed?

195
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:58,759
I didn't commit any crime.

196
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:01,759
I came here of my own accord.

197
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,600
Interesting.

198
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,039
Don't you know what place this is?

199
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,480
It's easy to enter, but impossible to get out.

200
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:15,759
I've seen people
seeking wealth, fame, and fortune.

201
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:17,919
But this is my first time seeing a person

202
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,600
seeking death for fun.

203
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:21,879
This is interesting.

204
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:28,519
Take a guess

205
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,600
at why I'm here.

206
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,840
Don't look down on me.

207
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,679
We have the same surname.

208
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,720
We came from
the same family 500 years ago.

209
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,879
Now that I'm here,

210
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:48,480
I don't know when I'll be able to get out.

211
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:49,639
From now on,

212
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,080
we have to depend on each other.

213
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,360
That's right.

214
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,000
You're the only living person

215
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,960
who can talk to me.

216
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,399
Precisely.

217
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:09,799
We're helping each other out.

218
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,120
Tell me then.

219
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:16,600
Why were you imprisoned?

220
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:17,720
Me?

221
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,960
Back then, my brothers and I
came to the Capital

222
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:32,240
to make a name for ourselves.

223
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,159
However, the Capital is a rough place.

224
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,080
Half a century has passed,

225
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,440
and I've obtained some fame and fortune.

226
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,679
However, they come

227
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:48,080
and go quickly.

228
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,600
Now that I'm an old man,

229
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,120
I have nothing left.

230
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,679
It's just

231
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,600
that I'm still unwilling
to surrender the drive

232
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,399
I have when I was young.

233
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:02,960
I was planning

234
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,640
to do something huge.

235
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,880
Skilled martial artists do react differently

236
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,559
after they finish the medicine.

237
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,520
(Juwen House, Bianjing Baked Cake)

238
00:17:24,593 --> 00:17:26,439
(Romance and Pleasure)

239
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,320
(House of Sanhe)

240
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,880
Great!

241
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,240
Hello, Miss Xiaoyao.

242
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,079
Hello, Jing.

243
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,319
Miss Xiaoyao.

244
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:53,720
Shuang.

245
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,359
Hello, Miss.

246
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,519
Xiaoyao, what's the matter?

247
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,799
Today might be a little chaotic.

248
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:03,880
We should stay on our guard.

249
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:18,200
Greetings, Mr. Su.

250
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,480
You're no longer
a part of the Sunset Drizzle.

251
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,519
You're my friend now.

252
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,359
You may drop
the formalities from now on.

253
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:26,240
Thank you, Mr. Su.

254
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,720
Judging from your state,

255
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,039
I assume something
must have happened on your way here.

256
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,519
Lately, it seems like the Six Half Hall

257
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:38,440
is regaining its strength.

258
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,519
They've been very active lately.

259
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:42,079
They even found me today.

260
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,920
Although Lei Sun is dead,

261
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,519
Lei Chun has inherited her position.

262
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:48,319
Not just that, Chancellor Cai
took her as his foster daughter.

263
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,720
Jiangnan's Pili Sect
is supporting them too.

264
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,240
The current Six Half Hall

265
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,480
will recover its strength soon.

266
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,440
I've heard from the other Keepers

267
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,400
that many of our hidden branches

268
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,480
were exposed

269
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,559
and attacked.

270
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,759
Seems like Lei Chun

271
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,640
is more ruthless

272
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:09,400
than her father, Lei Sun.

273
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:19,119
Ask those who are hiding
to maintain their positions.

274
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,160
No matter what
the Six Half Hall is up to,

275
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,400
and no matter if they want to
take over our territory or businesses,

276
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:25,599
just let them do it.

277
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,480
We only have

278
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,880
one priority right now.

279
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:32,599
That is to gather all of our strength

280
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,119
and save Bai Choufei.

281
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:38,720
Of course, we will save him.

282
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,680
However, if we try to save him right now,

283
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,759
no matter what we do,

284
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:43,920
the House of Sunset Drizzle
will be implicated somehow.

285
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,000
If that's the case,

286
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,440
Youqiao Group will use this reason

287
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,119
to suppress us.

288
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,160
If that happens,

289
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,119
Bai Choufei's effort would be in vain.

290
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:55,319
We have plenty of ways to save Choufei.

291
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,480
For example,

292
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:01,480
if someone dies,

293
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:03,759
he will be free forever.

294
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,160
That is a good idea.

295
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,839
I'll handle that.

296
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,200
Xiaoyao, you're no longer a part of us.

297
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,680
You don't need to do this.

298
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,799
Although I'm no longer
a part of the House,

299
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,279
I'm your friend, right?

Little Rock, look.

328
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:23,480
I've set up a tent

329
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:25,759
near a water source
on the leeward side of the hill.

330
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,240
The campfire is ready too.

331
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,240

00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:34,480
Come, Little Savage.

337
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,440
Time to eat.

338
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:40,680
Here.

339
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,319
Actually,

340
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,880
I don't think this is tough at all.

341
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,599
You see.

342
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:52,400
We're near a water source,

343
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,240
and the trees can block the rain for us.

344
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:56,880
This will be the way
we live from now on.

345
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,000
I'm already used to it.

346
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,680
I'm sure it'll get better.

347
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:11,920
What is this?

348
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,440
This is rosin.

349
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:14,759
It's a great ingredient.

350
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,319
Not only can it be used in medicine,

351
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,720
but we can also store it
as rosin powder by grinding it.

352
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:21,240
If you encounter any wild beasts here,

353
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,640
just throw some
rosin powder into the fire.

354
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,200
It'll generate a spark and scare them away.

355
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,359
It's that amazing?

356
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,039
Don't throw it now.

357
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,119
I'll run away if you do so.

358
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,640
Are you a wild beast?

359
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,480
Buddy, I guess we can't get out this time.

360
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,480
It is difficult.

361
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,200
The heroes roam the Capital

362
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,000
while those who were detested
die inside prisons.

363
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,480
To some, there's only a fine line

364
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,599
between a hero and a detested person.

365
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:24,519
If you take one right step,
you'll reach the sky immediately.

366
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,359
If you take one wrong step,

367
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,200
you'll be detested forever.

368
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:34,240
That's why we need to grab hold
of every opportunity we can get.

369
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:38,640
Let not golden chalices
mirror the moon without spirits.

370
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,759
Judging from what you said,

371
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:46,720
were you given the chance
to be a hero too?

372
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,759
You might not believe me.

373
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:54,240
If 20 years ago,

374
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,880
I had cherished the opportunity
and made a name for myself,

375
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,480
I would've got you out of this dungeon

376
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,200
with just one word.

377
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:05,000
There were other chances

378
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:06,759
after you missed out on that chance.

379
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,400
We have plenty of chances in life.

380
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,880
When you're as old as me,
you'll understand

381
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:17,240
that luck is a type of skill too.

382
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,079
Luck plays a huge factor in your decisions too.

383
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:23,039
If you don't cherish
your chance while you have it,

384
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,480
when you run out of luck,

385
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:29,440
it's useless no matter
how capable you are.

386
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,240
Vice House Master Bai,

387
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:44,599
please.

388
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,119
Buddy, this time,
there's truly no way out.

389
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,720
- Chancellor.
- Chancellor.

390
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,480
Have some food.

391
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,680
Chancellor, I didn't expect you
to come to a lowly place like this.

392
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,720
And,

393
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,119
the liquor is terrible.

394
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,519
These are what I usually eat.

395
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,240
It's my routine.

396
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,920
We eat three meals per day.

397
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:45,079
We eat and we sleep. That's what we do.

398
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:46,880
There's nothing special about it.

399
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,960
So, Chancellor,
what's your concern then?

400
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:53,960
To kill and cause chaos in the martial
arts world with a raise of your hand?

401
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:57,559
When you reach my position,

402
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,000
determining one's life or death
will be a common thing.

403
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,039
It won't even bother you by then.

404
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:04,519
So, Chancellor, to you,

405
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,960
determining one's life or death is common.

406
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:09,720
You've been roaming
the martial arts world for many years.

407
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:12,799
I suppose you have your fair share of kills.

408
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,440
However, you don't know
their names at all.

409
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,839
You kill them

410
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,559
like how you kill ants.

411
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:22,799
To me,

412
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,920
most people in the world

413
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:26,960
are just like ants.

414
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,799
Naturally, determining the life or death of an ant

415
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,559
is common to me.

416
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:36,640
Let me ask you something.

417
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:39,279
Do you have companions?

418
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,599
Chancellor, you must be joking.

419
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,119
I'm only here because of

420
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:46,920
my companions.

421
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,400
You mean Wang Xiaoshi and Su Mengzhen?

422
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,559
They're not your companions.

423
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,599
That's right.

424
00:27:58,359 --> 00:27:59,480
They're my brothers.

425
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,480
The Greatest Swordsman.

426
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,599
He's the hero of all heroes.

427
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,079
However, do you know

428
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:11,759
why Su Mengzhen

429
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,720
became famous?

430
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,400
Actually, the Su family
is renowned in the martial arts world.

431
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,240
When Su Zhemu took over the family,

432
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,720
he established the House of Sunset Drizzle.

433
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,559
He managed it in the Capital for 50 years.

434
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,880
He had friends all over the world.

435
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,119
Since young, the Red-Sleeved Nun

436
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:35,039
took Su Mengzhen as her disciple.

437
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:37,640
As for the Red Sleeve Blade,

438
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:39,880
the name only appeared

439
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:43,359
after the Su family managed
the sect for several generations.

440
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,359
Let's talk about Lei Sun.

441
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:49,960
He came to the Capital alone

442
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:51,720
and established the Six Half Hall.

443
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,079
However, behind him was the support of Pili Sect,

444
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,799
which is a well-established sect

445
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,480
since 100 years ago.

446
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,599
Let's talk about
your sworn brother Wang Xiaoshi.

447
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,359
He has a famous master.

448
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,119
His master and martial uncles,

449
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,039
all of them are renowned figures.

450
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,480
If you want to succeed

451
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,200
and stand at the top of the martial arts world,

452
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:24,960
you'll never be able to do it alone.

453
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:30,240
You need the help of families
and influential figures.

454
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:33,000
That influence could only
be accumulated through generations

455
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,559
of hard work and efforts.

456
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
That influence itself

457
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,440
was the vein and artery
that formed the martial arts world.

458
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,599
One can only possess unlimited strength

459
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,920
if they amass huge wealth and power

460
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:49,160
and direct them to a single individual.

461
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,799
It's the same
for Su Mengzhen and Lei Sun.

462
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,000
It's the same for Wang Xiaoshi too.
If so, what gives you the right

463
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:57,279
to be their companion?

464
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,359
I heard people saying

465
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,119
that Bai Choufei

466
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,519
had great aspirations

467
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,079
to reach the sky.

468
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,240
You're just a wanderer,
and you wandered to the Capital.

469
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,119
Where do you think you can reach

470
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:18,480
with your abilities alone?

471
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,599
Choufei,

472
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,680
your fate was decided
when you adopted that name.

473
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Your fate

474
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,079
has already been decided

475
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,880
when you were born.

476
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,720
If so, Chancellor,

477
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:03,920
where did you come from?

478
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,279
Me?

479
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,279
I was born in a small village in Fujian Province.

480
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,400
It is a poor village.

481
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,640
Luckily,

482
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,680
the camellia trees on the hill

483
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,279
bloomed quite often.

484
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,079
At first,

485
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,160
I wanted to rule the world
with my head held high.

486
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,400
However,

487
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:53,519
I had no choice
but to hide under the dirt.

488
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:58,119
I have great aspirations
that could reach the sky.

489
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:00,960
However,

490
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,279
I had no choice but to
wait for my opportunities to come.

491
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,440
I have lofty ambitions to conquer the world.

492
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:18,079
I'm just afraid I might end up as a
laughing stock for the next millennium.

493
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:25,839
A laughing stock
for the next millennium.

494
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:32,359
Wen Rou!

495
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:33,599
Wen Rou, wake up!

496
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:34,839
What's the matter?

497
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:35,960
The soldiers are coming! We have to go!

498
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:37,200
Come!

499
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,599
Marquis, they're not here.

500
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,039

501
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:22,960
Yes, Marquis!

502
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,119
I'll cover your back.
You should try and escape.

503
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,079
No, I don't want to be apart from you.

504
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,280
If you want to die, we'll die together.

505
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,960
I'm so envious.

506
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,639
I promise

507
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:56,559
I won't let you two

508
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:59,320
die together.

509
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:00,280
Take them down!

510
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:24,599
Come at me if you dare.

511
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:25,840
Don't hurt her.

512
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,519
Of course, Wen Rou will be fine.

513
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,199
Do you guys want to die?

514
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,760
Hurry and help Miss Wen up.

515
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:34,840
Just don't let her cause trouble.

516
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,519
Wait.

517
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,480
This is my prey.

518
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,320
You guys have no right to touch him.

519
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:52,320
So, did your foster father
assign you a new job?

520
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:53,719
Are you one of the guards now?

521
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,199
I'm grateful enough
that he assigned a job to me.

522
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,559
The Blood River Sword?

523
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:09,239
I've always been curious about

524
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,960
which sword is stronger.
Is it my Blood River Sword?

525
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:14,079
Or is it your Retainment?

526
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:16,199
Seems like we can finally

527
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,199
find out the result today.

528
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:38,960
I'm here as a guard and a messenger.

529
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,559
I have a message for you.

530
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:42,960
Aren't you concerned about

531
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,280
what happened to the House
after your departure?

532
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,039
Little Rock!

533
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:08,320
Your terminally ill brother

534
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:09,639
suffered from several shocks.

535
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:11,480
I guess he'll die soon.

536
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:13,519
And your second brother, Bai Choufei,

537
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,599
is in the hands of Chancellor Cai now.

538
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,280
But don't worry.

539
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,559
Lei Chun and I

540
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
have recommended
Bai Choufei to the Chancellor.

541
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,840
He won't die.

542
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,280
But I'm just afraid

543
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,840
that the prouder he is, the more he'll suffer.

544
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,800
Despicable scum.

545
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:55,000
Are you the person I met at Pobanmen?

546
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:03,280
That's not the only place
we'd met each other before.

547
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:19,599
Fang Yingkan!

548
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:22,960
Don't worry.

549
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,079
I'll take care of Wen Rou.

550
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Now,

551
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,000
you may rest in peace.

552
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,599
Someone is waiting for you in the underworld.

553
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:52,559
I'll send you to them right now.

554
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:00,079
Little Rock!

555
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,159
Little Rock!

556
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,079
Little Rock!

557
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:37,719
Little Rock!

558
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,679
Little Rock!

559
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,679
