00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,760
Say less.

36
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,680
It is meaningless to say any more.

37
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,879
The most important thing right now

38
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,520
is to kill Su Mengzhen.

39
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,199
Tell Lei Hen to take care of him.

40
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,520
Yes.

41
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,080
Wonderful.

42
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:36,000
Great.

43
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,560
The Red Sleeve Blade
cuts at the speed of light.

the target was Su Mengzhen,

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,479

(Monk Huayi, Six Half Hall)

51
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,199
just as I would for any other lives.

52
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,840
It is unbecoming of a monk

53
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,560
to be greedy.

54
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,800
It is unnatural for an old lady to kill

55
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,280
as well.

56
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:10,000
Charging money
for doing work for the Hall?

57
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,120
I can't believe both of you.

58
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,840
Amitabha.

59
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,240

00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,439

61
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,520
this battle.

62
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,800
Failure is not an option.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,680
See to it that Su Mengzhen
meets his demise.

64
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:34,759
Yes!

65
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,360
Are you the messenger from Baixu Garden?

66
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,080
I am.

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,800
Please come up.

68
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,360
If you seek the holder
of the Red Sleeve Blade,

69
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,560
you have found him.

70
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:10,000
I am Su Mengzhen.

71
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:26,920
He didn't look surprised
by the mention of your name at all.

72
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,399
My master, Recluse Tianyi,
asked me to deliver this to you.

73
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,399
Thank you for making the trip.

74
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,439
You're an interesting young man.

75
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,720
Many in the martial arts world

76
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,360
would be flabbergasted

77
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,360
at the mention of the name Su Mengzhen.

78
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,120
But you didn't seem

79
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,839
to be taken aback at all.

80
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,600
My name is Wang Xiaoshi.

81
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:52,800
Does that surprise you?

82
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,839
The successor
of Baixu Garden is interesting indeed.

83
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,600
Indeed.

84
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,800
Indeed.

85
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:29,920
Thank you, young man.

86
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,079
We shall bid farewell for now.

87
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,680
If you ever find yourself
in the Capital,

88
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:34,800
you can tell them

89
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,560
that you are a friend of Su Mengzhen.

90
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:39,920
It is good to make friends

91
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,199
in the martial arts world.

92
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:42,680
From now on,

93
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,680
you are my friends as well.

94
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:46,879
All right.

95
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,199
Farewell.

96
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,800
Let's go.

97
00:06:11,325 --> 00:06:13,325
(Yang)

98
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,480
W... Why are you making promises again?

99
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,959
You just met each other.

100
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:20,959
What... Why...

101
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:23,079
How did he become your friend?

102
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,759
Sometimes,
there are people in this world

103
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,759
that you just know
you are meant to befriend.

104
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:43,759
My lady,

105
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,560
(Mo, Six Half Hall)
we didn't manage to get the box.

106
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:47,000
(Mo, Six Half Hall)
What are we going to tell them?

107
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,759
Father said as long as we got the box,

108
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,920
the Six Half Hall
and the House of Sunset Drizzle

109
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,560
would be able
to discuss things in a civil manner,

110
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,560
without the need to draw swords.

111
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:02,120
But since he went back on his words,

112
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,360
there's no need
for me to get the box.

113
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,519
I'm afraid you'll be punished

114
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,160
by the Hall for doing so, my lady.

115
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,720
So what?

116
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:13,920
I would endure anything

117
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,480
for that person.

118
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,200
(Yang)

119
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,680
Do you reckon
those are our  enemies or friends?

120
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,040
You're the advisor. You make a guess.

121
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,519
Is your archer here?

122
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,040
No. He went elsewhere.

123
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,040
What a bad timing.

124
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,639
It's Gu Dong.

125
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,879
(Yang)

126
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:25,319
Mr. Su. Mr. Yang.

127
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:28,920
Gu Dong.

128
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,399
Why are you here?

129
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,279
As per House Master's orders,

130
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,240
I have come
to escort you to the Capital.

131
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,480
On the House Master's orders?

132
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,320
I shall trouble you then.

133
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,320
Tension is high in the Capital.

134
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:56,600
I'm sure you must've received the news

135
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,120
on your way here.

136
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,000
What do you plan to do next, Mr. Su?

137
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:02,759
Pay a visit to the House Master

138
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,519
and eliminate the disloyal.

139
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,559
Very well.

140
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,960
I have come

141
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,360
to assist you in disposing

142
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,240
of all disloyal members
of the House, Mr. Su.

143
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,480
You think there are traitors
among us as well?

144
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,600
Yes.

145
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,399
I have already been
investigating the matter in secret.

146
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:24,879
I have the list of traitors right here.

147
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,360
Should we help them?

148
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,399
Not for now.

149
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:28,480
He is Su Mengzhen, after all.

150
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,320
Pity.

151
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,240
I am one of them as well.

152
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,320
I cannot betray my men.

153
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:45,080
So I'm afraid your life
will have to end here, Mr. Su.

154
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,720
The Six Half Hall has twelve Elders.

155
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:54,120
Wuxie, how many are here?

156
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:58,960
The monk to the east
is the Eighth Elder, Monk Huayi.

157
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,360
The old lady to the west
is the Seventh Elder,

158
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:06,879
Madam Dou of Mount Qilian.

159
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:09,759
This formation

160
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,240
appears to be the doing
of the Fourth Elder, Lei Hen.

161
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,240
I wonder if he is here as well.

162
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,600
The Four Elders.

163
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,639
All of them are tough fighters.

164
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,000
Gu Dong,

165
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:23,759
what is your identity then?

166
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:26,440
The Ninth Elder
of the Six Half Hall, Gu Dong.

167
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,039
I've been meaning to have a duel
with you, Su Mengzhen,

168
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,679
the greatest red-sleeved swordsman.

169
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,799
All right.
I'll grant you this opportunity.

170
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,480
The House of Sunset Drizzle

171
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,320
shall purge our sect of all traitorous.

172
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:44,480
Let's not waste time.

173
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:46,759
Come at me all at once.

174
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,000
Get them!

175
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:21,879
Watch out!

176
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:07,879
Mother!

177
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,000
Mother!

178
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:10,679
Are you all right, Mother?

179
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:11,639
Mother!

180
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:13,759
The dart was poisoned!

181
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,320
It's time for us to help.

182
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,960
No.

183
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:20,480
He can handle it.

184
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,240
Mother...

185
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:38,639
Mother!

186
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,399
You'll pay for this, Su Mengzhen!

187
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:58,159
There is no way out

188
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,759
for both of you.

189
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:05,919
I'll take care
of the archers on the right.

190
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,799
Can you hold off the left?

191
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:11,200
Yes.

192
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:12,759
But I'll die.

193
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,120
It's time for us to curb the violent
and protect the weak.

194
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,759
Protect the weak?

195
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,600
Don't let him hear that.

196
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:18,599
Thank you for helping us.

197
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,000
Thankfully, both of you came back.

198
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,000
Not at all.

199
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,279
Are you all right,

200
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,680
Mengzhen?

201
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,880
He suffered some minor injuries.

202
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,079
Nothing he can't handle.

203
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:29,839
Mr. Su!

204
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:33,880
Your cough must be
the effect of a long-term illness.

205
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,400
I suffer from
about four terminal illnesses

206
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:41,920
and around six
that don't even have names.

207
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:43,559
When all of them
act up at the same time,

208
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,480
they help to keep me awake instead.

209
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:49,759
As long as I'm still awake,

210
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,079
I won't die.

211
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,200
Lei Hen's setup was good.

212
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,880
Ambush, assassins,

213
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,720
and archers.

214
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,480
Wuxie,

215
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,759
you should thank them.

216
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:04,440
If it weren't for them,

217
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:05,839
you would've been dead by now.

218
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,119
I believe you were their target.

219
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:11,440
No one can kill me,

220
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,279
but I can't say the same for you.

221
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,279
Now you've really surprised me.

222
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,519
The two of you
have been kind to lend us a hand.

223
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:24,720
But why did you help me?

224
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,880
To protect the...

225
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,240
One should help
when seeing injustice in one's way.

226
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,160
No need to mention it, Mengzhen.

227
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:35,759
I've met Wang Xiaoshi.

228
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,720
But who are you?

229
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:38,960
I am Bai Choufei.

230
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,720
Bai Choufei

231
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:42,759
and Wang Xiaoshi.

232
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,680
Since both of you decided to help me,

233
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,640
you should come with me.

234
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,759
I want both of you

235
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,519
to come with me to Pobanmen.

236
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,079
Are you still going to their branch?

237
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,960
Gu Dong is dead.

238
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:56,240
Hua Wucuo has yet to make a move.

239
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:58,400
There is no better time than now.

240
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:02,279
The Six Half Hall would go as far
as killing me to help Hua Wucuo.

241
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:05,680
I must have a proper talk with them.

242
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,160
Otherwise, are we supposed
to charge into the Capital

243
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,920
with just the four of us?

244
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,720
But we're not members
of the House of Sunset Drizzle.

245
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:17,119
You weren't,

246
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,759
but you are now.

247
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:23,680
You're right.

248
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:25,079
We are now.

249
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:27,839
What do you mean?

250
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,640
Because our intervention

251
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,880
ruined the Six Half Hall's plan.

252
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:33,279
The only one who dares to challenge them

253
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,279
is the House of Sunset Drizzle.

254
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,079
Enough.

255
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:36,960
Give me the word.

256
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:37,799
Are you coming along or not?

257
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,079
Of course, I will.

258
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:43,720
I will too.

259
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:46,880
But Mengzhen,
your martial sister, Wen Rou...

260
00:21:01,752 --> 00:21:04,611
(Yiji Inn)

261
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:12,519
You've come at last.

262
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,759
This way, please, Miss.

263
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,519
I've been waiting all day for you.

264
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,440
The dishes are all ready.

265
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:20,559
If you had come any later,

266
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,559
they would've gone cold.

267
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:24,440
Who told you to prepare these?

268
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,720
A man with the surname Wang
told us to prepare these.

269
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,480
Please enjoy your meal.

270
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,000
Call me if you need anything.

271
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,359
I guess he still has a heart.

272
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:47,079
The food looks delicious.

273
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:50,160
Wang Xiaoshi knows his stuff.

274
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:53,240
Who are you?

275
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:54,640
How do you know Wang Xiaoshi?

276
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:56,559
It's to be expected
that you don't know me.

277
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:58,440
I've heard your name countless times,

278
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,160
Young Lady of the Wen Family.

279
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,640
My name is Yang Wuxie.

280
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:04,799
Your martial brother
sent me here to protect you.

281
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,759
Mengzhen is here too?

282
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,359
He and your two friends

283
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,680
went to hit the Six Half Hall's branch.

284
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,359
My friends?

285
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:18,640
Impossible.

286
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,640
Who do you think my martial brother is?

287
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,839
As if he would bring
those incompetent men to do that.

288
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,160
Tell me.

289
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,880
Who are you?

290
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,720
What are you after?

291
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,559
"After"?

292
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,400
I told you the truth.
Your martial brother sent me here.

293
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,079
In that case,

294
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,839
tell me about the three of them.

295
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,319
Your martial brother is Su Mengzhen.

296
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,880
They call him
the greatest red-sleeved swordsman.

297
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,799
Isn't that right?

298
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,079
Everyone in the Capital knows that.

299
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:43,200
I was talking about the other two.

300
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:46,960
One of them is Wang Xiaoshi.
He wields the Retainment.

301
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,640
He is handsome and earnest.

302
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,519
He is forthright.

303
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,480
He carries the air of a hero.

304
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,319
The other guy's name is Bai Choufei.

305
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:55,319
He is dressed in white
and good with daggers.

306
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:56,920
He is direct and blunt.

307
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:59,359
I suppose you could call him
good-looking as well.

308
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,279
Who are you fooling?

309
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,519
One is a wild monkey from the mountains,

310
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,880
and the other is a cunning fox
with a sharp tongue.

311
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,279
They don't sound
like anything you described.

312
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,200
Do you think this is my first day
roaming the martial arts world?

313
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,400
You definitely
don't look like a good guy.

314
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,279
I don't look like a good guy?

315
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:18,960
Do you know what they call me?

316
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,079
"The Sincere and Honest."

317
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:23,440
The Yang family

318
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,119
only has one son in each generation.
We only produce good people.

319
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:26,599
The bad is not allowed
to enter the ancestral shrine.

320
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,400
Why won't you believe me?

321
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:30,240
"Sincere and honest"?

322
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,440
Mengzhen, why are you here?

323
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:37,319
Liar!

324
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,880
Greetings, Mr. Su.

325
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,113
(Shi Wukui, House of Sunset Drizzle)

326
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:57,680
Wukui, who are you to me?

327
00:23:58,079 --> 00:23:59,359
I am your most loyal servant.

328
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:01,839
I would die for you if you command it.

329
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,480
I trust you.

330
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,680
But if a person truly cares for another,

331
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,880
they won't wish
to see them die for their sake.

332
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,640
But I am willing to die for you.

333
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:14,799
I would have no regrets.

334
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,599
I want you to be my trusted aide,

335
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,240
not a subject who will die for me.

336
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,319
Remember that.

337
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,599
Yes, sir.

338
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:39,845
(Pobanmen)

339
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,519
Sir, Lei Mei is here.

340
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,400
I'll leave her to you.

341
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,559
Three people from the Six Half Hall

342
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:52,240
remain a mystery to everyone.

343
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,519
First, you have Lei Sun.

344
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,880
No one knows him.

345
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:56,519
Then, you have Di Feijing.

346
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,759
He knows everyone, but no one knows him.

347
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,480
Lastly, Lei Mei.

348
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:02,481
(Lei Mei, Six Half Hall)

349
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:03,960
(Lei Mei, Six Half Hall)
She appears as if she is easy to read.

350
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,599
But you'll come to realize

351
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:06,640
that you will only know

352
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,519
the things she wants you to know.

353
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,319
I would like to meet all of them today.

354
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,880
It's not a good thing
when all three of them gather together.

355
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,039
It makes things more fun, at least.

356
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:18,920
Don't worry.

357
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:21,559
The game has just started.

358
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,240
Di Feijing is waiting for us
at the top of the city wall.

359
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,160
If you have no friends,

360
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,440
go to Di Feijing.

361
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:30,960
He will be your friend.

362
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:32,640
If you have no bosom friend,

363
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,000
turn to Di Feijing.

364
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,160
He will become
your greatest friend for life.

365
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,039
Sounds like a pretty righteous guy.

366
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,279
Don't underestimate him.

367
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,039
The characters of the martial arts world
aren't always who they appear to be.

368
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:49,119
I need someone
to stay here to be the lookout.

369
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,960
You guys decide who it will be.

370
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:56,480
Of the two,

371
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:57,920
it is more dangerous to stay.

372
00:25:58,279 --> 00:25:59,000
I'll stay then.

373
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:04,559
Be careful.

374
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:05,680
Don't worry.

375
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,680
I have matters
to discuss with First Elder Di.

376
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,720
I would prefer not to be disturbed.

377
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:03,960
First Elder Di.

378
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,400
Mr. Su.

379
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,599
Please come up.

380
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,680
If I have you stay here,

381
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:18,599
would you mind?

382
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:19,599
Of course.

383
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,839
If you do, that's all the more reason
for you to stay.

384
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,119
Do you know why?

385
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,240
The Young Master of Sunset Drizzle
is going to see someone

386
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:28,599
from the Six Half Hall.

387
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:30,759
If I went in with you,
I would serve as your foil.

388
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:35,319
From the first moment I saw you,

389
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:37,680
I knew that you would rather die
than allow yourself to act as so.

390
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,519
So my advice for you
to stay is for your sake.

391
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,920
I'm not usually this considerate.

392
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,480
I shall humbly heed your advice then.

393
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,720
Men from the Ministry of Justice.

394
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,480
They've been waiting
to watch a show ensue from our meeting

395
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,160
for a while now.

396
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,039
All of us have eyes and mouths.

397
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,480
Who says they are the only ones
that can enjoy a show?

398
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:41,319
Perhaps we are the spectators.

399
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:43,839
Mr. Su. Please.

400
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,119
You came with your sword.

401
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:59,880
Have you come to kill or to talk?

402
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:02,200
If I came with the intent to kill,

403
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,200
you would not get a chance to speak.

404
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:05,319
You are here to talk then.

405
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,559
In that case,

406
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,079
let us have some tea first.

407
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,759
It looks like Lei Hen couldn't stop
the Red Sleeve Blade, after all.

408
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,160
The greatest red-sleeved swordsman,
Su Mengzhen.

409
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,079
(Fu Zongshu, Minister of Justice)
To try to defeat him with numbers

410
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,160
(Fu Zongshu, Minister of Justice)
is a joke itself.

411
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,079
Why haven't you raised your head?

412
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,279
I injured my neck.

413
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,720
Physician Su from our House
used to be an imperial physician.

414
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,279
Let him take a look at your injury.

415
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:53,119
It's an old injury. It can't be treated.

416
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:56,640
Your physician failed
to cure your cough.

417
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:59,359
It doesn't seem
like he is that good either.

418
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,960
It was my choice.

419
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,279
Between death and cough,

420
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,680
I chose the latter.

421
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,119
It's my fate to hang my head as well.

422
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:11,759
There is always a time
when one must lower their head.

423
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,440
If I have to choose
between this and a cough,

424
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:16,799
I would rather endure this.

425
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,960
I was only away for half a year,

426
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,119
and so many things
have happened in the Capital.

427
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:23,319
Di Feijing,

428
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:27,000
how much was the Six Half Hall
involved in all of this?

429
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:29,640
I, Di Feijing, do not deal underhand.

430
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,720
To be frank with you,

431
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,680
to prevent you
from returning to the Capital,

432
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,960
we mobilized 11 branches.

433
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,440
At the Kushuipu,

434
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:38,119
our Four Elders
combined forces to stop you,

435
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:40,400
but alas,
they were still no match for you.

436
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,640
It is our disgrace.

437
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,160
Then, given your forces,

438
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,440
if the Six Half Hall
truly wishes to defeat me,

439
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:48,240
it will be up to you and Lei Sun
to work together to stop me.

440
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,880
Why not make that battle happen today?

441
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,480
If you don't summon him here now,

442
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,279
I will end your life right here and now.

443
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:05,359
Your life is in my hands.

444
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:07,960
Would you agree?

445
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,720
You are upfront indeed, Mr. Su.

446
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,720
I have the upper hand.

447
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,319
I will state my conditions then.

448
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,440
I'll decide after hearing them.

449
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:26,920
Before I meet the House Master,

450
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,440
the Six Half Hall will abstain from all
internal affairs concerning the House.

451
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:31,680
That can be arranged.

452
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:38,279
Good. When I return to the Capital,

453
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,400
I will have a plaque made

454
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,599
with the words written by myself

455
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,799
to praise your virtue
and have it delivered to your Hall.

456
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:47,000
But Mr. Su...

457
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,359
Do you know in whose hands

458
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:55,559
your life is?

459
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:17,466
(Lei Sun, Six Half Hall)

460
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:15,200
This area is close to the Capital.

461
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,440
It is unwise to let them cause a ruckus.

462
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,766
(Ren Lao and Ren Yuan,
Ministry of Justice)

463
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:19,160
They are fighting down there.

464
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,480
Should we stop them?

465
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:21,480
Don't.

466
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,799
Look at how exciting this is.

467
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:27,240
They're all dogs in the streets.

468
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:28,720
Having these dogs fight one another

469
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:31,720
saves us a lot of troubles.

470
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,920
But at the building across ours

471
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,200
stand some
of the greatest heroes of the era.

472
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:37,240
Heroes?

473
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,000
Who are you calling heroes?

474
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:43,720
No matter how powerful
those martial artists are,

475
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:46,200
they are nothing but ants

476
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,640
in the face of the government.

477
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,144
(Pobanmen)

478
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,599
Good.

479
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,519
I share the sentiment.

480
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:25,480
Much cry and little wool.

481
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,840
I woke up early for nothing.

482
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,119
Let us return.

483
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:31,960
Oh, right.

484
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,960
When we get back,

485
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:36,719
run a background check
on the two men following Su Mengzhen.

486
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:39,239
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

487
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,360
Strange.

488
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,039
Wash your hands and eyes.

489
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,599
You use your hands to kill

490
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:11,519
and your eyes to read.

491
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,280
You need to take good care of both.

492
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,480
Third Elder,

493
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,480
why did you stop?

494
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:33,239
Our higher-ups refused to fight.

495
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,119
It's pointless for us to continue.

496
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:37,760
Goodbye.

497
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:46,880
Sir.

498
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:48,480
The deal is done.

499
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:50,639
Hurry back to the Capital
and hold down Hua Wucuo.

500
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,480
Rest assured, sir.

501
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:07,400
Strange.

502
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:09,320
How is he still alive?

503
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:11,960
Every fiber of his being
is practically plagued by ailments.

504
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:14,840
He is suffering
from at least three or four illnesses.

505
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,400
There are three possible reasons

506
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,400
why he is still alive.

507
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,079
Number one. He is simply too powerful.

508
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,440
He is able to prevent the illnesses
from clashing and devastating him.

509
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:28,440
No matter how skilled he is,

510
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,800
it's impossible to stop his condition
from worsening altogether.

511
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,519
So what's the second possibility?

512
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:33,480
Number two.

513
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,719
The diseases inside his body
are restraining one another.

514
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,760
And the last possibility?

515
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,239
The final possibility...

516
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:45,440
A miracle.

517
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,239
He knew I was here,
and he still came up here alone.

518
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:57,599
The greatest red-sleeved swordsman
is a phoenix

519
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,199
among the younger generation, after all.

520
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,519
A miracle is keeping him alive.

521
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,559
To kill him

522
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,920
would require a miracle as well.

523
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,480
It's a pity that the sword wasn't here.

524
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,559
It left a crack for him to slip through.

525
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:14,119
He wouldn't have been able
to walk out of here alive otherwise.

526
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,239
If I team up with the Chief Elder,

527
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,840
we could take him down.

528
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:22,079
And if you include those down there?

529
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:25,440
It would be our win as well.

530
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,239
The martial arts world

531
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,119
is also a world of business.

532
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:35,400
It's good if you can win,

533
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,679
but remaining undefeated
is where the true challenge lies.

534
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:38,920
Even if we can kill him

535
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,199
by working together,

536
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:41,480
it would still incur a hefty price.

537
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,599
We would leave ourselves vulnerable
for others to take advantage of.

538
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,159
It's not worth it.

539
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,280
From here on out,

540
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:53,199
the Capital
shall find itself without peace.

541
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,079
It has never been peaceful.

542
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,280
(Pobanmen)
What happened? Did you get into a fight?

543
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:08,440
Not exactly.

544
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:09,880
Who was he?

545
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:12,679
I couldn't get a good look.
His face was covered.

546
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:15,239
He kept his weapon hidden as well.

547
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:18,239
Chief Elder Lei certainly went all out

548
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:19,199
to prevent me from entering the Capital.

549
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:21,599
But thanks to that, I met you two.

550
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:23,360
This might be the luckiest thing

551
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,840
that has ever happened to me.

552
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:34,560
