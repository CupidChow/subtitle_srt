Let me go!

Let go!

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,920
Let go of me!

36
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,599

If I said you're not allowed to enter,

40
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:09,360
you shall stay here.

41
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,639
If anyone hinders me,

42

I'll kill you if you make another move.

46
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,240
Spare him.

47
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,479
I'll bear all the consequences.

48
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,599
You'll bear it?

49
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,919
What responsibility are you bearing?

50
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,120
I killed one of your men.

51
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,759
How would you let me go?

52
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,399
That man was meant for you to kill.

53
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,959
I can't believe that useless Lei Sun
had a good daughter like you.

54
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,639
Be prepared.

55
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:31,639
You'll come with me
to meet the Chancellor tomorrow.

56
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:20,000
He's waiting for you. Go inside.

57
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,079
Sir.

58
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,439
What brings you here?

59
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,639
I've killed one of your men.

60
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,560
So I'm here to atone for my crime.

61
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,079
How are you going to make it up?

62
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,800
With myself.

63
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,000
You need someone

64
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,279
who can take over the Six Half Hall.

65
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,839
I can be that person.

66
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:11,680
You want to be in charge
of the Six Half Hall?

67
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,319
You're pretty ambitious.

68
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,600
Are you capable of doing it?

69
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,839
Martial artists are business-minded.

70
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:20,079
I can do what my father did

71
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,519
for you.

72
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:24,120
You're not your father.

73
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,160
How can you prove

74
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,680
that you're like your father?

75
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,360
I'll prove it to you.

76
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,600
Don't avenge me.

77
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:34,759
If you must,

78
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,799
seek Bai Choufei's help.

79
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,679
Find him.

80
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:40,960
Father.

81
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,519
Father.

82
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,360
My lady,

83
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,840
must you go to River Chu Town?

84
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,559
The Pili Sect of Jiangnan's
influence is complicated.

85
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,000
It's not something we're familiar with.

86
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,799
You're not taking anyone
with martial arts skills.

87
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,399
What if they harm you?

88
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,519
What are you going to do?

89
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,799
My lady, can't you stay?

90
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,519
No matter how serious the matter was

91
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,480
in the past,

92
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:17,080
everyone would

93
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,960
do me a favor,

94
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,279
because I'm Lei Sun's daughter,

95
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,559
the Young Lady of the Six Half Hall.

96
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,639
Now,

97
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,000
I can only count on myself.

98
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,919
I must depend on myself.

99
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,759
In any case,

100
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:39,200
you should bring me along.

101
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,080
At least I can take care of you.

102
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,320
Don't worry.

103
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,639
I know what to do about this.

104
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,399
Mo,

105
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:53,679
I need you to do something for me.

106
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:11,440
Sir, I hope I didn't disturb you

107
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,879
by coming without informing you.

108
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,320
What are you doing here

109
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,799
instead of attending to your Young Lady?

110
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:20,480
I come here with a presumptuous request.

111
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,440
I hope you can help me.

112
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,559
Since Chief Elder's demise,

113
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,120
Young Lady has been filled with worries.

114
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,039
She gave it a thought for days

115
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,919
and finally decided
to take over the Six Half Hall.

116
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,080
But she's weak.

117
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,000
It won't be easy for her

118
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,159
to manage the Six Half Hall.

119
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,320
Chief Elder came
from the Pili Sect of Jiangnan.

120
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,320
Young Lady plans
to bring their power under control

121
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,720
and make use of them
for the Six Half Hall.

122
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,120
She's leaving
for River Chu Town tomorrow.

123
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,360
It's going to be a dangerous journey.

124
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,480
She has no one to trust.

125
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:53,039
Mr. Bai, are you willing to go with her?

126
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,080
What about Di Feijing?

127
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,879
She wants the First Elder to stay at the Hall.

128
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,720
She... She's not taking anyone with her.

129
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,720
Mr. Bai, I know

130
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,440
you may be from the House of Sunset Drizzle.

131
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,120
But you treat Young Lady sincerely.

132
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,360
You're a trustworthy person.

133
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,919
For her sake,

134
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,799
can you please do this favor for me?

135
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,360
Little Rock! Wen Rou! Come out here.

136
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,799
What is it, Bai?

137
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,200
Sit there.

138
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,559
Wen Rou, hurry up.

139
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,080
Were you looking for me, Cabbage?

140
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,320
What's the matter?

141
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,480
Sit there.

142
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,000
Bai,

143
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,679
what are you doing?

144
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:10,720
I want to draw a portrait of the three of us

145
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,120
for good luck.

146
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,480
How is a portrait considered good luck?

147
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:17,320
Can you give me a good pose?

148
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,279
All right.

149
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,360
Can you smile for a bit?
I'm not your debtor.

150
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,440
Bai,

151
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
it's your first drawing of me.
You better draw it nicely.

152
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,799
Keep quiet.

153
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:40,879
Don't move.

154
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,679
Are you done yet?

155
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:50,159
Just wait.

156
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,720
My face is getting numb from smiling.

157
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,720
Just bear with it.

158
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,639
Don't laugh.

159
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,679
All done.

160
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,320
Let me see.

161
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,279
What do you think?

162
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,679
Bai, didn't you say
you would draw the three of us?

163
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:12,480
Why are there only the two of us?

164
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:14,639
Do you have something to tell us?

165
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,720
Well.

166
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,279
I'm leaving the Capital tomorrow.

167
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,600
When I return,

168
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:23,840
I'll draw myself here.

169
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,159
This is the good luck I mean.

170
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,720
Where are you going?

Lei Chun wants to go to River Chu.

172
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm worried she might run into danger.

173
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,960
So I want to watch over her.

174
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:40,120
I know she doesn't have feelings for me.

175
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,879
But I just want to protect her.

176
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:45,000
Since you've already decided,

177
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,879
just do it.

178
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,039
I'm relieved to know you'll be with Chun.

179
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,000
Don't let anyone bully her.

180
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,080
Also,

181
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:55,360
take good care of yourself.

Me? Getting hurt?

185
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:00,120
I'd be the one hurting others.

186
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,279
He's right.

187
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:02,399

00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:20,000
and be careful.

I'll feel assured with you here.

Take good care of yourself.

199

Chancellor, Lei Sun was useless,

I'm not as talented as Zhuge.

I'm not as good as Tianyi.

neither of them is as good as mine.

Zhuge Zhengwo has returned.

261
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,799
When he was in the imperial court,

262
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,519
he always went against me.

263
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,839
I've been living in peace
while he was away for two years.

264
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,640
Now that he has returned,

265
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm starting to feel troubled again.

266
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,480
Do you mean to ask Mr. Thirteen

to kill Zhuge?

the Chancellor will be accused

273
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:34,039
come and see these words.

274
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,160
Do they remind you

278
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,039
That's right.

279
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,920
Wang Xiaoshi is Tianyi's disciple,

280
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:52,559
who's also Zhuge's
and your martial nephew.

281
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,279
No matter how skilled
Zhuge's martial art is,

282
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,519
he'd never expect

283
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,799
his martial nephew to kill him.

284
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:03,839
So he's the best person

285
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,640
to do it.

286
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,640
Then

287
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,920
someone from Sunset Drizzle

288
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,279
has killed the famous Divine Marquis Zhuge.

289
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,480
I don't need to tell you

what to do after that, do I?

You're indeed wise. Please rest assured.

292
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:24,759
When that happens, I'll wipe out

293

the House of Sunset Drizzle.

294

You used Carefree Sect's martial arts.

The move is fierce and swift.

00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,880
You have aggressive strokes.

337
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,799
Can you write a verse for me?

338
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:50,559
I plan to hang it
in the middle of this gallery.

339
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:53,000
If you don't mind,

340
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,440
I can write one verse for you.

341
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,240
That's great.

342
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,480
But don't hang it.

343
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,720
This way.

344
00:24:16,917 --> 00:24:19,183
(High...)

345
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,200
Why did you pick these words?

346
00:24:27,241 --> 00:24:27,846
(High Authority)

347
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,400
A purple ribbon
around the waist with a golden seal.

348
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:33,319
"High Authority" means
someone of high status.

349
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,599
Giving you these words

350
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:37,119
is most appropriate.

351
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,279
How did you know who I am?

352
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:46,839
To have such a place
in the Imperial Garden,

353
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,880
I can see you're not an ordinary person.

354
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,559
That landscape painting
by Li Sixun was kept

355
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,519
by the previous dynasty.

356
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,319
His Majesty had granted it
to an important official.

357
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:00,599
There's only one official in the court

358
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,440
who has a high status

359
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:04,160
and is proficient
in painting and calligraphy.

360
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:11,599
Greetings, Chancellor Cai.

361
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,079
You're young and skilled
in penmanship and martial arts.

362
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:15,681
(Chancellor Cai)

363
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,519
The successor of Baixu Garden

364
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,519
is indeed of great talent.

365
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,039
I've heard

366
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:24,240
what Retainment had accomplished

367
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,119
in the Capital.

368
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:29,880
Since you've known me so well,

369
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,920
I'm sure you've watched me
for a while now.

370
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:34,119
I guess you didn't invite me here just

371
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:36,559
to admire calligraphy.

372
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:38,440
Take a seat.

373
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:41,720
I asked you here

374
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,119
to talk about Youqiao Group.

375
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:48,160
You've heard of Youqiao Group?

376
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,119
I pay attention to the martial arts world.

377
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,880
Of course, I know about Youqiao Group.

378
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,440
They've been using unscrupulous means

379
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,680
to divide the interest

380
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:57,440
of the martial arts world.

381
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,440
They've killed
so many fellow martial artists.

382
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,599
If this organization doesn't fall,

383
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,880
it'll continue bringing disaster
to the country and the people.

384
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,400
We've always wanted
to wipe out Youqiao Group.

385
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:11,640
But they're well hidden.

386
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:13,559
It's hard to know
the way of their trades.

387
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:16,200
Not only they're well hidden,
but they're also very powerful.

388
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:20,200
Do you have any information about them?

389
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:22,440
I heard

390
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:25,000
their leader is Zhuge Zhengwo

391
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,799
who's famous
among the officials and commoners.

392
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,839
He's also your martial uncle.

393
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,440
Impossible.

394
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:40,720
That's impossible.

395
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,599
Chancellor,

396
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,119
I may have not met him,

397
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,680
but he's a commendable man.

398
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,160
Even my Master has said

399
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:48,720
there are only

400
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,119
a few upright people

401
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:51,039
in this world.

402
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,559
But Martial Uncle is considered one.

403
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:55,119
He's certainly not the leader
of Youqiao Group.

404
00:26:57,559 --> 00:26:59,000
We've only met twice.

405
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,519
It's reasonable that you don't believe me.

406
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,079
How about this?

407
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,759
I'll take you to see someone.

408
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:14,720
Get up.

409
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,440
Thank you, Chancellor.

410
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,200
Fu Zongshu?

411
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,759
Mr. Wang, it's been a while.

412
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,559
Is he the one you want me to meet?

413
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:31,200
This scum had committed
all sorts of crimes.

414
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,880
He's one of the Youqiao Group.

415
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,119
You must not believe
a single thing he said.

416
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,200
I...

417
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,119
Did I say it wrong?

418
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,039
Say something!

419
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:38,759
You're right.

420
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:41,039
It's precisely he's a corrupted official

421
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,440
that Youqiao Group
let him handle their affairs.

422
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,799
You might as well listen

423
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,519
to what he has to say.

424
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:51,279
Mr. Wang,

425
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,279
let me explain.

426
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:55,200
Listen to my explanation.

427
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,359
Mr. Wang, you're right about me.

428
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:03,440
I'm a corrupted official.

429
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,240
But I'm only following orders.

430
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,079
I'm not the mastermind.

431
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:12,599
It's your martial uncle, Zhuge Zhengwo.

432
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:14,720
My martial uncle is a respectable man.

433
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,279
Why should I believe you?

434
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:18,079
He? A respectable man?

435
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:20,839
That scum, Zhuge has deceived everyone.

436
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:22,200
He oppresses good citizens.

437
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:24,119
The Four Great Constables
under his leadership

438
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:25,839
may appear honorable and righteous.

439
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,559
But they frame loyal and upright people.

440
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,440
Those who supported him
climbed the ranks,

441
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,359
while those who went against him
had to live in misery!

442
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,200
Zhuge spent years trying

443
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,240
to improve his reputation.

444
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,720
Everyone thinks
he's loyal and righteous.

445
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,359
But they were deceived by him!

446
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:41,279
Nonsense!

447
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,319
Even if Martial Uncle Zhuge

448
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,160
is still an official at the imperial court,

449
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,160
he may not be able
to commit what you've said.

450
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:48,079
Besides, he has retired for two years.

451
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,759
No one knows where he is now.

452
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:51,880
You must not believe what he said.

453
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:53,440
Do you call that retirement?

454
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:54,960
That was his means of escaping

455
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:57,119
and hiding behind the Youqiao Group

456
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:58,079
to manipulate the officials and people!

457
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:58,680
You...

458
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:03,559
I thought I would have a patron

459
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,039
if I joined the Youqiao Group.

460
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:08,640
Who doesn't like power and wealth?

461
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,119
So are you saying

462
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:12,599
you're moved by your conscience

463
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,359
and decided to turn over a new leaf?

464
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,079
If I don't change my ways now,

465
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:17,279
I'll lose my life.

466
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,720
You blew up Lei Sun's firearms.

467
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:21,799
Lei Sun was supposed
to be responsible for it,

468
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:22,839
not me.

469
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:24,839
But I didn't expect you'd kill Lei Sun.

470
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:26,559
My head is on the chopping board now.

471
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:27,960
It's crime punishable by death!

472
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,240
I can't afford that.

473
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:32,759
That's why I risked my life
to see Chancellor.

474
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:36,799
I hope he'll give me a chance
to atone for my crime

475
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:37,880
by exposing the main culprit

476
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,519
and spare my life.

477
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:49,960
Martial Uncle Zhuge
has been leading the troops to battle.

478
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,599
Selling firearms to the Liao people

479
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,920
and losing the battle.

480
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,640
What does he gain from that?

481
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,839
Supporting the bandits
and using the troops for himself.

482
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:03,920
Since the beginning of our dynasty,
we've always overlooked martial arts.

483
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:06,039
Zhuge may have retired.

484
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:08,920
But he's deeply rooted in the army.

485
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:13,359
As long as the war doesn't stop,
the imperial court will use the troops.

486
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:16,160
As long as they use the troops,
they'll spend money.

487
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,799
Then the taxes paid by the people

488
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:21,880
will flow into the army.

489
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,559
Your martial uncle

490
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:26,200
is making money

491
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,599
from the gold circulating in the world.

492
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,759
Little Rock,

493
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:51,039
where did you go?

494
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,200
I've been searching everywhere for you.

495
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,319
I'm a little tired today.

496
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:54,960
I want to get some rest.

497
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:56,079
I...

498
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:03,119
What happened to him?

499
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,599
The gold circulating in the world?

500
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,079
That's the saying.

501
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:16,960
There's even

502
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,039
someone more powerful behind Fu Zongshu.

503
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,759
Do you call that retirement?

504
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,640
That was his means of escaping

505
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,640
and hiding behind Youqiao Group

506
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,640
to manipulate the officials and the people!

507
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,480
Every man has two sides.

508
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:32,319
In the face of huge benefits,

509
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:35,960
even saints can't help themselves.

510
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:39,079
You only heard of Zhuge in the past

511
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,119
from your master.

512
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,319
It's been so many years.

513
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:44,839
Things have changed a lot,

514
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:47,400
let alone a person's heart.

515
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,880
I may have learned
about Martial Uncle Zhuge

516
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,880
from my Master in person.

517
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,880
But didn't you learn about Zhuge Zhengwo

518
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,680
from someone else too?

519
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,519
If there's evidence,

520
00:31:58,759 --> 00:31:59,839
please show it.

521
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:02,039
Stop wasting your breath.

522
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,559
(Officials shouting fiercely.)

523
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,640
(The women crying in so much grief.)

524
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,839
(Wazi Alley on the outskirts of the Capital)

525
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,480
(is Zhuge's cronies' territory.)

526
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:17,680
(It's better to see
for yourself than hear about it.)

527
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,319
Madam, Wazi Alley is so remote.

528
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,799
Why is the night market here?

529
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,160
Just go and stop asking.

530
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,440
I don't mean anything else.

531
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,200
I just want to ask...

532
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,319
Don't ask.

533
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:03,799
Mister,

534
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:05,920
why is the night market at Wazi Alley different

535
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,839
from the Capital's night market?

536
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:09,119
The difference

537
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:11,400
is that Wazi Alley is not prosperous.

538
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:14,160
I can't tell if it's poor.

539
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,559
But everyone here

540
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:16,519
looks moody.

541
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:19,599
Tomorrow is the middle of the month.

542
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:22,960
It's collection day tomorrow.

543
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:25,759
Who can be happy about it?

544
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:27,960
The imperial court
collects taxes in summer and autumn.

545
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:29,519
Other levies are publicly listed

546
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,960
one by one.

547
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:32,880
Which levy are

548
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,039
they collecting?

549
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:36,599
Neither.

550
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,079
It's a private tax.

551
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,400
Who dares to collect private tax
under the Emperor's nose?

552
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:43,559
I dare not say.

553
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:44,799
So stop asking.

554
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,079
You should leave quickly
if you're not buying anything.

555
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:51,119
I should buy something, then.

556
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,319
So you can make some money.

557
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:55,039
I'll buy this one.

558
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,079
How much is this?

559
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,960
My apologies.

560
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,839
I can't sell you this item.

561
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:02,759
This is the best item I have.

562
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:04,160
It's not only me.

563
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,039
All the best items

564
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:07,599
at the stalls here

565
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,119
are for that person.

566
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,119
Are you saying

567
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:18,639
it's the man in the carriage
who collects private tax?

568
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,039
Sir!

569
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,679
Can you help my friend?

570
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,360
He committed a crime
and will be sentenced to death.

571
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,760
I have no other way

572
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,360
but to beg you.

573
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,440
It's not hard
to save someone from death row.

574
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,920
But

575
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,800
his life doesn't belong to him

576
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,400
after he's released.

577
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,079
As long as he can come out,

578
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:40,480
his life will be yours, Sir.

579
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,440
I have some work at the northern border.

580
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:45,719
I need someone
who could risk their life.

581
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,320
I can count your friend in.

582
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,719
But

583
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:52,239
if anything bad happened in the north,

584
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,320
that would be his resting place.

585
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,480
Not even his remains can be found.

586
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,880
So do you still want to save him?

587
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,519
Yes! How long he lives will be up to him

588
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:01,519
after he works

589
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:02,519
under your command.

590
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,920
Thank you, Sir! Thank you!

591
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,639
Thank you, Sir.

592
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,480
Thank you, Sir!

593
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,960
Thank you, Sir.

594
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,559
Thank you, Sir.

595
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:20,039
How dare you block our way?

596
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:20,920
Do you have a death wish?

597
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,559
How dare you block my way?

598
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:26,360
Do you also have a death wish?

599
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:28,960
Who is the one speaking?

600
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,360
And who's the one in the carriage?

601
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:33,920
You may not lose your life
for blocking people's way,

602
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:37,199
but you may not live
if you speak recklessly.

603
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,159
If I allow you

604
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:42,239
to behave recklessly
and disregard the law,

605
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:44,920
my experience gained
from running the Police Office

606
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:46,880
would be for nothing.

607
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,719
So what if you run the Police Office?

608
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:52,000
You need a valid reason
to bring someone to justice.

609
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:54,320
You need to have evidence
to sentence others to death.

610
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,440
Don't tell me

611
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,000
it's the death penalty

612
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,639
to buy a liquor jar.

613
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,599
Have it your way, then.

614
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,679
I'll do something about this.

615
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:08,360
You better be on your toes.

616
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,480
Thank you for your concern.

617
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:10,480
Let's go.

618
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:27,679
Thank you, Sir.

619
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,800
Who's the man inside the carriage?

620
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,800
Mister,

621
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:34,239
you've offended

622
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:35,760
the leader of The Four Great Constables,

623
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,199
one of the Six Panels, Official Heartless.

624
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,880
You must be careful next time.

625
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:55,639
Mister!

626
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:57,000
Master Fu, you're here.

627
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,039
Come and take a seat.

628
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:02,960
Liquor as usual?

629
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,000
I'll order something else.

630
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:06,960
I'll have a jar
of good-quality Shaoxing wine.

631
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:08,360
Make it warm too.

632
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,880
One salted duck.

633
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,599
You're spending a lot today.

634
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,440
I made a fortune from a small task.

635
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,280
What was it?

636
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:18,480
All right. You see...

637
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:21,119
I can't tell you this.

638
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,039
I won't say a word
even if you beat me to death.

639
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:23,480
Just serve the wine.

640
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,320
Shun, serve one salted duck!

641
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,800
Coming right up!

642
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,000
Please enjoy your meal.

643
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,639
All right.

644
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,880
Your wine is here.

645
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,119
Here you go.

646
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,599
Try this out.

647
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,440
Good wine.

648
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:57,079
Nice.

649
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,119
This duck looks delicious.

650
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:17,119
The higher-ups have ordered us

651
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:20,199
to continue with the act
at Wazi Alley for several more days

652
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:21,079
as a precaution.

653
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,320
People who lose themselves
over a small success are prone

654
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,039
to mistakes.

655
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,119
Find a place to bury him.

656
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,119
Yes.

657
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,320
Did you bring the information I want?

658
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,559
I've been waiting for it
for a long time.

659
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:58,920
It depends on what you want to know.

660
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:04,360
I want to know

661
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:07,559
if you're part of the Youqiao Group.

662
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,360
The Six Half Hall
works for the Youqiao Group.

663
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:16,440
So I naturally had worked for them.

664
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,199
Youqiao Group has a strict hierarchy.

665
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:22,079
Only people of Fu Zongshu
and Chief Elder Lei's position

666
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,079
are qualified to fill the positions.

667
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:26,239
These several positions alone are enough

668
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:28,719
to move the whole of the martial arts world.

669
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,400
Then who's the one

670
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,440
behind this?

671
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,239
Wang Xiaoshi, just a reminder.

672
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:38,039
To go against Youqiao Group,

673
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,239
you must pay with your life.

674
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:42,079
Not only yours.

675
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,639
You have to bet the lives

676
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:45,880
of everyone you know.

677
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:47,679
Their spies are everywhere.

678
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,400
So are their assassins.

679
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,280
You won't know

680
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,719
which of the words you've said

681
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:54,599
will reach their ears.

682
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:56,239
You won't even know

683
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:58,039
if the people around you

684
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,320
are one of them.

685
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,239
I've said this before.

686
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,280
Someone will need
to do something about it.

687
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,679
Since you've investigated this far,

688
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,639
I'm sure you can guess

689
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,000
the person behind all these.

690
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:19,320
I won't lie in front of Buddha.

691
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,199
I'll write a word here.

692
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:24,679
If it's the same as the one you have in mind,

693
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,440
that would be him.
