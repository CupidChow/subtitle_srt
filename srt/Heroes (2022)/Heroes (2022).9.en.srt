Hurry!

38
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,439
Help us out!

39
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,599
You'll catch a cold
if you don't wear anything thick.

40
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,319
We cannot afford
to see a physician right now.

41
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:21,680
Bai,

42
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,960
don't you think

43
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,560
it's too tough for us
to live in the Capital?

44
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:26,639
It's difficult to pay the rent

45
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,319
and see a physician.

46
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,400
But earning money is the hardest.

47
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,479
I just wanted to make some money

48
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,680
so that I could buy a brush for you.

49
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,360
Even that wasn't easy.

50
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:36,400
You can stop

51
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,439
worrying about me.

52
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:38,800
You shouldn't mind

53
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,599
the fire too.

54
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,840
The weather was dry.

55
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,680
I think the manager can pull it through.

56
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,560
No.

57
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,879
The manager was implicated
because of me.

58
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,319
I thought something was off today.

59
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,080
I had the feeling that someone
was eyeing the apothecary.

60
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,639
Back then, I didn't take it to heart

61
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,560
as I thought it was my imagination.

62
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:57,960
Now that I think about it,

63
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,840
I'm sure no one would try
to sabotage the manager

64
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,159
since he's a simple person.

65
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,879
If so, that means he was aiming for me.

66
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,120
It must be someone
from the Six Half Hall.

67
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,759
The Six Half Hall again?

68
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,599
Don't worry about being lonely
on the road ahead.

69
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,759
Everyone in the world
recognizes you as a friend.

70
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,680
He's still not willing to let us off,

71
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,400
even though we're already
in such a plight.

72
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:21,800
What?

73
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,000
Did they make things
difficult for you too?

74
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,319
They aren't from the Six Half Hall.

75
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:32,800
It's the heavens.

76

00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,800
Of course.

97
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,279
We once met in Xiliu.

98
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,920
I travel the world

99
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,439
to gather tales and anecdotes.

100
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,319
I realized something
only when I came to the Capital.

101
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,439
All the top martial artists

102
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,680
are actually here.

103
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,439
Speaking of which,

104
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,319
have your two friends

105
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,360
made a name for themselves?

106
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,040
Not yet.

107
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,040
Now, they're going through
a huge ordeal.

108
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,480
The place they worked in
was burned down.

109
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,160
And no one bought their
calligraphy and paintings.

110
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,879
I think they have to starve every day.

111
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,720
Although it's tough for now,

112
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:09,160
it will pan out well in the end.

That's what I believe in too.

114

I believe that my friends

will be included
in your list of heroes one day.

My lady, have you heard about this?

124
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,720
The two men you met on the boat

125
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,279
actually didn't make it
into the House of Sunset Drizzle.

126
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,040
Right now, one of them is selling
calligraphy and paintings on the streets

127
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,399
while the other is
working in an apothecary.

128
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,600
They're pretty pitiful.

129
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:53,720
Looks like you're pretty
concerned about them.

130
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:56,160
Of course, my lady.
They're your acquaintances.

131
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:59,480
Since they didn't make it
into the House of Sunset Drizzle,

132
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,560
my lady, why don't you ask
Chief Elder for his permission

133
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,399
and let them join the Six Half Hall?

134
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,040
They will never join the Six Half Hall.

135
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,160
And,

136
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,600
I've made a promise to my father.

137
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,959
I will step out
of the martial arts world.

138
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:13,079
If so, I don't think
they can stay here for long.

139
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:13,959
It's hard to say.

140
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,920
Both of them don't look like
they'll give up easily.

141
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,160
Come and take a look at my painting!

142
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,959
I just acquired a painting
of an old man grazing his calf

143
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:25,720
while overlooking the river!

144
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,319
Miss,

145
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:30,800
I knew

146
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,920
you could recognize
quality paintings at first glance.

147
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,560
This is the painting I just acquired.

148
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,720
Look.

149
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,720
Look at the strokes and imagery
depicted in the paintings.

150
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,519
I'm sure it came from
someone extraordinary.

151
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,759
I do know something about paintings.

152
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,240
The strokes look new and fresh.

153
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,399
It doesn't seem like the work
of a famous painter.

154
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,800
That's right.

155
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:55,160
Miss, you're exactly right.

156
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:57,839
I just made his acquaintances
not long ago.

157
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,519
He has no particular strength.

158
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,000
He came to the Capital
with an easel on his back.

159
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,319
However, he's very ambitious.

160
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,839
Look at this painting.

161
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,120
Don't you think it's amazing?

162
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,439
If so, why didn't you
give it a better name?

163
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,680
Old man grazing his calf?

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,079
I'm sure no one would buy that.

165
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,160
Young lady,

166
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,000
you see,

167
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,600
the name of the painting
can be altered accordingly.

168
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,720
Mainly, it depends on
whether your Young Lady likes it.

169
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,240
Throughout the stages of life,

170
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,199
when you look back
at your life at old age,

171
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,160
you'll feel sentimental.

172
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,279
The majestic landscape in the background

173
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,160
is still and calm.

174
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,680
It depicts the vastness
of Heaven and Earth.

175
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,440
Now that I think about it,

176
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,879
the people you meet in life
are just passengers.

177
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:38,320
You might be able to sell it out

178
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,159
if you change its name
to "Floating Dreams".

179
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,279
Aren't you buying it?

180
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,159
No.

181
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,879
Didn't you say

182
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,000
that the strokes are new and fresh?

183
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:54,720
Does that mean it can
achieve success in the Capital?

184
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:00,039
I guess there's nothing else I can do.

185
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:01,919
Please take care.

186
00:09:17,145 --> 00:09:23,434
(Second Year of Song-Yuan,
drawn by Bai Youjin)

187
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:25,960
What is he doing?

188
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,519
Ladies and gentlemen,

189
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:31,679
gather around!

190
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,840
Don't miss out on this opportunity!

191
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,519
Today, I hope you guys
will enjoy my show!

192
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:38,879
I will

193
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,759
stand inside this circle.

194
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,840
You can get one stone
for one copper coin.

195
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,200
If you guys hit me with your stones,

196
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,279
you can take back your money.

197
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,720
If not,

198
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,759
the money will be mine.

199
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:49,840
It's that simple.

200
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,080
It's that simple?

201
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,279
Just try it and you'll know.

202
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,159
- Anyone wants to give it a try?
- Me!

203
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,279
Mister.

204
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:01,360
Come on.

205
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,200
He's amazing!

206
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:07,240
That was so close.

207
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,480
Again!

208
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,840
Aim better.

209
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:15,639
- Aim better.
- That's right.

210
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:16,399
Aim better.

211
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,320
Aim better.

212
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,039
Thank you.

213
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
I quit.

214
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,679
Go now.

215
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,240
So, Tenth Elder,

216
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:03,240
regarding the things I said just now...

217
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,120
It's just a stall vendor you
killed, right?

218
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,440
The Six Half Hall will deal with it

219
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,919
for you.

220
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,080
Thank you, Tenth Elder.

221
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:18,080
I will accomplish the task
you gave me immediately.

222
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:19,279
Let's go.

223
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,840
Thank you, everyone.

224
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,559
Please come again next time.

225
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,440
See you, young man.

226
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,440
Take care.

227
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,759
Thank you.

228
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:38,919
Get out of the way.

229
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,679
Look at the amount of money.

230
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:46,559
He's so generous.

231
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,200
That's right.

232
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:48,320
You're right.

233
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,159
Mister, you're pretty generous, huh?

234
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,440
I have plenty of money in the world.

235
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,679
I wish to try something fun.

236
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,759
Do you dare to take up my challenge?

237
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:00,799
You can't do that.

238
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:01,559
He'll be injured.

239
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,840
He'll die from this.

240
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,159
That's too risky.

241
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:05,679
Sure.

242
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:12,919
If I don't hit you in three shots,

243
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,879
you can have all of it.

244
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:17,039
All right.

245
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,960
Young man, that's too risky!

246
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,080
Don't agree to his request!

247
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,159
Be careful!

248
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,399
Just forget it!

249
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,240
Amazing!

250
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,759
You're pretty good.

251
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:33,639
I was just lucky.

252
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,039
You have two more shots.

253
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,159
He's very skillful.

254
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,360
That's right.

255
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,000
That's so scary.

256
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,919
Boss!

257
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:01,039
Bai?

258
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,000
Who are you?

259
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,919
Mind your own business!

260
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:05,919
Scram.

261
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,559
Let's go.

262
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:17,759
I...

263
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,360
Bai!

264
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:23,600
Bai, wait for me!

265
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:27,679
Bai!

266
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,240
Bai!

267
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:36,879
Bai, wait for me!

268
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:40,919
Bai!

269
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:42,559
Can you wait for me?

270
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,120
They're falling to the floor.

271
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:46,679
Just wait for me!

272
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,799
My coins are falling.

273
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:52,919
Was this the idea you mentioned?

274
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,480
Didn't you say we need to retaliate

275
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,480
when people bully us?

276
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:57,120
So, can people bully and humiliate you

277
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:58,759
when they give you money?

278
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:00,279
I'm selling my craft for a living.

279
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:01,200
You're not selling your craft.

280
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,759
You're selling your dignity!

281
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,039
It depends on one's capability
to make a living as a martial artist.

282
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,639
This can be counted
as experience, right?

283
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:20,320
I don't think
I'm degrading myself by doing this.

284
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:21,720
I know life is tough right now.

285
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,200
But I'm sure
there are more solutions than problems.

286
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,639
We have to think of a way somehow.

287
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,720
If we wish to stay in the Capital,

288
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,320
we have to...

289
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,639
If I have to resort to this
to stay in the Capital,

290
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,120
I would rather leave!

291
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:32,360
Bai!

292
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,003
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

293
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:05,919
(So, not everyone)

294
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:08,559
(can find their place in the Capital.)

295
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,240
(People who have the power)

296
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,679
(can close every door.)

297
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,080
I'm sure the things it sees

298
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,159
will be different from what we see.

299
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,679
That's great.

300
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,519
It's flying

301
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:22,480
freely.

302
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,759
I'm sure it has been to more places

303
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,080
than us.

304
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:26,519
I'm going to stay here.

305
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:28,559
I wish to join
the House of Sunset Drizzle

306
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,559
as soon as possible.

307
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,600
(I can choose
not to stay in the Capital.)

308
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,279
(But it's different for Bai.)

309
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,399
(He has been waiting for too long.)

310
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:39,480
(The fame he desires)

311
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,440
(can only be attained in the Capital.)

312
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,440
I'm poor and unknown to the world.

313
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:49,279
I wonder who's following me?

314
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:56,519
Judging from what you said,

315
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:58,320
it seems like
you've taken advantage of me.

316
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,840
You're indeed poor and unknown.

317
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,360
I'm not here to be your follower.

318
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,159
I'm here to chase you away.

319
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,840
So, the Third Elder of the Six Half Hall

320
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,799
is here to see me personally?

321
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,000
Seems like you're bent on
forcing me to a dead end.

322
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,679
Come on then.

323
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,399
Tell all of your men to come out.

324
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,039
There's no one else.

325
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:18,399
I'm the only one here.

326
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,240
Although I'm here to chase you away,

327
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,759
that doesn't mean we need to fight.

328
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:25,039
If you're not afraid
of a young woman like me,

329
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,200
you can follow me.

330
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,720
I'll treat you to a drink.

331
00:16:52,218 --> 00:16:53,906
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

332
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,000
(You're not selling your craft.)

333
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,359
(You're selling your dignity!)

334
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,920
(If I have to resort to this
to stay in the Capital,)

335
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,079
(I would rather leave!)

336
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,599
If I knock on the door right now,

337
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,200
Bai will never forgive me.

338
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,519
Tenth Elder,

339
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,279
Chief Elder said

340
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:42,599
we should leave him alone
if he didn't knock on the door.

341
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,799
So, do we still need to follow him?

342
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,240
I saw him knocking on the door just now.

343
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:50,759
Didn't you see it?

344
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,599
I understand.

345
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,119
Many people came to the Capital

346
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:18,440
to embrace their dreams

347
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:19,920
and establish a foothold here.

348
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:22,400
But why must some people bully the weak

349
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,000
and chase them away?

350
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:30,319
You fooled me again.

351
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:33,920
Fine.

352
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,880
Since you're not leaving,

353
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,240
you should stay here forever then.

354
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,119
Since you've offended the Six Half Hall,

355
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,359
according to our rules,

356
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,160
you have to pay with your life.

357
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,880
You want to take my life?

358
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:53,480
I'm afraid you're not strong enough.

359
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,519
Attack!

360
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,440
Six Half Hall may have their rules,

361
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,759
but I have my own rules as well.

362
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,559
Do not attack those
who are holding onto their last straw.

363
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,799
You killed Hua Wucuo
when he was holding onto his last straw.

364
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:25,200
That was just the first punch.

365
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:29,119
Do not attack those
who cannot defend themselves.

366
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:30,839
But you burned down
the manager's apothecary.

367
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,880
That was the second punch.

368
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,359
As for the third punch,

369
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,119
I just felt like punching you.

370
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,390
(Maple Bridge)

371
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:11,880
Third Elder.

372
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:14,079
Nan, bring me a coat.

373
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:15,039
Sure.

374
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,839
Have you ever heard of this saying?

375
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:26,799
In the Capital's martial arts world,

376
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,000
the liquor you drink

377
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,319
determines

378
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:31,000
your status.

379
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,720
Of course.

380
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,559
This place is the top shop
in the Capital.

381
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,440
(Liquor)

382
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,884
(Liquor)

383
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,720
The liquor here is excellent and pricey.

384
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:00,839
An ordinary person might not be able
to afford to get drunk here

385
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,839
with their annual wage.

386
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:07,720
The name tags on the liquor pots

387
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,079
are largely unknown

388
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,480
as they're just nicknames.

389
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,320
(Liquor)

390
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:12,880
It might be Chief Elder Lei,

391
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,340
(Mugehei)

392
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,200
(Mugehei)
Mr. Su,

393
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,720
(Liquor)
Qi Shaoshang,

394
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,079
or even Marquis Shentong.

395
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,759
So, did you bring me all the way here

396
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,119
to humiliate me?

397
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:23,599
Don't you think
you should be humiliated?

398
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,880
I know you're skillful in martial arts.

399
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,759
However, it's useless
to be skilled in martial arts alone.

400
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,400
Moreover, you've offended

401
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,119
the group you shouldn't have,
the Six Half Hall.

402
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,279
The Capital's martial arts world
is small in the first place.

403
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,079
It was already difficult enough
for you to enter the door.

404
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,720
Moreover, this door
has been closed in front of you.

405
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:46,599
Now, it's a wall.

406
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,839
It's an iron wall.

407
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:49,519
You can't open it that easily.

408
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:52,000
You were only released from prison
after a prominent figure

409
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,240
like Mr. Su knelt
and pleaded for your sake.

410
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,000
If you wish to stay in the Capital,

411
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:58,119
your buddy has to
perform in the streets.

412
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,319
You're so prideful.

413
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,480
However, the people beside you
have cast away

414
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,680
their pride long ago for your sake.

415
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:04,319
So,

416
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:07,000
do you think you still have the face
to stay in the Capital?

417
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,960
Have a drink.

418
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,839
This is the only place

419
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,200

420

he never returned late.

496
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:43,640
When you fall for someone,

497
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,359
and if he's in the same situation

498
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,640
as Mengzhen right now,

499
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,039
you will understand how I feel.

500
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:03,640
Amitabha.

501
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:04,839
Miss Lei,

502
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:07,640
Mr. Su has returned to the Capital.

503
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:33,920
My lady, be careful.

504
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,643
(Fu's Residence)

505
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,400
Who's there?

506
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:58,960
I'm Su Mengzhen
of the House of Sunset Drizzle.

507
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:00,088
(Fu's Residence)

508
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,319
Mr. Su, please wait a moment.

509
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:17,880
Mr. Su,

510
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,119
our minister will see you.

511
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,680
Sir,

512
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,640
I've retrieved the item you asked for.

513
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:40,519
Mr. Su, I'm sure
it was an arduous trip. Good job.

514
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,359
Is the item with you?

515
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:47,119
Show it to me.

516
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,000
It's his head indeed.

517
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,920
Su Mengzhen, you do
live up to your name.

518
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:31,119
There's nothing you cannot achieve.

519
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,119
I think I've gotten worse at it.

520
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,559
I've been practicing Cuju lately.

521
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:43,400
When I saw something that's shaped
like a ball, I feel like kicking it.

522
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,240
Mr. Su,

523
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,920
please pick it up for me.

524
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:05,720
Someone!

525
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:06,680
Yes, sir!

526
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,359
Su Mengzhen assassinated Liu Anshi,
a court official!

527
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:17,160
Take him down!

528
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,480
Yes, sir!

529
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:25,960
Sir,

530
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:29,279
how can you prove that
I assassinated Official Liu?

531
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:32,319
This head is all the proof I need.

532
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:38,319
Sir, did you see clearly

533
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,319
whose head this was?

534
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:49,640
Sir, it's fake.

535
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,359
How dare you, Su Mengzhen!

536
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:55,799
I gave you a task,

537
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:56,519
yet you try to deceive me!

538
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:57,519
I'm ignorant.

539
00:29:57,799 --> 00:29:59,559
Sir, what exactly
did you want me to do for you?

540
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,160
You!

541
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,119
Su Mengzhen,

542
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:07,039
the House of Sunset Drizzle
is under my governance.

543
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,920
Now that you've offended me,

544
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,559
life will be difficult for you.

545
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:14,759
Sir!

546
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,319
Sir,

547
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,039
don't tell me this head
belonged to your friend?

548
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,119
By the way,

549
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,240
what did you say you'd do to me again?

550
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,559
Leave.

551
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:39,960
All of you, leave!

552
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,119
Have you ever thought about
the consequences of your actions?

553
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:56,680
I have.

554
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:03,279
Do you think I don't dare to arrest you

555
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:05,480
just because you're famous?

556
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,880
I can even kill you if I want to.

557
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:15,640
Sir, I know you're bold enough

558
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,559
to do anything in the world.

559
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:18,880
However,

560
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,720
if I was sent to the dungeon
in the Ministry of Justice

561
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:24,680
or died in some other place,

562
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:27,640
sir,

563
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,160
you will never know about

564
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,400
the things I had witnessed.

565
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,753
(Bianliang)

566
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:51,759
What are you trying to do?

567
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,000
Are you trying to leave by yourself?

568
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,839
Are you going to abandon your friend?

569
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,160
I'll break your legs for it.

570
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,200
I'm not abandoning my friend.

571
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,039
We've been living
in the Capital for some days.

572
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:06,359
It's fine that I couldn't
make a name for myself.

573
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,359
But you had to perform
in the streets for my sake.

574
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:08,680
Mr. Su was humiliated because of me.

575
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,319
I feel more humiliated

576
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:12,960
when my friends
have to suffer because of me.

577
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:14,920
That's why I'm going
to leave the Capital.

578
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,079
Are you done?

579
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,359
Since you said we're friends,

580
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:20,559
those minor sufferings didn't matter.

581
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,039
We came to the Capital together.

582
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:24,079
Since you're leaving,

583
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,759
let's leave together.

584
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,079
Wait.

585
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,079
Little Rock,

586
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,640
you still have your dreams to pursue.

587
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,039
You...

588
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:32,519
Why are you so wishy-washy today?

589
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:34,519
Didn't I tell you before?
Just listen to me.

590
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:35,680
Let's travel around for a few years

591
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,839
and return here.

592
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,000
If the Six Half Hall
dares to oppress us again,

593
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,160
we'll retaliate against them!

594
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,160
Okay.

595
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,039
Let's travel together then.

596
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,880
After that, we can return here together.

597
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:50,039
Let's go.

598
00:32:50,831 --> 00:33:00,346
(Bianliang)

599
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,799
It must've been an arduous journey.

600
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:10,319
You're finally back.

601
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,519
I've prepared hot tea
and a warm environment for you.

602
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:13,759
Treat this as your welcoming feast.

603
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:15,960
It'll get rid of the cold.

604
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,440
The journey was not too bad.

605
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:21,519
But I was almost arrested

606
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,839
in the minister's residence.

607
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,920
You brought a human head into the
residence of the Minister of Justice.

608
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,839
And, you actually came out alive.

609
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,119
Whose head did you bring

610
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:31,720
to keep you alive after all of that?

611
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:34,319
I got hold
of an intel from Official Liu.

612
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,400
Fu Zongshu and the Six Half Hall

613
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,319
have been operating a shady business

614
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:39,640
in the north.

615
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,119
And, it's related to the Liao people.

616
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:47,599
Following Official Liu's clue,

617
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,759
I went to the border area

618
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:53,440
and found the contact
of their shady business.

619
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,400
Are you the contact
of their business in the north?

620
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:02,000
Mr. Su, I'm sure you know that well

621
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,160
when you came all the way here
to track me down.

622
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,000
How did you guys go about
with your business

623
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:06,880
and do your handovers?

624
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:08,119
Tell me everything you know.

625
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,000
Mr. Su,

626
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,000
although the things we do

627
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,079
are harming other people,

628
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:15,760
we had no choice but to do it.

629
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:18,320
The families
of the people in charge here

630
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:21,840
are under the surveillance

631
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,480
of the Six Half Hall.

632
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:25,079
Does that include your family too?

633
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,360
I have a pitiful brother
living in the Capital.

634
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,639
His life

635
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,639
is under their control too.

636
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,639
If you escort me to the Capital

637
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,039
and save my brother,

638
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,280
I'll tell you everything

639
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:44,400
I know.

640
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,360
All right, I promise you.

641
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,119
Thank you, Mr. Su.

642
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,320
Save...

643
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,719
Save my brother.

644
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,440
Initially, I wanted him to tell me

645
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,239
about the so-called "business"
in the north.

646
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:14,880
It's a pity that he was killed

647
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,320
before he could tell me anything.

648
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:18,800
However, the contact

649
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,800
was vital to their business
in the north.

650
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,599
Official Fu backed off
when he saw his head.

651
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,079
This move

652
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,639
is risky indeed.

653
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:33,000
If you're 60 percent
confident about it, you should do it.

654
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:36,559
Regarding the contact's brother
who is under surveillance,

655
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:38,480
tell Messenger Pigeon Group
to locate him.

656
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:39,480
I will do so.

657
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,239
Hurry.

658
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:45,159
Drink your tea

659
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:46,320
and expel the cold in your body.

660
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,599
After drinking the warm tea

661
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,039
and getting your body warmed up,

662
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,760
you should hurry and leave the city.

663
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:54,119
Why?

664
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:55,880
The two people you told me to monitor,

665
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:56,920
Wang and Bai,

666
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,880
I think they can't stand it anymore.

667
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,599
If you wish to keep them here,

668
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,599
I'm afraid

669
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,039
you have to leave the city
and intercept them.

670
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,360
Prepare my horse.

671
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,039
It's already prepared.

672
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:33,920
Stop right there!

673
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,400
Wen Rou?

674
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:37,079
Wen Rou?

675
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:41,519
You're not gentle at all.

676
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:44,400
First, you flirted with other girls.

677
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:45,920
After that, you left me
in the House all by myself.

678
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,880
You didn't look for me even though
you were in the Capital for a long time.

679
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,400
And now, you're leaving
without bidding farewell.

680
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:50,599
You want me to be gentle?

681
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:52,639
You, and you!

682
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:54,480
Did you two even take me as a friend?

683
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:57,679
I'm sorry.

684
00:36:58,599 --> 00:36:59,119
I'm sorry.

685
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:04,960
I know the ordeals you guys faced
for the past few days.

686
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:06,920
However, are you sure
you want to leave just like that?

687
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:13,000
I came to the Capital
to join the House of Sunset Drizzle.

688
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:14,440
Since I have no chance to join it,

689
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,079
there's no meaning for me to stay here.

690
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,280
Actually, it's not that big of a deal.

691
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:21,119
Although the Capital is huge,

692
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,559
it's only a tiny part of the world.

693
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:24,400
Even if we can't make a name
for ourselves here,

694
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:25,760
I'm sure we can do it elsewhere.

695
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,920
What if you still have a chance?

696
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:31,559
Come on.

697
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,639
Someone wants to see you two.

698
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:36,800
Let's go.

699
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,400
Come on.

700
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,079
Where are you bringing us?

701
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,800
You'll know when we get there.

702
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,599
Mengzhen, I've brought them here.

703
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:54,960
You guys can enjoy your chat.
I'll make a move first.

704
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,440
Wen Rou.

705
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,719
Mengzhen?

706
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:02,159
Mr. Su, why are you here?

707
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,280
I was waiting
for two important people to show up.

708
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,239
Judging by your looks,

709
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:12,639
I assume you two
are leaving the Capital.

710
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:17,440
The Six Half Hall
oppressed us all the time.

711
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:19,000
The Ministry of Justice has forbidden us

712
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,400
from joining
the House of Sunset Drizzle too.

713
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:22,119
We have no choice
but to leave the Capital.

714
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,159
I've already told
you guys this long ago.

715
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:26,079
You two are already members
of the House of Sunset Drizzle.

716
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:29,480
Forget about the Ministry of Justice
and the Six Half Hall.

717
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,159
You guys are joining
the House of Sunset Drizzle.

718
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,559
It has nothing to do with them.

719
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,119
But Mengzhen,

720
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,679
when you knelt in front of Fu Zongshu
and pleaded for us,

721
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:39,559
I...

722
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:41,519
I knelt in front of Fu Zongshu?

723
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,440
Fu Zongshu

724
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,039
is only good with his words.

725
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:52,760
I didn't expect you two

726
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,719
to be duped by him.

727
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:56,760
You want me to kneel
in front of a person?

728
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,400
I guess I can do it
if it's for the sake of my brothers.

729
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,239
What did you say?

730
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,880
Did you say we were brothers?

731
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,800
Your ear is perfectly fine.

732
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:09,639
We're sworn brothers.

733
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,239
But we only met each other once.

734
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:12,800
But we did experience
life-or-death situations together.

735
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,599
Do you even know who we are?

736
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:16,199
I don't care who you are.

737
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:17,760
You want us to become
your sworn brothers

738
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,679
without knowing who we are?

739
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:20,760
Who said that one must inquire

740
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,719
about the other party's
family history and background

741
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:23,599
before becoming sworn brothers with him?

742
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:25,440
If so, why are you trying
to make us your sworn brothers?

743
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,480
I don't need a reason to do so.

744
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,039
Do you expect me to say something

745
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:32,079
like we will be in weal and woe

746
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,880
and stay together forever?

747
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,480
If so, how many
sworn brothers do you have?

748
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,400
Two.

749
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:38,760
You

750
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:41,239
and him.

751
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,760
You're trying to recruit us to
join the House of Sunset Drizzle, right?

752
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,599
If you two are not willing to do so,

753
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,960
you may leave right now.

754
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:53,679
Even if we don't see each other again,

755
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:56,679
you two will forever be my brothers.

756
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,519
Big Brother!

757
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,519
You're the big brother here?

758
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:11,880
You don't say?

759
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:15,960
Big Brother!

760
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:18,920
Big Brother, Second Brother!

761
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:20,119
Third Brother!

762
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:21,039
Second Brother,

763
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:21,639
Third Brother!

764
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:22,480
- Big Brother!
- Big Brother!

765
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:24,480
I finally found myself a big brother

766
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,559
in the Capital!

767
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:28,960
Great!

768
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:29,519
Big Brother!

769
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:30,920
Second Brother!

770
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:32,599
Third Brother!

771
00:40:46,317 --> 00:40:47,920
(Yang)

772
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,360
I, Su Mengzhen.

773
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:09,840
Bai Choufei.

774
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:11,000
Wang Xiaoshi.

775
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,679
We hereby become sworn brothers.

776
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,920
We will go through
thick and thin together.

777
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,239
We will entrust our lives to each other
and never let each other down.

778
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:19,599
If we go against this vow,
may the heavens punish us!
