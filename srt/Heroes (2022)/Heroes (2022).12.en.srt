(Well Prisoner, Looming Danger. Part 1)

32
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,680
I chanced upon this drawing.

33
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,359
While it's not from someone famous,

34
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,920
it's vivid

35
00:01:59,079 --> 00:01:59,879
and poignant.

36
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:02,319
I think you'll appreciate it.

37
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,280
I can feel the power of every stroke.

38
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,599
This

39
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,080
must be drawn by someone prideful.

40
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:11,280
Keen eyes.

41
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,560
I do like it a lot.

42
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,159
Here.

43
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:29,879
Feeling better now?

44
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,719
I have been meaning to ask.

45
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:37,800
You're a woman.

46
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,639
Why did you

47
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,120
eat something sour like this
for more than a decade?

48
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,120
Why not something else?

49
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,639
Because this

50
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,800
is the taste of our first encounter.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,919
Since you gave me a drawing,

52
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,199
I have something else for you too.

53
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:10,080
I found this warm jade in the northwest.

54
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,680
You're sensitive to cold

55
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:12,759
so you should wear it.

56
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:16,960
Put it on for me.

57
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,919
The jade merchants will always say
their jades bring good luck.

58
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,080
But I like how soothing
the texture of this jade is.

59
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:35,879
It's quite unique.

60
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,759
I want you to carry it.

61
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,199
So?

62
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:44,639
Do you like it?

63
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,120
I love it.

64
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,199
Not because it has a special texture.

65
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,879
But because

66
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,599
it symbolizes unity.

67
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,824

68
00:04:27,546 --> 00:04:31,960
(Discovery)

69
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,240
Night can be cold.

70
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,079
You should return early.

71
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,040
I'll show you
another great drawing next time.

72
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,079
To the chess parlor.

73
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:27,759
Miss Lei, why did you return?

74
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,600
I came out
because I heard a carriage nearby.

75
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,600
I noticed this broken lantern
when I was about to leave.

76
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,680
Must be due to those
small, flying pebbles.

77
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,319
I'll buy a new one tomorrow.

78
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,199
No need.

79
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,160
Use mine.

80
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:45,680
Make sure

81
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,560
it stays lit forever.

82
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,000
Noted.

83
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,040
How romantic.

84
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:10,600
Why didn't you talk to her more
before you left?

85
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:14,079
I always don't know
what to say before I leave.

86
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:16,720
Just another glance

87
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:17,920
is good enough.

88
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,360
You and her father
are on each other's throat.

89
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,639
You don't have many glances left.

90
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,279
We will all die sooner or later.

91
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,959
That doesn't mean we should just sit
and wait for it to arrive.

92
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,079
Why did you drag me here this late?

93
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,319
Fu Zongshu will pass by here tonight.

94
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,959
I want to give him a lesson.

95
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,639
You brought me here

96
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,160
to assault a government official?

97
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,079
There are good and bad officials.

98
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,079
As the Minister of Justice,

99
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,480
he abused his power

100
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,519
and harmed many people.

101
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,839
I know that.

102
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,319
I'm never fond of him.

103
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,600
I even blasted his carriage
with fireworks.

104
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,879
When did you do that?

105
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,720
When you were jailed.

106
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,079
I cannot let this slide.

107
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,839
When will he arrive? I'll attack first

108
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:23,360
but you have to deal with the guards
for me.

109
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,279
No need for that.

110
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,079
He is going
to his secondary residence tonight.

111
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,360
He houses a mistress there,

112
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,439
and he doesn't want his wife to know.

113
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,079
Therefore, he will not be escorted.

114
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,439
Wonderful.

115
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:32,240
I...

116
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:45,920
He's here.

117
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,279
What should we do?

118
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:52,560
Who's there?

119
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,279
Halt!

120
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,439
Arrogant fool!

121
00:07:58,439 --> 00:07:59,800
I am the Minister of...

122
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,279
Sir!

123
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,199
Who's there?

124
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,480
That was brutal.

125
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:10,360
Great!

126
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,399
Fu Zongshu now

127
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,360
has a swollen forehead to deal with.

128
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,360
We're removing the evils from the people.

129
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:21,959
Wow!

130
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:22,800
Amazing.

131
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,000
Someone's drowning!

132
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,959
Someone's drowning!

133
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,360
Help!

134
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:32,960
Someone's drowning!

135
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,919
Little Rock!

136
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,559
Save him!

137
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,120
Yes!

138
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,240
Mister, are you okay?

139
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,480
Swim back up!

140
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:50,960
Mister.

141
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,639
Swim back up!

142
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,480
Pull them up.

143
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,639
Swim back up.

144
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,480
I'm glad he's fine.

145
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,200
Here.

146
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,039
Come.

147
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:05,919
Careful.

148
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,360
Mister?

149
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,240
Wake up, mister.

150
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,840
Wake up!

151
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,200
Stop standing still. Find a physician!

152
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,279
Now!

153
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:17,879
Wake up, mister.

154
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,519
Mister?

155
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,480
You fell for it.

156
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,039
A physician, even.

157
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
It was a prank?

158
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,720
I was wondering

159
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,720
which beautiful lady

160
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,080
would come to my rescue.

161
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,039
But instead,

162
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,120
I attracted a man.

163
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,679
I only have
my irresistible charm to blame.

164
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:50,279
Men and women want me.

165
00:09:52,017 --> 00:09:53,878
(Fang Yingkan, Marquis Shentong)

166
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,279
(Fang Yingkan, Marquis Shentong)
Have a sip. It'll warm you up.

167
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,759
They say ugly people
are often up for no good.

168
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:58,919
You have a nice face

169
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,720
but the way you speak is off-putting.

170
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,600
If you're done, I'll leave.

171
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:03,559
Wait!

172
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,519
Mister!

173
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
Thank you for saving my life.

174
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,399
What's your name?

175
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,080
What do you want?

176
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,720
You saved me.

177
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,399
I have to repay you,

178
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,639
don't I?

179
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,200
Of course!

180
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,080
You never had a problem

181
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,360
so I didn't save you.

182
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,480
I am not your savior.

183
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,039
Goodbye.

184
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,360
Mister!

185
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,600
Don't leave, mister.

186
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,720
Mister!

187
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,360
Mister!

188
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:29,919
Mister, you're cold.

189
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:32,320
Drink with us to warm yourself up.

190
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,320
Maybe

191
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,559
I'll use my body to warm you up.

192
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:36,240
No, thanks.

193
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,039
Let go of him.

194
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,159
- Let go of that man!
- Don't touch me.

195
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,240
Don't touch me.

196
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,600
Who's there?

197
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,600
Who are you to give us orders?

198
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,320
You're not the only pretty girl here.

199
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,360
Who do you think you are?

200
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,159
Don't touch me!

201
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,080
- Mister.
- Don't touch me.

202
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,080
I'm the daughter
of Wen Wan, Lord of Luoyang.

203
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,039
Also, the disciple of Red-Sleeved Nun,
Hanshan Swallow.

204
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,159
If you don't let go of him,

205
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,480
I'll sink your ship!

206
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,759
What a bold claim.

207
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,679
My wife!

208
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,000
Wife?

209
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,240
- My wife!
- Wen Rou.

210
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,320
I'm not your wife.

211
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,080
Explain at once.

212
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,720
Hey, do not make allegations like that.

213
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:14,919
Her maidenhood is at stake.

214
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,919
This is none of your business.

215
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,159
I'm Fang Yingkan.

216
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,559
I went to Lord of Luoyang's Residence

217
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
and had a great time with your father.

218
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,000
Your father

219
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,799
agreed to our marriage.

220
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,080
Unfortunately,

221
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,000
you were out that day.

222
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,240
And today,

223
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,799
we bumped into each other.

224
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,360
The serendipity.

225
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,480
So

226
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:38,720
you know my father?

227
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,000
Yes.

228
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,840
Everyone knows who my father is.

229
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,759
It's shameless of you to pull this

230
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,840
out of your hat.

231
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,559
An opportunist like you

232
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,759
will never gain my father's approval.

233
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,679
If we're in Luoyang,

234
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,080
you'll be the food for the fish.

235
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,039
Spicy.

236
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:56,240
And you are cheeky.

237
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,480
I love it.

238
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,360
Go away!

239
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,200
Don't waste your time. Let's go.

240
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,480
Pull another trick again
and I will not go easy on you.

241
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,240
Go and hit me.

242
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:10,720
Miss Wen,

243
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,320
you are cordially invited to my abode.

244
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,440
Let me change your mind.

245
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:16,879
What do you plan to do?

246
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:18,360
Born anew?

247
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:20,559
I get it now.

248
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,600
You don't like my persona.

249
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,240
Easy.

250
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,440
Come.

251
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,799
Bring me my golden pot.

252
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:31,919
That's a golden pot.

253
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,080
It's real.

254
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:35,799
What is he up to?

255
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:36,720
- Come.
- God knows.

256
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,480
Since Miss Wen doesn't like my persona,

257
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,279
then I

258
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,480
shall turn over a new leaf.

259
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
From now on,

260
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:56,919
I will not
visit indulgent places like this.

261
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,279
As the saying goes,

262
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:00,720
it's never too late to change.

263
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,600
My wife,

264
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:03,360
are you pleased?

265
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,279
Heed my advice.

266
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,080
Get some grass-leaf sweet flag,

267
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,440
borneol and styrax.

268
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,200
Get them quickly.

269
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,759
Why?

270
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,240
It's to cure your brain.

271
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,240
You look like a simple man,

272
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,120
but you're quite witty yourself.

273
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,200
Interesting.

274
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,120
Interesting.

275
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,399
Don't let me see you again.

276
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:30,960
If I see you,

277
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,360
I'll beat you.

278
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:32,840
Let's go.

279
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,679
It seems like

280
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:43,960
my future wife doesn't want me.

281
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,080
Any fine women here

282
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,679
want to take me in?

283
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,639
Let's drink to keep ourselves warm.

284
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,000
Come.

285
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,440
Sure, mister.

286
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,000
Let's go.

287
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,080
Shameless, perverted,

288
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,639
deviant, disgusting.

289
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,279
Swine!

290
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,840
Stop it.

291
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,480
People think you're yelling at me.

292
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,240
It's none of your business.

293
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,960
A grown man mingles
with a bunch of women.

294
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,360
Worse, those sorts of women.

295
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,120
I'm so pissed.

296
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,639
I want to punch him.

297
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,399
My perfume pouch is gone.

298
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,096
(Six Half Hall)

299
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,120
Wrong move.

300
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,200
If you place it there,
you'll have seven moves left.

301
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,840
There

302
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,200
you'll have three moves left.

303
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,759
Why are you upset?

304
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,159
I'm not as smart as you.

305
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:15,639
I admit defeat.

306
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:18,759
Chief Elder, you lost to me in chess

307
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,600
but in the martial arts world, even
Su Mengzhen isn't as smart as you.

308
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:25,000
You tried to kill the one
he looks after in front of him.

309
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:28,039
Everyone has heard about it.

310
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:31,480
Stop coddling.

311
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,679
I know the ones in charge
of the business in the north

312
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,720
have been dealt with.

313
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,240
We need to elect another capable person
to handle it again.

314
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:40,360
Can

315
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,279
I?

316
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,840
You want the business in the north?

317
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:56,200
Are you willing to sacrifice
your eyes and your tongue?

318
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:58,960
If so, I'll let you handle it.

319
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,360
Are you then?

320
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,440
I'll miss them.

321
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,360
So you can't handle the business.

322
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,240
So

323
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,159
I'm always an outsider.

324
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:15,879
Patience.

325
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,840
I'll give you

326
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,159
a mission.

327
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:22,320
Once it's done, you'll handle
the business in the north.

328
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,039
What do you want?

329
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:24,639
Go back to your home

330
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:27,159
and bring me the Five Warriors.

331
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,279
Incorporate them into Six Half Hall.

332
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:29,919
Once it's done,

333
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,440
the business in the north is yours.

334
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,559
Third Elder.

335
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,480
A message for you.

336
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,120
I thought you
might be with the Chief Elder

337
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,519
so I brought it here.

338
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,799
Thank you, First Elder Di.

339
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,159
It seems like you're visiting
Pili Sect, Lei Mei.

340
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,000
So you knew, First Elder Di.

341
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Pili Sect is the brainchild
of my father.

342
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:03,600
Now that he's gone,

343
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,799
you're so eager to squeeze the sect

344
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:06,880
dry.

345
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,720
You're mistaken, Lei Mei.

346
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:11,160
You are the brainchild

347
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,039
of your father.

348
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,200
If sacrificing Pili Sect
can guarantee your safety,

349
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,680
I'm sure he will do it.

350
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,480
Also,

351
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,680
you know Chief Elder's tantrum.

352
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,319
Crossing him

353
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,480
is equal to a death wish.

354
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,319
Third Elder.

355
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,119
Nan sent you the letter

356
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,880
but this meal is on me.

357
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,519
Please sit down.

358
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,079
Not too long ago,

359
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:04,480
you were still a penniless man.

360
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:06,119
And now,

361
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,640
you're the Vice House Master
of Sunset Drizzle.

362
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,160
You now have the money and the fame.

363
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,880
Even your demeanor is different.

364
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,319
The Capital is a place full of miracles.

365
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,640
Miracles?

366
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,079
Several months ago,
I was on the wanted list.

367
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,559
I lived under constant fear

368
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,240
and had to sprinkle beans by my door
every night before I slept

369
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,079
in case someone came to take my life.

370
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,839
I thought I would have to flee forever.

371
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,680
At that time,

372
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,279
I did not believe in any miracle.

373
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,079
A toast

374
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,960
to you for encountering a miracle.

375
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,799
Lei Mei,

376
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,599
have you turned down an opportunity?

377
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,200
Never.

378
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,599
Why?

379
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,440
An opportunity is like a soul mate.

380
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,599
If you miss it, it'll forever be gone.

381
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:08,920
People like us

382
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,039
are chasing after lofty goals.

383
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:12,960
Why would we turn down anything

384
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,200
that will allow us to move upward?

385
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,519
Because you lack a sense of security.

386
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,279
You wouldn't turn it down

387
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:20,880
because you don't dare to.

388
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,599
I have turned it down.

389
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:26,799
That's our difference.

390
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:29,119
You took a risk.

391
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:32,240
You turned down an Elder position
in Six Half Hall

392
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,920
and waited to see
what you would be offered.

393
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,240
And now, you're the Vice House Master
of Sunset Drizzle.

394
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,480
Look around you.

395
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,960
The liquor,

396
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,279
your seat,

397
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,279
the reverence,

398
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,799
you won them all from the gamble.

399
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:48,960
I can sit here

400
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,480
not because I'm the Vice House Master.

401
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:54,039
It's because they know
we are regulars here.

402
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,799
It's all thanks to you.

403
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,720
Fortunately, Sunset Drizzle
gave me a place to stay.

404
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,680
I have some extra money

405
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:09,400
to buy you a meal here.

406
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,039
I don't like to be indebted to anyone.

407
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:16,920
Is it enough?

408
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:29,000
And with this?

409
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:35,400
Vice House Master Bai,

410
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,960
you owe me more than one meal.

411
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:39,960
You'll know why soon.

412
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,680
We'll see.

413
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,680
Oh,

414
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,519
you mentioned miracles.

415
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:55,240
A miracle came to me

416
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:56,920
because I turned down something,

417
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:58,640
not because I was given something.

418
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:00,759
Lei Mei,

419
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,240
one day, I hope you
have the choice to say no.

420
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:06,960
Later.

421
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:20,400
Nan,

422
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:23,480
fetch me my cloak.

423
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,440
Noted,

424
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,000
Third Elder.

425
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,655
(Maple Bridge)

426
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,647
(Maple Bridge)

427
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,279
Third Elder,

428
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,200
are you heading to River Chu

429
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,720
to visit Pili Sect
per Chief Elder's request?

430
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:03,094
(Maple Bridge)

431
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:06,920
Yes.

432
00:22:49,641 --> 00:22:50,842
(Tombstone of Beloved Wife, Guan Zhaodi.
Daughter: Lei Chun, Brother: Guan Qi)

433
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,799
Another year has gone by.

434
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,960
Do you remember what mother looked like?

435
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:56,799
I can never forget.

436
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,160
During the bitter cold night that year,

437
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,039
if Madam hadn't taken me in,

438
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,119
I'd have been frozen to death
by the street.

439
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,440
I will never forget
what she looked like.

440
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:16,279
But I have forgotten.

441
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:19,960
Chun,

442
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,440
you were still small back then.

443
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:23,359
You

444
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:25,720
take after her.

445
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,680
Father might have forgotten too.

446
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,240
After he met her,

447
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:38,079
he stopped visiting Mother.

448
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:43,480
Not even during the tomb-sweeping
festival or her death anniversary.

449
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,480
Another one bites the dust.

450
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,000
Last time, it was Su Zhemu.

451
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:31,440
Who died this time?

452
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,960
She is dead.

453
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,359
This liquor

454
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,039
is for her.

455
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:46,799
You are one

456
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,839
who cries crocodile tears.

457
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:53,200
I'm sure many skeletons here

458
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:55,799
were once your friends.

459
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:58,559
And you killed them all.

460
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:00,240
What now?

461
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:03,559
Thought of the one you killed by mistake

462
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:05,680
and you feel a pang of guilt?

463
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:11,480
You're down under

464
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,519
so you don't know the date.

465
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,680
I don't blame you.

466
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,799
Today is the death anniversary
of your sister.

467
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:27,799
You killed her too.

468
00:25:27,824 --> 00:25:29,392
(Guan Qi, Mitian Sect)

469
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,599
I'm waiting

470
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,039
for the day you die!

471
00:25:58,279 --> 00:25:59,480
Greetings, Mr. Thirteen.

472
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,480
(Yuan Xian, Thirteen Doom)

473
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:03,359
(Yuan Xian, Thirteen Doom)
What brought you here, Marquis?

474
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,039
It's the beginning of a new month.

475
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:07,400
I wish to see my foster father,

476
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,640
to pay him a visit.

477
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,960
Nothing of import then.

478
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,519
Your foster father
is indisposed at the moment.

479
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,480
Please return.

480
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:21,079
Do I need to repeat myself?

481
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,640
Please tell him

482
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:26,799
that I came.

483
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,119
I shall take my leave.

484
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,319
Yingkan.

485
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,039
Yes, Mr. Thirteen?

486
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,880
I like your name.

487
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,839
Yingkan.

488
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,960
Yingkan.

489
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,640
That's the name befitting
of a bystander.

490
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,279
Many interesting things
have happened in the Capital lately.

491
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,279
Just watch.

492
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,759
Do not meddle in them.

493
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:54,319
Right.

494
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,599
Your foster father always says

495
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,640
that poems can nurture sentiments,

496
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,440
paintings can nurture character.

497
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:02,079
If you're bored,

498
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,400
find him some poems or drawings.

499
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,680
That should be your priority.

500
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:13,119
Yes, Mr. Thirteen.

501
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,400
See you.

502
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:42,200
(My wife,
please join me in Fengyue Inn.)

503
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,240
(Your perfume pouch
is in my safekeeping.)

504
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,960
(It palliates this forlornness.)

505
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,119
Opportunist!

506
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,319
Just go away.

507
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,000
What's the matter?

508
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,599
Who got on your nerves?

509
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,839
He stole my perfume pouch

510
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,039
and teased me.

511
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,279
I have to settle the score with him.

512
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,079
Calm down.

513
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,039
Here. Have a seat.

514
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,839
He is cheeky.

515
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,240
But knowing him,

516
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:10,119
the more attention you give him,

517
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:11,240
the better he feels.

518
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,839
But I want him to stop pestering me.

519
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:14,160
All right.

520
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,400
Calm down first.

521
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:17,359
Let me handle him

522
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,440
for you.

523
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:22,960
Okay.

524
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,240
Come again next time.

525
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,559
Have a look!

526
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:28,400
Look at my wares.

527
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:29,319
New arrival!

528
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:31,000
Mister, have a look.

529
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,079
I just imported these accessories.

530
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,880
Do you like any of them?

531
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:38,519
Excellent choice.

532
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:39,480
I have this necklace, please.

533
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,559
Sure, one guan, please.

534
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:43,000
Here.

535
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,400
There you go.

536
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,559
Thanks, mister.

537
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:47,960
Come again.

538
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:25,680
The rooftop opens to a great view.

539
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:26,880
My wife,

540
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,160
come up here.

541
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,640
I picked this spot

542
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:48,359
so that I can enjoy the scenery
with my wife.

543
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:51,039
A beautiful scene is best enjoyed

544
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,680
with a beauty in my arms.

545
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,519
But you came

546
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,279
instead.

547
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:00,680
What a shame.

548
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:02,960
You're not good enough for her,

549
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,880
despite

550
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:06,559
your pretty face.

551
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:07,920
Your manner is just repulsive.

552
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,839
After idling for many years,

553
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:12,720
I have forgotten how to behave properly.

554
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,359
Come.

555
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:16,680
I don't mind you as well.

556
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,559
Drink with me.

557
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,319
I'm not interested.

558
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,079
Give me back her perfume pouch

559
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:21,640
and I'll leave.

560
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:23,240
Also, I'm here to tell you

561
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:24,839
to stop pestering her.

562
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,720
Pestering?

563
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:28,920
I'm not pestering.

564
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,880
I love Wen Rou.

565
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,400
Am I not allowed to court her?

566
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:35,039
You, on the other hand,

567
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,839
dog around her all day long

568
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,559
for some reason.

569
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,000
That's pestering.

570
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,200
You claim that you love her

571
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:42,960
but do you know her?

572
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,160
I don't.

573
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,519
But when I see her face,

574
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,200
smell her scent,

575
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:52,680
my heart is aflutter.

576
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,079
That's perversion.

577
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:56,400
If you like someone,
you should respect her first.

578
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,799
Liking somebody

579
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,799
is all about your feelings.

580
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,799
Respect your own feelings.

581
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:05,880
As to how to make
the other person happy,

582
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,920
that depends on your skill.

583
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,799
Don't worry.

584
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,359
I

585
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,720
am good at it.

586
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,880
God forgive me.

587
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,920
If I don't hit him today,

588
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:21,599
I'll never forgive myself.

589
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,480
A gentleman never fights.

590
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,400
This is what you're after, isn't it?

591
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,319
If I hand it to you like this,

592
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:38,200
it will reflect badly on me.

593
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,559
Snatch it from me

594
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,759
if you can.

595
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,160
You must be tired.

596
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,160
Come.

597
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,079
Give it to me.

598
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:05,160
Fine.

599
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,720
I'll give it to you.

600
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:16,319
You!

601
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,160
Oh, it fell into the well.

602
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,000
I...

603
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,480
You won't retrieve it?

604
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,559
Oh, you're not willing
to drench yourself for Wen Rou.

605
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:25,960
I'll go then.

606
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,079
I'm already all wet for Wen Rou.

607
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:28,880
Just wait here.

608
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,240
This is a classified place
of Six Half Hall.

609
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:55,799
Before long,

610
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,200
someone will be here.

611
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,279
Good luck getting out of there.

612
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,680
Marquis.

613
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:34,960
The perimeter is clear?

614
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,680
Yes.

615
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,880
Once the well is sealed,

616
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:09,440
within seconds,

617
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,840
water will flood it.

618
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:12,920
Who are you?

619
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:16,679
I do not matter.

620
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,800
Seven inches above your left hand,

621
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,400
there is one movable brick.

622
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,079
It's a device.

623
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,000
Turn it

624
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,599
to open this door.

625
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:16,079
There is a candlestick behind you.

626
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,159
If you have a match on you,

627
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:21,880
light it up.

628
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,920
I have been kept under
the well for so long.

629
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,320
I can't believe
I get to see a living person.

630
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,400
Young man.

631
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,599
Who are you?

632
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,519
I'm Wang Xiaoshi.

633
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:11,400
Who are you, mister?

634
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:13,119
Me?

635
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,119
I'm a prisoner.

636
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:19,880
A prisoner?

637
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,679
For a long time?

638
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:33,400
I have lost track of time.

639
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:36,239
I suppose I've been kept here

640
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,719
for a very long time.

641
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:41,880
Who is heartless enough

642
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:43,480
to subject you

643
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,480
to this?

644
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,679
Lei Sun kept me here.

645
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,559
You know him?

646
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,360
He is the Chief Elder of Six Half Hall.

647
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,199
Everyone knows him.

648
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,920
Is that so?

649
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,000
What about Guan Qi?

650
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:02,960
Mitian Sect?

651
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,199
What has the martial arts world

652
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,480
become?

653
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:18,199
Mister, do you know a way out?

654
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,239
Young man.

655
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,719
Unhook me

656
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,599
and I'll tell you the way out.

657
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,400
Come.

658
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,320
Hurry up.

659
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,440
That's it.

660
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:39,519
Now.

661
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:43,400
Mister, you need to tell me

662
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,199
why Lei Sun is keeping you here.

663
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,440
You see the child remains over there?

664
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:55,960
He wore bells around his ankle.

665
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:04,960
He was my son.

666
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,280
He died in front of me,

667
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,400
turned into a skeleton.

668
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,719
The skeletons here

669
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:15,880
are the people Lei Sun killed.

670
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:18,840
He hates me the most

671
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:21,119
so he doesn't want me to die easily.

672
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,400
He imprisoned me here

673
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,880
so that I'll suffer a fate
worse than death.

674
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:32,400
The mechanism

675
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:34,280
was installed to keep me from escaping.

676
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:35,480
Hesitate more

677
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,000
and we'll both drown here.

678
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:39,599
What are you waiting for?

679
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,599
We have no time!

680
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:44,119
Unhook me now.

681
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,719
Freedom is mine again!

682
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,519
I haven't seen the moon in a while.

683
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:34,599
Mister, it's not safe here.

684
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,000
We should leave.

685
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:37,800
Let me take a breather.

686
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:39,960
We don't have the time.

687
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:40,679
Pardon me.

688
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:03,559
The guards were all killed.

689
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,920
When the ones on shift arrived,

690
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,360
the prisoner is gone.

691
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:10,280
What should we do with those people?

692
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,880
We have no time for them.

693
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,960
Just settle it with the rules in place.

694
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:14,840
Yes, sir.

695
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,136
(Star-snatching Hall)

696
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:29,199
So?

697
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,199
He was released.

698
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:32,039
We have assembled all Elders
in the Capital.

699
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,239
Everyone is ready.

700
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,440
Don't you worry, Chief Elder.

701
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,679
Whoever this prisoner is,

702
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:38,119
he will be captured
either alive or dead.

703
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,559
Listen up.

704
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,880
All scouting squads

705
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,320
will be divided into two teams.

706
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:44,760
Whichever team finds the prisoner first

707
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,679
will run back

708
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:48,239
and report to me in the Hall.

709
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,480
What?

710
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,159
You think you can capture

711
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:53,239
him?

712
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:56,719
Do you truly have no idea who he is?

713
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,559
If he is free,

714
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,320
no one will be able to catch him again.

715
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,599
Understood?

716
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:02,800
Yes, sir.

717
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,400
Go now!

718
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,840
Yes, sir.

(Six Half Hall)

721
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,079
We should move.

this is where you should stab.
