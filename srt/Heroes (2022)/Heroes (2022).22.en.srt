The gift of the Six Half Hall has arrived!

33
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,159
Are they here to mess things up?

34
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,560
They're finally here.

35
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,400
I'm Lei Dongtian, and these
are my men from Six Half Hall.

36
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,400
Greetings, House Master Su.

37
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,800
House Master Su,
you're heroic and intelligent.

38
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:17,599
The Six Half Hall is willing to bow down.

39
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,520
We're willing to follow you.

40
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,319
Where is Di Feijing?

41
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,080
First Elder Di is unwell today.

42
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:31,120
That's why he told us
to send the gift on his behalf.

43
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,719
Since it is a gift,

44
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,800
why did you guys bring a coffin here?

45
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,479
Of course it's because we hope

46
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,719
House Master Su can strike it rich
and ascend the ranks.

47
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,159
Chief Elder Lei is dead.

48
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,960
His forces are under my rule now.
The same goes for the coffin.

49
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,439
All right.

50
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,240
I will accept the gift.

51
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,400

53
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,039
You knew that I was coming, huh?

54
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,000
You actually sent a coffin to my banquet.

55
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,280
Why else do you think

56
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,800
the Six Half Hall could come inside

57
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,360
without any difficulties?

58
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,879
I am the devil's incarnate
when I wield the blade.

59
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,719
Without you,

60
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
I'll be very lonely.

61
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:57,759
Why?

62
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,360
Why?

63
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,319
Back then, in order to survive,

64
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,680
I killed my father in front of you.

65
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,680
I survive until now

66
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,199
so that I could kill you

67
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,959
with my own hands!

68
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,360
When you take a life,
you have to pay the price.

69
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,360
You can get your revenge.

70
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,079
However, you're not capable enough

71
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,639
to take my life.

72
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,360
Chief Elder!

73
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,879
We haven't lost yet!

74
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,639
We haven't lost!

75
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,800
We lost.

76
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,040
Just admit defeat already.

77
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,399
Mr. Su,

78
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,560
please grant me a quick death,

79
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:10,879
and let them go.

80
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,519
You don't need to die.

81
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,519
I can let you leave this place alive.

82
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,279
I don't get to decide
my actions when I'm alive.

83
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,240
You should at least let me decide

84
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,839
how I die.

85
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:28,680

86
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,680

87

Chief Elder!

88
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,920
Chief Elder!

89
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,399
My death won't be in vain.

90
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,040
Father!

91
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,040
Father.

92
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,439
How did this happen?

93
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:15,240
Do not avenge me.

94
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,160
If you must...

95
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,160
Father?

96
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,959
Father!

97
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,439
Father!

98
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:32,960
Father!

99
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,559
Father!

100
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,559
Physician Shu, how is his condition?

101
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:40,200
House Master Su
has been sick all his life.

102
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,039
Even so, he took on
several fights and was injured.

103
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,240
His vigor has been depleted.

104
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,799
He's exhausted
both physically and mentally.

105
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,480
He harbored excess grief

106
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:50,279
and kept everything to himself.

107
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,000
That's why he ended up like this.

108
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,720
I've already sent
a messenger pigeon to my father

109
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,360
and requested my family's
secret medicine recipe

110
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,120
to be delivered to the Capital.

111
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,799
Physician Shu, I just hope
that you can stabilize

112
00:09:58,799 --> 00:09:59,840
Mengzhen's condition for now

113
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,480
till the medicine arrives.

114
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,720
That's right.

115
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:05,159
The Wen family is renowned
for the medical skills.

116
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:07,759
It's best if we can
get your secret medicinal recipe.

117
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,080
However, House Master Su needs to rest
and recuperate for the next few days.

118
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,759
He mustn't attempt any rigorous activities.

119
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:20,159
That's for the best.

120
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,799
Understood.

121
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,480
Thank you, Physician Shu.

122
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,519
I shall take my leave now.

123
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:27,159
Thank you.

124
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,320
Please.

125
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:38,159
Mengzhen, don't get up!

126
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:40,960
Do you guys know

127
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,080
the best way to treat

128
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,679
my current condition?

129
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:44,320
Tell us.

130
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:47,799
That is to treat it as if I wasn't sick.

131
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:51,039
All of you should leave.

132
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:52,519
Let's go.

133
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,639
Chun, holding a funeral is exhausting.

134
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,639
Don't tire yourself out.

135
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,840
It's been two days
since you got any sleep.

136
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,679
Go and take a break.

137
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
Now that Father is gone,

138
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,919
Di, you have to protect

139
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,080
the Six Half Hall from now on.

140
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,080
Your father didn't let me go that day

141
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:47,200
not because he wanted me
to protect the Six Half Hall.

142
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,559
He wanted me to protect you.

When you take a life,
you have to pay the price.

145
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,159
We shall eradicate
the House of Sunset Drizzle

146
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:31,480
and trample upon Su Mengzhen's body!

147
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,960
Yes, sir!

148
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,559
Stop right there!

149
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:51,360
You guys are going to fight again
right after Chief Elder's passing?

150
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,399
Do you want Chief Elder

151
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,759
to wander the underworld
without any peace?

152
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:58,120
He's already dead.

153
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,960
Now, you're still talking about his peace?

154
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:03,399
Where were you
when Chief Elder was killed?

155
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,279
Father was the one
who forbade him to go.

156

Father went to Sunset Drizzle
to seek life in the midst of death.

to see you guys fall out with each other

as the Six Half Hall falls apart?

164
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,360
Since it was Chief Elder's
arrangement all along,

165
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,080
First Elder Di, you can be the ember all you like.

166
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,679
But, you don't get

167
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,320
to tell me what to do!

168
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,279
You want to seek revenge,

00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:48,039
and I know I shouldn't stop you.

170
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,799
Let me ask you this then.
How confident are you

171
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,080
in taking down Su Mengzhen?

172
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:57,000
Even if I have
to sacrifice everyone here,

173
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,440
I will eradicate

174
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,120
the House of Sunset Drizzle!

175
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,039
Eradicate them
and cause major bloodshed?

176
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,000
How many of their men will be sacrificed?

177
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,919
How many of our men will be sacrificed?

178
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,279
Is that the revenge you seek?

179
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:15,360
Do you want the Six Half Hall
to disappear from history?

180
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,000
With a grudge in your heart
and a blade in your hand,

181
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:24,080
it's easy for you

182
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:26,720
to kill your enemies.

183
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,720
But, doesn't that mean

184
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,559
all of Chief Elder's efforts

185
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,279
will be in vain?

186
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:32,799
You guys must remember this!

187
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,639
All of you are still alive,

188
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:38,039
thanks to Chief Elder's sacrifice!

189
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,080
Chief Elder is gone,
and the martial arts world has changed.

190
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,039
We need to change

191
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,720
our rules too.

192
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:05,639
This is the first rule.

193
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:07,080
From today onward,

194
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:09,000
the Six Half Hall will unite as one.

195
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,559
All of you may speak up,

196
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:12,360
but only one person will make the decision.

197
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:14,480
It will be me.

198
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,080
Your affairs are under my jurisdiction.

199
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,039
This is the second rule.
You must endure.

200
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,399
Keep your hatred in your heart,

201
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,360
and your blade in your sheath.

202
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:27,000
No matter how hard it is,

203
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,600
you guys have to do it.

204
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,840
You guys are armed.

205
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:34,240
If anyone is unsatisfied,
you may come and challenge me.

206
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,039
I will yield.

207
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:45,360
But I want to ask you something.

208
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:47,600
How long do we have to endure?

209
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,320
You guys might think

210
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:50,840
that although Chief Elder is gone,

211
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,720
Su Mengzhen is terminally ill
and seriously wounded.

212
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,639
You might think this
is the best opportunity to avenge him.

213
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:57,039
But, in my opinion,

214
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,240
we're only seeing their weakness

215
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,519
because they show it to us on purpose.

216
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,159
When we see their strength,

217
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,360
that might be their weakness instead.

218
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,799
Now, the House of Sunset Drizzle
is the dominant sect.

219
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,279
That is their strength

220
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:11,519
and their weakness.

221
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,519
They cannot survive for long
as a dominant sect.

222
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:16,759
We will endure and monitor them

223
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:19,600
until the day they fall out with each other.

224
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,399
When that day arrives,

225
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,840
that will be the day for us to seek revenge!

226
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:31,679
Yes, First Elder Di!

227
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,759
Returning to the underworld!

228
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,676
(Memorial Tablet of Beloved Father, Lei Sun)

229
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,720
Separated from the living!

230
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,079
Wishing for a smooth journey!

231
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:14,519
Deities, show us the path!

232
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,960
Under Minister Fu's order,

233
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,279
we're here to send
Chief Elder Lei on his last journey.

234
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,400
This is the money for Chief Elder Lei's
journey to the underworld.

235
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:28,559
This is Minister Fu's order too.

236
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:48,599
Returning to the underworld!

237
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,599
Separated from the living!

238
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,839
Wishing for a smooth journey!

239
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,640
Deities, show us the path!

240
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,000
Back then, Lei Sun came
to see me with 300 gold taels.

241
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,680
He told me

242
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:19,000
that it was everything he had.

243
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,400
But he said he could

244
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,880
help me make 3,000 gold taels,
or even 30,000 gold taels in the future.

245
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,680
And,

246
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,240
he did fulfill his promise.

247
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,680
I did help him to establish a
foothold in the martial arts world too.

248
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:39,880
Since he's dead,
his debt should be called off.

249
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,240
I've returned the 300 gold taels to Lei Sun

250
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:47,759
so that he won't haunt the human world.

251
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:56,960
Lei.

252
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,240
Rest in peace.

253
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,759
Do not miss

254
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:09,400
the human world.

255
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,079
Shocked by bewilderment!

256
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,079
To the west he goes!

257
00:19:31,165 --> 00:19:33,553
(Memorial Tablet of Beloved Father, Lei Sun)

258
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:37,160
Ancestors, bless him!

259
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,640
Today is my father's funeral procession.

260
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,000
No one is to disturb his peace.

261
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,920
Under the House Master's order,

262
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,519
we're here to offer
Chief Elder Lei some liquor of honor

263
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,759
and a lantern of safety.

264
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,200
Toward extreme bliss!

265
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:02,599
Bury the hatchet!

266
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,160
Shattered tiles as jade!

267
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,160
To be reborn anew!

268
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,200
Farewell, Chief Elder Lei!

269
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,759
To the west he goes!

270
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:43,160
Ancestors, bless him!

271
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,319
You're drinking such strong liquor
right after your injury.

272
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,319
Are you trying to kill yourself?

273
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,680
In the past, I was troubled.

274
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,960
The liquor here tasted bitter to me.

275
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,400
But now that the trouble
has been resolved,

276
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,720
why does the liquor

277
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,240
still taste bitter to me?

278
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,000
Once you're used to feeling bitter,

279
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,759
it's hard for you to feel something else.

280
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,960
But no matter how tough it is,
you should learn how to forgive yourself.

281
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:54,000
You can cry if you feel like it.

282
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,079
You'll feel better after that.

283
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:02,440
Back then, I saw Lei Sun
injuring my father personally.

284
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,359
How I wished to kill him back then.

285
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,680
But when I looked at my father,

286
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,680
I knew he wanted me to stay alive.

287
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,359
I could only get my revenge by staying alive.

288
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,599
In order to acquire Lei Sun's trust,

289
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:23,400
I dealt the killing blow myself.

290
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,880
I killed my father.

291
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,920
From that moment onward,

292
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:31,920
I knew

293
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,519
getting revenge
was the only reason for me to live.

294
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:39,599
But sometimes, I hate myself for it.

295
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:43,920
If back then,
I didn't understand what he meant,

296
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:47,160
would my life

297
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:51,319
turn out differently?

298
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,079
It's been so many years.

299
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:02,599
I sold myself to Lei Sun,

300
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:05,279
trying to please him like a pet.

301
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,119
I had to wag my tail and sacrifice my dignity,

302
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,519
just to kill him one day.

303
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,400
But the funny thing is,
now that Lei Sun is dead,

304
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:20,920
I have

305
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,079
lost my reason to stay alive.

306
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,279
Of course you have a reason to stay alive.

307
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,640
You were just trapped
by your hatred for too long.

308
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,519
Now that you've exacted revenge on him,

309
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,440
you own your future now.

310
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,480
From today onward,

311
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,240
you have to live on

312
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,599
for your own sake.

313
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:43,079
I think

314
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,920
this is what your father
would've wished to see.

315
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,240
I knew that you're the one who saved me

316
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,000
on the night I killed Li Niantang.

317
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,759
If you need any protection,

318
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:04,079
I, Bai Choufei, will protect you
for the rest of my life.

319
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,359
If you wish to be free,

320
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,759
you can go anywhere you like.

321
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,759
Lei Mei.

322
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,960
Now, you have the freedom to choose.

323
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,119
Choufei is leaving us, right?

324
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,400
I'm your big brother.

325
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,319
I'm his big brother too.

326
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:45,759
I can at least guess

327
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:47,839
what my brothers are thinking.

328
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:49,640
Even if Choufei is leaving,

329
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,880
we're just working for separate factions.

330
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:53,640
The three of us are still brothers.

331
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:56,079
We'll be brothers forever.

332
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:07,000
When I first met you,

333
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,839
you felt strangely familiar to me.

334
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:14,720
It was as if we knew each other long ago.

335
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,759
Me too.

336
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,119
Back then, I had just come
from Baixu Garden.

337
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:26,599
I just wanted to roam
the world freely for a little while.

338
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:29,200
Just like what Wen Rou said,

339
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,200
I was just a silly kid.

340
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,599
You aren't silly.

341
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,400
You just pretend

342
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:35,839
to be silly most of the time.

343
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,759
Mengzhen, it sounds

344
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,440
as if you're trying
to give me an obvious hint.

345
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:46,200
Let me ask you this.

346
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,440
What do you plan to do next?

347
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,400
Mengzhen, you should know
what I'm planning to do.

348
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:56,599
Youqiao Group is related
to the death of my parents.

349
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,480
Although Lei Sun is dead,

350
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:00,079
the mastermind behind him

351
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,759
is still lurking in the shadows.

352
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,519
To put it in the bigger picture,

353
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:05,400
I wish to be like you, Mengzhen.

354
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,680
I wish to contribute
to the martial arts world.

355
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,279
To put it in the smaller picture,

356
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:11,440
I wish to roam freely.

357
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,519
There must be somewhere
for me to roam freely.

358
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,799
With your personality,
you can take care of yourself just fine.

359
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:23,599
However, if you wish
to protect the people around you,

360
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,359
you'll suffer in the martial arts world.

361
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,559
However, if you take over my position,

362
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,759
you can do anything,
even launch an investigation.

363
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:42,079
Many people will help you out.

364
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,319
Mengzhen,

365
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,559
actually, no matter
if I take over this position or not,

366
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,119
I will definitely do the things

367
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,400
I want to do.

368
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:01,599
Even if no one helps me out,

369
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,799
I'll still do them.

370
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,599
Mengzhen.

371
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,519
You haven't fully recovered yet.
You should be resting on your bed.

372
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:01,592
(Second Year of Song-Yuan)
A lonely hawk flies toward the azure mountain,

373
00:28:01,593 --> 00:28:03,839
(Drawn by Bai Youjin)
reaching the pale sky.

374
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,839
This is a great painting.

375
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:08,920
Am I right,

376
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,640
Bai Youjin?

377
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,920
Mengzhen, how did you know?

378
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,200
Actually,

379
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:23,119
I already knew about it

380
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,079
when Chun gave me the first painting.

381
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:28,200
That's right.

382
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:31,359
You know everything all along.

383
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:43,720
In the past,

384
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,680
it was hard for us to see each other

385
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,319
because there was
an impassable obstacle blocking our way.

386
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,400
Now that

387
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,599
her father is gone,

388
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:59,720
I actually lost the right to see her again.

389
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:03,960
I do hope

390
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,000
that I had the right
to stab Lei Sun in the heart.

391
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,440
You always aspire to reach the sky.

392
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:16,400
Now, there are not many people
who are as influential as Lei Sun

393
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,039
in the martial arts world.

394
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,039
Why don't you stab me instead?

395
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,359
I once told you

396
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,599
that you could enter
this chamber at any time.

397
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:34,880
Today, only the two of us are here.

398
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:36,559
I wish to know

399
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,160
your thoughts about our ties.

400
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,279
That day, at the Across The Sea Hall,

401
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,960
all eyes were on you.

402
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:53,039
I was envious of you.

403
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,000
Mengzhen, I don't wish to deceive you.

404
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,440
I wish to become the next you
and have all eyes on me.

405
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:04,079
However, there could only be one figure
like you in the House of Sunset Drizzle.

406
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,519
I understand what you mean.

407
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,200
Since you aspire to reach the sky,

408
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,359
I will not stop you.

409
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,799
I respect your decision.

410
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,862
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

411
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:45,160
(At six o'clock p.m,)

412
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,240
(I hope everyone can gather
at Fenglin Restaurant.)

413
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,880
(No matter if we stay together
or separated after this,)

414
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:52,119
(I wish to treat you guys to a drink.)

415
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:52,989
(Su Mengzhen, Wen Rou)

416
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,279
(I wish to tell you guys
about the story of Retainment.)

417
00:31:56,323 --> 00:31:57,184
(Lei Chun, Bai Choufei)

418
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,000
House Master.

419
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,640
(Lei Chun)

420
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,759
Retainment

421
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:43,000
is a backsword.

422
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,799
It was forged
by a master sword-smith 300 years ago.

423
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,799
This sword has an extremely sharp edge.

424
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,119
He hurt his beloved woman with this sword

425
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:54,799
by accident.

426
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:56,920
He regretted it all his life.

427
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,279
Right before he died,

428
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,200
he sealed off one edge of the sword.

429
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:04,720
He hoped that his successors
could wield the sword

430
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,160
with a heart of retainment.

431
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,960
After that, it was imparted
to the Carefree Sect.

432
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,279
The founder of the sect, Wei Sanqing,

433
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,839
had three students.

434
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:19,160
They were Divine Marquis Zhuge, Thirteen Doom,

435
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:21,039
and my Master, Recluse Tianyi.

436
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:24,680
But all three of them
couldn't inherit the sword.

437
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:32,559
Divine Marquis Zhuge once said

438
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:34,880
that his life wasn't in vain

439
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,079
after seeing that beautiful flower.

440
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,559
He meant the woman he loved.

441
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,680
He has achieved countless
achievements in life,

442
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,799
but he couldn't inherit Retainment.

443
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:46,400
I guess it's because
he couldn't retain his beloved woman.

444
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,839
Rumor has it

445
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:51,759
that Thirteen Doom was a sore loser.

446
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:54,559
He was obsessed
with martial arts all his life.

447
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,640
And, he finally mastered
the Arrow of Sorrow.

448
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:58,680
However, on the day
he mastered the martial art,

449
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,000
he suddenly descended into madness

450
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,559
and killed his wife.

451
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,160
I think he couldn't inherit Retainment

452
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,359
because

453
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:09,159
he couldn't retain his own nature.

454
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,840
My father once said

455
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,920
that true winners
are those who could endure losses.

456
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,679
After listening
to the story of Thirteen Doom,

457
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,239
I think he's right.

458
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,400
Sore losers can never win.

459
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,440
What about your master?

460
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,039
Why couldn't he inherit Retainment?

461
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,039
Initially, my Master was actually
very close with the other two.

462
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,679
But after that, the two of them

463
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,159
became sworn enemies.

464
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:32,679
That was the reason my master
gave up on inheriting the sword.

465
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:34,719
It's because he felt

466
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:38,199
he couldn't retain the ties
of his closest buddies.

467
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:55,079
To retain the world and its people;

468
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,159
to retain the times and you.

469
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:59,599
I'm the wielder of Retainment.

470
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,400
I have a heart of retainment.

471
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,039
I don't want history

472
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:07,159
to repeat itself.

473
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,000
Little Rock,

474
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,599
don't worry.

475
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,280
There's no grudge
between Mengzhen and me.

476
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,480
No matter when and where,

477
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,920
we will always be brothers.

478
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:46,400
Little Rock and I invited Chun.

479
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,039
Mengzhen, you didn't do it
of your own accord.

480
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,840
You should explain yourself to Chun.

481
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:04,719
Wang Xiaoshi didn't finish the story

482
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,519
of Retainment.

483
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:11,760
There was a lady called Jing.

484
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:13,360
Her father

485
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:16,519
died at the hands of Divine Marquis Zhuge

486
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,920
and Thirteen Doom.

487
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,960
In order to drive a wedge between them

488
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,360
and exact her revenge,

489
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:25,239
she married Thirteen Doom.

490
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,079
She didn't marry him

491
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,000
out of love. It was out of hatred.

492
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:32,079
She suffered for the rest of her life,

493
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:35,679
and she died at
the hands of Thirteen Doom.

494
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:42,480
The nuptial liquor

495
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,159
that we didn't manage to drink,

496
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,519
I will replace it with this.

497

as his enemy all his life.

00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,239
After tonight,

500
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,480
I shall do the same.

(Six Half Hall)

512
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,920
Who are you?

513
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:44,119
How dare you injure our guards

514
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:45,880
and barge into the Six Half Hall?

What's your goal?

They might not know who I am,

00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:57,840
but you should.

518

Keep your blades away.

Mr. Thirteen.

Mr. Thirteen, may I know

523
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,599
why you're here?

524
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:28,159
This is an order from the Chancellor.

525
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,639
Lei Sun can afford to die.

526
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,639
However, the Six Half Hall
must maintain its stability.

527
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:34,679
From now on,

528
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:38,119
I will take over the Six Half Hall.

529
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,239
He will be your new Chief Elder.

Him?

533
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,000
He's the new Chief Elder?

534
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:27,000
Greetings, Chief Elder.

535
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,880
What are you doing here?

536
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:54,239
Who said you could come in?

537
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,639
I'm the Chief Elder
of the Six Half Hall.

538
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,280
Of course I can go anywhere I like.

539
00:41:58,519 --> 00:41:59,519
But you?

540
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,599
You're no longer
the Young Lady of the Six Half Hall.

541
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:03,840
However, you have a chance

542
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,639
to be the Chief Elder's wife.

543
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:06,360
Scram!

544
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,679
Go away!

you shall stay here.
