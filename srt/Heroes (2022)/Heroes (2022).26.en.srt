Yes, sir!

00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,400
Hurry!

35
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,360
He didn't go outside?
Why did he go there instead?

36
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:27,680
It's as if he's looking for someone.

37
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,560
This is bad! We have to protect the Chancellor!

Protect the Chancellor?

39
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:32,599
We should protect Sir.

40
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,400
You should protect me instead!

41
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,759
Mr. Thirteen will protect the Chancellor!

you won't be able to escape today!

00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,280
you won't be able to touch the Chancellor.

48
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,800
Martial Uncle, you've been assisting the tyrant.

49
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,040
I'm sure you've committed
many despicable deeds.

50
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,879
Since we're in the same sect,

51
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,160
I will spare your life
if you give up right now.

52
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,879
I won't stop

53
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,600
until I kill Chancellor Cai.

54
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,759
You have no way to escape now.

55
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,600
This world belongs to us.

56
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,000

61
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,920
I've killed plenty of people.

62
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,639
How should I remember

63
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,240
if your mother was one of them?

64
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,079
Fine.

65
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,680
Let me send you to the underworld

66
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,480
so that you can reunite with your mother.

Mengzhen, I've returned.

Xiaoshi is executing
an important mission tonight.

77
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,079
Let's wait here for him.

78
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,120
I've heard about it.

79
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,920
I'm sure he'll be here.

83
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,519
Shut the gate so that the culprit can't escape!

00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,600
Yes, sir!

85
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,800
Hurry up!

86
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,519
Shut the city gate!

87
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:46,920
Yes, sir!

I was the one who killed Fu Zongshu.

94
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,040
It was my decision alone
to assassinate Chancellor Cai.

95
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,920
It has nothing to do with anyone else.

96
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,920
I don't feel like
killing more innocent people.

97
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,040
You guys can arrest me.

98
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,720
Follow me!

99
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,879
This is as far as I can take you to.

100
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,679
Take care.

101
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,600
Go up!

102
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,200
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

103
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,240
Shi Wukui is right outside the city gate.

104

He has prepared a horse for you.

105
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,320
Advisor, will I implicate the others in the House

106
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:10,600
if I leave like this?

107
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,320
Don't overthink it.

108
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,039
Your two brothers
are waiting for you at Kushuipu.

109
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,279

00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,320
I didn't expect so many things to happen

112
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,960
after returning from River Chu.

113
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,399
Little Rock has truly grown up.

114
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:46,879
Back then,

115
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,320
this is the place
where we first met each other.

116
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,159
I didn't expect us

117
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,679
to part ways at the same place.

118
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,679
Great timing.

119
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,279
I'll leave the rest to you now.

120
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:02,720
Mengzhen, have you
already come up with a plan?

121
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:08,279
For a certain period,

122
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:11,120
I might not be managing
the House of Sunset Drizzle anymore.

123
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,799
This time,

124
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,159
you mustn't leave again.

125
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,480
You will replace me
and take charge of the House.

126
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,519
Choufei,

127
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,519
you've always been bold and daring.

128
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:30,120
Even so, you need to maintain
a righteous and compassionate heart.

129
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:34,519
When you're in this position,

130
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,480
you can't just kill anyone you like.

131
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,799
If you kill every person

132
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:39,600
who isn't your friend,

133
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,279
you'll only end up in one way.

134
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,000
That is,

135
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,519
all of your friends
will turn into your enemies.

136
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:59,240
Mengzhen, I'm different from you.

137
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,799
I, Bai Choufei, don't need any friends.

138
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,519
Having you two as sworn brothers is enough.

139
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,840
But I know what you're thinking.

140
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,000
You're planning to
send Wang Xiaoshi away and

141
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,919
bear the heinous crime of assassinating
an important court official alone.

142
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:20,519
I object.

143
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,399
I'm the House Master.

144
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,519
I'll bear this responsibility.

145
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,480
Mengzhen!

146
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,279
Little Rock.

147
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,240
Bai, you're back too?

148
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,279
You'll bring down the entire sky

149
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:59,279
if I don't return now.

150
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:03,279
Fu Zongshu is dead.

151
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,639
But it's a pity

152
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,519
that I couldn't kill Chancellor Cai.

153
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,919
You guys shouldn't have saved me.

154
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,399
If you guys just ignored me,

155
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:13,639
the House might still
have a chance to survive.

156
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:18,639
You don't need to worry about that.

157
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,960
The Divine Marquis was here
before you arrived.

158
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,399
He has a way to exonerate your crime

159
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:24,399
and rid the House of suspicion.

160
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:27,759
That's right.

161
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,519
With his identity as the Divine Marquis,

162
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,399
it isn't that easy for Youqiao Group

163
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,360
to kill him.

164
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,120
The conflicts in the court are nothing
compared to the martial arts world.

165
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,480
We just need some time to plan it out.

166
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,200
However, our priority right now

167
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,600
is for you to leave.

168
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:42,559
Just leave.

169
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,639
Don't worry, Choufei and I will be fine.

170
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,200
Sorry, I've dragged you guys down this time.

171
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,320
You did this for the sake of the people.

172
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:00,320
This is what we should do

173
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,519
as your elder brothers.

174
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,320
You've done something we couldn't.

175
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,120
You're a hero.

176
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,879
However, heroes are always lonely.

177
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:17,080
They face perilous journeys too.

178
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,200
You must be careful in the future.

179
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,519
It's such a pity.

180
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,720
Now that you're back,

181
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:27,360
I have to leave.

182
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,960
Don't worry.

183
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,720
We'll surely reunite one day.

184
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,039
By then,

185
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:35,679
when Mengzhen has fully recovered
from his illness,

186
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,399
we can continue to
stay in Chou Shi House.

187
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:39,279
We can drink together, chat together,

188
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,960
and listen to
Wen Rou's prattle together.

189
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:42,159
We can drink until we drop.

190
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,519
By then, I would've traveled
across the mountains and rivers,

191
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,519
and had all kinds of interesting experiences.

192
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,039
I'm sure I have plenty of stories
to share with you guys.

193
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,240
You have to hurry and leave.

194
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:55,679
This place isn't completely safe.

195
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,799
You shouldn't stay here for too long.

196
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:57,840
Understood.

197
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,840
Mengzhen, actually, there's one more thing.

198
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,919
Just leave Wen Rou to me.

199
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,000
You should take care of yourself.

200
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,720
I don't know

201
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,639
when we'll meet again.

202
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,600
As long as the sky is intact and the road is around,

203
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,159
we will definitely reunite one day.

204
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,320
We'll wait for your return.

205
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,480
Take care.

206
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:40,600
Take care.

you just had to spout nonsense

I have had enough of you.

you have to travel 400 li westward.

We can't take the official road now.

265

But my needlework is pretty good.

269
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:16,119
Even though I can't do any rough chores,

270
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,839
I can learn how to gather firewood
and set up tents.

271
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:22,599
I don't have a bad temper.

272
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,599
However, if I have to stay outside all the time

273
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,839
and be exposed to the elements of nature,

274
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,519
I'll panic too.

275
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,759

I'm afraid the officials we can get in touch with

302
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,279
aren't influential enough
to do anything in this situation.

Before this, no one knew about his plan.

310
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:23,079
After this, all of you tried to apprehend him.

311
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,839
However, I pressured you guys to stop
as the House Master.

312

If someone asks you about this case,

314
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,680
you guys shall use this as your excuse.

315
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:34,559

What my brother did

318
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
was the same as what I did.

319
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,079
Don't worry. This isn't my first time
doing something like this.

House Master,

322
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,759
even if they don't dare to kill you or torture you,

323

the dungeon is damp and dark.

324
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:52,559
You won't be fed or dressed well.

325
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,039
Your body won't be able to take it.

326
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,519
House Master, please think twice!

327

Maybe we still have another way.

Sometimes,

329
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:03,039
we can only achieve the right thing

330
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,920
by making the wrong decision.

331
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,480
I've made up my mind.
Do not try to persuade me.

332
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:14,240
Even you're trying to stop me?

333
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,079
Of course I must stop you.

334
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:17,240
Not just that.

335
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,920
As the Vice House Master of
the House of Sunset Drizzle,

336
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,680
I shall remove you from your position
as the House Master.

337
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:24,559
What?

338
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,160
Su Mengzhen had proved himself
incompetent

339
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,559
by allowing Wang Xiaoshi
to kill an important court official.

340
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:31,160
He has jeopardized Sunset Drizzle.

341
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,839
It's reasonable for me
to remove you from your post.

342
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,039
The House of Sunset Drizzle was always
managed by capable individuals.

343
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:41,319
Su Mengzhen isn't fit to be
the House Master right now.

344
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:42,920
If so,

345
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:46,759
he should hand over the position of House Master.

346
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,000
Choufei,

347
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:50,920
this concerns the entire House of Sunset Drizzle.

348
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,680
You don't get to make the call alone.

349
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,319
Get out of my way!

350
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:57,079
Not just the Vice House Master.

351
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:59,039
I also think that Mr. Su

352
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,079
isn't fit to be the House Master.

353
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:01,799
I agree!

354
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:03,799
I agree!

355
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,440
We agree too!

356
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,759
Mr. Su tried to cover up
the mistake of his subordinate.

357
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:17,920
He should retire from the position.

358
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,039
House Master, please retire from your position.

359
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:28,240
Mengzhen,

360
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,839
sometimes, we can only achieve the right thing

361
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:32,480
by making the wrong decision.

362
00:23:38,508 --> 00:23:40,160
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

363
00:23:43,063 --> 00:23:48,102
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

364
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:50,799
I, Bai Choufei,
House Master of Sunset Drizzle,

365
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,599
wish to see the official in charge here.

366
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,359
I've heard about your deed

367
00:24:00,377 --> 00:24:00,996
(Studious Legacy)

368
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,000
in River Chu.

369
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,519
You did a great job.

370
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:05,200
Chancellor,

371
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:07,799
since I said I could manage
the Six Half Hall for you,

372
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,920
I would never disappoint you.

373
00:24:09,945 --> 00:24:10,892
(Studious Legacy)

374
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,680
I like your ruthlessness.

375
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,359
You need to have someone to depend on

376
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:16,799
before you can inherit the Six Half Hall.

377
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,960
I wish to take you as my foster daughter.

378
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:22,240
What do you think?

379
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,920
Greetings, Father.

380
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,559
Father, the Six Half Hall and I
are willing to serve you

381
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,960
with our lives.

382
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,559
What are you doing here?

383
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,279
Mr. Bai, how have you been

384
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,599
since our departure at River Chu?

385
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,640
Even though we part ways,
we shall reunite someday.

386
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,000
However, I didn't expect us
to reunite in such a manner.

387
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:11,440
Wang Xiaoshi killed Fu Zongshu
of the Ministry of Justice.

388
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:12,799
He fled.

389
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,680
The Chancellor sent me here
to ask you guys a question.

390
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:17,799
Who shall bear the consequences of his crime?

391
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,480
I shall.

392
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,160
You? Can you afford to bear the consequences?

393
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,920
Since the Chancellor sent you here
to pursue responsibilities,

394
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:25,039
naturally, it's an official affair.

395
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:27,680
Now, I'm the House Master of Sunset Drizzle.

396
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:29,079
Naturally, I can afford
to bear the consequences.

397
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,359
You've helped me out before.

398
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:32,839
I do not wish
to make things difficult for you.

399
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,319
I need to give you a reminder.

400
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,839
If you try to stand up for him now,

401
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,319
you'll die for it.

402
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:42,599
I'm not standing up for him.

403
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,960
Mr. Su is terminally ill.

404
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,400
I've already taken over
his position long ago.

405
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,559
I was the one responsible

406
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:48,480
for the House's operations lately.

407
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,559
And that includes Wang Xiaoshi's
mission to assassinate the official.

408
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:51,880
So,

409
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,799
arrest me if you must.

410
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:56,839
Arrogant and mighty,

411
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:59,039
just like a drawn bow.

412
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:00,839
I'll grant you your wish.

413
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,480
Take him away.

414
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,359
Yes.

415
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,400
But I don't want to grant
Su Mengzhen his wish.

416
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,240
Do you guys think

417
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:20,839
you can stop me?

418
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,519
The House Master of Sunset Drizzle
has already surrendered.

419
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,160
I do not wish to cause more bloodshed.

420
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,920
I just wish to see Su Mengzhen.

421
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,440
I think he wants to see me too.

422
00:26:37,165 --> 00:26:39,680
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

423
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:40,519
Sir!

424
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,480
Get out of my way.

425
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,759
Sir, don't go out!

426
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,359
Get out of the way.

427
00:26:56,337 --> 00:27:00,822
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

428
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:16,440
Are you surprised

429
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:18,039
to see me here?

430
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:21,240
Why did you have to go this far?

431
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,319
Why?

432
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,079
You are the reason

433
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,200
I suffered so much!

434
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:29,799
You killed my father.

435
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,640
The Six Half Hall lost the person
they could depend on.

436
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,920
Naturally, I have to look for another person.

437
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:40,920
Release Bai Choufei.

438
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,200
He can't withstand the condition of
the dungeon in the Ministry of Justice.

439
00:27:44,228 --> 00:27:45,956
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

440
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,640
No matter if you're trying
to answer to Chancellor Cai

441
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,359
or avenge your father,

442
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:50,880
you should arrest me.

443
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:53,799
I should be your prisoner.

444
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,839
How hard can it be for you to be a prisoner?

445
00:27:57,799 --> 00:27:59,440
How hard can it be for me to kill you?

446
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,920
I want to keep you here,

447
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,559
so that you'll witness
the House of Sunset Drizzle

448
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:07,440
being devoured inch by inch.

449
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,079
I want you to witness the torture

450
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,160
of your sworn brother day by day,

451
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:16,119
until you feel that death is luxurious to you.

452
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:17,480
Only then, I'll be satisfied.

453
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:23,599
Will you feel better

454
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:26,079
if you do so?

455
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,640
What? Do you feel sorry for me now?

456
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,039
I have another way.

457
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,519
You can kill me with your Red Sleeve Blade.

458
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,599
If so, I don't need to withstand all of this.

459
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,240
You can wield
your so-called "righteousness"

460
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:42,319
and end me from this suffering.

461
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,319
I'm your enemy,

462
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,920
but you can't kill me.

463
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:50,839
Bai Choufei is your sworn brother,

464
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:52,160
but you can't save him.

465
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:54,279
Su Mengzhen, the Greatest Swordsman?

466
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,079
What a joke.

467
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:58,319
Does that hurt?

468
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:00,839
It hurts for me too.

469
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,359
This

470
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:06,200
is the pain

471
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:08,839
we need to endure together in the future.

472
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:23,440
You mustn't go!

473
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:23,880
Marquis!

474
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,319
I need to see Father.

475
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:27,400
Marquis, please don't
make things difficult for us!

476
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,039
This is not the time!

477
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,240
Last night,

478
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,880
Official Fu Zongshu was...

479
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,839
This is not the time?

480
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:33,079
When will be the time then?

481
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:33,960
Move out of the way!

482
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:36,680
Marquis!

483
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:43,039
- Marquis!
- Marquis!

484
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:43,640
Father.

485
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,480
- Chancellor.
- Chancellor.

486
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:51,547
(Studious Legacy)

487
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:53,319
Why didn't you bring me
the calligraphy paintings?

488
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:54,599
I don't want to do that anymore.

489
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:55,920
It's rendering me useless.

490
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,119
Aren't you useless from the start?

491
00:29:58,119 --> 00:29:58,799
I'm not!

492
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:05,200
(Studious Legacy)

493
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,680
I was the one
who released Guan Qi from captivity.

494
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,920
I was the one who stirred up a feud
between the Six Half Hall

495
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:13,680
and the House of Sunset Drizzle.

496
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,799
Why did you do so?

497
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,640
For today.

498
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,240
For Youqiao Group to have an empty slot.

499
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,480
I'm much more capable
than Lei Sun and Fu Zongshu.

500
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,200
Father, as long as you give me the power,

501
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:33,240
I can do anything for you!

502
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,279
Lei Sun is dead.

503
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,240
Fu Zongshu is dead too.

504
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,799
Now that I've offended you,

505
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:55,200
why don't you kill me too

506
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,240
and end my suffering?

507
00:30:58,039 --> 00:30:59,079
At least I can act like a tyrant

508
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,640
in the underworld if I die.

509
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,319
Every day,

510
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,960
I have to behave like a pet just to survive.

511
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:08,680
I'm really tired of it.

512
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,599
I don't wish to act anymore.

513
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:14,960
Father!

514
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,880
I guess you can't tolerate

515
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:28,839
acting like a useless fool anymore.

516
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,039
Father,

517
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,200
I beg you.

518
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:41,279
The Six Half Hall is occupied.

519
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,519
And you've suffered for a long time.

520
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,160
From today onward,

521
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:54,559
Fu Zongshu's position

522
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,160
will be yours.

523
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:02,599
Thank you, Father.

524
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,359
In the future, you should push the door gently.

525
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,599
Now, you're a high-ranking person.

526
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,240
That means you have to behave like one.

527
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:19,279
I understand.

528
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,720
There's a newcomer.

529
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,359
Join me.

530
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:30,400
Be quiet!

531
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,079
A newcomer?

532
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:34,960
I want the newcomer.

533
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:35,640
Be quiet!

534
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,039
Join us.

535
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:37,759
Come and join us.

536
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:38,640
Be quiet!

537
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,559
Stop making a ruckus!

538
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,799
- Come here.
- Don't leave.

539
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,240
- Come here.
- Come here.

540
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,440
Come and have some fun.

541
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,240
Come on.

542
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:17,759
Have you ever heard of the saying

543
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,720
that the martial arts world is a business field?

544
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,440
I have.

545
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:23,559
I even know who said it the first.

546
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:24,759
It was you, Father.

547
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,680
You need to know something.

548
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:28,400
There are millions of people 
in the martial arts world.

549
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:32,079
It isn't that easy to manage it.

550
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,079
Actually, I said the same thing

551
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,839
many years ago.

552
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,279
That's why

553
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:39,000
everyone in the martial arts world

554
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,119
believes in that fact

555
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,799
after so many years.

556
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:45,160
Thus, they formed beliefs.

557
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,319
With beliefs, comes order.

558
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,720
With order, management is much easier.

559
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,000
Do you think I'm right?

560
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,640
Father, you're right.

561
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:54,200
There are millions of people
in the martial arts world,

562
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:55,920
and they should be governed.

563
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,799
So, Father, do you want
the martial arts world to be peaceful

564
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,799
or in chaos?

565
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:05,319
You're not experienced enough.

566
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,839
If your father was in your shoes,

567
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,880
he would never ask me that question.

568
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,760
I do not hate nor love the martial arts world.

569
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,679
What I desire is the flowing gold.

570
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,000
I gave you my warrant and soldiers

571
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,360
to storm the House of Sunset Drizzle.

572
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:25,119
Yet you only managed to bring back Bai Choufei.

573
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,119
Do you think this is a worthy trade?

574
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:29,840
It is.

575
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,119
Explain yourself.

576
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,159
Sunset Drizzle is
a well-established sect with deep roots.

577
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,960
If we arrest Su Mengzhen,

578
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,880
they will surely attempt to fight us to the death.

579
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,679
It can only end in bloodshed.

580
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,119
But according to my knowledge,

581
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,199
Su Mengzhen

582
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,639
is terminally ill.

583
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:48,880
He will die soon.

584
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:52,320
Continue.

585
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,760
Bai Choufei always has high aspirations.

586
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,480
However, his talent is always underappreciated.

587
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:00,119
Even though he was appointed as the
Vice House Master of Sunset Drizzle,

588
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,599
he has no power at all.

589
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,639
He is unhappy with the situation.

590
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:06,960
If we bring someone like him to our side

591
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,519
and persuade him,

592
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,639
I'm sure he'll be of use to us.

593
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,320
By then, if we still want to take down
the House of Sunset Drizzle,

594
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,159
we can send Bai Choufei.

595
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,920
We can win the battle without any sacrifices.

596
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,400
I've heard of the name Bai Choufei

597
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,559
many times.

598
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:23,880
Many people had recommended him to me,

599
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,239
saying that he's a white lotus
that bloomed in an evil world.

600
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,000
How about this?

601
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:32,320
Let's lock him in the dungeon of

602
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,880
the Ministry of Justice for some time.

603
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,840
I will see him when I have the time.

604
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:38,480
Yes, Father.

605
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,199
We need friends to do business.

606
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,239
The more friends we have,

607
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,960
the bigger our business will be.

608
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,679
Today, I'm going to introduce someone to you.

609
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:52,519
You replaced your father

610
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:56,400
while he replaced Fu Zongshu.

611
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,400
Come in.

612
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,760
Greetings, Father.

613
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,159
Greetings, Chief Elder Lei.

614
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:38,400
Marquis, from today onward,

615
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:39,920
you'll be a powerful figure.

616
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:41,800
Why must you approach me from the back?

617
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,199
There are rules in the garden too.

618
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,920
Chief Elder Lei, you're here because
the Chancellor had acknowledged you.

619
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,920
But I'm only here

620
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,199
because the Chancellor

621
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:53,800
needs a lackey he can command.

622
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,880
Naturally, I have to stay at the back.

623
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:02,679
Chief Elder Lei, I suppose
you're friends with Wang Xiaoshi.

624
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,039
He's a traitor.

625
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:05,559
How could he be my friend?

626
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:07,280
Great.

627
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:09,320
Father just assigned a mission to me.

628
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:11,920
I'm to kill Official Liu Anshi in the North.

629
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:13,920
I was thinking

630
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,639
that if I could capture Wang Xiaoshi

631
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,920
and hand him to the Chancellor,

632
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,280
I would score huge credits.

633
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,559
If so, Marquis,

634
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,199
I hope you can succeed.

635
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,079
Chief Elder Lei, I suppose you're not
used to people standing behind you.

636
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,880
I shall make a move first.

637
00:38:27,317 --> 00:38:28,581
(It's fine if I can't fly. But when I do,
 I'll soar to the highest.)

638
00:38:28,582 --> 00:38:29,848
(It's fine if I can't make a sound. 
But when I do, I'll make the loudest noise.)

639
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,599
Little Rock,

640
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,920
please don't die.

641
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,519
Why are you staring at me?

642
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,199
I'm trying to remember your look
while you're still clean.

643
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,840
What do you mean?

644
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:14,920
In the future, we'll stay outdoors

645
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:15,840
and climb through mountains and hills.

646
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,920
We have to sleep on the ground

647
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,679
with the sky as our blanket.

648
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,840
We'll become savages soon.

649
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:22,159
Are you afraid?

650
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:23,679
Of course not.

651
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,599
I've already prepared myself mentally.

652
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,079
Preparing yourself mentally is not enough.

653
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,119
You have to learn some survival skills too.

654
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:32,440
Teach me then.

655
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,280
Remember this.

656
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,920
When you set up a tent outdoors,

657
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,800
you have to set it up
at hills on the leeward side.

658
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,960
When you sleep at night,

659
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,400
you must make sure the campfire stays lit.

660
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:53,559
That way, wild beasts won't approach you.

661
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,239
And do you

662
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:58,320
wish to know the weather
on the second day?

663
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,039
You can look at the moon.

664
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:06,159
What if we split up one day

665
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,519
and I can't find you?

666
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,079
Look at the sky.

667
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:12,760
Look under your feet.

668
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,320
Look.

669
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:20,960
The brightest star in the sky

670
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:23,159
is called the North Star.

671
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:25,320
It's always pointing towards the North.

672
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,800
This way, you won't lose your direction.

673
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:30,920
You need to look under your feet

674
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,880
to observe foot tracks.

675
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:34,559
A person's foot tracks are shallow.

676
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:37,519
That's why you need to learn
how to read a horse's foot tracks.

677
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,840
What if it's pouring outside

678
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:43,280
and there are no stars nor foot tracks?

679
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:45,280
What should I do if I can't find you?

680
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,559
You won't be that unlucky.

681
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,400
If that does happen,

682
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,960
I will not leave your side.

683
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,199
I will surely stay by your side
and protect you.

684
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,679
Which one is the North Star?

685
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:26,880
Did you see it?
