(Cold Sword and Moon,
The Young Tiger Rises)

32
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,760
I've found the person
you told me to look for

33
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,120
after you came back

34
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,599
from the border area.

35
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,400
The only clue that the contact
of the business in the North

36
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,280
had left behind was him.

37
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,479
I need to see him personally.

38
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:13,800
Must you see him tonight?

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,680
I have to.

40
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,680
The city will be in turmoil tonight.

41
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:18,719
If you head out,

42
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,719
you'll be giving the Six Half Hall
an opportunity to strike.

43
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:23,840
Judging by Lei Sun's personality,

44
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,520
he will surely
get rid of him by tonight.

45
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,599
I can't afford to wait any longer.

46
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:29,560
Take care of the House for me.

47
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,840
Ask Choufei and Xiaoshi

48
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,120
to meet up with me when they're back.

49
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,520
All right.

50
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,639
Show me

51
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,560
how tough you are!

52
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,199
Follow my orders
or face the consequences!

53
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,240
All those who joined
the House of Sunset Drizzle

54
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,080
are idiots!

55
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:11,919
Your consequences

56
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,719
don't scare me at all.

57
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,639
You don't even care
for the position of Elder?

58
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,759
What do you wish to become then?

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,360
Your father!

(Yingfeng Inn)

62
00:03:56,805 --> 00:03:58,587
(Yingfeng Inn)

63
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,079
You?

64
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,560
What are you doing here?

65
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,639
Lei Hen enjoys torturing people.

66
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,079
He wants music when he tortures
his victims.

67
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,920
He brought me here
to play music for him.

68
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:04,720
This place is dangerous.

69
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,639
You should leave.

70
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,759
But I haven't received my payment yet.

71
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:09,240
You!

72
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,360
This is no time to joke around.

73
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,160
Hurry and leave!

74
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,040
I won't be in danger.

75
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,839
But you might be.

76
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,040
Continue playing.

77
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,920
I love the sound of music
when I kill people.

78
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
I'll save you after him.

79
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,839
Morality and justice?

80
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,079
Those don't exist in
the martial arts world.

81
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,439
Everything is a business.

82
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,639
Elder Li, I have to
depend on you in the future.

83
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:15,920
Elder?

84
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,480
That does sound better
than being a keeper.

85
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,120
Come.

86
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,199
Is there no one else in the House?

87
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,560
They actually sent
the Vice House Master here personally?

88
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,519
It's not that there's no one else
back in the House.

89
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:44,079
I just want you to die terribly.

90
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,959
You're luckier than your other brothers.

91
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,279
I will show you a quick death.

92
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,079
It's better than letting
Lei Hen capture you.

93
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,279
Long Xiaoqing,

94
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,399
I'm here to save you.

95
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,319
Continue playing.

96
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,600
Seems like you guys
have been waiting for a long time.

97
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,680
That's right.

98
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:50,759
We were waiting for you

99
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,680
and Bai Choufei.

100
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:53,959
We were

101
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,279
planning to take your lives.

102
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,399
You're still trying to protect her

103
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,279
when you're in this situation?

104
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,960
You should protect yourself first!

105
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,880
(Yingfeng Inn)

106
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,120
Now, you cannot use your daggers.

107
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,000
Just kill me already.

108
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,039
Cut the crap.

109
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,720
Chief Elder Lei came up with this plot

110
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,399
to capture you and Wang Xiaoshi.

111
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,879
Although bringing
your body back is viable,

112
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,960
bringing you back alive
is more valuable.

113
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:46,600
Take him away.

114
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,120
Miss Xiaoyao,

115
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,159
who exactly are you?

116
00:11:16,827 --> 00:11:17,710
(Su)

117
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:20,279
I'm Zhu Xiaoyao,
Mr. Su's personal bodyguard

118
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,279
and an archer of
the House of Sunset Drizzle.

119
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:23,360
So, you're one of us?

120
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:27,799
Since we're on the same side,

121
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:28,960
you should let me out.

122
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:29,919
Hurry.

123
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,960
The key is over there.

124
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,279
Come on, pass it to me.

125
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,639
I'm here to save Mr. Long,

126
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,000
not you.

127
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,639
Miss Xiaoyao,

128
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,279
can you please stop messing around?

129
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,639
We're inside the territory
of the Six Half Hall.

130
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:50,960
Please let me out!

131
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,159
I can let you out

132
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,879
if you promise me
something good in return.

133
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:58,120
Once you let me out,

134
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,399
I'll go and save Long Xiaoqing.

135
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,519
You can claim my credit.

136
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:01,879
Is that good enough?

137
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,279
Who cares about claiming credits?

138
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,399
Besides,

139
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:06,399
look.

140
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,360
Xiaoyao, I'll send
Mr. Long to the carriage.

141
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,080
What I want

142
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,519
is simple.

143
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:24,480
Tell me about it.

144
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,240
You have to sleep with me.

145
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,720
What?

146
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:38,039
No way.

147
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,120
I can never agree to that!

148
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,559
Are you afraid that
Wen Rou might know about it?

149
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:40,679
I!

150
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:41,440
Do you like Wen Rou?

151
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:41,840
Wen Rou!

152
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,679
Anyway, it's a no!

153
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:45,759
I can never agree to that!

154
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,559
I don't mind that you like Wen Rou.

155
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:52,120
All of us just want to have fun
while we're still alive.

156
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,200
If you won't agree to it,

157
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,639
I'll make a move then.

158
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,879
Miss Xiaoyao!

159
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,080
I beg you!

160
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,120
Please let me out!

161
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:01,919
Here.

162
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:15,960
You!

163
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,279
You lunatic!

164
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,720
Lunatic?

165
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,679
Fine, I'll leave for real this time.

166
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:22,919
Don't go!

167
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:24,159
Come back!

168
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,480
Come back!

169
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,759
Don't come near me!

170
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:04,021

00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:05,480
Don't come near me!

172
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,360
His life is mine.

173
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,440
If you want it,

174
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,240
you can exchange it with your life.

175
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,200
Don't be afraid.

176
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:51,600
Your elder brother told me to save you.

177
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,679
Are you okay?

178
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:04,159
Be careful.

179
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,690
(Sipai Inn)

180
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,240
Little Rock!

181
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,120
Are you okay?

182
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,440
I'm fine. What about you?

183
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:59,279
I'm fine too.

184
00:16:01,703 --> 00:16:03,210
(Sipai Inn)

185
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:06,159
You guys are too fast.

186
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:07,759
I couldn't catch up to you two.

187
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:11,200
The House Master has issued an order.

188
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,679
You are to gather at Xiaocaomen Street.

189
00:16:18,983 --> 00:16:21,273
(Sipai Inn)

190
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:31,720
Mengzhen!

191
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,639
Mengzhen.

192
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,240
He was killed.

193
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:37,000
He was saved.

194
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,600
Good.

195
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:39,679
This is?

196
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:46,120
Don't be scared.

197
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,000
Sit down for now.

198
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,240
Have a seat.

199
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,039
What are they waiting for?

200
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,680
For a chance to act.

201
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,440
What are we waiting for?

202
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:36,960
For the dawn to come.

203
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,200
The patrolmen of the Ministry of Justice
have been missing the entire night.

204
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:43,119
However, that gap won't last for long.

205
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:44,400
Once morning comes,

206
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,640
even Lei Sun can't kill in public.

207
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,359
I think the three of us
can pass through them

208
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,759
easily.

209
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,920
I'm afraid that the situation
will change if we wait too long.

210
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,240
That is indeed viable.

211
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,160
However, I must bring him with me.

212
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,440
If that's the case,

213
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,960
I guess last night was thoroughly
planned by the Six Half Hall.

214
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:08,119
First, he took out four of our keepers

215
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,680
to reduce our manpower.

216
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,200
After that, he launched an attack
to disperse our troops.

217
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,000
Lastly, after you've saved him,

218
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:15,799
they'll surround us.

219
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:19,039
And he's the bait.

220
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,160
You did great analyzing the situation.

221
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,440
However, even if he's the bait,

222
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:23,599
I still need to save him.

223
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,559
All right. I'll also protect him then.

224
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,039
I'm afraid
they will shoot hidden arrows.

225
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,759
Mister,

226
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:37,119
can I have one bowl of noodles?

227
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:38,640
Okay, here you go.

228
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:40,680
Thank you.

229
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,079
Here you go.

230
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,519
Have some noodles for now.

231
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:53,519
Don't be afraid.

232
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,440
Have your fill and boost your courage.

233
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:04,839
Brother!

234
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,079
Brother!

235
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,240
(Clock)

236
00:19:19,653 --> 00:19:20,680
(Fu's Residence)

237
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,419
(Fu's Residence)

238
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,805
(Fu's Residence)

239
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:26,319
My brothers, let's greet the arrival
of a new dawn!

240
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:33,039
Brother!

241
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:35,000
Brother!

242
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:56,839
Brother!

243
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,400
Mr. Su, although
you're a dignified figure,

244
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,559
you risked your life for a person

245
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,079
you've never met before.

246
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:22,519
Do you think it's worth it?

247
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,319
Chief Elder Lei,

248
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,319
it's morning now.

249
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,759
What's going on?

250
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:53,680
You guys are wielding weapons
and fighting in public?

251
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,240
Do you guys really think that the
Ministry of Justice has no power here?

252
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:01,039
Sir, we're having our noodles here.

253
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,799
The Six Half Hall and I
were having breakfast together.

254
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,160
Chief Elder Lei,

255
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:05,839
am I right?

256
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,839
That's right.

257
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,720
Do you think I can say otherwise?

258
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,160
If you come later next time,

259
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:18,759
we could've saved ourselves
from plenty of trouble.

260
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:28,000
Sirs,

261
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,839
do you want to have some noodles?

262
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:41,079
Brother!

263
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,200
My brother, he...

264
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:49,079
House Master.

265
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,160
Take good care of him.

266
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:52,680
Yes, House Master.

267
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:54,240
Don't be scared.

268
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,480
You can follow them.

269
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,079
I thought he was scared out of his wits

270
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,680
when we were at the noodle stall.

271
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,519
Now that I think about it,

272
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,319
I'm afraid he's mentally retarded.

273
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,400
Although his body did grow up,

274
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,720
he only has the mentality
of a three-year-old kid.

275
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:21,400
Mengzhen,

276
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,440
who exactly was that?

277
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:24,440
Let's talk inside.

278
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,160
I guess you guys have a grasp
of the situation here

279
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:35,559
after what you had experienced.

280
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:37,559
The Capital has two major sects.

281
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,079
The Six Half Hall

282
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,240
colluded with an organization

283
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,160
called Youqiao Group.

284
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,440
These people lay down iron rules

285
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,680
and think that they rule the world.

286
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:50,839
If anyone objects to them,

287
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,079
they'll destroy them.

288
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,039
Wherever there's gold,

289
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,759
they'll follow.

290
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:59,680
Fu Zongshu is a member
of the Youqiao Group, right?

291
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,559
He's not the only one.

292
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,480
There are other members
who are hiding in the dark.

293
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,720
The firearm trade in the north

294
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,839
is their biggest business.

295
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,640
At first, I'd already convinced
the contact

296
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,319
to tell me the secret.

297
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:12,039
However, he was killed.

298
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:14,000
His younger brother was his only kin.

299
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:18,079
I will let the House
take care of him in the future.

300
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,079
So, Mengzhen, you knew

301
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,680
that he wasn't able to
tell us the secret.

302
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,240
Right.

303
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,480
If so, why did you save him?

304
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,400
Whether he can tell us the secret

305
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:28,920
isn't the thing I care about.

306
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,839
The only thing I wanted to do

307
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,039
was to go against Youqiao Group

308
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,200
and save more pitiful people like him.

309
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:39,519
But Mengzhen,
I have something to ask you.

310
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,920
The House of Sunset Drizzle
doesn't bow to any officers

311
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:43,599
or establish any ties
with the imperial court.

312
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,799
And now, we have to fight against
Six Half Hall with their backing.

313
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,079
Was this what you truly wished for?

314
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,559
Since young, I was diagnosed
with a terminal disease.

315
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:55,359
The physician told me I'd die before
I reach 30 years of age.

316
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,440
But now, I'm already 32 years old.

317
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
To me, time is the important thing.

318
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:02,279
So, everything I'm doing right now

319
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,720
is my wish.

320
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,960
But you two,

321
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,400
is it your wish to join
the House of Sunset Drizzle

322
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,400
and go against them?

323
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,240
But of course.

324
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,640
However, I can't stand it

325
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,839
when they lay down their own rules.

326
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:20,000
If the martial arts world
in the Capital needs rules,

327
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,400
we must be the ones laying them down.

328
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:27,920
If we work together,

329
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:29,119
we can overcome anything.

330
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,519
Stop staring at me.

331
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:31,960
Of course, I'm happy to do so.

332
00:24:35,568 --> 00:24:38,360
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

333
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,960
Last night was a long night, huh?

334
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,920
I can finally go to sleep now.

335
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,559
Little Rock,

336
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,759
what do you think about
Mengzhen's act of saving Long Ba?

337
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,279
Mengzhen is a loyal person.

338
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,799
I'm impressed.

339
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:58,680
However, when it comes to war,

340
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,000
winning is more important
than being impressive.

341
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,519
We came up with a thorough plan
and risked our lives to save him.

342
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,480
However, if the three of us
died back then,

343
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:07,480
the centurial foundation
of the House of Sunset Drizzle

344
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,319
will go down the drain.

345
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,240
Do you think

346
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,160
it's worth it for us to take the risk
just to save a person

347
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:12,160
who couldn't even talk?

348
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:14,759
We're safe now, aren't we?

349
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:16,480
You should stop thinking about

350
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,960
the things that hadn't happened.

351
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,680
Moreover, if the three of us

352
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,119
can't even save
a pitiful person like him,

353
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,599
I'm sure we won't
be able to achieve anything.

Let not golden chalices
mirror the moon without spirits.

358
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:40,960
This is about mutual consent.

359
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:42,359
Mutual consent.

360
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:45,160
Martial artists face death every day.

361
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,279
I will face the music myself.

362
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,839

(House of Sanhe)

365
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:59,000
Did you come here because you missed me

366
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,079
and you wanted to sleep here?

367
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,640
Or do you want to sleep with me?

368
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:02,799
It's none of them.

369
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,720
I have my own bed.

370
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,440
I just want to clarify
some things with you.

371
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,200
Go ahead then.

372
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:10,839
I'm all ears.

373
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,480
Relationships aren't
that difficult to understand.

374
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,599
The most important thing
is mutual consent.

375
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,799
If both parties are willing,

376
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,039
naturally, you can continue.

377
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:26,480
So,

378
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:29,000
you have to confirm whether
the other party is doing so willingly.

379
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,559
Relationships aren't
that difficult to understand.

380
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,680
The most important thing
is mutual consent.

381
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,920
If both of us are willing,

382
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,039
we can continue.

383
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:36,440
You finally understood, huh?

384
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:37,519
Let's continue then.

385
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,559
So,

386
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:41,599
I have to confirm if I'm willing or not.

387
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:43,039
I was drugged that day.

388
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,319
I couldn't remember anything.

389
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,200
So, I didn't do it of my own accord,

390
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,599
I think.

391
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,279
I did put the drug into the liquor.

392
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:52,400
However, you drank the liquor
of your own accord,

393
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:53,440
I think.

394
00:26:58,519 --> 00:26:59,319
If it doesn't go well,

395
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,000
I have another solution for you.

396
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:04,519
Martial artists face death every day.

397
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,680
Actually, not everyone
pays attention to that.

398
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:09,759
As the saying goes, let not golden
chalices mirror the moon without spirit.

399
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:11,640
So,

400
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,039
you have to persuade her
that this matter

401
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:15,880
isn't important at all.

402
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,680
Martial artists face death every day.

403
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:19,039
Actually, not everyone

404
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,319
pays attention to this.

405
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,720
As the saying goes, let not golden
chalices mirror the moon without spirit.

406
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,799
You're even using quotes?
You're pretty intelligent.

407
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,720
So, I have to persuade myself
that this isn't important at all.

408
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,039
But it's pretty important to me.

409
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:34,960
I can't do it.

410
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,240
It's my first time.

411
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,240
So, are you saying

412
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,559
that I'm taking advantage of you now?

413
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,880
What do you want to do then?

414
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,160
I don't want to do anything.

415
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:44,519
Actually, I'm here today

416
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,599
to clarify this with you.

417
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:48,680
I was hoping that you could
stop teasing me with this.

418
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,400
But you keep

419
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,480
talking in circles.

420
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,319
Sometimes, it's true.
Sometimes, it's not.

421
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:52,160
I don't know

422
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,599
when you're speaking the truth
and when you're not.

423
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:55,119
I really wish to clarify this with you!

424
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:56,559
But when you talk, where was I again?

425
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:58,359
What am I talking about?

426
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,480
I think I didn't make myself clear.

427
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:04,079
Calm down.

428
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,440
Take your time and think about it.

429
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:08,119
Think until you're clear
with what you're thinking.

430
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:29,119
Have you straightened out your thoughts?

431
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,039
Wen Rou?

432
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:34,640
Why did you come
to the House of Sanhe again?

433
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I'm not here to enjoy myself.

434
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,039
I just don't want you to...

435
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,160
What?

436
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,400
I don't want you to misunderstand me.

437
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,160
I don't want to make you upset.

438
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,119
I was drugged last time.

439
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:53,039
I was confused.

440
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,319
That's why I came here

441
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:56,079
to clarify the incident.

442
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:01,519
I've gotten to the bottom of it.

443
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:04,880
Xiaoyao was just teasing you.

444
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,440
Actually, nothing happened
between you two.

445
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,039
Xiaoyao?

446
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:20,759
Since when did you two
become great friends?

447
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:22,599
Wait!

448
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,480
Did you two gang up
to play a trick on me?

449
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,920
You had 15 girlfriends before this.

450
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,440
Of course, I need to punish you.

451
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,759
That's not true!

452
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:33,279
The information you got
from the Advisor was false!

453
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:34,799
Wait.

454
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:36,359
Before this, you asked me

455
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,880
why I didn't draw my sword, right?

456
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,480
It's because my sword
is called Retainment.

457
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,839
My master said this before.

458
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,279
It was the same for all of its wielders.

459
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:43,680
If I draw it for anyone's sake,

460
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,440
I will...

461
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:47,559
I will be entangled
with that person forever.

462
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:03,960
I first drew my sword

463
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,480
to protect you.

464
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:34,440
Mr. Bai!

465
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,079
Mr. Bai!

466
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,039
Mr. Bai!

467
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,319
Mr. Bai!

468
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:40,839
Mister?

469
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:43,119
I finally found you.

470
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:44,920
I went to the place
you stayed last time.

471
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,359
The old madam said

472
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:47,480
you've moved out.

473
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:50,519
I was praying to the heavens

474
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:52,400
so that I could see you again.

475
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:54,200
So, why were you looking for me?

476
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,480
You might not know,

477
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,599
but your painting
was sold for a high price.

478
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:01,720
Look.

479
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,000
This is the profit
that we agreed upon last time.

480
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:04,880
You can count them.

481
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:11,279
I thought no one bought my paintings.

482
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,200
That's not true.

483
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:14,839
A rich customer
took a liking to your painting.

484
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:16,880
Before this, it was hanging on the wall.

485
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,200
Now, it's in the middle
of its framing process.

486
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:20,440
Once it's framed,

487
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,000
it will be sent to her residence.

488
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:23,480
The rich customer also said

489
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,960
that she would purchase

490
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,920
any paintings produced by

491
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,240
Bai Youjin.

492
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:32,079
By the way,

493
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,680
are you free right now?

494
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,920
Why don't you draw a painting right now

495
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,079
so that I can hang it
in the middle of my shop?

496
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,039
I would be honored if you did so.

497
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,079
No problem.

498
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:42,799
Let's go.

499
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:43,680
All right. Please.

500
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,240
Mr. Su,

501
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:09,960
sorry for the wait.

502
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:16,319
Chief Elder Lei,
the Capital is a huge place.

503
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:18,160
Do you think it has
enough space for you?

504
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,000
Yes, I do.

505
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:22,200
Is it enough for the two sects
to split it evenly?

506
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:24,039
Yes.

507
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:26,039
If so,

508
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,920
why did you attack us last night?

509
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:31,839
I was just following the rules.

510
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,400
Chief Elder Lei,
what are the rules for you?

511
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:39,200
Some people are in certain positions
while some work for them.

512
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,079
Those in certain positions
do not deviate

513
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:42,920
while those who work for them
follow the law.

514
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,400
That's the definition of a rule.

515
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,880
Mr. Su, you've taken over
the House of Sunset Drizzle.

516
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,759
You also recruited
Wang Xiaoshi and Bai Choufei.

517
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,680
You were going against the rules.

518
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,960
Not just that, you even tried to
sabotage my business.

519
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,319
Don't you think you were being too much?

520
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,440
You do sound like an officer

521
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,400
when you speak in that manner.

522
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:08,759
Since that's the case,

523
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,519
I'll tell you about my rules as well.

524
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:13,400
Wang Xiaoshi and Bai Choufei
are my sworn brothers now.

525
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:15,839
Chief Elder Lei, you can
forget about recruiting them.

526
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,119
As for the Six Half Hall's business,

527
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,319
I've already lit it on fire.

528
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:21,880
It all depends on your sword

529
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,960
whether you can save it.

530
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,640
What a shame.

531
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,720
The cup isn't completely filled up.

532
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,640
It's imperfect.

533
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:35,480
If so, I'll fill it up for you.

534
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,039
Farewell.

535
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:27,760
Madam,

536
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:29,199
I'm back.

537
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,519
Little Rock, you're back?

538
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,000
Little Rock.

539
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,599
Hello, Madam.

540
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,559
This is?

541
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,519
I'm Wen Rou.

542
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:38,559
I'm a good friend of Little Rock's.

543
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,239
Wen Rou?

544
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,239
You're a nice girl.

545
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:43,320
Madam, I brought some snacks for you.

546
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,559
Thank you.

547
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,760
(Respect Brings Victory)
You're a nice girl indeed.

548
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,760
Mr. Wo, what are you doing up there?

549
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,639
It was leaking when it rained.

550
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,920
I'm here to fix the roof.

551
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,440
You didn't manage to fix it
even after the entire day.

552
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,079
You've read so many books.

553
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:01,639
Did none of them teach you
how to fix a leaking roof?

554
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:02,800
(Respect Brings Victory)
No.

555
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,679
(Respect Brings Victory)
Mr. Wo, why don't you come down?

556
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,920
(Respect Brings Victory)
Let me fix the roof.

557
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,639
It's fine.

558
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,920
Don't try to stir up trouble here.

559
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,599
Just sit down.

560
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,440
Madam,

561
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,360
I used to do all these chores

562
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,760
when my Master and I were
living in the mountains.

563
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,719
I'm good at them.

564
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:15,760
Fine then.

565
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,000
Madam, just let him do it.

566
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,960
If he does a bad job,
ask him to compensate for it.

567
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,320
Don't worry, Madam.

568
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,480
Young lady,

569
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,639
tell me about it.

570
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,039
How did you get to know Little Rock?

571
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,679
If you insist on it,

572
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:33,039
it'll be a long story.

573
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,239
That's great.

574
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:37,920
I love it when there's someone
who can talk to me.

575
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:38,559
Let's go.

576
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,360
Let's go.

577
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,440
Now that you two had joined
the House of Sunset Drizzle,

578
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,239
I guess you two are successful now.

579
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:54,639
Being successful isn't
the thing I'm looking for.

580
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,199
I just wish to render a huge achievement
alongside Mengzhen.

581
00:35:58,119 --> 00:35:58,920
A huge achievement?

582
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:00,760
That day, Mengzhen asked us

583
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,920
if we were willing to protect the
martial arts world together with him

584
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,679
and return
the martial artists their freedom.

585
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,280
I hate it when
people constrict my freedom.

586
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:08,360
Of course, I would join him.

587
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:11,760
I know you love freedom,

588
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:14,920
however, the path you had mentioned
just now was the path of a martyr.

589
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:20,199
Mr. Wo,

590
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:22,280
some things have to be completed

591
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,159
by certain people, am I right?

592
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,559
If someone wields a sword
to kill others,

593
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:28,519
someone else will bath in blood
to serve justice.

594
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,239
We need to protect
the martial arts world

595
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,679
only because there are
too few heroes and too many crooks

596
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,199
in the martial arts world.

597
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:41,920
If you want to be righteous
and serve justice,

598
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,400
you'll be blocking their path.

599
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:46,880
If that's the case,
you'll be attacked from all directions.

600
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,199
If that does happen,

601
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:50,559
what will you do by then?

602
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:54,679
When that happens, I'll split
the mountains to open up a path.

603
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:55,920
I'll build bridges to cross the river.

604
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:58,119
I'll fix the roof when it leaks.

605
00:36:58,599 --> 00:36:59,760
There are always more solutions
than problems, right?

606
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,679
That was great, young man.

607
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,320
Mr. Wo, have some water.

608
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:14,920
Mr. Wo.

609
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,360
Okay.

610
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:16,840
Where's mine?

611
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,159
Why aren't you doing your work?

612
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,039
I was just taking a break.

613
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,320
Give it to me.

614
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:29,920
Thanks.

615
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,920
You better do your work.

616
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,320
If not, I won't let you eat.

617
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,360
I got it.

618
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,320
Madam, let me help you out.

619
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:41,920
Okay.

620
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,679
Come, you can cut the vegetables.

621
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,360
Okay.

622
00:37:54,827 --> 00:37:59,405
(Second Year of Song-Yuan,
drawn by Bai Youjin)

623
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:01,320
How is it?

624
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:04,679
Wind and frost swirl up
from the white silk surface,

625
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,639
so superb, this painting
of the gray hawk is.

626
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,360
In the past, I only thought
he was good at drawing landscapes.

627
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:11,920
I didn't expect

628
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,840
this hawk painting to be even better.

629
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:17,039
It's a great painting.

630
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:18,280
So,

631
00:38:18,315 --> 00:38:19,269
(Second Year of Song-Yuan,
drawn by Bai Youjin)

632
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:19,880
will you buy it?

633
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:21,559
Isn't it obvious?

634
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,639
Hurry and wrap it up.

635
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:23,719
All right!

636
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:27,920
My lady,

637
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,639
you've already bought
two of his paintings.

638
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,599
Do you really like
Mr. Bai's paintings that much?

639
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,840
But his paintings
don't look that nice to me.

640
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,519
He's a great painter.

641
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,400
However, I do not like his style.

642
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,159
He does.

643
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,079
Are you referring to House Master Su?

644
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,320
But yesterday, I heard

645
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:49,400
that House Master Su and Chief Elder
almost got into a fight.

646
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:56,920
Humans are born to die.

647
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,400
But even so, we can't just sit still
and wait for it to come, right?

648
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,199
Mr. Wo, Madam, we'll leave now.

649
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:11,920
Mr. Wo and Madam are nice people.

650
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:13,760
I'll visit them more often in the future.

651
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,320
Why is it your job to visit them now?

652
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,880
It's my job to do so.

653
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:18,920
Can't I thank them

654
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:19,599
on your behalf?

655
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:21,920
Speaking of which,

656
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,960
if Mr. Wo and Madam hadn't taken us in,

657
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,800
I guess we would've
slept on the streets.

658
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,039
One is a little rock while
the other is a cabbage.

659
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,039
If you two slept on the streets,
it'd become a market.

660
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:33,800
I'll bring you to a place

661
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,159
where we can enjoy
the Capital's scenery.

662
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:36,400
Scenery?

663
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:38,360
The sky view on the Iron Pagoda?
Or the moon view on Zhou Bridge?

664
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,119
The place I'm bringing you

665
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:41,760
is much better
than the places you just mentioned.

666
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,440
Let's go.

667
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:45,559
Hurry!

668
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:51,760
Slow down!

669
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,400
Hurry up!

670
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,280
Look.

671
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:58,360
Is this it?

672
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,639
I only see roofs.

673
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:00,519
What's so nice about it?

674
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:02,400
You're still not familiar
with the Capital.

675
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:04,400
If you wish to see great scenery,

676
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:05,400
I can bring you around.

677
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,679
Can you be patient for once?

678
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:07,920
Take a closer look.

679
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,280
How did you find this place?

680
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,079
Bai and I lived there in the past.

681
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,920
Whenever I couldn't sleep,

682
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,519
I'd take a walk.

683
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:28,079
During one of my walks,

684
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,360
I found this place.

685
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,840
Since this is such a great place,

686
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:33,880
you shouldn't bring anyone else here.

♪Sunset is hanging by the sky♪

688

693
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:46,599

700
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:57,079
The martial arts world
is plagued by stormy weather.

701
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:58,400

Someone is looking in our direction.

00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:56,119
It's Little Rock and Wen Rou.

725
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,840
Wen Rou is a nice lady.

726

She comes from a good background

Little Rock is not too bad himself.

729
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,880
If someone wields a sword
to kill others,

730
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,880
someone else will bath in blood
to serve justice.

731
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,360
When he said that,

732
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,239
he reminded me of
that man I used to know.

Who?

734

The legendary hero, Fang Geyin.

Even if he doesn't
look anything like Fang Geyin,

he can become a legendary hero.

737
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:30,920
If he wants to court
the Young Lady of the Wen family,

738
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,199
he has to be a legendary hero.
