(A Duel and Contention. Part 2)

32
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,520
Vice House Master Bai.

33
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,039
Unveil it.

34
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,280
Which carriage seller is it from?

35
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:52,479
A shop on the city's south side.

36
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,280
It's a new shop.

37
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:55,120
Not many know about the shop.

38
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,439
The House is making a move.

39
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,919
Stay cautious on your way there.

40
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,400
Remember, use the southern gate.

41
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,639
Don't worry. I'm prepared.

42
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:04,479
But you,

43
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:05,960
you betrayed the House Master

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,960
because of us.

45
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,400
Set aside the formality.

46
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:10,360
I'll be fine.

47
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,159
All I hope is that

48
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,840
you and your father

49
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,159
can live peacefully after the reunion.

50
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:15,879
Don't burden yourselves

51
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,439
with the trouble of
the martial arts world.

52
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:18,479
Xiaoyao...

53
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,400
Drifters always run into each other.

54
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,159
We will meet again.

55
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:24,919
Go on.

56
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,240
Xiaoyao, take care.

57
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,560
Inform Vice House Master Bai.

58
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:56,960
Yes.

59
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,960
You're the decoy?

60
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,599
Do you have a death wish?

61
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:08,039
I am ready to face death.

62
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,400
Is it worth for someone

63
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,400
like Guan Qi?

64
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:11,599
He is my father.

65
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:15,439
Even if he is a merciless killer,

66
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,600
I should sacrifice myself for him.

67
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,360
Prepare more soldiers and horses.

68
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,240
Search every road exiting the city.

69
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:25,800
Yes.

70
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,079
It's been years since we last met.

71
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,639
Do you serve
the House of Sunset Drizzle now?

72
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,079
Yes.

73
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,560
They want me dead,

74
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,680
but you are trying to save me.

75
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,920
You betrayed them.

76
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,639
I owe my life to you, Holy Master.

77
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,759
If you remember who I am,

78
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,519
you should not lock me up.

79
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,160
I don't want to imprison you,

80
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,000
but I know you won't listen to me.

81
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:18,240
The House and the Hall
both want you dead.

82
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,079
I will send you to safety.

83
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,720
They want me dead?

84
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:27,199
I take lives,

85
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,920
and no one shall take my life.

86
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
You can kill me,

87
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,199
but don't go back.

88
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,240
They will kill you.

89
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:52,519
If you die,

90
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,240
what about your son?

91
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,160
My son?

92
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,319
My son is already dead!

93
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,079
He is alive.

94
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,079
He took care of you
when you were in a coma.

95
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:04,879
You saw him.

96
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,560
He's alive?

97
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,560
Xiaobai told me

98
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,160
my son died as soon as he was born.

99
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,079
Given your state back then,

100
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Xiaobai didn't think
you'd be a good father.

101
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,920
As soon as the child was born,

102
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,759
he was secretly sent away.

103
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,360
My son is alive.

104
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,439
I remember his look.

105
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,199
He is as fair as a lotus root.

106
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,240
I bought him the bell he's wearing.

107
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,959
Who gave you the right

108
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,120
to decide

109
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,920
I wasn't fit to be his father?

110
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,879
He is my son.

111
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,199
You have no right to send him away.

112
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,000
You have no right to say
I wouldn't be a good father!

113
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,920
Be careful.

114
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,160
You let me out,

115
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,680
and now you want me dead.

116
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,839
What logic is that?

117
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,560
You killed my friend.

118
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,279
I will take your life,

119
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:10,959
not for justice

120
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,720
but for revenge.

121
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,920
That's more like it, Wang Xiaoshi.

122
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,920
Only the capable kill for revenge.

123
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,439
Only the foolish kill

124
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,680
for the greater good.

125
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,000
Bring it on.

126
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,759
The sooner I kill you,

127
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,439
the sooner I get to see my son again.

128
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,399
My son is alive.

129
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,199
I'm not lying this time.

130
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,279
Is that so?

131
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,440
I doubt you'll see him again!

132
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:16,840
No!

133
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,840
Don't kill him!

134
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,559
He deserves sympathy.

135
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,960
The people he killed

136
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,519
deserved more sympathy!

137
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,360
Don't kill him!

138
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,120
Those I can kill

139
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,120
died at my hands.

140
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,360
And now, I die at the hands

141
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,759
of someone I can't kill.

142
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:17,240
You may end me now.

143
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,120
Kill me like an insignificant insect.

144
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:28,840
Do it!

145
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,639
You're either kill the evil

146
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,360
or the divine.

147
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:34,960
Nothing is impossible.

148
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,120
But Guan Qi carries the secrets
of the Youqiao Group.

149
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,440
We need him captured alive.

150
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,519
I'm not like you.

151
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,120
You are just a crippled man.

152
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,720
From now on,

153
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,320
you'll live as an insignificant insect.

154
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:27,120
I won't waste my time on an insect.

155
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,480
Get up.

156
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:46,960
Tell me.

157
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:49,600
What evil have you done

158
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,519
for Fu Zongshu and the Youqiao Group?

159
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,159
The Youqiao Group

160
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,240
ordered Lei Sun

161
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,840
to produce explosives and firearms

162
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,840
and secretly have them sent to the north

163
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,879
to be sold to the Liao people
at a high price.

164
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,720
Then, the Liao people
will use those weapons

165
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,039
to attack the Song people.

166
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,320
As long as the war goes on,

167
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,759
they will never stop making money.

168
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:28,639
They exploit the people

169
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,759
and get rich from the war.

170
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:32,039
They will never stop making money.

171
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:35,480
Do you get it now?

172
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:38,320
The gold circulating in the world?

173
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,799
That's the saying.

174
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:44,960
Fu Zongshu is working

175
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:49,000
for someone even more powerful.

176
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:53,360
I will bring them to light.

177
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:57,039
I wish they get killed.

178
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:01,799
Let's go.

179
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:33,120
(Mr. Wo.)

180
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,840
(I didn't take his life.)

181
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,639
(But now, he is crippled.)

182
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,039
(From now on,)

183
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,879
(he can't hurt anyone.)

184
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:50,360
I am crippled.

185
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,559
Will my son be disappointed

186
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:54,679
when he sees me?

187
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,240
Never.

188
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,799
He won't.

189
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:35,399
Those eyes,

190
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:37,639
they look like mine.

191
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,000
You repaid Mr. Wo's kindness.

192
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,200
I avenged Mr. Wo's death.

193
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:46,799
You shouldn't have hurt Xiaoyao.

194
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,759
My brother-in-law,

195
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,640
why must you

196
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,079
leave the well after all this time?

197
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,119
I kept you imprisoned for eight years,

198
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:40,680
but at least I kept you alive.

199
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:48,720
Look at you now.

200
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:51,359
You died as soon as you left.

201
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,039
I have use of your skull.

202
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,400
Don't take it out on me.

203
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,079
I have the order, and I have no choice.

204
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:52,759
Is it done?

205
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,559
It is done.

206
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,440
Open it.

207
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,920
This isn't as scary as I expected.

208
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:36,079
Chief Elder Lei.

209
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,319
You did a great job.

210
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:43,680
But Guan Qi had stirred up trouble

211
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,200
in the city,

212
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,720
so there will be gossip and rumors.

213
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,079
Deal with it.

214
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,960
Your wish is my command.

215
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,119
Lei.

216
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:04,519
For all these years,

217
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:06,799
I've treated you as my brother.

218
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:09,960
But I must warn you.

219
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,400
Whatever tasks I give you,

220
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,920
there is no room for errors.

221
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,240
Just do your job.

222
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:22,200
If you make the same mistake
you made with Guan Qi in the future,

223
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,000
our bond won't be enough
to save your neck.

224
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,319
Back to the residence.

225
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:40,759
Yes.

226
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,480
I had enough of this stinking lair.

227
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,200
Get the rest of his remains.

228
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,680
We'll bury him.

229
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:18,799
Yes.

230
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,400
Chief Elder.

231
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,160
(Peng Jian)

232
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:33,519
Marquis.

233
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:34,920
Guan Qi

234
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:35,960
has been killed.

235
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:38,720
At whose hands?

236
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,640
Vice House Master Bai Choufei
of Sunset Drizzle.

237
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,319
Bai Choufei is talented.

238
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,480
Hundreds of people

239
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:55,200
tried to kill Guan Qi and failed.

240
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,200
Now that he was released,

241
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,039
he failed to take

242
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,559
Fu Zongshu's life,

243
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:02,960
and he failed

244
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,079
to kill Lei Sun.

245
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,160
He was useless to me.

246
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,160
Guan Qi deserved to die.

247
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:13,000
He deserved the worst death.

248
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,039
But why did you hurt Zhu Xiaoyao?

249
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:16,319
I tried to kill Guan Qi.

250
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,480
Zhu Xiaoyao was protecting him.

251
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,440
Would you kill innocent lives

252
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,799
just to get to Guan Qi?

253
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:21,079
I was avenging Mr. Wo.

254
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:22,279
I had to kill him even if there was

255
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:23,039
an army in my way!

256
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:24,799
You'd be no different from Guan Qi!

257
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,480
Yes!

258
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,279
In your eyes, we are both just as bad.

259
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:28,079
But you?

260
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:30,200
You're too soft to avenge Mr. Wo.

261
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:32,640
You are a coward.

262
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:25,519
Here it comes.

263
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,400
The medicine is here.

264
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:31,160
It's still warm.

265
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:32,839
Drink it.

266
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,240
Drink it while it's warm.

267
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,400
Come on.

268
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:40,519
You look better now.

269
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:42,079
Not bad.

270
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,359
Not bad indeed.

271
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,319
Here.

272
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:46,599
Swallow this, quick.

273
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,200
The medicine is getting more bitter.

274
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,440
What did you put in it?

275
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,000
Nothing in particular.

276
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,559
It's still the same medicine.

277
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,240
Well...

278
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,200
I used more anemarrhena.

279
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,359
I used a dose of panax notoginseng.

280
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,160
That's all.

281
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:14,519
It seems the sickness is getting worse.

282
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,000
Not at all.

283
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:21,079
Your battle with Guan Qi
took a toll on you.

284
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,720
The panax notoginseng

285
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,079
is to provide nourishment.

286
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,480
Don't be paranoid.

287
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:34,319
I'm not worried about my health.

288
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,759
You shouldn't worry too much.

289
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:39,240
How can I not be worried?

290
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,559
If we lose you,

291
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I'll lose my job.

292
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,559
Wait.

293
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:51,799
Are you worried that I might die?

294
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:55,839
Yes.

295
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:58,799
You're the only friend I have.

296
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,639
(Tombstone of Beloved Wife, Guan Zhaodi.
Daughter: Lei Chun, Brother: Guan Qi)

297
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:45,680
Zhaodi.

298
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,799
Your brother Guan Qi

299
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:51,160
is gone.

300
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:56,599
I risked the lives

301
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:58,839
of the entire Six Half Hall

302
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,599
to keep him alive for eight years.

303
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,240
I did my best.

304
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,400
Please don't be mad at me.

305
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:16,559
Forget it.

306
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,400
I'll have a drink with you.

307
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,839
Look at you.

308
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,400
It's always me who's visiting.

309
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,000
You should visit me sometimes

310
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,200
in my dreams.

311
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,200
I've never seen my father

312
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,039
so heartbroken.

313
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:50,480
I have.

314
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:53,720
The day when Madam passed away,

315
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,680
Chief Elder stayed up all night
watching at the funeral.

316
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,960
It was snowing heavily that night.

317
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,279
Chief Elder aged
a great deal that night.

Chun.

319
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,880
Madam's greatest concern

320
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,000
was you and your father.

321
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:09,759
She'd be sad to know

322
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,039
that you two have grown distant.

323
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,480
I appreciate the concern.

324
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,039
Talk to the Chief Elder.

325
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,920
My heart is content

326
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:28,759
knowing that he still misses my mother.

327
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,440
I shouldn't interrupt.

328
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,240
I'm tired.

329
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,519
I am truly exhausted.

330
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:47,360
(Tombstone of Beloved Wife, Guan Zhaodi.

331
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:20,319
Xiaoyao, you are awake.

332
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:27,839
Sorry.

333
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,400
I couldn't save him.

334
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:33,000
I'm glad you're all right.

335
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,519
There are people

336
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,559
who have never met their fathers.

337
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,480
At least I had met mine.

338
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:48,279
Open the door.

339
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,319
Herbs?

340
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,799
Xiaoyao, these herbs were left outside.

341
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,119
Someone must have sent these.

342

of medicine here.

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:31,759
(is named "Retainment".)

346
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,440
(Starting today,)

347
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,720
(you are the owner of this sword.)

348
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,240
(Remember,)

349
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,519
(do not always resort to killing.)

350
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,039
(Show mercy if you can.)

351
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:56,759
Mengzhen,

352
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,119
I wounded Zhu Xiaoyao

353
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,519
when I tried to kill Guan Qi.

354
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,559
But still,
she is your personal bodyguard.

355
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:05,319
It was a mistake on my end.

356
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,559
This isn't what you think.

357
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:13,039
How so?

358
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,960
The cold-hearted often show kindness.

359
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:22,680
Some words are best left unspoken.

360
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,640
You insisted on killing Guan Qi

361
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:27,279
because you wanted to avenge Mr. Wo.

362
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,519
Mr. Wo had shown me
and Little Rock kindness.

363
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,279
We must repay that kindness.

364
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,880
Guan Qi killed Mr. Wo.

365
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:40,160
I had to make him pay for that.

366
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:41,559
Very well.

367
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,559
That's the Bai Choufei I used to know.

368
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,680
Remember

369
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,440
who you point your blade to.

370
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,640
They make weapons in Song

371
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:57,000
and transport them to the north

372
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,519
to sell to the Liao people.

373
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,599
Then, the Liao people use those weapons

374
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:01,720
to fight Song.

375
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:03,640
As the war continues,

376
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,839
they continue to make money

377
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,160
by exploiting it.

378
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,119
That led to
the predicament we're facing.

379
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,680
The Liao people are great warriors.

380
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:16,119
And now, they have weapons
provided by the Youqiao Group.

381
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,000
It's no wonder we have

382
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:19,599
constant skirmishes at the borders.

383
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:22,200
The gold circulating in the world

384
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:24,559
is the people's hard-earned money.

385
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,839
The Pili Sect

386
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,119
mastered the technique
of making explosives.

387
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:31,559
But Lei Sun betrayed the Pili Sect.

388
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:33,200
He took most of
the elite soldiers with him.

389
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,000
Lei Mei, the daughter
to the Elder of Pili Sect,

390
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,400
is now working for the Six Half Hall.

391
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,640
It's safe to say

392
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:43,359
the Six Half Hall produced the weapons

393
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,319
sent to the north.

394
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,440
Guan Qi hated Fu Zongshu and Lei Sun

395
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,279
to the bones.

396
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,480
He told me

397
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,920
there was a mastermind
pulling the strings.

398
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,759
Now we know
there is a mastermind in hiding,

399
00:31:58,359 --> 00:31:59,400
we should force them to show themselves.

400
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:02,079
Wuxie, dispatch the entire
Messenger Pigeon Group.

401
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:04,480
Locate the Six Half Hall's
armory as soon as possible.

402
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:05,920
Understood.

403
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,319
I'll see to it right away.

404
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:32,160
Xiaoyao.

405
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,160
Must you go?

406
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,279
I made a choice and must now
accept the consequences.

407
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:53,400
I, Zhu Xiaoyao,
had betrayed the House Master.

408
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,599
I will accept my punishment.

409
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:57,640
You treated your former master
in such a way.

410
00:32:58,359 --> 00:32:59,440
When I'm in danger,

411
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:01,240
you will treat me the same as well.

412
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:04,480
Personally,

413
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:05,839
I don't blame you.

414
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:07,640
But as the House Master,

415
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:10,839
this matter must be dealt with
according to the House's rules.

416
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,599
Thank you for the judgment, Mr. Su.

417
00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:31,950
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

418
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,799
Zhu Xiaoyao

419
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,079
abetted the House's enemies.

420
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,559
Her action must not be tolerated.

421
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:38,599
As per the House's rule,

422
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,319
she is banished.

423
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:42,080
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

424
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,159
As the House Master,

425
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,880
I am responsible for her action as well.

426
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,000
I will take that strike for her.

427
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,159
When you leave,

428
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,440
you are no longer one of us.

429
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:12,840
But wherever you are

430
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:13,920
from now on,

431
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,360
you will always be my friend.

432
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:20,639
Bid her farewell.

433
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,320
Over the years,

434
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,159
you worked in the dark

435
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,039
to support our brethren in operations.

436
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:33,920
Mr. Su is aware

437
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:36,360
of your contribution,

438
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:41,519
and so are our brethren!

Yellow.

442
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:51,280
You're a good dog.

443
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:52,920
You'll take care of Madam, right?

444
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,559
Where is Bai?

445
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:02,000
In the house.

446
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,199
Bai gets sentimental easily.

447
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:09,280
He can't stand seeing his friend off.

448
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:25,320
Little Rock.

449
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:27,440
Wo told me

450
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,000
you often went to a balcony

451
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,599
to view this courtyard.

452
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:35,880
Could you take me there too?

453
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,480
Let's go.

454
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:03,880
Madam.

455
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,840
There, that's our home.

456
00:40:02,762 --> 00:40:04,320
(Respect Brings Victory)

457
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,719
Indeed.

458
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,599
It's beautiful.

(To live a free and simple life,)

460
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,239

(When I parted with my Master,)

462
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,000
(I didn't feel too much sadness.)

463
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,280
(I knew that one day,)

464
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:18,079
(I'd reunite with my Master.)

465

(But after I came to the Capital,)

(I realized there are people
we'll never meet again)
