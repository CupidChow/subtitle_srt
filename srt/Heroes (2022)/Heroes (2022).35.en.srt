It's too cold in here.

Master told us

58
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,400
to live on and live well.

59
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,680

(it means I am already gone.)

63
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:52,879
(I know)

64
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:56,079
(you will never blame me for Master's death.)

65
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,399
(But I can't help but blame myself.)

66
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,759
(Master is gone.)

67
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,199
(We are both saddened by his passing.)

68
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,839
(But you are forcing a smile
to ease my sadness.)

69
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,680
(That only made me feel worse.)

70
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,066
(Here lies the beloved Master: Recluse Tianyi)

71
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:12,319
(If you can't talk about Master
when you're with me,)

72
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:13,879
(or miss him,)

74
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,920
(be happy again.)

75
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,160
(Master's passing is
now a thorn in our hearts.)

76
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,360
(But we are too scared to remove it.)

77
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,360
(We can't even try,)

78
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,120
(because the pain will only
be more unbearable.)

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,759
(Perhaps)

80
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,759
(we should give each other some space.)

81
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,959
(Let time)

82
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,040
(heal this ache in our hearts.)

83
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,319
(This is my choice.)

84
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,759
(I've made up my mind,)

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,480
(but leaving you
requires a lot of courage.)

86
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,079
(To me,)

87
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,560
(you're the most precious treasure)

88
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,560
(I've found in the martial arts world.)

89
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,199
(I had never thought)

90
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,360
(I'd meet someone)

91
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,000
(who could make my life
so much more wonderful)

92
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,399
(and at the same time so peaceful.)

(Every moment we share,)

95
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,839
(and every bit of memory)

96
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:11,839
(are priceless)

97
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,560
(to me.)

98
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,680
(We've witnessed
the vastness of the sea,)

99
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,279
(been through the never-ending snow,)

100
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,759
(and admired the sky full of stars.)

101
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,399
(To me,)

102
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,759
(you're the best thing
to ever come into my world.)

108
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,360
Little Rock?

109
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,360
Little Rock!

110
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:27,360
Xiaoshi!

111
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,879
Xiaoshi!

112
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,560
One of the horses is missing.

113
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,839
Miss Wen Rou must have taken off with the horse.

114
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,600
But it was snowing last night.

115
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,399
The tracks have been covered up by snow.

116
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,680
We have no idea where she went.

117
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,800
She left while it was snowing

118
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,959
so there wouldn't be

119
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,759
any tracks.

120
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,959
I taught her that.

121
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,759
Many women who seem soft and frail

122
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,759
can be impossibly unyielding.

123
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,199
Nothing can stop them.

124
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:58,160
It's even more so
given how strong-willed Wen Rou is.

125
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,680
I think

126
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,279
she was determined to leave.

127
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:03,560
If you asked me,

128
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,800
she could be at the edge of the world.

129
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,639
But how far can that be?

130
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,639
Your fate is intertwined.

131
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,519
You will be together again someday.

132
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,240
If I insisted on keeping her here,

133
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:18,800
she'd never be happy again.

134
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,560
I should respect her decision.

135
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,720
And given my circumstances,

136
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,199
perhaps it's best

137
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,480
that she left.

138
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:29,879
How so?

139
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,040
What about you?

140
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,399
What will you do now?

141
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,120
I am a wanted fugitive.

142
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,840
The world is vast,

143
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,480
but there are only
a handful of places I can go.

144
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,399
I will follow the original plan

145
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,159
and leave the pass.

146
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:52,399
Good.

147
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:53,799
Brothers,

148
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,960
I leave Official Liu in your care.

149
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:58,279
Take care.

150
00:08:59,039 --> 00:08:59,799
Take care.

151
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,559
- Take care.
- Take care.

152
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:05,680
To grow old and nameless,

153
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:10,320
only Di Feijing would have that wish.

154
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,760
(The land is vast,)

158

Why did you come back?

180
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,199
I've decided to follow you

181
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,600
and escort Official Liu back to the Capital.

182
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,480
Sorry for the intrusion.

183
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:01,679

Chancellor Cai is.

185
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05,679
Not to mention
you are a wanted fugitive.

186
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:06,400
Move forward for what's right.

187
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,559

192

What will you do with Su Mengzhen?

193
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,400
Su Mengzhen

194
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,360
is the most respected hero.

195
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:35,880
Given his reputation,

196
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,720
if he died in prison,

197
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,480
the people would revolt.

198
00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:41,520
If he died where people can see,

199
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,039
there would be chaos.

200
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:47,400
But if he died in
the House of Sunset Drizzle...

201
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,400
That would be his demise.

202
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,279
I

203
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,480
am his demise.

204
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,720
Wang Xiaoshi is still alive.

205
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:15,880
That's the best hope I have right now.

206
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,679
I wonder when he's coming back?

207
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,799
I know you're worried about his safety.

208
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,600
Burn some joss sticks in the morning.

209
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,919
Pray for his safe return for me.

210
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,199
Sure.

211
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,840
You can fool them,

212
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,240
but not me.

213
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,039
Even if Wang Xiaoshi is alive,

214
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:45,959
even if he returns to the Capital,

215
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,480
and even if things might
change for the better,

216
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,880
I'm afraid

217
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,720
your body might already...

218
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,640
You are right.

219
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,799
Bai Choufei's ambition is beyond measure.

220
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,039
He doesn't have the patience.

221
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,319
Sir.

222
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,559
He will kill you.

223
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,880
As I said,

224
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,640
the only man who can kill me

225
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,279
is myself.

226
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,679
But I was wrong.

227
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,640
There is another who can.

228
00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:23,000
Who is it?

229
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:29,880
You.

230
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,039
"The fearless brings peace for many,

231
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,360
but dies a death that's lonely."

232
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,279
When you hear this line,

233
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:41,319
do not hesitate.

234
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,199
You must kill me.

235
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:07,400
Tomorrow

236
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,000
you must gather some plums
for me from the Beiying Forest.

237
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,279
I'm making Chun's
favorite preserved plums.

238
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,279
This will be the last time.

239
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:23,640
Gather the fruits for me.

240
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,640
House Master!

241
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,039
House Master.

242
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:55,840
Get up.

243
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,279
House Master, I'll get you the physician.

244
00:15:59,360 --> 00:15:59,959
I'll get help.

245
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,439
Don't go to Physician Shu.

246
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,880
I've learned a lot from this sickness.

247
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,760
I know very well how sick I am.

248
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,880
I've sent the Lord of Luoyang a letter

249
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,159
and asked for the secret medicine.

250
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,559
If my guess is right,

251
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:16,240
it should arrive tomorrow.

252
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,959
Great! That is great.

253
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,159
House Master, I'll send our men

254
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:23,240
to welcome the envoy of the Wen family.

255
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:23,760
All right?

256
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,000
See to it yourself.

257
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,480
With their medicine,

258
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,319
I'll get better.

259
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,520
Sure.

260
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,079
House Master,

261
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:34,959
let me help you to your room.

262
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,239
I'm all right.

263
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,040
Don't worry.

264
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:52,959
House Master.

265
00:16:54,239 --> 00:16:55,159
Rest well.

266
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,719
- Mr. Bai.
- Mr. Bai.

267
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:32,400
We got you the thing you asked.

268
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,914
(From the Chancellor. Su Mengzhen
sent his man to assassinate Fu Zongshu.)

269
00:17:38,915 --> 00:17:40,340
(Arrest him and kill the rebels.)

270
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:45,600
Good.

271
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:46,999
Mr. Bai.

272
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,080
Su Mengzhen is already a cripple.

273
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:52,719
With your might,

274
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,159
you can easily kill him.

275
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:57,400
Why would you need a document?

276
00:17:58,439 --> 00:17:59,560
You are so wrong.

277
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:01,999
He's the famous Su Mengzhen.

278
00:18:03,439 --> 00:18:05,880
Killing him requires an impeccable timing.

279
00:18:06,479 --> 00:18:07,519
One strike

280
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,600
and not the slightest hesitation.

281
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:11,959
But I have the document.

282
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,479
Now is the best time.

283
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,159
Yes.

284
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,080
Yes.

285
00:18:19,479 --> 00:18:20,239
Dismissed.

286
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,080
Many have tried to kill him but failed.

287
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,439
What makes you think you'll succeed?

288
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:36,959
Are you asking

289
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:39,640
because you want him dead

290
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:41,600
or do you want him alive?

291
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,040
I have an idea.

292
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,199
Let's run a test.

293
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,840
See if it's his fate to die by my hand.

294
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,239
What test?

295
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,337
(Order)

296
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,439
I'll point to a character randomly.

297
00:19:04,439 --> 00:19:05,479
If it's an even number,

298
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:07,479
I'll kill him.

299
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,719
If it's an odd number,

300
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:12,719
I'll spare his life, considering he was once

301
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:15,239
my brother.

302
00:19:20,479 --> 00:19:21,320
Let's begin.

303
00:19:26,136 --> 00:19:27,669
(Meng)

304
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,560
"Meng?"

305
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,239
It seems our fate is intertwined.

306
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:38,080
There are 13 strokes in this character.

307
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,400
You've gone through
a painstaking effort to take his life,

308
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:48,239
but it seems heaven thinks otherwise.

309
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,560
I don't believe in heaven's will.

310
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,560
I believe only in myself.

311
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,120
One, two, three, four, five, six,

312
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,959
seven, eight, nine, ten,

313
00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:13,840
eleven, twelve, thirteen,

314
00:20:13,873 --> 00:20:16,682
(Meng)

315
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:17,679
fourteen.

316
00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:22,600
That's heaven's will.

317
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:24,640
In the past,

318
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:26,719
people must go through me to get to him.

319
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:29,320
But now, only I can take his life.

320
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:36,479
You've lost your mind.

321
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,719
You're right.

322
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:39,840
But what about you?

323
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:42,800
Are you any better?

324
00:20:44,999 --> 00:20:46,640
You face the man who killed your father,

325
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:49,840
but you still love him.

326
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:53,239
But then again, you feel
frustrated for not killing him.

327
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,959
And then the cycle goes on and on.

328
00:20:57,719 --> 00:20:59,600
Let's see
how long your sanity will last.

329
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,929
(Six Half Hall)

330
00:21:25,943 --> 00:21:30,040
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

331
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,800
A closed front gate

332
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,360
is not enough to stop

333
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,600
Chancellor's order.

334
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,719
Let's go inside.

335
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,343
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

336
00:22:43,439 --> 00:22:44,199
Mr. Wukui,

337
00:22:45,439 --> 00:22:47,080
do you carry
the House Master's pass with you?

338
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,320
Oh, I forgot.

339
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,959
The Wen family doesn't know our faces.

340
00:22:52,959 --> 00:22:54,239
We need the pass to verify ourselves.

341
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,159
Let's go get it.

342
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:56,959
- Let's go.
- Yes.

343
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,679
You're finally here.

344
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:08,999
Yes.

345
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,080
I'm finally here.

346
00:24:15,439 --> 00:24:17,280
The House of Sunset Drizzle.

347
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,280
You've been here since you were born,

348
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,320
but it took me years to get here.

349
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,199
I brought
Chancellor Cai's order with me,

350
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,919
but there is no one else in the House.

351
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:36,080
Speaking of that,

352
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,519
why didn't you run away?

353
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,840
As you said,

354
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:44,199
we were born differently.

355
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,999
I was born into this place.

356
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:47,560
Why should I run away?

357
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,239
Are you ready to take my life?

358
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:54,439
You can tell before I even

359
00:24:54,999 --> 00:24:55,600
say it aloud.

360
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,759
It's your breath.

361
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,199
A person's breath
is body language in itself.

362
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,800
You take deep breaths when you speak

363
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,080
to suppress your stress.

364
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:13,600
You rarely get so nervous.

365
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,239
Other than killing me,

366
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:19,199
I don't see why you'd get so nervous.

367
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,479
It seems

368
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:27,560
knowing you for too long
backfires on me.

369
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,040
You could tell with one look

370
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,959
what my true nature is.

371
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,360
I don't mind being honest with you.

372
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,040
I am nervous,

373
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,120
but I am also excited.

374
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:41,320
I've thought about
killing you for too long.

375
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:48,400
Why do you want to kill me?

376
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:51,159
Is it because you serve a new master

377
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,919
and want to prove your loyalty?

378
00:25:53,439 --> 00:25:54,880
The young die fighting.

379
00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:56,120
You stand above all.

380
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,560
You should know the rule.

381
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,040
No.

382
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,759
That is not why you want me dead.

383
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,320
You want to kill me

384
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,880
because you resent me.

385
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,880
Of course I do!

386
00:26:10,199 --> 00:26:11,959
You treated me like a dog!

387
00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:13,439
You ordered and bossed me around!

388
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,640
I had enough!

389
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:16,479
You shall pay with your life

390
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,959
for how you disrespected me.

391
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,999
One question.

392
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:42,800
Could you spare me

393
00:26:44,719 --> 00:26:46,199
considering we were

394
00:26:46,719 --> 00:26:47,519
once brothers?

395
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,800
What did you say?

396
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,320
Are you begging for my mercy?

397
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,080
Yes.

398
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,199
Su Mengzhen begs for my mercy!

399
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,759
Seeing we were once sworn brothers,

400
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,759
and that I am now

401
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,040
a dying man

402
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,959
with nothing left...

403
00:27:18,999 --> 00:27:21,280
I beg for your mercy.

404
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,040
If you were any smarter,

405
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,719
you wouldn't say that at this moment.

406
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,439
If I were any smarter,

407
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,679
would I be in this sorry state?

408
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:40,239
Choufei.

409
00:27:41,439 --> 00:27:42,679
Throughout my time as the House Master,

410
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,519
have I not lived up to the name?

411
00:27:45,439 --> 00:27:45,999
You have.

412
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,840
It's just that I want to
take your place so badly,

413
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,439
which is why I must eliminate you.

414
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,439
Good.

415
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:54,199
Good.

416
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,840
What about as a friend?

417
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:01,120
Have I ever failed you as a friend?

418
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,640
Yes, you have!

419
00:28:02,199 --> 00:28:04,360
You always favored Wang Xiaoshi over me!

420
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:06,239
You never treated me as your brother!

421
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,439
I challenge you to a final duel

422
00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:10,800
because I deem you worthy.

423
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,519
Su Mengzhen.

424
00:28:14,199 --> 00:28:16,040
You should thank me for that!

425
00:28:38,239 --> 00:28:38,919
Your answers

426
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,719
made me believe

427
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,439
it's right to place
my trust in Wang Xiaoshi.

428
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,040
It's right not to put you in charge.

429
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,959
I asked you to spare me

430
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:53,999
because it's a test for you.

431
00:28:56,479 --> 00:28:58,719
Since there is no room for further negotiation,

432
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,080
I shall show you no mercy.

433
00:29:17,199 --> 00:29:18,400
You are right to feel nervous.

434
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,800
Even now,

435
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,959
I might still defeat you.

436
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,560
I'd love to find out about it.

437
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,583
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

438
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,600
Those are Bai Choufei's men.

439
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:50,679
Bai Choufei?

440
00:29:51,199 --> 00:29:51,840
We should attack.

441
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,280
No.

442
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,280
No.

443
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:55,999
I've been impatient my whole life.

444
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,759
Now is not the time.

445
00:29:58,759 --> 00:29:59,280
I have an idea.

446
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,439
I'll sneak in

447
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,560
and scout ahead.

448
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:02,800
Stay here.

449
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,400
Inform the Advisor if anything happens.

450
00:30:04,479 --> 00:30:04,919
Yes.

451
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,040
Let's go.

452
00:30:59,999 --> 00:31:01,080
You are already half-dead.

453
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,919
You can't win this fight.

454
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,880
As I said,

455
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,640
some obstacles take but a moment

456
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:09,640
to overcome.

457
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,320
Su Mengzhen!

458
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:20,280
Killing you isn't that hard.

459
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,040
You are

460
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,439
the best rival

461
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:27,640
and the worst enemy.

462
00:33:30,999 --> 00:33:32,759
Then allow your worst enemy

463
00:33:33,959 --> 00:33:35,519
to bid you farewell.

464
00:33:57,999 --> 00:33:58,999
Su Mengzhen!

465
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,479
Su Mengzhen!

466
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,720
Su Mengzhen.

467
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,079
Su Mengzhen.

468
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,760
This way!

469
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,919
Check every inch of this place!

470
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,079
Yes!

471
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:52,959
Sir,

472
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:53,559
we've found nothing.

473
00:34:57,439 --> 00:34:57,880
Move out.

474
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,880
(House of Sunset Drizzle)

475
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,360
House Master Bai.

476
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,119
We caught Shi Wukui at the Huxin Pavilion.

477
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,200
Where is Su Mengzhen?

478
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,999
If you kill me,

479
00:35:38,479 --> 00:35:40,840
you will never find him.

480
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,320
Tell us where he is.

481
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:46,680
We'll spare you from the pain of torture.

482
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:54,840
Who do you think you are?

483
00:35:56,919 --> 00:35:58,320
If I'm saying anything,

484
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,800
I'll tell your master, Mr. Bai instead.

485
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,599
Let's hear it.

486
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,559
When I first met you,

487
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:11,360
you told me you were
Su Mengzhen's suicide warrior.

488
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,320
Would you actually betray him?

489
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,720
Keep searching!

490
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,479
Miss Zhu!

491
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,320
The House Master...

492
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:39,800
The House Master was...

493
00:36:41,439 --> 00:36:42,559
He was killed by Bai Choufei!

494
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,280
The House has been seized.

495
00:36:58,439 --> 00:36:58,999
Advisor!

496
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,280
Advisor!

497
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:01,559
Advisor!

498
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,320
Advisor! Bai Choufei raided the House.

499
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:08,959
The House Master is dead.

500
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,240
His body was nowhere to be found.

501
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,320
Advisor...

502
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,039
We've lost the House.

503
00:37:34,479 --> 00:37:35,160
Well?

504
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:36,559
We haven't found him.

505
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,160
The others are still searching.

506
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,639
Reinforcements have arrived.

507
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:41,760
We can search every inch
of this building.

508
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,439
And the secret passage?

509
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:44,800
It leads to the lake

510
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,079
and is connected to the Bian River.

511
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,320
The underground
waterways can lead to anywhere.

512
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,519
It's like a labyrinth once entered.

513
00:37:50,919 --> 00:37:52,320
We can't tell which direction he went.

514
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,240
But since he was wounded,
he couldn't have gone far.

515
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:47,959
Congratulations, House Master!

516
00:38:52,439 --> 00:38:53,079
House Master Bai,

517
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,840
from now on,

518
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,160
the entire martial arts world
is under your command.

519
00:38:59,200 --> 00:38:59,999
Send the words.

520
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:01,479
Su Mengzhen is dead.

521
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,639
Continue the search secretly.

522
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:05,439
Yes!

523
00:39:07,439 --> 00:39:08,200
From this moment on,

524
00:39:08,999 --> 00:39:11,439
search every corner of the Capital,

525
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,999
and every inch of the land

526
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,599
to find Su Mengzhen.

527
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,479
Bring him to me,

528
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:22,800
dead or alive.

529
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:24,119
Yes.

530
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:29,079
House Master, Su Mengzhen
was heavily wounded.

531
00:39:29,479 --> 00:39:30,680
He would have surely died.

532
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:31,959
We will

533
00:39:31,959 --> 00:39:33,479
find his body very soon.

534
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:34,400
One more thing.

535
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,840
Clear Su Mengzhen's room.

536
00:39:38,479 --> 00:39:39,360
Anything he used

537
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:40,760
or touched

538
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,720
must be disposed of and burned.

539
00:39:43,919 --> 00:39:44,720
Leave none behind.

540
00:39:45,479 --> 00:39:46,919
And the tree in front of his room,

541
00:39:47,479 --> 00:39:48,240
chop it down.

542
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,360
Yes.

543
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,079
Report!

544
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:55,919
Vice...

545
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:02,800
House Master.

546
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:16,280
Every message from the messenger pigeons

547
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:18,880
must be handed to me firsthand.

548
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:19,999
Yes, House Master.

549
00:40:29,777 --> 00:40:32,270
