1
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,360
Mr. Qi, are you having a bad stomach?

2
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,240
Who has a bad stomach?

3
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,080
It's you.

4
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,320
The villain complained first.

5
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,840
If I hadn't seen you sleeping so well,

6
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,120
I would have thrown you out long ago.

7
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,880
It's not me.

8
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,680
Dongfang Yu actually hates me.

9
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,120
This Eastern Yu

10
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,800
Did you tell Wu Jiao Jiao?

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,120
Oh, no, I won't.

12
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,960
Second Junior Brother.

13
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,320
Uncle Dong has made breakfast.

14
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,080
Eldest Brother.

15
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,280
Shouldn't he do it?

16
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,560
I can't either.

17
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,440
I like it very much.

18
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,640
You praised Uncle Dong.

19
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,600
go

20
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,920
You are so charming.

21
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,760
Did you have any difficulty recently?

22
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,320
What difficulties will you encounter?

23
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,480
You can tell me.

24
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,040
Brother Yu, this is delicious.

25
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,600
This is the toast I bought in the shop today.

26
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,120
I'll cook it for you tomorrow.

27
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,240
It will taste better.

28
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,480
To make bread.

29
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,360
Who wouldn't?

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,920
Then come.

31
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,000
Come on.

32
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,840
This is for making dumplings at noon.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,440
Why don't you give it to me?

34
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,040
No yeast.

35
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,360
So what?

36
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,520
I like to use this.

37
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,680
That's really fresh.

38
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,320
When I first heard about making bread,

39
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,040
No yeast.

40
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,320
How about this?

41
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,760
Is what makes my bread special.

42
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,640
It's not your fault that you don't understand.

43
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,440
But you should be humble.

44
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,640
I won't.

45
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,800
A man who doesn't even know how to live.

46
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,240
Teach me.

47
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,800
How about you apologize?

48
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,680
I'll teach you how to apologize.

49
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,400
I really don't believe it.

50
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,720
Alright.

51
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,240
I'm sorry. Here, teach me.

52
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,560
Your apology is insincere.

53
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,400
Don't teach me.

54
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,960
Some people are stubborn.

55
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,600
It's like farting in the morning.

56
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,080
Dongyu

57
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,920
You worked so hard today.

58
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,840
Here, have a tomato.

59
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,200
Supplementary nutrition

60
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,040
Xiao Bao.

61
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,720
You have a very important task today.

62
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,080
Do you know what it is?

63
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,360
What is it?

64
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,480
Is to watch these two people.

65
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,600
Don't let them fight.

66
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,600
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

67
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,600
I'll leave it to you.

68
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,440
I'm glad you're happy.

69
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,760
bye-bye

70
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,720
Xiao Bao, let's go. I'll take you to eat something delicious.

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,840
You're really stirring shit.
