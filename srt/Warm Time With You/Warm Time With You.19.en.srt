1
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,080
Brother Xiao Yu.

2
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,000
come

3
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:05,760
Second Junior Brother.

4
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,640
Why are you always picking me up?

5
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,240
Yes?

6
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,160
Are you upset that I came to pick you up?

7
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,160
Are you happy?

8
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,080
I know.

9
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,440
You want your mom to pick you up?

10
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,240
I'm jealous.

11
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,760
I want you two to pick me up.

12
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,080
Have you told your mother?

13
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,920
No

14
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,680
Why didn't you say something?

15
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,440
Second Junior Brother.

16
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,160
Do you want to live with me?

17
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:32,760
That's right.

18
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,240
I want to live with you.

19
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,160
But I don't want to leave my mother.

20
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,480
Let me ask you something.

21
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,640
Choose between me and my mother.

22
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,480
Who are you going to choose?

23
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,000
I don't want to choose.

24
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,560
But you can be my father.

25
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,240
And be your father.

26
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,280
That's right.

27
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,600
When you get married,

28
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,440
Don't bother me as a four-year-old.

29
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,120
I don't have to leave my mother.

30
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,840
And a father.

31
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,040
As we are now.

32
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,600
To live a good life.

33
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,560
come

34
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,360
I remember when I was young,

35
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,120
You drank some water and got it everywhere.

36
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,120
And then behind me,

37
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,840
And wiped my mouth with my clothes.

38
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,800
You found it out?

39
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,680
Then why didn't you stop me?

40
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,320
You were so cute when you were little.

41
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,120
Follow my ass every day.

42
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,880
Like a little sidekick.

43
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,360
I was afraid I would tell you

44
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,120
You won't be my follower anymore.

45
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,800
How could it be?

46
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,640
I've always known you

47
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,040
I'm proud to be your follower.

48
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,440
Why did you reveal all my secrets?

49
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,520
to have spare time

50
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,560
after

51
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,440
This is our little secret.

52
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,040
You can clean my clothes.

53
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,160
I really miss my childhood.

54
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,000
You are so charming.

55
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,960
Actually, I am looking forward to the future.

56
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,920
I'm longing for you.

57
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,760
And Wu Yi.

58
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,240
In the future,

59
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,760
Brother Xiao Yu.

60
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,760
I have to pick up Wu Yi.

61
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,560
Then I...

62
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,560
I'm leaving now.

63
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,440
I'll go with you.

64
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,000
to have spare time

65
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,440
I have to get changed.

66
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,600
Why would I run away?

67
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:19,920
Over the years,

68
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,680
What I was looking forward to the most happened.

69
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,440
I ran away.

70
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,240
Is it because of Qi Mo?

71
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,200
Why would I think that?

72
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,760
Hello, Qi Mo.

73
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,080
Xiao Bao is with me.

74
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,760
I'll show him around the Qi Group.

75
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,240
Oh

76
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,360
Second Brother, like me,

77
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,520
Eldest Brother.

78
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,240
Why do you do this after putting on lipstick?

79
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,800
There are two people on TV.

80
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,080
We will be together after kissing.

81
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,360
It's your mother again.

82
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,600
To watch TV with you.

83
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,800
This is my lipstick.

84
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,160
You put on your mother's lipstick.

85
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,200
Even if you kiss each other,
