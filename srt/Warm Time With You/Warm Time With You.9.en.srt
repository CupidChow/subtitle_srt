1
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,240
It's okay. Do your own thing.

2
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,320
hey

3
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,880
This chair is mine.

4
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,840
You can't sit there.

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,240
If you say that,

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,960
I still insist on

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,120
Brother Yu, why are you here?

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,280
This is a game of musical chairs.

9
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,240
I played it in kindergarten.

10
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,200
Mom, can I play with you?

11
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,600
Brother Yu, why are you here?

12
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,920
I thought you were on a business trip.

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,040
He came to see me.

14
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,360
I'll be back soon.

15
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,960
You two know each other?

16
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,560
I have some business contacts.

17
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,920
Not really.

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,440
I just came back from a business trip.

19
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,960
So I came to see you and Xiao Bao.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,880
What about the side dishes?

21
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,920
Xiaorou made it.

22
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,800
We don't eat these dishes, right, Jiao?

23
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,800
Why do you always call me Jiao Jiao?

24
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,840
It's weird.

25
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,800
She's so affectionate.

26
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,680
After all, we are a family.

27
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,240
Besides,

28
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,880
Who says I don't eat side dishes?

29
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,520
You don't even know.

30
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,640
Xiaorou can cook these dishes.

31
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,000
Wu Yi and I won't eat it.

32
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,480
Second Brother, don't say it too early.

33
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,320
You won't know until you eat it.

34
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,080
Wu Yi knows it best.

35
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,920
Wu Yi, let me ask you something.

36
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,200
Choose between me and the side dish.

37
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,120
Who are you going to choose?

38
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,960
Of course, you're more important than the side dishes.

39
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,480
Well

40
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,720
But you don't have any side dishes.

41
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,520
Mom, I'm going to paint.

42
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,080
I have to finish my homework after drawing.

43
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,880
Go. The teacher told me.

44
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:18,720
WuYi

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,680
As the heir of the Qi family,

46
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,120
How can you say these dishes are delicious?

47
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,520
I heard that

48
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,600
The landlord has been looking for trouble.

49
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,120
Xiaorou just told me

50
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,520
It's nothing.

51
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,880
Has been solved.

52
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,640
that

53
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,320
If there's something to hide,

54
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,320
You can tell me directly.

55
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,400
I really don't.

56
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,440
Don't get me wrong.

57
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,760
How about this?

58
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,320
You and Wu Yi should move to my house.

59
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,080
The room is still empty.

60
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,640
Xiaorou can be your company.

61
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,840
I don't want to leave here.

62
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,880
If my sister comes back,

63
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,880
I'm afraid she can't find me and Wu Yi.

64
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,440
It took me a long time to persuade him.

65
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,040
Qi Mo asked us to stay here.

66
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,200
therefore

67
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,240
Qi Mo

68
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,080
Is the landlord here.

69
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,720
Qi Mo didn't bully you, right?

70
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,640
How about this?

71
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,400
We can buy this house.

72
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,520
Dongyu

73
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,240
I'm really sorry.

74
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,320
The price of my house

75
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,800
You can't afford it.

76
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,080
I won't let anyone bully Jiao Jiao.

77
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,280
Mom, I've finished drawing.

78
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,520
I'll play outside for a while.

79
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,480
Go.

80
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,040
Please be safe.

81
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,480
Well

82
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,480
Brother Xiao Yu.

83
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,040
How about we go out for a walk?

84
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,080
There are outsiders.

85
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,280
It's inconvenient to talk.

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,680
go

87
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,600
Who wants to go out?

88
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,000
He was here just now.

89
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,600
Where are you going?

90
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,280
Second Junior Brother.

91
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,400
Wu Yi, what are you doing?

92
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,160
This damn Wu Jiao Jiao

93
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,160
How could you let such a young child

94
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,480
To do this.

95
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,040
Wu Jiao Jiao, you're finished.

96
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,440
Give it to me.

97
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,360
WuYi

98
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,440
Don't do this anymore, you know?

99
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,080
Second Junior Brother,

100
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,920
There's no buts.

101
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,360
That's what I used

102
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,120
I know.

103
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,960
You have done so much for this family.

104
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,240
I'll take care of you from now on.
