1
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,720
Actually,

2
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,320
If you throw us out now,

3
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,160
And pay us back.

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,480
How inappropriate.

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,600
But if you let us stay,

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,920
Can you collect rent?

7
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,120
I bought the house.

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,960
Do you think I care about the rent?

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,080
Yes

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,000
big shot

11
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,520
I'm shallow.

12
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,200
Look.

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,720
You and I are Wu Yi's closest relatives.

14
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,080
You have too much money to care about the rent.

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,880
that

16
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,760
that

17
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,120
Why don't you let us

18
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,040
And love each other.

19
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,240
Think about this picture.

20
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,560
How wonderful it is.

21
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,680
I bought this place.

22
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,480
To take care of Wu Yi.

23
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,520
But after I met you today,

24
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,480
I found Wu Yi's living environment

25
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,040
Is much worse than I thought.

26
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,800
I don't trust you with Wu Yi.

27
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,800
You can either

28
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,400
Give up the custody of Wu Yi now.

29
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,880
The house is yours.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,640
or

31
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,280
Move out of this house now.

32
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,280
WuYi

33
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,000
We'll move out now.

34
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,000
custody

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,840
Don't even think about it.

36
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,240
Mom

37
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,360
Why are you moving?

38
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,840
Are we getting kicked out by a bad landlord?

39
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,880
Yes

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,880
Bad landlord.

41
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,520
Second Brother, we have a deal.

42
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,800
To protect the martial arts together.

43
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,160
Do something.

44
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,480
You can't bear

45
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,480
Let Wu Yi sleep with you?

46
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,280
WuYi

47
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,280
We'll pack up now.

48
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,560
Just like our spring outing.

49
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,760
Our adventure is about to begin.

50
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,800
Well

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
WuYi

52
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,920
Do you like it here?

53
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,760
This is my home.

54
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,280
Of course I like it.

55
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,520
Then you and Second Junior Brother

56
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,160
Live here together, okay?

57
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,080
Second Junior Brother.

58
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,320
I really, really like you.

59
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,680
But I have to protect my mother.

60
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,680
She will be bullied by the bad guys.

61
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,400
As you wish.

62
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,480
We'll move out now.

63
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,120
to wait a moment

64
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,960
Protect our homes and defend our country

65
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,760
Keep fit and healthy.

66
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,640
That's all for today.

67
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,600
Bye. Be careful on the way.

68
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,360
Goodbye, teacher.

69
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,960
Where are you going, Wu Yi?

70
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,640
Let's train after class.

71
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,000
Hurry up.

72
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,040
YanKai

73
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,720
To find the best room here.

74
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,920
Put my clothes down.

75
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,160
Okay, boss.

76
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,280
Eldest Brother.

77
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,040
Look what I brought you.

78
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,160
Piggy Bag.

79
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,920
Do you like it

80
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,320
Come on.

81
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,440
It's so pretty.

82
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,960
It's so beautiful.

83
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,520
Why are you here?

84
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,440
Moving?

85
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,640
Come on.

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,360
This Qi Mo

87
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,400
How could you be so kind as to let me stay?

88
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,080
There must be a conspiracy.

89
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,800
No way

90
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,040
I have to get rid of him.

91
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,640
high five

92
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,560
Yeah

93
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,040
Why are you moving?

94
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,280
The beautiful scenery

95
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,560
To practice martial arts.

96
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,160
Practice
