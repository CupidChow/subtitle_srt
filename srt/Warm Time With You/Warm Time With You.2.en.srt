1
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,360
You don't have to thank me.

2
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,200
I've accepted it.

3
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,160
Thank

4
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,120
Thank you, big head.

5
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,880
I dumped them for three blocks.

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,120
I finally got rid of her.

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,240
It's my fault again.

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,960
What does it have to do with me?

9
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,720
You can beat them up.

10
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,920
They thought I was related to you.

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,120
Great, I have to pay for the medical expenses.

12
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,880
This lady

13
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,240
I helped you.

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,120
Do you think it's appropriate to blame me now?

15
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,120
Boss, be frank.

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,760
I have another one at home.

17
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,520
Should we buy it together?

18
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,440
That's unnecessary.

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,040
We are not interested in houses.

20
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,360
Your boss is interested in

21
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,440
The woman in the room

22
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,280
Our boss

23
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,480
I'm not interested in women.

24
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,800
This gentleman

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,640
You won't let go of my child.

26
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,600
What do you mean?

27
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,920
Give Wu Yi to you.

28
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,080
I'm worried.

29
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,560
In broad daylight,

30
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,120
You took our child

31
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,120
What are you worried about?

32
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:32,880
Mom

33
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,280
He's the second junior brother.

34
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,160
Protect the martial arts with me today.

35
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,800
What?

36
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm here today.

37
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,880
To get Wu Yi's custody back.

38
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,240
Who are you?

39
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,360
You have no right to ask for custody.

40
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,360
I'm Wu Yi's physiological relative.

41
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,520
His second uncle.

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,680
The Qi family has been

43
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,240
To know the existence of Wu Yi.

44
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,880
So I came to pick up Wu Yi today.

45
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,320
Take him back to the Qi family to raise him.

46
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,800
We hope you can take the initiative to give up custody.

47
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,680
after all

48
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,120
You're only his aunt.

49
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,440
What are you dreaming about?

50
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,240
Go back.

51
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,240
Boss

52
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,120
It's done.

53
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,680
The taxes will be paid in a few days.

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,680
Pretty good

55
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,880
I forgot to introduce myself to you.

56
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,560
I'm your current boss.

57
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,240
The landlord, Qi Mo,

58
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,840
Go to Wuyi.

59
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,880
By the way, Yan Kai,

60
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,640
This house is a little run-down.

61
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,640
It's time to decorate.

62
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,960
Change it to granite.

63
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,760
And that room.

64
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,880
Why do you keep it?

65
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,960
OK

66
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,040
What's going on?

67
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,560
Qi Mo bought the martial arts school.

68
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,000
Keep an eye on me.

69
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,520
Don't let him find out. Everything goes as planned.

70
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,400
Martial and charming, right?

71
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,400
It's clearly written in the contract.

72
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,800
If Party A reclaims the house forcibly,

73
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,560
You need to compensate Party B for one year's rent.

74
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,840
Send the account number to my assistant this afternoon.

75
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,160
Drink some water first.

76
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,320
Actually, if you kick us out now,

77
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,240
And pay us back.

78
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,480
How inappropriate.

79
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,480
But if you let us stay,

80
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,000
Can you collect rent?
