1
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,800
Who will be responsible for this?

2
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,040
Of course, you're in charge.

3
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,360
What martial arts school are you running?

4
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,360
This lady

5
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,960
Please pay attention to your behavior.

6
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,240
And indulges the villains.

7
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,960
So a kid like Wu Yi

8
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,720
He might get hurt again.

9
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,280
therefore

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,680
I'm the honorary principal.

11
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,080
Is to remind you all the time.

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,480
The school management and teachers

13
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,120
To eliminate this problem.

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,120
That's the only way.

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,840
So as to train people like Wu Yi.

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,360
An excellent and intelligent child.

17
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,040
You...

18
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,120
Martial and charming.

19
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,040
What's your intention to me?

20
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,120
You're a child yourself.

21
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,760
And take a child.

22
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,720
Thank you so much.

23
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,120
Mom

24
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,920
I said Second Junior Brother is very suitable.

25
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,120
Shh

26
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,320
You won.

27
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,600
What do you want to achieve?

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,640
I'll help you.

29
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,600
That day,

30
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,960
Are all fake?

31
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,880
What he did

32
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,800
Just to steal Wu Yi?

33
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,120
You are so charming.

34
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,680
Why didn't you answer the phone?

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,520
You are so charming.

36
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,800
Where is she?

37
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,360
You are so charming.

38
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,000
You are so charming.

39
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,160
Hello, Xiaorou.

40
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,720
Is Jiao Jiao with you?

41
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,640
No, what's wrong?

42
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,320
Do you know when she's in a bad mood,

43
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,040
Where will he go?

44
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,440
You should go to the restaurant.

45
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,560
Alright.

46
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,680
Boss

47
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,560
Two dozen more beers.

48
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,200
I can finally

49
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,640
Drink it without scruple.

50
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:42,960
Xiao Bao.

51
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,600
Do you really want to live with Qi Mo?
