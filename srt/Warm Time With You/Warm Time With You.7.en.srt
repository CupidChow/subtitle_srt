1
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,120
I'm so tired.

2
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,360
I can't relax for the martial arts.

3
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,960
I will work harder.

4
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,600
And hand out leaflets.

5
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,280
Hello, manager.

6
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,000
What? Triple the number of people.

7
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,640
Are all students and parents.

8
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,840
I'll be there soon.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,680
Can it be done?

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,800
It can work.

11
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,360
Practice first.

12
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,120
I'll be back later.

13
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,600
To fight with me.

14
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,520
Oh dear

15
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,240
Why are you so late?

16
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,960
I've been practicing for hours.

17
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,160
Assemble for training

18
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,040
You don't have to do it every day.

19
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,480
My clothes are wet.

20
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,120
Did I go too far?

21
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,600
actually

22
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,920
You don't have to work so hard.

23
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,560
Won't you give me custody of Wu Yi?

24
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,960
Custody is impossible.

25
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,480
Mom, you're back.

26
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,680
You missed me?

27
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,680
Yeah, I really miss you.

28
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,360
Aunt Xiaorou gave me

29
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,880
When I called,

30
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,320
You want meat?

31
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,960
I like to eat whatever my mom makes.

32
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,720
I only want my mother.

33
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,400
Wash your hands and prepare for the meat.

34
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,200
That's great.

35
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,040
You can eat meat tonight.

36
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,160
We've handed out all the leaflets today.

37
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,440
The whole world.

38
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,240
I can barely take you with me.

39
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,400
reluctantly

40
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,280
a row

41
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,520
How long can you last?

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,520
hey

43
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,800
Martial and charming.

44
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,520
You are so short of money.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,680
Why are you holding on to the custody of Wu Yi?

46
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,760
He's not your son.

47
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,520
Who says he's not my son?

48
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,000
Who says we don't kiss?

49
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,680
I fought with him.

50
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,040
Hit him.

51
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,560
Oh dear

52
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,080
Alright, alright.

53
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,160
Let's not fight.

54
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:19,920
I am.

55
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,480
When you work like this,

56
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,720
It's hard.

57
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,760
It's not hard for me.

58
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,600
I want to be here.

59
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,200
To raise Wu Yi.

60
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,760
My sister just disappeared.

61
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,360
She will definitely come back.

62
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,520
I must return Wu Yi to her.

63
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,040
My disciple.

64
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,160
We must work hard to refuel.

65
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,160
Work hard.

66
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,160
Work hard.

67
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,560
She's a crazy woman.

68
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,480
You can't even take care of yourself.

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,080
And took care of Wu Yi.

70
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,200
Qi Mo is so strange.

71
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,680
You slept here last night.

72
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,280
You can't even take care of yourself.

73
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,640
And wanted to take care of Wu Yi.

74
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,160
It's fast.

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,360
So handsome.

76
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,080
What are you thinking?
