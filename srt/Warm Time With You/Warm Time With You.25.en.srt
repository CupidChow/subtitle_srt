1
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,240
I know you're still awake.

2
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,800
I didn't have dinner tonight.

3
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,520
therefore

4
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,720
I've prepared something for you.

5
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,520
I'm fine.

6
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm worried about him.

7
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,720
He's so big.

8
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,600
It'll be fine.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,120
He's so grown up.

10
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,280
I've never left without saying goodbye.

11
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,760
And I won't miss Wu Yi's parents meeting.

12
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,360
You are so charming.

13
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:20,880
come

14
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,440
We

15
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,920
Have a good meal.

16
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,840
Then you can sleep peacefully.

17
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,920
If we don't hear from him tomorrow,

18
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,680
Can I go with you to call the police?

19
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,160
Thank you, Brother Yu.

20
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,680
When did my Jiao Jiao

21
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,840
You're so kind to me.

22
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,680
Nothing.

23
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,240
You are so charming.

24
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,320
You care so much about him.

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,160
If it were me,

26
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,480
What will happen to you?

27
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,200
Mom

28
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,160
Are you back?

29
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,760
Not yet.

30
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,520
Have you called him?

31
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,920
How about we go find him?

32
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,480
WuYi

33
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,080
I made you

34
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,480
Favorite egg sandwich.

35
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,560
go

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,840
Let's have breakfast.

37
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,240
Uncle Dong.

38
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,160
Can I make one for you?

39
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,360
He will be hungry when he comes back.

40
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,640
Alright.

41
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,040
Uncle Dong.

42
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,440
Can you find Second Junior Brother with me?

43
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:14,960
good

44
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,400
I'll stay with you.

45
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:19,840
You are so charming.

46
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,000
Stop packing.

47
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:21,880
go

48
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,040
Go and eat your breakfast.

49
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,480
to have spare time

50
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,800
I'm not hungry.

51
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,240
I'll go to work later.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,240
If you're not feeling well today,

53
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,400
Don't go.

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,720
It's okay.

55
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,360
Mom, I miss you.

56
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,200
Qi Mo,

57
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,120
I'll look for it.

58
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,280
Don't bother.

59
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,680
As you said,

60
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,360
He's already an adult.

61
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,520
He should know.

62
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,080
Take responsibility for your actions.

63
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,640
You are so charming.

64
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,360
Brother Xiao Yu.

65
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,600
Why are you here?

66
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,560
Didn't you pick up Wu Yi?

67
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,880
I went to pick up Wu Yi.

68
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,480
But Wu Yi was picked up early.

69
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,480
Who picked him up?

70
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,440
Don't worry.

71
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,560
I want to show you something.
