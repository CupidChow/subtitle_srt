1
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,000
The photos are printed.

2
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,920
So many tickets.

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,520
Well

4
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,560
You're late for the movie.

5
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,560
What's wrong with you?

6
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,080
If anything goes wrong, there must be a monster.

7
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,120
Give it to me.

8
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:53,840
Don't look.

9
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,320
So you like this one.

10
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,560
Alright.

11
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,480
This is the one for the parents meeting.

12
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,240
Or not?

13
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,840
I think this photo is not good.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,480
I threw it away.

15
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,200
I really like this one.

16
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,120
Really?

17
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,160
What?

18
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,280
The movie is about to begin.

19
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,600
Let's go inside.

20
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,120
The movie is good. It's pretty.

21
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,440
I'm Qi Mo.

22
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,320
You have good taste.

23
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,680
Yes, there is.

24
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,040
Can I have that photo back?

25
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,120
I have to think about it.

26
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,200
Since you like this photo so much,

27
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,040
that

28
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,160
We're rock, paper, scissors.

29
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,320
If you win, I'll take the photo.

30
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,760
What if you lose?

31
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,240
I lost.

32
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,520
You can handle the photos.

33
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,320
For instance

34
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,440
To the parents meeting.

35
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,440
after all

36
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
You decorated it?

37
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,080
Who? Who said it was me?

38
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,160
How do you know?

39
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,640
Did Yan Kai tell you that?

40
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,960
Of course not.

41
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,600
You...

42
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,000
It's written on your face.

43
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:29,960
How about this?

44
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,360
What if I lose?

45
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,160
I'll help you realize a wish.

46
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,760
What if you lose?

47
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,520
To make my wish come true.

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,440
There's no way I'm in charge of Wu Yi.

49
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,360
Martial and charming.

50
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,800
It's been so long.

51
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,480
Don't you trust me?

52
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,600
That's not true.

53
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,680
I'm used to it.

54
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,080
such

55
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,080
I promise you,

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,840
This is just our wish.

57
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,680
Be careful.

58
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,960
I have many wishes.

59
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,600
I'm sure to win.

60
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,080
Don't brag so early.

61
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,440
come

62
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,920
Rock and paper scissors.

63
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,440
The photo is mine.

64
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,920
Which wish should I fulfill first?

65
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,320
Of course.

66
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,440
The most important one.

67
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,800
The second round.

68
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,120
You won.

69
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,280
What do you want to achieve?

70
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,000
I'll help you.

71
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,600
This is my wish.

72
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,920
What?

73
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,120
Wu Yi is waiting at home.

74
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,320
Let's go back.

75
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,560
Well
