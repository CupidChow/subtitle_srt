1
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,080
Qi Mo

2
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,080
Why is he here?

3
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,480
Dongyu

4
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,520
Why are you here?

5
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,200
YanKai

6
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,680
When I started working,

7
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,760
The most basic requirements for you.

8
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,600
Have you forgotten it?

9
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,400
Let me stress again.

10
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,040
I only wear limited amount of clothes.

11
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,080
what

12
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,080
This is not limited.

13
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,760
You're wearing a shirt.

14
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,720
You have the right temperament.

15
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,560
I'm more handsome in it.

16
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,160
You won.

17
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,240
Dongyu

18
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,000
Why are you here?

19
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,360
I'm going home.

20
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,080
get home

21
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,160
Is this your home?

22
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,360
Pretty much.

23
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,920
Jiao Jiao is my home.

24
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,080
President Qi.

25
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,320
Why are you here?

26
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,720
I forgot to tell you.

27
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,800
The owner of this house

28
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,760
It's me.

29
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,720
But the landlord.

30
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,240
Why hasn't Jiao mentioned it?

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,240
Jiao Jiao hasn't contacted you for a long time.

32
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,760
after all

33
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,000
I have been living here for a long time.

34
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,160
Xiaorou made it for Wu Yi.

35
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,920
And Jiao Jiao,

36
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,520
Their favorite food.

37
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,680
Wu Yi won't eat it.

38
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,440
Dongyu

39
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,200
Don't you know that

40
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,040
How serious the nitrites are?

41
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,080
After three days, the nitrites

42
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,920
Will rapidly decrease when you reach the peak.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,640
President Qi.

44
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,360
These common sense

45
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,240
Don't you know that?

46
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,000
reduce

47
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,120
It doesn't mean that.

48
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,920
Hypertension

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,480
Hair loss, kidney failure, cancer.

50
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,480
Will happen.

51
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,840
No one is eating pickles.

52
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,920
President Qi.

53
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,520
You're exaggerating.

54
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,920
To prevent trouble.

55
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,960
You're careless.

56
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,160
Pickles are our working people.

57
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,080
The crystal of wisdom.

58
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,080
Is the inheritance.

59
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,720
Whatever.

60
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,200
anyway

61
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,480
They won't eat it.

62
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,880
It's like

63
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,880
The project of Nuanyang in the morning.

64
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,440
It's useless for you to struggle.

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,480
final

66
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,520
In vain.

67
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,960
We'll see.

68
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,000
Ah

69
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,960
Little flower cat.

70
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,880
Mom

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,880
I think you are the most gentle.

72
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,840
Right?

73
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,040
I also think I'm super gentle.

74
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,120
So I'm going to

75
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,760
To find a powerful man.

76
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,040
Protect your mother.

77
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,120
Oh dear

78
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,440
Xiao Bao is so small.

79
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,680
It's so transparent.

80
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,760
Do you have a suitable candidate?

81
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,000
Yes, Second Junior.

82
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,720
he

83
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,160
Where is he suitable?

84
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,880
Protect the martial arts with me.

85
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,680
The landlord is so rude.

86
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,200
You dare not get angry with Second Junior Brother.

87
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,280
He...

88
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,960
Is the ability of currency.

89
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,520
Second Young Master,

90
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,160
And superpower.

91
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,040
That's more suitable.

92
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,760
Children

93
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,320
Think it through.

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,440
Second Youngest Brother,

95
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,760
But it's not gentle at all.

96
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,920
Second Brother took Mother back to the room yesterday.

97
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,400
And roasted them with fire.

98
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,120
And baked bear clothes.

99
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,480
Really?

100
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,640
Dongyu

101
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,000
Our household affairs and dirty work

102
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,120
There's an aunt to do it.

103
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,040
Please go back.

104
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,680
It's okay. It doesn't matter.

105
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,880
Do your own thing.

106
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,080
hey

107
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,680
This chair is mine.

108
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,680
You can't sit there.

109
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,160
If you say that,

110
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,600
I still insist on

111
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,560
Brother Yu, why are you here?
