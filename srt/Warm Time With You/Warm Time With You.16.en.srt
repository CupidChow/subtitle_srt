00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,240
Hello, Xiaorou.

2
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,720
Why does your brother want to live in my house suddenly?

3
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,040
Oh dear

4
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,600
My home is inconvenient.

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,880
What's wrong with your home?

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,840
I'm in a relationship.

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,000
Why did you take off your order so quickly?

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,680
I don't care.

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,520
Just take care of my brother for a few days.

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,840
Please take care of my brother.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,920
Hang up, right?

12
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,240
You can do it with my help.

13
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,360
Dongyu

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,000
Do you think this is a hotel or a restaurant?

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,720
Come and go as you wish.

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,560
I just go home often.

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,000
That's enough.

18
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,280
Yes, I'm fine.

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,800
You can go back now.

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,280
Who stay here.

21
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,920
It's probably not me.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,400
I'm afraid you haven't figured it out yet.

23
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,920
I'm the landlord here.

24
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,440
What are you talking about?

25
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,560
Ah

26
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,560
Nothing?

27
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,280
Dongfang Yu said he was tired.

28
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,320
I want to go back and rest.

29
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,440
I'm not leaving. He's not going.

30
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,320
I disagree.

31
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,640
Why don't you agree?

32
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,040
I'm the landlord. I have the final say.

33
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,720
I'm a tenant here.

34
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,840
I have the final say.

35
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,560
Old rules

36
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,560
Rock and paper scissors.

37
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,040
It's up to the winner.

38
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,160
Rock and paper scissors.

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,320
I won.

40
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,920
Dongfang Yu, you can leave now.

41
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,240
Wu Yi is still in the room.

42
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,160
When you wash him,

43
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,160
Hurry up.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,800
I know.

45
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,360
I've been

46
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,200
A business travel

47
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,280
I just came back.

48
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,680
therefore

49
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,400
I have more time to take care of you and Wu Yi.

50
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,920
Oh

51
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,800
Are you here to see Wu Yi?

52
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,480
I'm here to see you.

53
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,160
Brother Yu, eat fruit.

54
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,840
Xiao Yu, it's getting late.

55
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,280
Wu Yi is still in the shower.

56
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,280
I'll check on him first.

57
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,160
good

58
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,520
Xiao Yu came to see me.

59
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,480
Are you here to see Wu Yi?

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,320
I'm here to see you.

61
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,160
You're a child yourself.

62
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,880
How can I take a child?

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,240
What am I thinking?

64
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,800
Why would I...

65
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,720
Compare the two of them.
