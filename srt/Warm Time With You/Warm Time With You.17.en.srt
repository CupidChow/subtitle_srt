1
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,160
It's the same nightgown.

2
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,160
It's really annoying.

3
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,160
Dongyu

4
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,440
I'm warning you.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,120
Qi Mo has been

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,480
Not with another person.

7
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,640
Slept in the same room.

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,080
Don't make any noise to me.

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,120
otherwise

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,680
Don't blame me for driving you out.

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,800
Alright.

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,440
I'll leave then.

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,080
I don't know who just now.

14
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,360
He insisted on letting me sleep in the same room with him.

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,480
Okay, I'll go sleep with Wu Yi.

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,320
to wait a moment

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,600
I barely

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,240
Accept your stay here.

19
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,480
Qi Mo, what are you doing?

20
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,680
If Qi Mo is really

21
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,880
The custody of Wu Yi.

22
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,920
With his ability, he could have

23
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,800
Take Wu Yi away.

24
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,120
But why would he

25
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,320
To live here.

26
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,720
Dongyu

27
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,640
You didn't sleep in the middle of the night.

28
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,440
What's wrong with you?

29
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,680
Qi Mo

30
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,840
Why are you living here all the time?

31
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,320
Jiao Jiao,

32
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,920
It seems that even if you ignore him,

33
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,560
I won't sleep tonight.

34
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:15,920
Alright.

35
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,280
Dongyu

36
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,400
Today, I will

37
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,560
To have an honest talk.

38
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,320
Are you staying at Jiao Jiao's house?

39
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,640
For the custody of Wu Yi?

40
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,920
What does it have to do with you?

41
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,200
Why are you always here?

42
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,760
Jiao Jiao and I were childhood friends.

43
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,240
You can also say that

44
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,960
And watch her grow up.

45
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,080
Uncle Wu can't take care of them.

46
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,760
When the two sisters

47
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,200
And sent Jiao Jiao to me.

48
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,000
Take care of her at home.

49
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,320
The first doll I ever bought for her.

50
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,480
The first time I sent her to school,

51
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,480
Include

52
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,880
Her parents died.

53
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,600
I accompanied her through the hardest time.

54
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,800
So what?

55
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,600
We're

56
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,760
Is a recognized couple in this alley.

57
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,640
Our parents

58
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,440
All want us

59
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,040
When you grow up, you will become in-laws.

60
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,840
Xiaorou came early.

61
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,520
Treat Jiao Jiao as a sister-in-law.

62
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,480
So,

63
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,440
There's no fate.

64
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,880
If you want me to,

65
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,880
Have been together for a long time.

66
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,000
It's not about fate.

67
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,400
I can't accept it.

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,960
And raised Wu Yi in a delicate manner.

69
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,080
But I have figured it out now.

70
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,760
Since I like Jiao Jiao,

71
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,920
If you want to be with her,

72
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,880
You have to accept Wu Yi.

73
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,240
As for the identity,

74
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,080
And become a family.

75
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,920
It's not important anymore.

76
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:29,760
to stop

77
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,760
I don't want to be your family.

78
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,400
Is that your decision?

79
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:36,720
a row

80
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,400
I'll analyze it with you.

81
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,920
Your so-called childhood friend

82
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,880
And grow up together.

83
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,760
We haven't been together for more than 20 years.

84
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,480
What is this?

85
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,560
It's meant to be.

86
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,080
It shows that Wu Jiao Jiao

87
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,880
Without you,

88
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,120
Also

89
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,960
You said you accepted Wu Yi.

90
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,640
Did Wu Yi accept you?

91
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,040
I don't believe in fate.

92
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,760
Whether you believe it or not doesn't matter.

93
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,960
I'm Wu Yi's second junior brother.

94
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,400
What is this? This is fate.

95
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,880
Blood is thicker than water.

96
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,760
I didn't expect you to be single.

97
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,600
You're right.

98
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,280
How about this?

99
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,960
I proposed to Jiao Jiao.

100
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,720
Give you custody of Wu Yi.

101
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,600
Shooting two birds with one stone

102
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,200
No way

103
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,200
Why not?

104
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,600
Sleep

105
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,680
That's right.

106
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,680
Why not?
