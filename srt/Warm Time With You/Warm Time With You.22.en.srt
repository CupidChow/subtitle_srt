1
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:37,840
Boss

2
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,440
Is it stable this time?

3
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,120
You can laugh if you want to.

4
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,600
I can see your handsome face

5
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,920
When I saw you hiding,

6
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,080
A smile about to spill out.

7
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,080
YanKai

8
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,920
You haven't been to the grass-roots level for a long time recently.

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,560
I've experienced it.

10
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,200
You have fooled me again and again.

11
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,080
In my experience,

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,440
I'm sure Wu Jiao likes you.

13
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,480
YanKai

14
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,680
You can see people.

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,200
But your method is not reliable at all.

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,760
The Martial's delicate toes

17
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,040
To Wu Yi forever.

18
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,080
Did you see Wu Yi when she was away?

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,400
Oh, no.

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,840
I will never trust you again.

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,560
Also

22
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,360
Boss

23
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,680
We don't need to confirm it.

24
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sure Wu Jiao likes you.

25
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,520
So we're going to

26
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,920
And attack directly.

27
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,120
attack

28
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,360
How to attack?

29
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,360
Boss, don't forget your identity.

30
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,280
We're taking a family photo tomorrow.

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,160
That's right.

32
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,360
The teacher said

33
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,880
You must be with your parents.

34
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,120
Why did the teacher ask for this?

35
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,200
Don't you want to make things difficult for me?

36
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,280
You are so charming.

37
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,120
I don't think the teacher's request is too much.

38
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,680
But it's really hard for you.

39
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,280
It's not difficult.

40
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,560
Second Junior Brother is very suitable.

41
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,720
How does he fit in?

42
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,240
One, two, three.

43
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,680
A family of three

44
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,000
That's right.

45
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,040
So can Xiao Yu.

46
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,880
No.

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,840
Wu Yi's blood and mine are thicker than water.

48
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,400
You are also half a relative.

49
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,480
What is Dongfang Yu?

50
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,240
Take a photo of the whole family.

51
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,480
Of course, the family should take photos together.

52
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,040
Oh

53
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,520
family

54
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,360
Eldest Brother.

55
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,640
The weather is not beautiful today.

56
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,240
Can't we shoot today?

57
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,400
If you can't shoot it today,

58
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,040
We still have tomorrow.

59
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,920
It might not rain tomorrow.

60
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,000
But I made a deal with Dali.

61
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,840
At night, he looked at my family photo.

62
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,120
WuYi

63
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,560
What kind of family photo do you want to take?

64
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,560
I'll handle it for you.

65
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,400
Really?

66
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:20,920
Really

67
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,280
Yeah, that's great.

68
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,200
Look.

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,360
Fly, fly.
