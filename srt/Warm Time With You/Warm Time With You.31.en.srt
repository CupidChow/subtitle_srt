1
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,440
Besides Wu Yi,

2
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,480
I'm used to having you.

3
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,880
In this small courtyard,

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,720
Witnessed our every bit of it.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,800
We grew up together during this time.

6
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,360
You erased my arrogance.

7
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,560
evil tendencies

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,960
I also feel your innocence.

9
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,040
And strong.

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:57,840
You are so charming.

11
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,800
I love you

12
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,560
As long as I have you,

13
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,680
I feel at ease.

14
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,360
Thank you for growing up with Wu Yi.

15
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,200
In the days to come,

16
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,600
Let me protect you.

17
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,560
I want to have a home with you.

18
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,160
Marry me.

19
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,400
Father and mother.

20
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,360
Do you need my help?

21
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,400
WuYi

22
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,160
Where's Wu Yi?

23
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,400
He's watching cartoons.

24
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,760
Second Junior Brother.

25
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,240
Come and watch it with me.

26
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,160
Why are you running away?

27
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,440
I'll be right there.

28
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,920
Hello, Yan Kai.

29
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,320
Hello, Xiaorou.

30
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:00,960
Come right away.

31
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,120
Xiao Bao, come with me today.

32
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:05,960
No way

33
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,280
I was arranged by President Qi.

34
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,640
I've bought the tickets for the carnival.

35
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,280
But Bao likes me more.

36
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,520
Right, Xiao Bao?

37
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,360
I'll take you to eat cream cake.

38
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,080
Alright?

39
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,840
Who does Xiao Bao like?

40
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,720
Then let's go together.

41
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,120
And bought cream cakes.

42
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,720
To the carnival.

43
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,320
Let's go.

44
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,360
good

45
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:26,840
Let's go.
