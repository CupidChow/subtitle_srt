1
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,320
Poor Wu Yi.

2
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,400
Martial Jiao Jiao, you vicious woman.

3
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,040
I'm back

4
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,280
You're back.

5
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,600
I'm going to cook now.

6
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,560
You still know to come back?

7
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,440
Do you think

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,600
This world is fascinating.

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,640
What are you talking about?

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,560
Martial and charming.

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,800
I think you have completely forgotten

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,880
The existence of a child

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,960
Is your skin itchy again?

14
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,800
When you and Dongfang Yu were in love,

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,280
Do you know what Wu Yi is doing?

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,240
I

17
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,640
He has done so much for this family.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,960
Look for yourself.

19
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,960
Why did you send me a photo of Wu Yi?

20
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,280
You see that?

21
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,240
You must be ashamed.

22
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,720
You still think you raised Wu Yi?

23
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,960
The most suitable candidate?

24
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,840
Why are you so greedy?

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,040
From now on,

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,480
I won't let you go.

27
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,520
Martial and charming.

28
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,760
I officially inform you that

29
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,320
I'm taking Wu Yi home tomorrow.

30
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,800
From now on, everything about Wu Yi,

31
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,880
I'll be in charge.

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,680
If you want money, come to me.

33
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,960
What are you doing?

34
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,840
Come on.

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,560
You hit me?

36
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,520
You can't kill me.

37
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,000
I'll take Wu Yi home tomorrow.

38
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,440
I'll tell you again.

39
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,400
No one will take Wu Yi.

40
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,960
Hello, Miss Li.

41
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,920
Miss Wu Yi.

42
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,320
Are you not very supportive?

43
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,600
Wu Yi's extracurricular activities

44
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,960
No.

45
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,880
I support him very much.

46
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,240
Alright.

47
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,800
Come and see me when you pick up Wu Yi.

48
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,680
Alright.

49
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,960
I'm going now.

50
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,240
Mr. Li, I'll go too.

51
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,600
Why am I not Wu Yi's parent?

52
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,680
Alright.

53
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,160
Don't take it.

54
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,200
Everyone, be careful.

55
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,320
It's Wu Yi's father and mother.

56
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,360
We came together.

57
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,520
Seems to be supportive.

58
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,720
Our activities

59
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,640
Stop it, Miss Li.

60
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,760
This lady and I

61
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,920
Has nothing to do with it.

62
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,920
Miss Li.

63
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,280
What's wrong with Wu Yi?

64
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,640
Are you in trouble? Tell me.

65
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,440
Miss Li.

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,600
I'm the guardian of Wu Yi's future.

67
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,640
So what do you want to tell me?

68
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,720
Here's the thing, Mother Wu Yi.

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,160
Wu Yi, this afternoon,

70
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,240
I didn't hand in my homework.

71
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,040
Da Li went home crying.

72
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,640
Wu Yi didn't hand in her homework this afternoon.

73
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,920
Yes, Mother Wu Yi.

74
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,600
We know that parents

75
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,840
I love you dearly.

76
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,080
So we use

77
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,320
Rotating field practice

78
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,480
Yes, I know.

79
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,920
I've talked to Dali's mother.

80
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,880
Waste utilization

81
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,280
The activity of turning waste into treasure.

82
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,120
We've done a lot of sessions.

83
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,160
Wu Yi, what are you doing?

84
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,320
This time, Wu Yi and

85
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,640
Darley is a group.

86
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,200
But Wu Yi didn't come this afternoon.

87
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,840
Darley cried for a long time.

88
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,440
Just got coaxed home by his mother.

89
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,960
I saw

90
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,320
Wu Yi picked up the bottle.

91
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,800
I also want to know

92
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,640
Why didn't he bring the bottle to school?

93
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,000
Wu Yi, don't pick up garbage anymore.

94
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,800
Do you know

95
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,280
Second Junior Brother,

96
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,280
There's no buts.

97
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,280
That's me.

98
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,160
I know.

99
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,440
You have done so much for this family.

100
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,640
I'll take care of you from now on.

101
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,760
Why are you so greedy?

102
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,720
From now on,

103
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,000
I won't let you go.

104
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,880
Come on.

105
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,720
You can't kill me.

106
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,240
I'll take Wu Yi home tomorrow.

107
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,880
Miss Li.

108
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:56,800
WuYi

109
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,400
You really picked up the bottle.

110
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,320
only

111
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,920
Was taken away by a beggar.

112
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,600
I threw out some garbage.

113
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,880
But you asked Wu Yi to go to school alone.

114
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,360
It's not right.

115
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,800
The road condition is so complicated now.

116
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,520
He's so young.

117
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,080
What if there's any danger?

118
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,080
Look for yourself.

119
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,040
We didn't leave until we saw you.

120
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,760
Who knew you would throw the bottle away?

121
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,360
And then made wild guesses about others.

122
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,160
Hum

123
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,960
It's too hasty.
