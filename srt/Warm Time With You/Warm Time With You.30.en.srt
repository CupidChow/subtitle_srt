1
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,040
The interview is ready.

2
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,560
All questions, answers and submissions

3
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,360
I have confirmed everything.

4
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,240
Have the shareholders been accounted for?

5
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:38,960
Yes

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,040
Has made all the shareholders know

7
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,880
You will soon have custody of Wu Yi.

8
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,800
And Qi Jun.

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,160
20 percent.

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,920
Do we need to inform Qi Mo?

11
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,000
If he didn't do his best,

12
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,880
Why bother? I'm Fan Zhou Zhang.

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,320
Acting.

14
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,280
dad

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Why does it say that

16
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,000
You've got custody of Wu Yi.

17
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,280
We found Xiao Yi.

18
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,000
I just want to tell everyone

19
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,400
Qi Jun has a wife?

20
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,560
I also have grandchildren.

21
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,800
Xiao Yi is one of Qi's people.

22
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,040
dad

23
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,760
Wu Yi is still young.

24
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,800
It's not appropriate to go back to the Qi family now.

25
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,400
I want to wait for him to get older.

26
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,120
And get him back.

27
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,240
Nonsense

28
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,400
How could the Qi family

29
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,240
Announce it immediately. The formalities will be done soon.

30
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,680
Change your name.

31
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,000
Thank you for your concern for me.

32
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,960
I'm fine now.

33
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,640
I have to thank my eldest son Qi Jun.

34
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,480
He blessed me in heaven.

35
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,240
And led me to my grandson.

36
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,280
The heir to the 20% stake,

37
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,520
This is

38
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,200
The grandson I just found?

39
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,320
In my son's will,

40
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,560
He gave 20% of the shares

41
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,520
To my little grandson.

42
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,600
You can't go in.

43
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,120
I can only run it for him.

44
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,800
But the custody of Wu Yi

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,560
I never gave it to you.

46
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,400
But Wu Jiao Jiao.

47
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,400
What's the relationship?

48
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,160
Whose equity is it?

49
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,440
Wu Yi is indeed your grandson.

50
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,360
but

51
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,080
Why didn't my brother

52
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,920
I'll leave the custody to you.

53
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,040
Because he realized you only care about equity.

54
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,600
I don't care about Wu Yi at all.

55
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,440
As Wu Yi's guardian,

56
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,560
I've decided to transfer the 20% share

57
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,400
Subrogation right

58
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,920
To Second Uncle of Wu Yi.

59
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,640
Qi Mo of Qi clan.

60
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,760
I'm back

61
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,480
you

62
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,080
You are so charming.

63
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,480
Thank you.

64
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,640
For what?

65
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,640
Thank you for believing in me.

66
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,520
Thank you, too.

67
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,520
Bring Wu Yi back.
