1
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,080
I'm late for kindergarten.

2
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,280
Who sent me to the kindergarten?

3
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,800
What's your problem?

4
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,480
Martial and charming.

5
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,040
You said you didn't mean to me.

6
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,240
Two meters away.

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,560
We who practice martial arts

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,200
Bumps and bumps are inevitable.

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,720
If you can't take it,

10
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,560
Don't stay in the martial arts school.

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,720
As his disciple.

12
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,000
Once again,

13
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,440
I'm here to supervise you.

14
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,640
And take care of Wu Yi.

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,560
So that Wu Yi

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,040
And come back to our Qi family.

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,440
Why would I go back to the Qi family?

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,840
Are you two getting married?

19
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,280
It's not impossible.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,640
Don't talk nonsense.

21
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,760
Who sent me to the kindergarten?

22
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:11,800
If so,

23
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,560
We will use the world

24
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,240
The most fair and just.

25
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:15,920
To make a decision.

26
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,480
Stone, scissors and paper.

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:18,720
I won.

28
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,480
Hey, no.

29
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:20,960
I haven't agreed to it.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,800
Hey, Wu Jiao Jiao.

31
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,440
Are you fooling around?

32
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:25,960
a row

33
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,720
Then let Wu Yi decide for herself.

34
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,680
WuYi

35
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,560
Who do you want to send you to school?

36
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,200
Xiao Bao.

37
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,880
Second Junior Brother.

38
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,080
Martial and charming.

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,760
Second Junior Brother.

40
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,960
This woman

41
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,640
excessive

42
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,360
I'm so tired.

43
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,080
There's only one more thing left.

44
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,200
comfortable

45
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,120
Are you happy with me these days?

46
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,120
Happy

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,960
this

48
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,440
Are you still playing?

49
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,800
Don't play anymore.

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,160
Let's come back later.

51
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:14,520
go

52
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,360
Let's eat something delicious.

53
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:15,720
Well

54
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,480
This Qi Mo

55
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,480
I won't be able to talk to Wu Yi

56
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,760
To develop a relationship.

57
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,760
I hand out leaflets outside every day.

58
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,480
The haunting Qi Mo.

59
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,560
And pestered Wu Yi every day.

60
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,440
No way

61
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,680
The shape of strawberries

62
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,680
It's a bit unique.

63
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,040
President Qi,

64
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,800
Eat strawberries.

65
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,480
Only eat one third of the sharp strawberries.

66
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,160
This is a strawberry butt.

67
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,720
Oh, my god.

68
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,080
Such a big butt.

69
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,160
It's too hypocritical.

70
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,840
Hello, Qi Mo.

71
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,520
President Qi has been working hard recently.

72
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,880
Don't speak so loudly.

73
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,080
He's working hard.

74
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,080
No work, no kids.

75
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,960
Speaking of hard work,

76
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:15,960
To be a teacher.

77
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,200
I will treat you personally.

78
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,040
get up

79
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,480
Your body

80
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,280
It's okay.

81
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,400
You can keep practicing.

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,120
This weather

83
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,240
It's sunny.

84
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,840
I think it's very suitable for training.

85
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,320
I'll get changed.

86
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,640
Five minutes later,

87
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,360
Assemble for training

88
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,040
hey

89
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,600
You're so charming.

90
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,160
Yan Kai, save me.

91
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,720
This training is killing me.

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,880
This is a private matter between your martial arts.

93
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,360
I really can't control it.

94
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,360
YanKai

95
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,960
Then prepare your resignation.

96
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,000
To the Personnel Department.

97
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,080
Boss

98
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,880
As your best assistant,

99
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,400
I will protect you.

100
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,600
Hurry up.
