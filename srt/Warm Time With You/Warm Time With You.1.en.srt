1
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,560
Wu Jiao Jiao, stop right there.

2
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,160
Qi Mo

3
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,040
His name is Wu Yi.

4
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,680
He's your brother's orphan.

5
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,000
I spent a few months

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,160
To figure it out.

7
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,640
This child follows a single woman.

8
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,720
You can't eat or wear well.

9
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,920
In my heart,

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,160
We can't get there.

11
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,080
dad

12
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,160
Don't worry.

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,800
Since you're Big Brother's child,

14
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,960
I will definitely take back custody.

15
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,560
To take the child back to the Qi family.

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,560
Someone checked out.

17
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,120
I'm really blessed.

18
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,040
Who are you?

19
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,360
I'm the one

20
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,800
Cleaning

21
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,280
Cleaning

22
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,000
Well

23
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,600
Bearer

24
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,960
Who are you?

25
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,480
So you're here.

26
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,080
YanKai

27
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,480
To return my room.

28
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,880
Get me another car.

29
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm going to see my nephew.

30
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,440
Incidentally

31
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,040
The woman

32
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,200
Martial and charming.

33
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,200
Don't think about it this time.

34
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,800
eldest brother

35
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,920
I didn't do anything just now.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,720
I

37
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,080
I can't pay for your medical expenses.

38
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,760
Wu Jiao Jiao, wait here.

39
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,160
We will definitely find you.

40
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,120
You can't escape.

41
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,880
I won't escape.

42
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,760
I'm not running.

43
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,480
I'm definitely not running away.

44
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,760
You're such a child.

45
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,560
Why are you so stubborn?

46
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,280
You haven't paid the rent for half a year.

47
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,360
Move out now.

48
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,920
Mom said we rented this place.

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,480
This is my home.

50
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,160
You can't take it away.

51
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
Get out of the way.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,120
If you don't move,

53
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,960
I'm not responsible for hurting you later.

54
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,760
I dare to hurt him.

55
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,720
Who are you?

56
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm his second.

57
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,800
Second Junior Brother.

58
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,360
What second junior brother?

59
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,080
You are my new disciple.

60
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,960
To protect the martial arts with me.

61
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,200
right or wrong?

62
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,640
Yes

63
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,880
Eldest Brother.

64
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,240
I'm here.

65
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,200
Don't be afraid.

66
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,840
No one will hurt you.

67
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,720
YanKai

68
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,760
Buy this.

69
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,960
And come to me after you complete the formalities.

70
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,960
Okay, boss.

71
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,200
It's because of this exhibitionist.

72
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,760
I have to pay for the medical expenses.

73
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,400
How can I pay for the medical expenses?

74
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,080
WuYi

75
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:31,960
Where's your mother?

76
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,800
Mom, she's working to make money.

77
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,960
WuYi

78
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,480
Mom

79
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,400
you

80
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,640
you
