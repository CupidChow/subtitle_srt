1
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,800
You are so charming.

2
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,360
Brother Xiao Yu.

3
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,680
Why are you here?

4
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,280
Didn't you pick up Wu Yi?

5
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,800
I went to pick up Wu Yi.

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,400
But Wu Yi was picked up early.

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,280
Who picked him up?

8
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,440
Don't worry.

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,200
I want to show you something.

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,640
Wu Yi was picked up by the Qi family.

11
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,880
Besides, I've already asked about it.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,360
Old Qi has passed the dangerous period.

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,320
And went back to the Qi family.

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:50,960
I'll find him.

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:51,800
You are so charming.

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,640
Don't worry.

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,960
Grandpa will be fine.

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:03,840
WuYi

19
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,120
When Grandpa wakes up,

20
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,440
Let's say hello to Grandpa.

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,200
I'll send you back first, okay?

22
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,240
Mom

23
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,000
He's anxious now.

24
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,720
I want to be with Grandpa.

25
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,520
But I don't want my mother to worry.

26
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,080
Obedient

27
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:22,640
dad

28
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,640
dad

29
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:31,800
The doctor said

30
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,280
You're out of danger.

31
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,880
Rest at home for a while.

32
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,880
You can recover completely.

33
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,920
alas

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,000
She's old.

35
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,560
We don't have much time.

36
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,760
Wu Yi.

37
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,520
Do you want to

38
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,400
To live with my grandfather.

39
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,160
Think about it.

40
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,560
From now on,

41
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,520
And moved here.

42
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,920
To live with my grandfather.

43
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,400
grandpa

44
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,720
Will give you all the fun toys.

45
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,760
And delicious food.

46
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,760
Alright?

47
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,560
dad

48
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,760
Grandpa, no.

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,240
I have to protect my mother.

50
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,840
But you can...

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,720
And moved to the martial arts school with us.

52
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,000
To the martial arts.

53
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,680
What if Grandpa

54
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,920
I just want to

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,480
dad

56
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,800
Wu Yi has been out for a long time.

57
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,200
I'll send him back.

58
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,320
For a long time.

59
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,240
He and that woman

60
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,680
How many years have you lived here?

61
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,800
I want to see my grandson for a while.

62
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,080
You said that

63
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,240
For a long time.

64
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,440
Qi Mo

65
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,880
What do you mean?

66
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,720
Grandpa, I'll stay with you.

67
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,440
How about later?

68
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,520
dad

69
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,880
I mean,

70
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,440
You just recovered.

71
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,120
You need more rest.

72
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,360
Miss Wu

73
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,320
Calm down.

74
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,440
President Qi will be out soon.

75
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,720
Mr. Qi,

76
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,280
Is not in a good condition.

77
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,840
When I need my family.

78
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,040
He needs his family.

79
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,200
Then take away my family, right?

80
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,320
Just for the moment.

81
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,720
Wu Yi can't go back.

82
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,320
Why can't I go back?

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,480
You are so charming.

84
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,600
My father is still weak.

85
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,240
I just need Wu Yi to stay with him for two more days.

86
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,400
Two days later, I will

87
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,440
Wu Yi, give it back.

88
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,560
Okay?

89
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,120
Why can't I take my son?

90
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:39,920
Qi Mo

91
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
You came to our house.

92
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,840
To separate us, right?

93
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,440
You are so charming.

94
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,320
sorry
