1
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,680
I've always followed Wu Yi.

2
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,000
When I saw you pick him up,

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,840
That's why I left.

4
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:33,680
Hum

5
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,240
Boss, something is on your mind.

6
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,600
Since you're asking me,

7
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,600
I'll discuss it with you.

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,560
If a person misunderstands,

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,400
The other one has character problems.

10
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,880
What should I do?

11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
Wu Jiao Jiao is

12
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,960
Although he's a little grumpy,

13
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,440
And a little stronger.

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,320
But it's not a bad guy.

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,680
That being said, I'm the one

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,120
Who said it was Wu Jiao Jiao?

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,840
in short

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,280
There's a rift between them.

19
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:13,920
What should I do?

20
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,040
Of course it's an apology.

21
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,280
apologize

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,040
I won't.

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,240
Other ways.

24
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,280
Boss

25
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,160
Actually, it's easy to apologize.

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,200
Don't worry.

27
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,840
With you and me,

28
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:26,960
to grasp

29
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,680
Qi Mo

30
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,760
Why are you wearing my bear hood?

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,320
These flowers are for me.

32
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,840
Why are you giving me flowers?

33
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,960
Oh

34
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,440
You want to apologize to me?

35
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,200
You're so thoughtful.

36
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,320
I accepted it.

37
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,120
Just accept it.

38
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,040
You...

39
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:12,760
It's not you.

40
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,000
To apologize.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,640
You need to come in person.

42
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,440
It's over, Barbie Q.

43
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,920
I said it's useless to apologize.

44
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,640
You have to think of such a stupid way.

45
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,840
Boss

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,840
Actually, it's useful for you to apologize.

47
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,600
Second Brother, I'm back planting flowers.

48
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,200
Eldest Brother, your face is so dirty.

49
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,680
Aren't you afraid that I will scold you?

50
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,680
No, Second Junior, don't worry.

51
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,720
Eldest Brother, let me ask you.

52
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,040
A friend made me angry.

53
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,320
How are you going to coax me?

54
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,160
I'd better coax her.

55
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,200
I'll teach you.

56
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,200
Mom, I'm back.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,280
Where have you been?

58
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,920
Why are you so dirty?

59
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,840
I went to plant flowers.

60
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,800
Grow flowers

61
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,720
The teacher said

62
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,240
The flowers will appear in three months.

63
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,320
I want to give it to you.

64
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,080
Really?

65
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,280
Well

66
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,440
Alright.

67
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,680
I'll get changed later.

68
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,520
I made it for you today.

69
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,520
Your favorite Little Bear Rice Balls.

70
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,120
Mom is the best.

71
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,520
Make one for Second Brother.

72
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,880
I'm not making it for him.

73
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,760
You're really my eldest brother.

74
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,000
Who is the cat?

75
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,560
Second Junior Brother.

76
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,920
Mom loves surprises.

77
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,000
You have to make her happy.

78
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,160
And then when she wasn't looking,

79
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,560
Give me a kiss.

80
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,400
I won't be angry anymore.

81
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,960
Why aren't you sleeping here at night?

82
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,600
What are you doing?

83
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,040
You are so charming.

84
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,360
I
