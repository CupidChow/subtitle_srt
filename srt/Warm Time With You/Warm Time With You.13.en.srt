1
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,760
It's so late.

2
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,840
Why hasn't Wu Jiao Jiao come back yet?

3
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,000
Are you in danger?

4
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,080
I'm going out.

5
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,280
You are so charming.

6
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:49,640
Martial and charming.

7
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,440
Look at the time.

8
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,080
Qi Mo

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,320
Who told you to mess up our lives?

10
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,680
Qi Mo, you arsonist

11
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,800
From my heart.

12
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,080
Martial and charming.

13
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,000
From now on,

14
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,400
You are responsible for me.

15
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,920
To be responsible for you.

16
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,720
What the hell?

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,600
Why would I have such a dream?

18
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,520
What do you mean?

19
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,800
Who will be responsible for this?

20
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,600
Of course, you're in charge.

21
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,240
There are so many children in the class.

22
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,880
You saw Wu Yi pushing my son.

23
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,520
It was a small thing.

24
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,560
But Wu Yi

25
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,520
She said she was wronged.

26
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,600
And I...

27
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,920
Trust Wu Yi.

28
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,880
Every word I said,

29
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
What do you want?

30
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,600
Your son started the fight.

31
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,480
My son has broken his hand.

32
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,520
What martial arts school?

33
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,240
This lady

34
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,080
Please pay attention to your behavior.

35
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,880
It's okay. I'll handle it.

36
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,440
Fatty, don't be angry.

37
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,800
Between the kids.

38
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,280
Bumps and bumps are inevitable.

39
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,280
Don't talk about this. Pay the money.

40
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,200
Alright.

41
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,560
Yes

42
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,880
And broke my son's hand.

43
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,000
exactly!

44
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,640
And threatened to show me.

45
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,600
And made my Fatty cry.

46
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,720
You have to make decisions for your nephew.

47
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,440
How absurd

48
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,920
She's obviously blackmailing me.

49
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,240
What are you going to do?

50
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,440
I don't know either

51
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,080
So much money?

52
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,200
Are you really going to pay for it?

53
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,760
Did Wu Yi really hurt his son?

54
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,720
The kid did it lightly.

55
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,240
Wu Yi said it wasn't him.

56
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,000
It must not be him.

57
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,920
I know Xiao Bao's character the best.

58
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,120
Are you going to pay for it?

59
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,360
This thing between children

60
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,920
In the final analysis

61
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,160
Or is it between adults?

62
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,440
Second Junior Brother.

63
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,880
Mom, because of me,

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,440
It will cost a lot of money.

65
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:30,960
Eldest Brother.

66
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,920
Are you unhappy about this?

67
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,800
Well

68
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,560
Let me ask you something.

69
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,600
What's going on between you and Fatty?

70
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,240
Fatty said I didn't have a father.

71
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,560
I have two younger brothers.

72
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,480
He said I lied to him.

73
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,760
And then you pushed me.

74
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,840
I dodged.

75
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,800
He fell down.

76
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,840
Eldest Brother, how brave you are!

77
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,440
Fatty pushed you and you didn't cry.

78
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,000
Well, I'm not crying now.

79
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,280
I'm a disciple of the martial arts school.

80
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,600
I'm the bravest.

81
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,040
Okay, you're the bravest.

82
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,400
That

83
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,360
And give it to Second Junior Brother.

84
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,920
Eldest Brother, don't be unhappy.

85
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,680
I won't let the master spend the money, okay?

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,600
Well
