1
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,800
I will not give you the custody of Wu Yi.

2
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,720
joke

3
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,720
Wu Yi is a member of the Qi family.

4
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,040
Will return to our Qi family sooner or later.

5
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,080
You're an outsider.

6
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,400
Why should I be moved?

7
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,840
Ask Wu Yi.

8
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,720
Who does he prefer to be with?

9
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,000
Isn't he obvious enough?

10
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:00,880
he

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,600
Happiness

12
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,280
Huan

13
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:02,960
I

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,000
They are related by blood.

15
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,520
At first sight,

16
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,120
Okay, I won't be the same as you.

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,680
That's just a child's three-minute fever.

18
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,960
You're an adult.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,080
You still believe in this?

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,240
Whether I believe it or not doesn't matter.

21
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,840
Give me back the custody of Wu Yi.

22
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,880
I'll show you.

23
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,440
What is the bond of family?

24
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,040
Be secure against assault

25
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,320
Tell some fantastic tales

26
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,960
wait and see

27
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,920
I want more.

28
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,920
I can only take one last bite.

29
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,560
We will go home.

30
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,520
Alright

31
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,440
This is Wu Jiao Jiao.

32
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,280
Crafty

33
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,520
Qi Mo is hard to deal with.

34
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,320
This can't go on.

35
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,520
Xiao Bao.

36
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,200
Xiao Bao.

37
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,840
WuYi

38
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,920
WuYi

39
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,480
WuYi

40
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,240
What's wrong?

41
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,440
Are you all right?

42
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,200
Second Brother took me to wash the incense.

43
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,160
you

44
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,280
You...

45
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,280
Martial and charming.

46
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,000
What's your intention to me?

47
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,080
Don't flatter yourself.

48
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,480
Give it to me.

49
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,040
halo

50
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,000
You actually thought I would steal a child.

51
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,480
I'm Qi Mo.

52
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,080
How could you do such a shady thing?

53
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,400
What happened today

54
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,480
You should apologize.

55
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,480
Write a letter of guarantee.

56
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,320
Forget it.

57
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,240
What apology?

58
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,640
What letter?

59
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,360
Why should I apologize?

60
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,240
Of course, I don't think you have good feelings for me.

61
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,080
You think of me as a pervert.

62
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,240
You treat me as a thief?

63
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,200
Stay two meters away from Wu Yi.

64
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,040
You seem to be up to no good.

65
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,840
you

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,720
From now on, I'll be two meters away.

67
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,240
I think you treat me with ill intention.

68
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,280
Be insatiable

69
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm late for kindergarten.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,560
Who sent me to the kindergarten?
