1
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,000
The beautiful scenery

2
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,480
To practice martial arts.

3
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,920
Practice

4
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,160
Qi Mo

5
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,800
You want to live in the martial arts.

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,960
And develop a relationship with Wu Yi.

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,120
To be Wu Yi's second junior brother.

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,840
That's why I promised you a fair competition.

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:39,800
However

10
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,640
Since you have entered my martial arts school,

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,360
You have to follow the teacher's arrangement.

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,640
From now on,

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,040
Every student in the martial arts school

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,480
Will be trained.

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,160
Martial and charming.

16
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,480
This is the agreement between Wu Yi and me.

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,880
What does it have to do with you?

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,040
You can train if you want.

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,960
unless

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,800
You don't want to develop a relationship with Wu Yi.

21
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,480
I don't want to be Wu Yi's second junior brother.

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,800
And I don't want to train.

23
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,200
WuYi

24
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,160
Your second senior brother.

25
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,960
He doesn't want to practice martial arts.

26
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,360
It's just training.

27
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,600
Who are you afraid of?

28
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,120
come

29
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,200
good

30
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,040
Assemble for training

31
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,320
Control training.

32
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,840
This is the horse march.

33
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,440
It's stable now.

34
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,880
From now on, I'll stand firm.

35
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,800
Finally,

36
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,360
So that you can stand tall.

37
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,560
Can you stop talking?

38
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,320
You really can't talk.

39
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,560
But you can be a teacher.

40
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,320
Look.

41
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,720
I forgot the time.

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,040
Let's start over.

43
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,080
My disciple.

44
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,720
The core of the hip needs force.

45
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,400
Can you stop touching me?

46
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,800
Wu Yi, come here.

47
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,400
Show me to your second junior brother.

48
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:32,960
five

49
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:33,880
four

50
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:34,960
three

51
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:35,840
two

52
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,080
one

53
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,640
Get ready for the next one.

54
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,160
what

55
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,600
And the next one.

56
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,520
Yes?

57
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,480
I can't hold on anymore.

58
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,440
You want to give up?

59
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,800
WuYi

60
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,880
Your second junior brother.

61
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,760
Who says I want to give up?

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,080
Go on.

63
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,200
Second Young Master, come on.

64
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,040
I believe you can do it.

65
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,360
I'm exhausted.

66
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,600
Finally stopped.

67
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,000
He can run away.

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,880
My legs are sore.

69
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,440
Why don't you give up?

70
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,600
You can't do that.

71
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,760
Too slow.

72
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,840
How about another day?

73
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,000
If I run,

74
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,680
Overtook you on this little car.

75
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,520
It's too embarrassing for you.

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,960
This is against me.

77
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,720
Do you think that

78
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,720
To practice martial arts.

79
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,000
It's not too late to give up.

80
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,120
it is nothing

81
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,600
I can't do that.

82
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,640
a row

83
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,200
You're so ruthless.

84
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,400
Come on.

85
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,360
Come on.

86
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,400
Ride it.

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,080
I'm going all out with you.

88
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,520
Hurry up.
