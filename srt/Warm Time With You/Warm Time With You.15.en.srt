00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,320
Hello, parents.

2
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,320
My name is Qi Mo.

3
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,120
And Wu Yi's parent.

4
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,440
When did you become an honorary principal?

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,560
What about Uncle Fatty?

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,880
How did you do that?

7
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,600
Of course, he has outstanding ability.

8
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,280
What are you capable of?

9
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,640
I'm also capable.

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,480
There are essential differences between us.

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,800
What's the difference?

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,080
I run a martial arts school.

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,640
Take the children to strengthen the body and cultivate the mind.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,280
And indulges the villains.

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,880
So a kid like Wu Yi

16
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,240
And possibly get hurt.

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,080
therefore

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,840
I'm the honorary principal.

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,600
Is to remind the school management and teachers

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,200
To eliminate this problem.

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,600
To treat teachers and children alike.

22
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,800
When facing the problem,

23
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,960
You won't shirk the responsibility.

24
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,160
Or ignore it.

25
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,400
That's the only way.

26
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,800
So that I can be trained like Wu Yi.

27
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,680
An excellent and intelligent child.

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,600
Qi Mo bought the kindergarten.

29
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,480
Xiao Yi went back to Qi's house.

30
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,800
It's impossible.

31
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,600
Let him go to the kindergarten.

32
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,480
Keep an eye on Qi Mo.

33
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,320
Okay, President Qi.

34
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,880
What does Qi Mo mean?

35
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,320
He won't ruin my good deed.

36
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,320
WuYi

37
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,760
Second Young Master,

38
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,360
You have worked so hard for us.

39
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,480
Let's reward him today.

40
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,440
good

41
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,960
But these delicious foods

42
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,080
Are prepared by Second Junior Brother.

43
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,640
To borrow flowers.

44
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,440
You're a child yourself.

45
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,960
And take a child.

46
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,960
Thank you so much.

47
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,440
Mom, I said Second Junior is very suitable.

48
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,200
Shh

49
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,480
Let's eat.

50
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:57,920
Yes

51
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,000
Hurry up and eat.

52
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,320
There's no coriander here.

53
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,040
Qi Mo is thoughtful.

54
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,600
Noticed that I don't eat coriander.

55
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,960
actually

56
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,560
He takes good care of us.

57
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,160
By the way,

58
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,640
Well

59
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,320
Recently, the parents of kindergarten

60
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,440
What's your relationship with Wu Yi?

61
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,040
What's your answer?

62
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,040
Tell the truth.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,760
Second Junior Brother.

64
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,680
Second Uncle.

65
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,720
Compared to the second junior brother,

66
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,280
I want a father more.

67
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,360
Ah

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,560
WuYi

69
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,920
Did you miss me?
