1
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,600
Brother

2
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,960
You're proposing now.

3
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,320
Isn't it a little radical?

4
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,160
We can't wait any longer.

5
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,600
With her current life condition,

6
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,880
It's hard to compete with the Qi family for custody.

7
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,520
Only Jiao and I are married.

8
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,200
To help her keep Xiao Bao.

9
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,400
Before the Qi family attacked,

10
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,680
The fastest way

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,520
But I think it's a little abrupt.

12
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,520
What about your happiness?

13
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,200
As long as I can be with Jiao Jiao,

14
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,040
Is my greatest happiness.

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,840
moreover

16
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,240
I should have done it a long time ago.

17
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,400
Xiao Bao.

18
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,280
Mom

19
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,840
Did anyone bully you?

20
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,760
No.

21
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,080
I have an appointment with Second Junior Brother.

22
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,160
To give me a surprise.

23
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,280
Pleasantly surprised

24
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,880
Qi Mo will take Wu Yi home.

25
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,520
WuYi

26
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,600
Mom, let's not talk about it.

27
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,880
Second Junior Brother came to pick me up.

28
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,160
Xiao Bao.

29
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,280
No matter what,

30
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,880
I will take you home.

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,160
He and that woman

32
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,480
How many years have we lived together?

33
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,560
I want to see my grandson for a while.

34
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,360
You said it's been a long time.

35
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,280
Qi Mo

36
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,400
What do you mean?

37
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,560
Boss Qi's physical condition

38
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,560
As you think,

39
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,000
And Secretary Zhao's movement

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,240
Has reported it.

41
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,160
After verification,

42
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,400
To the reporters.

43
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,760
In addition

44
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,320
Sell some other stocks.

45
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,040
We are always ready to attack our own.

46
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,920
But there's a more pressing problem.

47
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,240
say

48
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,440
Dongfang Yu,

49
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,520
Seems to be planning to propose to Wu Jiao Jiao.

50
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,560
Brother Xiao Yu.

51
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,360
you

52
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,520
What are you doing?

53
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,160
I know it's hard for you

54
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,880
Suddenly.

55
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,720
But this is our best option.

56
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,960
If we get married,

57
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,120
We can give Wu Yi a healthy family.

58
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,480
Stable economic conditions

59
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,040
such

60
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,800
No one can take Wu Yi away.

61
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,560
You are so charming.

62
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,280
Where's Wu Yi?

63
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,760
You are so charming.

64
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,920
I like you.

65
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,320
I won't hurt Wu Yi.

66
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,520
I promise you,

67
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,760
Wu Yi must be fine.

68
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,400
Trust me, okay?
