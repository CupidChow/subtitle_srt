1
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,560
YanKai

2
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,480
Can you be reliable?

3
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:28,880
Three times.

4
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,640
I took three strong blows.

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,160
Boss

6
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,880
I forgot about Wu Jiao Jiao.

7
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,240
Is special.

8
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,520
Who would have thought you haven't come close yet?

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:41,960
on

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,200
Gently.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,560
So what you said is a lie.

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,160
I don't like Wu Jiao Jiao at all.

13
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,280
Don't you want to know?

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,480
Her attitude towards you.

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,000
Do not want to

16
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,320
Actually, I have another way.

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,000
Don't go near Wu Jiao Jiao.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,920
You can also know whether she likes you or not.

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,920
If a person likes you,

20
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,560
She might lie to you.

21
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,080
Or pretend not to know you.

22
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,800
But her toes

23
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,840
Can't be deceived.

24
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,040
I will definitely face you.

25
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,680
Boss

26
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,880
I tried to restrain myself

27
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,640
The meaning of love and respect.

28
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,000
Wu Yi.

29
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,040
Have you ever thought about having a father?

30
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,880
Is to take care of you and your mother.

31
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,720
Of course I have.

32
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,160
I think the second junior brother is very suitable.

33
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,520
Qi qi mo

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,160
That's right.

35
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,280
I like Second Junior best.

36
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,520
He's handsome.

37
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,200
And protect your mother.

38
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,080
And my principal.

39
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,000
that

40
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,000
Compared to me,

41
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,200
Although Uncle Dong is handsome,

42
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,120
To protect your mother.

43
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,080
But you're always away from me.

44
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,280
To protect her.

45
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,760
Qi Mo was so weird yesterday.

46
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,880
These parents are really...

47
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,120
He is an honorary principal.

48
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,240
Why did you give him so many gifts on Teachers Day?

49
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,120
Boss

50
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,400
Look at your toes.

51
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,240
What are you two talking about?

52
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,400
Nothing?

53
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,640
What are these?

54
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,360
The parents of Wu Yi's class

55
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,920
I've prepared a holiday gift for you.

56
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,640
How about this?

57
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,000
It's from Mei's mother.

58
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,040
Love bento

59
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,240
How about this?

60
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,520
It's from your hometown.

61
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,520
Oh

62
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,360
this

63
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,040
Zi Xin's mother gave it to you.

64
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,600
The first scarf in winter.

65
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,880
I don't want it.

66
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,800
Go back.

67
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,840
This is prepared by Wu Yi's mother.

68
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,400
If you don't want it,

69
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,880
I want to...

70
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,800
You prepared a gift for me?

71
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,520
I want Wu Yi's mother's gift.

72
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,160
Yan Kai, take it back.

73
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,000
All right, boss.

74
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,640
Thank you.

75
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,800
What's wrong with him?

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,040
Why are you so happy?

77
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,360
Our boss

78
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,960
That's love.

79
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,880
Ah

80
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,720
love

81
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,800
With whom?

82
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,320
Your toes are pointing at Wu Yi.

83
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,440
Mom, I want some water.

84
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,600
Hold on.

85
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,360
Let me help you.

86
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,680
Have some water.

87
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,240
Drink slowly.

88
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,160
It's been a whole day.

89
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,040
Her toes never turned towards me.

90
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,360
Do you?

91
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,520
She really doesn't like me.

92
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,040
It's not reliable.

93
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,120
Yan Kai's method is not reliable at all.
