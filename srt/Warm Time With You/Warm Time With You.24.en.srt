1
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Boss, you're back.

2
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,480
Wu Yi just went to bed.

3
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,040
I've been waiting for your photos before I go to bed.

4
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,040
I think it's too late.

5
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,040
So I put him down.

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,240
Thank you.

7
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,800
It's getting late.

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,480
Go to bed early.

9
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,920
Remember our agreement.

10
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,120
We'll have a parents meeting tomorrow.

11
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,600
Boss

12
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,600
I told you that Wu Jiao likes you.

13
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,880
We use the project

14
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,360
And entangle Dongyu.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,680
Once he leaves,

16
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,520
You're making great progress.

17
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:16,920
That's enough.

18
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,200
Little Zhuge,

19
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,440
to grasp

20
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,000
It seems

21
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,560
Qi Mo,

22
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,920
I can't rely on it.

23
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,320
to show clearly

24
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,560
Are you going to

25
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,160
It's the opposite.

26
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,880
Mr. Qi, let me handle it.

27
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,840
Well

28
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,480
The way Wu Yi looks at this little demon,

29
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,560
It's not bad.

30
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,400
You won.

31
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,360
What do you want to achieve?

32
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,320
I'll help you.

33
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,520
President Qi suffered a heart attack.

34
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,840
She was rescued by An Ping Hospital.

35
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,760
Sleepyhead, wake up.

36
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,320
I'm late for the parents meeting.

37
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,600
Where is Qi Mo?

38
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,920
He didn't come.

39
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,840
She must have gone to the kindergarten.

40
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,960
I don't know either

41
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,320
Then we have breakfast.

42
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,160
Let's go too.

43
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,000
Well

44
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,360
Where can Qi Mo go?

45
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,800
sorry

46
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,040
The number you dialed

47
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,320
Not in the service area.

48
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,080
What about Qi Mo?

49
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,600
You haven't answered your phone all day.

50
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,120
Hello, Miss Li.

51
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,160
Director Qi.

52
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,480
Did you come to the kindergarten later?

53
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,840
Okay.

54
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,320
Thank you.

55
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,080
Mom

56
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,560
Don't be mad at me.

57
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,800
He didn't come.

58
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,360
Something must have happened.

59
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,880
I hope so.

60
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
He simply forgot

61
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,280
I'm already worried about him.

62
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,480
Qi Mo
