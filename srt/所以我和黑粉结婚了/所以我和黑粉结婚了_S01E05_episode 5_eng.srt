1
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,350
   

2
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,220
   

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,930
   

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,720
   

5
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,640
   

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,430
   

7
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:40,960


8
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:52,640
   
  

9
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,470
Geunyoung.

10
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,879
What now?

11
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,860
You still have the heels.

12
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,090
They were limited edition.

13
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,980
Don't throw them away.

14
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,179
What?

15
00:01:15,179 --> 00:01:17,250
You guys know each other?

16
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,900
Hoo Joon, it's nothing.

17
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,730
Don't worry about it.

18
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,390
So you guys know each other.

19
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,670
Why?

20
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,270
You jealous?

21
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,360
Jealous, my butt.

22
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,620
How does it feel to know that I know your secret?

23
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,210
Mind your own business.

24
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,579
Mind my... Don't tell me what to do.

25
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:47,750
Only I can do that.

26
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,460
Why is it only you?

27
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,040
And this was my first time.

28
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,730
You guys just stress me out.

29
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,600
Am I that easy to you?

30
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,880
- So annoying. 
 - I was just kidding.

31
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,270
Hey...

32
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,470
I was only kidding.

33
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,300
Why is she so sensitive?

34
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,000
When did I ever tell her what to do?

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,382
Well, I did and that might've offended her.

36
00:02:10,382 --> 00:02:12,250
I was in the wrong.

37
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,830
Taxi!

38
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,400
Isn't this a public relations problem?

39
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,570
What?

40
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,410
Tell them to do as well as we do.

41
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,500
The production was sloppy.

42
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,150
What do you mean sloppy?

43
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,110
Do they know how many all-nighters we pulled?

44
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,390
Who doesn't when you make an album?

45
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,079
Choreography was also a problem.

46
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,500
There was nothing that hooks.

47
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,830
Worry about the rhythm first.

48
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,160
The choreography would've been better.

49
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,280
Look at Hoo Joon's album... At least try to imitate his album and performance.

50
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,830
We're on the same team.

51
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,400
The way she criticizes...

52
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,850
Stop!

53
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,379
You know how to insult me.

54
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,470
I'm the artist and I'm not saying anything.

55
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,270
I made the final decision.

56
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:31,179
I accept my failure and I'm staying put.

57
00:03:31,179 --> 00:03:33,330
Let's do better next time.

58
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,770
I'm counting on you.

59
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,060
Yes, sir.

60
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,450
I'll do my best.

61
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,520
Long time no see, everyone.

62
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,680
What's the matter?

63
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,390
Dad must have sent me.

64
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,390
I didn't want to come.

65
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,680
How nice of you to come.

66
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,390
He asked me.

67
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,378
"Do you know why I named him Jaejoon?"

68
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:13,680
Jae is for fortune.

69
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,979
Joon is for bright.

70
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:18,870
He wanted you to be bright about fortune.

71
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,870
So I said.

72
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,920
"Dad, money is...

73
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,780
bright to some.

74
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,540
And dark to others.

75
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,130
It's pitch black for someone who fails every time."

76
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,100
This is when they say you don't live up to your name.

77
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:44,390
I'm sure that Dad regrets buying this for you.

78
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,730
Is the girl still here?

79
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,904
To be bright about fortune,

80
00:04:54,904 --> 00:04:59,690
you have to know what to keep and what to throw away.

81
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,879
You're not going to practice?

82
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:13,000
I'll take away your phone.

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,579
I barely got it back.

84
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:18,520
Joon is starting to annoy me.

85
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,779
Why so sensitive?

86
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,600
In golf, you want to be most careful

87
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,550
when everything is going well.

88
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,470
You still have much to go.

89
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,770
You're not even doing that well.

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,370
- Joon! 
 - Hello.

91
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,600
Hey.

92
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,979
You go practice.

93
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:42,540
When will he stop nagging me?

94
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,900
Do your best.

95
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,670
He said, "Do your best."

96
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,220
Man.

97
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,380
You must be tired.

98
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,340
You have one more appointment...

99
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,200
Appointment? Which one?

100
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,879
You remember him, right?

101
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,350
The youngest one in BM Group.

102
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,880
Was it Hodeok?? The one who plays guitar?

103
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,479
It's his birthday today.

104
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:20,120
The CEO of BM called me himself to ask you to stop by.

105
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:24,080
The company is releasing a new motorcycle soon.

106
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,470
And they're thinking of you for the advertisement.

107
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,610
Now I have to go to a teenager's birthday party for work?

108
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,470
He's a big fan of yours.

109
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:38,120
Think of it as going to celebrate it as a fan service.

110
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,040
I'll just congratulate him and not shoot the commercial.

111
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,930
You crazy?

112
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,000
You know how much that is?

113
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,720
Even he, as a high school student with common sense, would know I was there because of an advertisement.

114
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,120
What are you saying?

115
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,720
Just do it for us.

116
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,804
You're asking too much.

117
00:06:56,804 --> 00:06:58,100
I'm not going.

118
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,460
It's not only for you.

119
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,470
It's for the company.

120
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,280
You're going, right?

121
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:07,420
You will because you're nice.

122
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,010
I think he will.

123
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,080
He will.

124
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,270
I want chicken breast.

125
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,570
Oh, chicken breast?

126
00:07:16,179 --> 00:07:17,440
I almost made a mistake.

127
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,979
I like the skin and the soft flesh.

128
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:23,510
I was worried you might like the same part.

129
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,079
What's wrong with them?

130
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:25,890
You're here.

131
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:29,620
Chicken lovers are talking about chicken.

132
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,020
- Then should we share the parts we both like? 
 - No. Why? There is a lot of chicken...

133
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,220
Hey. What's the matter with you?

134
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,670
It was one of those days.

135
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,210
What's with the slippers?

136
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,370
You go home first.

137
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,580
You don't have to wait while I'm out with the kids.

138
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,920
I thought you didn't want to come?

139
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,670
I'll just sit down and not think.

140
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,770
Okay.

141
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,150
I'll come and pick you up after.

142
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,490
No, thanks. I can find my way home.

143
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,960
Bye.

144
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,560
Still...

145
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:12,370
♪ Come on, Baby. Come here and look at me ♪

146
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:19,930
♪ Come on, Baby. Someone come and stop me ♪

147
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,960
Why don't you go hang out more?

148
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,100
Why aren't you having fun?

149
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,262
Hey.

150
00:08:38,262 --> 00:08:40,579
You guys are so wholesome.

151
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:43,410
You think I smoke and drink?

152
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:44,879
I want to be a top star like you.

153
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:47,070
I can't mess up.

154
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,540
If you can't do anything because you're too worried you'll mess up on your way to being a top star,

155
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,900
why do it?

156
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,870
You either have to have a strong mentality or leave everything behind.

157
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,300
Don't do it unless you can.

158
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,310
What about you then?

159
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,650
Well, I...

160
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:11,898
I'm here because your dad told me to for a commercial,

161
00:09:11,898 --> 00:09:15,830
I'm either mentally strong or I gave up...

162
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,960
Let's just say that I have a strong mentality.

163
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,440
I'm here to celebrate your birthday with no thought of commercials.

164
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,970
Then you aren't strong, but pretending to be.

165
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,040
You've grown.

166
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:32,540
This is why I like you.

167
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,190
Because I can talk to you like a real brother.

168
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:45,768
 In Korea, you learn to drink soju from your dad. 

169
00:09:45,768 --> 00:09:50,430
 But I'm learning it... from you. 

170
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:54,700
 I'm so lucky to have you. 

171
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,610
Let's go party.

172
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,940
What party... You go and play.

173
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,100
I'm too old for this.

174
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,390
Seriously,

175
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,940
why am I even here?

176
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,080
Shinhyuk.

177
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,080
Don't you have to get back to study?

178
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,179
Right.

179
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:12,370
I should. I should.

180
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,170
Let's drink next time.

181
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,670
Yes.

182
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,720
Bye.

183
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,360
See you later.

184
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,350
Hey.

185
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:27,770
So you threw away the shoes in front of Roy's restaurant?

186
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:30,680
They didn't fit me in the first place anyway.

187
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,770
The heels don't fit you and one smacked a top star.

188
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:38,030
And they are now being thrown away at Roy's restaurant.

189
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:41,540
A sad life for those heels.

190
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:48,170
Hey, isn't that the preview of the variety show you are doing?

191
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:52,060
 I can reveal Hoo Joon's duplicity! 

192
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,640
 She may hate me because of a misunderstanding, 

193
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,670
 but I'll be the first to embrace her. 
   

194
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,079
   
   

195
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,440
   

196
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,670
 She's the first to shock me many times a day. 
   

197
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,180
 Shall we go, Geunyoung? 

198
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,210
 I'll drive safely. 

199
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,120
   

200
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,750
 

201
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,320
 Stop! 

202
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,772
Hey...

203
00:11:18,772 --> 00:11:19,979
What?

204
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:24,620
From the preview alone, you're a devil.

205
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,890
Freaking broadcasting stations!

206
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:29,650
Is this the devil's editing?

207
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,830
Never mind the preview.

208
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,350
But if the actual show is this way, let's just sue them.

209
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,790
I have a friend at a law firm.

210
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:42,810
The things that are being painted and the things that are painted are all of the same.

211
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,530
Freaking people...

212
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,779
 Can we have more sauce? 

213
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:52,020
Yes, just a second.

214
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,750
 Door is unlocked. 

215
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,600
  Door is locked. 

216
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,870
 Still... 

217
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:27,370
 I had my pride left. 

218
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:34,460
 That was... in limited edition. 

219
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:48,520
What's going on?

220
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,830
You suddenly asked me to come here.

221
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,180
Remember this place?

222
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,520
You threw me a party here 6 years ago.

223
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:00,270
 Welcome to Inhyung's debut party. 

224
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,980
I keep thinking back to that moment.

225
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,010
So here we are!

226
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,680
So you still remember?

227
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,550
Of course.

228
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,820
I thought you forgot.

229
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:30,779
I was really happy back then.

230
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,290
You were?

231
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,950
I want to go back.

232
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,648
Work...

233
00:13:37,648 --> 00:13:39,490
And you...

234
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,310
Okay.

235
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:46,680
And...

236
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,250
I don't know what you saw that day,

237
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,804
but we ran into each other coincidentally.

238
00:13:51,804 --> 00:13:55,350
And even if we met again, there is nothing between us.

239
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:09,560
He's just someone from the past, just someone.

240
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,100
Between?

241
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,760
Someone?

242
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:21,410
You still... can't say his name in front of me?

243
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:26,510
That's because... you still don't like it.

244
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,750
Do you know what our problem is?

245
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:36,090
Both of us... can't forget about our past with Joon.

246
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,670
Huh?

247
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,650
No.

248
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,479
Our problem is...

249
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:50,920
that I can't talk about our past because of Joon.

250
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,970
Let's stop this.

251
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,930
Where are you going?

252
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,110
Get in the car. We'll talk at home.

253
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,660
Let go of me.

254
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,579
I'm tired of trying to work it out with you.

255
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,360
Get in the car.

256
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,720
Just say you're sick of me!

257
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,570
Is that what you wanted?

258
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,330
For me to end it first? Huh?

259
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,979
Why am I always...

260
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,379
What are you doing?

261
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,870
You leave.

262
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,530
What?

263
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,350
Oh Inhyung.

264
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,570
Get in the car.

265
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,400
Hey!

266
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:10,130
You ran into us again?

267
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,730
I was just going to go.

268
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,779
But I didn't want people to see you like this.

269
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,830
What's he saying?

270
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,350
Geez, this guy...

271
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,220
Stop it.

272
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,820
Just stop it.

273
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:32,010
Seeing you like this is hard for me.

274
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:38,530
What's hard about it? Huh?

275
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,560
Did you want to be a showoff that badly?

276
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,979
In front of the ex-girlfriend you abandoned?

277
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,560
Listen carefully.

278
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,110
I didn't abandon her.

279
00:16:56,030 --> 00:17:02,330
If you keep doing this... I might get her back.

280
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,879
Get her back?

281
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:13,780
If you didn't abandon her, then what was it?

282
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,020
Good luck.

283
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,410
Wait for me.

284
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,950
I will clean your idol.

285
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,430
So clean.

286
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:09,130
I'll expose him.

287
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,720
This house is huge.

288
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,779
Why is he here again?

289
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,110
Why keep buying tteokbokki when you don't eat it?

290
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,560
They say... all tteokbokki is delicious.

291
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,790
No, that's not true.

292
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:51,240
My mom... sold tteokbokki when I was young.

293
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,670
Since she was a kid, everyone told her she needed to run her own place.

294
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:59,440
But she never really thought about she never heard them tell her about cooking.

295
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,000
Her business gracefully failed with her saying,

296
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,879
"It's hard for tteokbokki to not be delicious."

297
00:19:04,879 --> 00:19:07,702
She still doesn't know why her place failed.

298
00:19:07,702 --> 00:19:09,394
Who said it though?

299
00:19:09,394 --> 00:19:10,790
That all tteokbokki is delicious.

300
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,434
Someone.

301
00:19:12,434 --> 00:19:14,600
And she loved tteokbokki.

302
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,870
You got in a fight?

303
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:30,740
♫  It will be the star of the night.  ♫

304
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:40,070
♫  A short greeting that said goodbye  ♫

305
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,420
Put this on.

306
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:46,480
♫  The last night will come  ♫

307
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,200
♫  Like a very long night's dream  ♫

308
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,200
Your hands can fight, but they are unable to put a bandage on.

309
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,500
♫  Will you run away if it were ereased?  ♫

310
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:09,200
♫  I can't do it like my heart  ♫

311
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:19,900
♫  I hope I don't wake up and feel sad  ♫

312
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,960
Who's there?

313
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,120
 It's a flower delivery. 

314
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,779
Oh Inhyung, right?

315
00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:36,960
Please sign here.

316
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,970
Thank you.

317
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,600
 Don't be mad. 

318
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,170
 You may call me a coward, 

319
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,340
 but I still can't let you go. - JJ 

320
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:41,820
Did you... want to protect something, too?

321
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,390
You're drunk.

322
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:50,140
Protect?

323
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,250
Of course, I did.

324
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,470
I wanted to protect my love,

325
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,520
my work...

326
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,770
but you took my work away.

327
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,730
And the one with pink pants took my love away.

328
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,640
Why do you ask?

329
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,350
You're being all sentimental.

330
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,570
Just because.

331
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,410
I couldn't protect it.

332
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:24,570
Everyone wants to protect what's theirs.

333
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:27,930
Sometimes, you just can't.

334
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,770
And the time may come when you can again.

335
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:40,579
Or there might be something new you want to protect.

336
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,379
Something new to protect...

337
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,360
That's awesome.

338
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:59,600
I... never protected anyone.

339
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,190
Not my mom or my friend.

340
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,040
Even my love.

341
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:14,170
You asked me why I keep buying tteokbokki, even though I don't eat it.

342
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:18,710
There was someone.

343
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,120
 All tteokbokki is delicious. 

344
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,770
She said, "All tteokbokki is delicious."

345
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:36,170
She just couldn't walk past a tteokbokki place with out getting some.

346
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,520
She was that innocent and simple who wished for nothing.

347
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,330
And I couldn't protect her.

348
00:23:53,084 --> 00:23:56,230
What am I saying to you?

349
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,610
You are sleeping, right?

350
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,370
 Joon. 

351
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:18,286
 Since you're going to Japan anyway, I decided to clear up your schedule. 

352
00:25:18,286 --> 00:25:23,040
 According to the person who looked into it, your dad's friend lives in Japan. 

353
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,350
♫  Girl, I remember  ♫

354
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,310
♫  But now in my eyes are you  ♫

355
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:38,710
♫  Make me surrender  ♫

356
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:44,160
♫  You kept me up all night long  ♫

357
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:48,790
♫  I promised I'll treat you right  ♫

358
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:52,160
♫  But I didn't know how  ♫

359
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,620
♫  Girl, I remember  ♫

360
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:01,030
♫  The times that you said, "You're mine."  ♫

361
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:10,020
♫  Baby, you... I still love you  ♫

362
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:18,390
♫  Baby, you... I'm still with you  ♫

363
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:28,450
♫  And in the cold, girl, I hold you close, I will wake up from now  ♫

364
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:32,130
♫  Baby, you...  ♫

365
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:34,879
 We're not home right now. 

366
00:26:34,879 --> 00:26:39,920
 Leave us a message and we'll get back to you. 

367
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,770
 It's me. 

368
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,800
 The one who couldn't protect you, Mom 

369
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,800
♫  Girl, I remember  ♫

370
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,190
Just like someone...

371
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:56,150
♫  Make me surrender  ♫

372
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,300
I can't really...

373
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:02,160
♫  You kept me up all night long  ♫

374
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,060
protect someone.

375
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:10,890
♫  I promised I'll treat you right, but I didn't know how...  ♫

376
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:13,290
You and Inhyung...

377
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:18,950
♫  The times that you said your lies  ♫

378
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,580
What?

379
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,379
How insolent.

380
00:27:35,379 --> 00:27:40,360
I have something to discuss with you.

381
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,430
What is it?

382
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:45,079
 I'm going to sign a contract with Lee Geunyoung. 

383
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:47,656
Since you have filmed with her a few times,

384
00:27:47,656 --> 00:27:50,430
So how is she? Does she have the potential to be an entertainer?

385
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,760
No, she doesn't. Just ignore her.

386
00:27:54,979 --> 00:27:58,306
That means she does have potential.

387
00:27:58,306 --> 00:27:59,779
 I mean. 

388
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:03,460
Someone's blackmailing me that he might take away my star

389
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,070
and he acts like she's his star.

390
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,540
 Come on. 

391
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,488
I'm so scared.

392
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:11,430
I want a new star.

393
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:15,130
Anyways, thanks for your advice.

394
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:22,934
Let's do some laundry.

395
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:25,110
How do you do this?

396
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,830
He must have never used it.

397
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,979
Can I be the first?

398
00:28:29,979 --> 00:28:31,960
Of course, master!

399
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,120
I've been waiting for you.

400
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,210
That's right.

401
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:02,550
Detergent? Yes!

402
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,640
Now...

403
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,090
Strong cycle...

404
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:32,479
What? What the heck?

405
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:37,070
He didn't even have the machine connected?

406
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:40,480
Geez, nothing seems to work in this house.

407
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:43,520
It's not right.

408
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:49,620
It's the weekend.

409
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,080
Yes, producer.

410
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,860
What's up? It's the weekend.

411
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,079
 An emergency! 

412
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:56,370
 Our release date has been moved up. 

413
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:58,040
 So we have to shoot today. 

414
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,879
 I'm going to the house first. 

415
00:29:59,879 --> 00:30:01,140
 Come right away. 

416
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,360
You're coming here?

417
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,770
I mean...

418
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:06,240
You're going there?

419
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,440
Shall we move on to next trainee? 
    

420
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,920
No.

421
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,640
Let's stop for today.

422
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,460
You can leave.

423
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,330
Sir.

424
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:28,470
There are some trainees... that I think need to start forming a group for debut

425
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:30,070
All they do is train.

426
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,170
I mean.

427
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,940
Is there really any way they can make it?

428
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,679
Really think it through. Huh?

429
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,660
Not leaving?

430
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,579
Have a good day.

431
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,820
How long are they going to be this slow?

432
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,150
I'm so frustrated.

433
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,460
Don't we have any sensational new rookies?

434
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:01,620
Someone who can threaten Hoo Joon...

435
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:10,279
I'm going for an unexpected walk.

436
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:14,350
Can I arrive right about now?

437
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,720
Why is he here again?

438
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:23,370
We meet again.

439
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,679
I know.

440
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,650
The shoot isn't easy, right?

441
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:28,740
No.

442
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:33,160
But the vitamin you gave me last time really helped.  I've been able to hold on.

443
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,370
My pleasure.

444
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,370
See you next time.

445
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,379
Why would I want to see you again?

446
00:31:40,379 --> 00:31:40,970
Let's go.

447
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:43,300
- Oh, Reporter Choi. 
 - It's been a lot of work.

448
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,780
Where's our top star?

449
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,450
Hello.

450
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,610
My goodness.  My goodness. Why are they doing that between men?

451
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:01,900
They just want attention.

452
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,820
She's staring daggers at us.

453
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,420
Is my head bleeding?

454
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,620
What brings you here?

455
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,870
I just stopped by.

456
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,330
You don't look well.

457
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,560
I'm fine.

458
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,844
I didn't sleep well last night.

459
00:32:14,844 --> 00:32:15,920
Cheer up.

460
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,100
Write me a good article when the release date is confirmed.

461
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,579
Don't worry.

462
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:24,540
I know well that the other person is not normal.

463
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,570
Your face really doesn't well.

464
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,520
Shouldn't you go to the shop and get some treatment

465
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,070
No way. I'm shining like a star.

466
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,410
She's not here?

467
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:34,770
Your makeup artist?

468
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:35,830
She's gone?

469
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:39,710
Please make her look pretty.

470
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,820
Okay.

471
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,820
Geunyoung.

472
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:46,278
You don't really take care of your skin.

473
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:48,460
That's a problem.

474
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:52,570
You feel like you're applying makeup to sand, right?

475
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,600
I'm sorry, Geunyoung.

476
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:57,170
I can't hold my tongue...

477
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:59,320
Ms. Noh, come on.

478
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,300
Don't say that you can't hold your tongue.

479
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,300
It offends her more.

480
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,070
I know.

481
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:08,860
A lot of people must've asked you to shut your mouth.

482
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,350
They did.

483
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:14,425
It's better to say nothing if you can't hold your tongue.

484
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:16,370
Gangyeon, you're so funny.

485
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:17,580
Take good care of her.

486
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,560
Make her pretty.

487
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,640
Everything going well?

488
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,070
Stop looking at me.

489
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:32,090
Mind your business.

490
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:34,550
Why don't you mind yours?

491
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,170
Whose is this? I found it.

492
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:40,570
It's laundry.

493
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:41,920
I should put it in the washer.

494
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,910
Where did you find this, Mr. Han?

495
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,879
Is it yours?

496
00:33:45,879 --> 00:33:48,870
I brought it from home because I...

497
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,830
Don't have a washer?

498
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,080
No.

499
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,144
Goodness, that's why.

500
00:33:57,144 --> 00:33:59,979
But the washer is not connected here.

501
00:33:59,979 --> 00:34:01,520
I know.

502
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,280
Huh?

503
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,090
- It's not? 
 - No.

504
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:10,510
Oh! It's not.

505
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:14,150
I shouldn't have brought this heavy laundry then.

506
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,840
You wasted your energy.

507
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,970
This house sure doesn't feel like someone's living in it.

508
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:20,430
- Right? 
 - Yeah.

509
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:23,210
It's somewhat cold.

510
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:25,379
We're shooting soon.

511
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,460
He scared me.

512
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,500
Today, let's check what we need at home.

513
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,580
We looked around.

514
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,830
We're missing many things.

515
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,560
And the house is dirty, too.  It was left as is after the last shooting.

516
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,390
Oh yeah?

517
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:46,930
Then let's wipe the floor, too.

518
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:47,710
Okay.

519
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,138
You okay with that?

520
00:34:49,138 --> 00:34:50,500
Let's get started then.

521
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,970
- Get ready. 
 - Okay.

522
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:54,320
We're getting ready.

523
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,540
Please move.

524
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,970
I told you not to make it obvious.

525
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,979
Why leave the laundry there?

526
00:35:04,979 --> 00:35:08,160
The washer wasn't working so I just put it there for a second...

527
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,179
Then what about the floor?

528
00:35:10,179 --> 00:35:12,440
I clean this big house every day.

529
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,770
Be quiet.

530
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,900
Anyway, I can't mop so you'll do it.  Got it?

531
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:17,850
Answer me.

532
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:20,110
You told me to be quiet.

533
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:28,320
You know how to do it?

534
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,290
Of course.

535
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:31,440
I've been doing all these things myself since I was a kid.

536
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,710
Just because I'm a celebrity doesn't mean I'll not do these things.  I'll show show you.

537
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:39,870
And I'm one of the handy ones among celebs.

538
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,430
It's not that.

539
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:45,010
I can't let you do such a hard job.

540
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:48,020
 He constantly makes himself look better. 

541
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,579
 A two-faced man. 

542
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,079
Wow, you're even handy.

543
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:59,768
You're just... the perfect man.

544
00:35:59,768 --> 00:36:02,470
Then I'll wipe the floor.

545
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:05,100
I'm good at it.

546
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,870
Gangyeon,

547
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:26,780
how do you even get in here with all those clothes?

548
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,120
I can't.

549
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:33,040
While they shoot, let's clean this up.

550
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,830
Hey, sit down.

551
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:47,790
♫  Open that living room   ♫

552
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:52,320
♫  Baby, put a little grace on it  ♫

553
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,890
♫  On it... Baby  ♫

554
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:56,160
♫  Put a little sauce upon it  ♫

555
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,890
♫  Try to chase, for the win, this bitch is in my face  ♫

556
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:03,000
 Wipe it hard. Harder! 

557
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:31,970
You're still not...

558
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,560
I'm sorry, Geunyoung.

559
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,770
I can't do anything else when I'm focused.

560
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:51,179
You know what you're doing, right?

561
00:37:51,179 --> 00:37:54,060
It did take me some time to find the flaw in the machine,

562
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,620
but the answer was here.

563
00:37:55,620 --> 00:38:00,479
I'm happy to be able to do something for you.

564
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:02,860
By the way, were you wiping the floor?

565
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,730
We could've done it together.

566
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,479
I'm grateful you said that.

567
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,020
You can't do stuff like this.

568
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,820
I'm perfect for it.

569
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,770
I think I'm talented.

570
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:17,790
Keep going.

571
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,858
I think you'll strain your neck.

572
00:38:19,858 --> 00:38:21,980
Take it easy.

573
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,000
Maybe this angle this time?

574
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,610
Yes, like that.

575
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,300
Director,

576
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,560
I put it in here, right?

577
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:59,760
#$%^&amp;(*&amp;^%

578
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,430
Wow.

579
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:37,360
There's a room here.

580
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,980
I should clean in there, too.

581
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,070
 Where are you going? 

582
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,940
 This place is huge, I'm looking around the house. 

583
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,770
 Don't ever go to second floor. 

584
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:51,790
 What kind of shady stuff are you hiding up there? 

585
00:40:05,379 --> 00:40:07,610
 When I tell you not to, don't. 

586
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:11,330
 Geunyoung! 

587
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:15,379
Geunyoung!

588
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,570
I finally got it to work.

589
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:19,000
Want to see?

590
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,470
I'll be there after I clean this room.

591
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:23,950
No. I want to show you already.

592
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,580
Let me just finish the second floor.

593
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,220
I'm not done.

594
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,000
I think I should finish cleaning the second floor.

595
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:34,360
That's okay. Let me show you already.

596
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:38,810
Don't be surprised too much.

597
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:41,610
This is basic stuff.

598
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:47,982
Success!

599
00:40:47,982 --> 00:40:49,130
 Cut! 

600
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:50,279
 Okay. 

601
00:40:50,279 --> 00:40:52,000
 That was great. 

602
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,890
 That's it for today. 

603
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:55,670
We're wrapping up.

604
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,000
- Great job! 
 - You too.

605
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,100
Great work!

606
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,020
Good job.

607
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,320
 Wrap everything up! 

608
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,570
It's disgusting to watch him.

609
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:13,920
His whole life is fabricated.

610
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,060
Unnie, the shoot is almost over.

611
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,390
That's weird.

612
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,740
Where is it?

613
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,770
Which one?

614
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:24,979
The white one.

615
00:41:24,979 --> 00:41:26,550
- This one? 
 - No.

616
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,700
It's a white t-shirt.

617
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,150
Why is this here?

618
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:33,410
I'm sorry. I thought it was mine.

619
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:34,720
What can you do.

620
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,310
We can pay it back.

621
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:39,610
At any rate, always making a mess.

622
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,100
I'll pay for it.

623
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,470
Baby.

624
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,900
Don't. How much is it?

625
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,650
I can give you 30...

626
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:51,400
300?

627
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,620
Come on, everyone.

628
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:56,200
Its market value is $1,000.

629
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,770
It's $3,000 including Hoo Joon's premium.

630
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:04,000
That's impossible!  It's just a t-shirt.  $3,000?

631
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,960
What?

632
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,180
$3,000 is absurd.

633
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,500
What is this? It's that expensive?

634
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,040
It's because of you.

635
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,560
You're a luxury brand on your own.

636
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,770
All you had to do was stand still, why did you even bother speaking up?

637
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,560
I was just wiping the floor.

638
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,810
So I just grabbed a shirt...

639
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:23,970
Be quiet.

640
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,400
Go do your laundry. It smells.

641
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,900
Geunyoung, don't worry. I'll look into it with Rara.

642
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,650
It's okay.

643
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:36,120
I'm so sorry.

644
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,420
I thought it was mine.

645
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,910
It's okay.

646
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:44,400
Should I try washing it?

647
00:42:45,279 --> 00:42:48,730
That's okay.

648
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,180
 Look at this. 

649
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:56,390
Hoo Joon's reality show's trailer is up.

650
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:59,070
That reporter is really something.

651
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:02,000
She was born, born for entertainment.

652
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:18,470
What the heck. It'll still take them a while.

653
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,920
 Did Hoo Joon already leave? 

654
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,480
 Yeah, a while ago. 

655
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,120
 Can you keep this and give it to him when you see him? 

656
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,080
 What is this? 

657
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:41,280
It wa s under Hoo Joon's van and I forgot to give it to him. 

658
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,020
 I'm sorry. Do me a favor. 

659
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,020
Okay.

660
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:46,730
Why is it so soft?

661
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,820
So the purpose of this house is...

662
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:33,190
 Something is in this room. 

663
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,320
Why ring the bell? You know the password.

664
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,370
What about you?

665
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:50,079
You just open the door without seeing who it is.

666
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:55,530
Why are you looking at me like that?

667
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:58,660
I was wondering why you keep coming here when it not even your house.

668
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:01,390
It's not because of you so don't mind it.

669
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:03,720
That's right.

670
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,670
It's because of something else.

671
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,320
He must be looking for this.

672
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:41,242
I said it has nothing to do with you.  What?  What?

673
00:45:41,242 --> 00:45:42,620
Looking for this?

674
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:45,500
Your eyes are all red.  Really red.

675
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,520
What is this?

676
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,960
Don't pretend like it's not yours.

677
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,420
A gift? I don't need it.

678
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,820
A gift you say?

679
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:55,170
What a pervert.

680
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,600
- What? 
 - Don't bring something like this to the shoot. Okay?

681
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:01,870
You're lucky that I saw this first.

682
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:05,810
Finding this outside, makes me wonder how you'd be at home.

683
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:07,540
I think it's from that room.

684
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:09,979
What the heck is this?

685
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:14,750
What is this?

686
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:18,700
You're getting better at acting.

687
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:19,870
What do you mean "what"?

688
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:23,120
What do you think? Maybe it's one of your collections.

689
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:25,994
Do you...

690
00:46:25,994 --> 00:46:27,930
have proof that it's mine?

691
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:28,890
Is it mine?

692
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:30,770
Or is it Ms. Noh's?

693
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:32,510
You want to play it like that?

694
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,800
Lee Geunyoung, I'm asking you a favor.

695
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,640
Don't ever, ever be a journalist in your next life.

696
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:41,070
You don't have the basics to verify the facts.  The facts.

697
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:46,370
Of course.

698
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:49,670
It's hard to acknowledge that you're a perv.

699
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,679
 My star! What's up with the video call? 

700
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:01,030
Do you know anything about this?

701
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:02,170
 Oh. 

702
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:04,200
 One of your fans gave it to you while you were shooting. 

703
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,350
 I meant to throw it away. 

704
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:08,220
 I heard it's women's underwear. 

705
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:11,810
 You know how those crazy fans throw there underwear to their idols? 

706
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:13,838
Some may think...

707
00:47:13,838 --> 00:47:15,580
that I'm a pervert.

708
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:17,060
 I know. 

709
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:20,379
 Rara was going to throw it away before you saw it and got upset. 

710
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:22,270
 Leave it. I'll throw it away. 

711
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:24,870
 And I opened the weird package. 

712
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:27,380
I told you to leave it. Why open it?

713
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,430
 You never know. It may be dangerous. 

714
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:32,590
 What if it's a dead rat? 

715
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:33,990
It's just a hat.

716
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:36,120
With a memo that it's yours to wear.

717
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,890
 I'll leave it in the car. 

718
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:39,430
 Post it when you can. 

719
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:41,130
All right, bye.

720
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:43,740
 Okay. 

721
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:46,790
You once got a dead rat in the mail? That's awful.

722
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:48,180
How does that feel?

723
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:49,912
Don't change the subject.

724
00:47:49,912 --> 00:47:51,300
I mean...

725
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,980
Why did he say it was yours?

726
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,420
It made me get the wrong idea.

727
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:58,540
I didn't know women send you their underwear.

728
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:01,310
You think you can use your ignorace as a weapon?

729
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:03,310
Your really impossible.

730
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:05,079
Impossible?

731
00:48:05,079 --> 00:48:07,560
Who do you call impossible?

732
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,390
At least I'm not two-faced like a guy I know.

733
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:13,610
Not only are you deceitful, but you have a secret chamber.

734
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:14,580
Do you think you're Harry Potter?

735
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:16,884
Then get out!

736
00:48:16,884 --> 00:48:20,900
I did get your consent to live in this house in secret,

737
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:23,000
but it's not like this is your house.

738
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,079
This is my house.

739
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:25,960
Really?

740
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,220
So get out if you don't like it here.

741
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:31,370
It's fine by me, so please get out.

742
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:34,500
You talk too much.

743
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:39,040
It's his house?

744
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:41,360
Really?

745
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:48,320
When he's angry,

746
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:52,530
he ignores what others say. 
    

747
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:54,540
 You didn't even hear what I had to say before you got all pissed off! 

748
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:57,190
 What you say? It's not like it's my first time to meet someone like you. 

749
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:58,620
 You and your camera earlier, 

750
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:00,290
 and now you follow me to take pictures. 

751
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:01,560
 You want me to let it slide? 

752
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,930
 I told you I didn't take pictures. 

753
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:08,146
When I'm not even saying anything...

754
00:49:08,146 --> 00:49:09,570
he says "Shut up."

755
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:10,980
 Shut up! 
   

756
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:13,020
 Do I have to tell you that? 

757
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,170
He's seeking attention but needs medical attention.

758
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:23,080
An attention whore. 
    

759
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,528
 Guys. 

760
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:27,670
 This makes me really sad. 

761
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:30,770
 She may hate me now because of a misunderstanding. 

762
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:32,560
 I'll be the first... 

763
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,690
 to embrace her. 

764
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:44,670
An attention whore. 
    

765
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:54,000
He's a master of only promoting his cool side.

766
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:56,540
 When I'm down and exhausted, 

767
00:49:56,540 --> 00:50:00,740
 looking at these fan letters... 

768
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:03,058
 really cheers me up. 

769
00:50:03,058 --> 00:50:04,980
 My number one treasure. 

770
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:12,980
Let's not be fooled by him.

771
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,500
- Yes. 
   - Is this Lee Geunyoung? 

772
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,470
This is she.

773
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:45,540
 I'm Kang Gyeongsoo, the editor-in-chief at Super Patch. 

774
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:48,170
Huh?

775
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:51,140
This is really unprecedented.

776
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:54,250
I'm calling because our company thought it'd be nice

777
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:58,720
to be able to hire you as our journalist.

778
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:03,440
 You never check your emails, so I'm calling you myself. 

779
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,890
 It's to make it all formal. 

780
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:11,120
 So please show up at out interview. 

781
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,060
It's tomorrow.

782
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:26,280
   

783
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,890
   

784
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:30,510
   

785
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:32,510
 Get lost, you witch! 

786
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:35,470
 I don't like how he's supposed to be married with an anti-fan. 

787
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:37,250
 Is this for real? 

788
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:40,580
 She's impossible. 

789
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:41,920
 Who is that? 

790
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,120
 I hate it. I hate this show so much. 

791
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:10,179
We were going to see each other tomorrow anyways.

792
00:52:10,179 --> 00:52:13,570
What brings you to the station?

793
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:15,179
Where's Mr. Han?

794
00:52:15,179 --> 00:52:19,200
He's busy editing because the first episode will air when we're in Japan.

795
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,170
You're all packed?

796
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:22,270
No, not yet.

797
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:23,310
Why not?

798
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:24,600
You don't want to go?

799
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,080
Huh?

800
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:30,940
That's not it.

801
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:34,770
By the way,

802
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:36,770
Ms. Noh.

803
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:40,200
By any chance,

804
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:44,330
what happens if I quit?

805
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:46,440
That'll be violating our contract.

806
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,220
So you'll have to give up the signing bonus

807
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:51,450
and the show will finish with no ending,

808
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:55,880
and Mr. Han and I will be in a lot of trouble.

809
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:56,880
I'm sorry.

810
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,310
Maybe I scared you.

811
00:53:00,279 --> 00:53:02,680
You want to quit?

812
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,020
No...

813
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:05,179
It's not that.

814
00:53:05,179 --> 00:53:06,370
What's wrong?

815
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:08,460
You're doing great.

816
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,190
And the show will be different from the trailer.

817
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:14,750
And being in Japan together will be so much fun.

818
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:18,740
Well, that is considered not holding my tongue, which we know I can't do.

819
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,330
You know what Mr. Han will say.

820
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:21,580
"That's too bad."

821
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:25,330
Your decision matters more than the show.

822
00:53:35,279 --> 00:53:37,360
I'll talk it over with the producer again.

823
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,750
Don't worry too much.

824
00:53:45,179 --> 00:53:47,074
Let's talk again tomorrow.

825
00:53:47,074 --> 00:53:48,330
Sir,

826
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:51,300
Inhyung has an appointment tomorrow...

827
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:54,080
Just do the appointment.

828
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,500
Jaejoon?

829
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,430
Geunyoung.

830
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,812
Who's that?

831
00:54:01,812 --> 00:54:03,674
A new star in my company.

832
00:54:03,674 --> 00:54:07,400
A rookie. You wouldn't know her.

833
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,390
I heard the date for the first episode is set?

834
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:10,470
Yes.

835
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:13,502
You look nervous.

836
00:54:13,502 --> 00:54:15,720
I'm a bit worried.

837
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,350
Yes.

838
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:28,012
Yes, sir.

839
00:54:28,012 --> 00:54:30,030
Let's go.

840
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,830
Is something wrong?

841
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:36,550
They can't reach Geunyoung.

842
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:38,310
Now, she's doing it all.

843
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:41,770
We should leave now to make the flight.

844
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:46,990
They don't know where she lives, so they are worried.

845
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:50,679
She's really good at making people worry.

846
00:54:50,679 --> 00:54:52,810
Let's stop by the penthouse on the way.

847
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:53,960
She's probably sleeping there.

848
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,579
What?

849
00:54:55,579 --> 00:54:56,870
Why would she?

850
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:58,080
I'll tell you on the way.

851
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,150
We'll be late.

852
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:22,260
Geunyoung?

853
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,970
Geunyoung?

854
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:37,000
I don't think she's here.

855
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,320
I'm going down.

856
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:45,510
We greatly value what you have done so far.

857
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:46,930
Thank you.

858
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:49,450
I'll work hard if you let me.

859
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:53,570
If you do get the job, can you start right away?

860
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:55,579
Yes.

861
00:55:55,579 --> 00:55:58,970
As you know, I am in a reality show.

862
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:02,360
I should quit right away since this is my real job.

863
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,500
No way. What are you saying?

864
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,180
That's the nature of investigative journalism.

865
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:09,050
Huh?

866
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:15,020
Investigative journalism that will reveal the dirty secrets of the show business world.

867
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:17,680
That's your biggest merit.

868
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:21,550
And we should use it to our advantage.

869
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:25,079
Continue working with Hoo Joon for now...

870
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:26,858
and...

871
00:56:26,858 --> 00:56:28,520
gather information.

872
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:32,100
What I mean is the other sides of Hoo Joon that are not shown on TV.

873
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,750
His scandal for example.

874
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:35,770
Or anything you can find out.

875
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:39,530
If you can bring that information to us,

876
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:41,410
you're hired.

877
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,540
It's an opportunity for an exclusive.

878
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:51,950
   
   

879
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:57,010
You're here.

880
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:02,520
Geunyoung isn't here?

881
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,979
Rookie, did she call you?

882
00:57:04,979 --> 00:57:07,930
She asked Ms. Noh what would happen if she quit.

883
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:09,879
I guess she was serious.

884
00:57:09,879 --> 00:57:11,820
What did she tell her?

885
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:14,380
I don't really know.

886
00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:17,440
Let's just wait a little bit.

887
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,250
I don't see Ms. Noh either.

888
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:24,120
She's already gone in to buy cosmetics.

889
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:27,000
How much prettier will she get?

890
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,220
Let's just wait.

891
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:33,360
Just wait a little bit.

892
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:53,250
Let's sign today.

893
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:21,560
♫  Can you hear my heart?  ♫

894
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:28,260
♫  Can you see my words?  ♫

895
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:33,160
♫  On the cold and dark night  ♫

896
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:42,050
♫  I want to hear your voice  ♫

897
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:48,840
♫  I can see that heart  ♫

898
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:55,280
♫  I remember those words  ♫

899
00:58:55,400 --> 00:59:07,530
♫  I can't sleep tonight because you're growing up around me  ♫

900
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:13,579
I don't want to be two-faced, fooling a celeb and selling his information.

901
00:59:13,579 --> 00:59:17,752
Maybe I'm not crazy enough for an exclusive yet.

902
00:59:17,752 --> 00:59:19,398
Okay.

903
00:59:19,398 --> 00:59:24,950
I'll be waiting with this.

904
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:27,790
Call me back when you're ready.

905
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:43,528
Am I at the right terminal?

906
00:59:43,528 --> 00:59:46,930
Maybe I should've told them it was my first time at the airport.

907
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:00,770
Geunyoung, where are you?

908
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:02,290
It's not there.

909
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:04,406
Come to the second floor.

910
01:00:04,406 --> 01:00:06,500
Yes, the second floor.

911
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:10,679
Turn right when you come up. You'll see us.

912
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:19,290
Where are they talking about?

913
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:31,110
It's really time now.

914
01:00:31,110 --> 01:00:35,300
Go first, I'll take her with me on the next flight.

915
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:36,710
We should do that.

916
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:38,860
Hey. Wrap it up well.

917
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:40,810
Where's Hoo Joon?

918
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:42,330
Huh?

919
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:46,910
Where did he go?

920
01:01:06,270 --> 01:01:07,170
We're late.

921
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:07,940
Run.

922
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:10,060
♫  Looking at you looking  ♫

923
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:14,400
♫  I know this is something, I wanna do it right   ♫

924
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,290
♫  Do it right  ♫

925
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:18,510
♫  And usually I move fast  ♫

926
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:22,790
♫  But this I want it to last, I wanna do it right  ♫

927
01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:24,290
♫  Do it right  ♫

928
01:01:24,290 --> 01:01:27,660
♫  So I try to keep my patience  ♫

929
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:31,740
♫  To make the best of it, but I'm still breathless  ♫

♫  Day &amp; Night, Day &amp; Night, Day &amp; Night  ♫

939
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:07,770
 You must be newlyweds. 

940
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:08,420
 I'm sorry. 

941
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:09,620
 Get it together. 

942
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:11,140
 It's your first time in Japan, huh? 

943
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:13,470
 I haven't seen Joon joke around like that in a long time. 

944
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:14,960
 He's lucky to have you. 

945
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,730
 You can't look at him for one second without lying about your feelings. 

946
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:22,670
♫  I don't see another, I wanna be the one  ♫

947
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:24,137
 I told you let's not do this! 

948
01:02:24,137 --> 01:02:25,271
 Geunyoung! 

949
01:02:25,271 --> 01:02:26,437
 Wake up. 

950
01:02:26,437 --> 01:02:29,196
 She was with you. 

951
01:02:29,196 --> 01:02:31,312
 It's her first time here. 

952
01:02:31,312 --> 01:02:33,570
 Mom. 

953
