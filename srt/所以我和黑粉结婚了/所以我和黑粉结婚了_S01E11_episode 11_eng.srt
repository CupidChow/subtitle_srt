00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:53,050
   

9
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,200
You got a call.

10
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,020
I'm not picking up.

11
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,530
Just answer it.

12
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,500
Who's calling me at this hour?

13
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:06,790
   

14
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,620
What are you doing? Answer it.

15
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,270
Yes.

16
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,530
Just a moment.

17
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,570
- What'sâ”€  
  - Are you a friend of Oh Inhyung? 

18
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,000
 This is the hospital. 

19
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,100
Yes. O-Okay.

20
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,380
Is something wrong?

21
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,010
Inhyung was found unconscious in her car and now she's in the hospital.

22
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,860
Really?

23
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,070
What are you doing? Then go already.

24
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,612
Let me take you home first.

25
00:01:44,612 --> 00:01:46,970
You're going to go alone?

26
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,979
What'll you do? Wear a helmet? There are lots of people there.

27
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,570
You'll start rumors.

28
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,579
Let's go together.

29
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,920
I'll go with you.

30
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,890
   

31
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,280
   

32
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,550
Wait a moment.

33
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:11,250
You can't go in like this, you'll cause a huge uproar.

34
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:12,920
Still...

35
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,079
Wait until she's in a patient room.

36
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:18,100
Call Jihyang first.

37
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:29,340
   

38
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,870
When they come in alone, we usually just call in whoever is first on speed dial.

39
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,481
We got lucky. It's not always someone that's capable of caring for them.

40
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,320
 She's someone I couldn't protect. 

41
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,750
 I tried to protect everyone but ended up just hurting them. 

42
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:03,880
 Inhyung, do you still... want Hoo Joon to protect you? 

43
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:09,030
â™«  Can you hear my heart?  â™«

44
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:15,670
 Where did it all go wrong for us? 

45
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:20,710
â™«  On this cold and dark night  â™«

46
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:29,620
â™«  I want to hear your warm voice  â™«

47
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:36,370
â™«  I can see that heart  â™«

48
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:42,960
â™«  I remember those words  â™«

49
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:50,010
â™«  I can't sleep tonight because you're growing around me  â™«

50
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,140
Don't worry too much. They said she'll wake up soon.

51
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,980
Thank you.

52
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:01,800
Are you awake?

53
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,730
How did you come here...

54
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,610
They say you were unconscious in the car.

55
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,620
You don't remember?

56
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,790
But... why are you guys here together?

57
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,400
It just ended up that way.

58
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,010
What happened to you?

59
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,530
Let me make a call.

60
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,830
Tell me, Oh Inhyung.

61
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,260
What happened?

62
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,190
Honestly, I don't remember how I got there.

63
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:02,280
I didn't know the hospital would call you.

64
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,170
And I didn't know you would be with Geunyoung either.

65
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,520
Is Jaejoon giving you a hard time?

66
00:05:20,179 --> 00:05:22,100
What if he is?

67
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,880
If I say he is... will you take me back?

68
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:36,060
I... thought you were happy and so I held back,

69
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,780
but...

70
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,630
Don't get mad.

71
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,810
I hate myself like crazy for being like this.

72
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,290
Right.

73
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,620
They must want to talk by themselves.

74
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,810
Geunyoung.

75
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,070
You're here.

76
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,050
Where is Joon?

77
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,340
He's... inside.

78
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,770
Joon.

79
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,840
Let's go back.

80
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,820
Jihyang.

81
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,826
I'll call Jaejoon.

82
00:06:20,826 --> 00:06:21,940
Don't.

83
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,770
I'll call him later.

84
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,790
Since you are awake, we'll get going then.

85
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,620
Let's go.

86
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,370
How do I leave her alone when she is sick?

87
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,067
So what then? You're going to care for her all night?

88
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,230
Then I... can stay here with her.

89
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,580
It's okay, Geunyoung.

90
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,620
Don't mind it.

91
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,360
We can't leave you alone.

92
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,110
I'll be here.

93
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,920
- Geunyoung. Still, I'll-- 
 - I'm sorry, Geunyoung.

94
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,290
Can you do that just for today? He has to go shoot something.

95
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,610
Sure. Get going.

96
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,540
Thank you.

97
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,130
- Jihyang. 
 - Let's go.

98
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,879
I'm sorry.

99
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,330
Does it make sense to leave them alone?

100
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,162
Any other way? I had no choice but to ask Geunyoung...

101
00:07:22,162 --> 00:07:26,120
And if the hospital calls you on a number only the two of you know, get rid of it.

102
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,210
Inhyung is trying hard not to do me harm.

103
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:33,900
We'll see what happens tomorrow and I'll call Jaejoon,

104
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,119
or she can take care of herself on her own,

105
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:38,270
so don't worry about it.

106
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:06,300
 â™« Please don't leave me â™« 

107
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:12,720
 â™« I'm just a small child â™« 

108
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:20,020
 â™« Do you want me to see me heartbroken? â™« 

109
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:25,250
 â™« I'm just a small... â™« 

110
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:30,930
 â™« ...a really small child â™« 

111
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,979
Just tell me if you need anything.

112
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:42,010
- Yes. 
 - Okay.

113
00:08:44,979 --> 00:08:48,020
We really see each other a lot.

114
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,920
I know.

115
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,090
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,670
For what?

117
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,470
I'm just someone who knows that you and Joon are close.

118
00:09:01,335 --> 00:09:03,765
There's that and...

119
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,990
About the leak...

120
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,979
Huh?

121
00:09:09,979 --> 00:09:13,560
I wasn't trying to have people blame you.

122
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,970
Then it was you?

123
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,460
Why did you do it?

124
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,330
I don't even know why I did it.

125
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,520
You must not understand me.

126
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,556
Did you want people to understand you by doing that?

127
00:09:31,556 --> 00:09:36,158
Did you not even think once about how it would hurt other people?

128
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,650
Other people...

129
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,520
Who are you worried about?

130
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,860
Joon?

131
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,480
Or... Jaejoon?

132
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,360
Everyone.

133
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,290
Including me. Jihyang, Jaejoon, Hoo Joon...

134
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:51,340
Everyone's in trouble because of you.

135
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,360
You said you don't know why you did it.

136
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,520
Before you go looking for what you want,

137
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:04,480
think about others and learn to understand them.

138
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:23,370
â™«  I just laugh but you don't even notice  â™«

139
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:30,880
â™«  Is this the person you broke up with yesterday?  â™«

140
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:37,880
â™«  I just thought if I spent all that time  â™«

141
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,060
â™«  Everything would be forgotten  â™«

142
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,470
Joon, the shoot is ready.

143
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,320
Yes.

144
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:51,880
â™«  It blows like the wind in my heart  â™«

145
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,430
 I'm sorry. 

146
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,240
â™«  It flows and comes to me like a river  â™«

147
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,400
 Why do you keep saying sorry? 

148
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,050
 You don't even know how I feel. 

149
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:07,460
â™«  A love that I can't go back and forget  â™«

150
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:13,960
â™«  It's blowing, blowing in my chest  â™«

151
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,440
 Your meal is ready. 

152
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,460
Enjoy your meal.

153
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,960
You should eat, even if you don't want to.

154
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,810
Are you still mad at me?

155
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,100
Or are you okay now?

156
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,380
So you know you made me mad.

157
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,670
I must have a knack for that,

158
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,912
for making people mad.

159
00:11:40,912 --> 00:11:42,990
I think you have other talents.

160
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,830
Making people look back.

161
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,710
Is it because you're pretty?

162
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,379
You can laugh right now?

163
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:52,480
You're also talented at that.

164
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,079
About that thing...

165
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:58,370
I just wanted to say I was sorry.

166
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:01,190
I don't know how to say sorry.

167
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,020
I'm sorry.

168
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,540
I don't really know your situation.

169
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,490
I didn't live a perfect life myself.

170
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,100
Anyway, it's okay.

171
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,090
To get what you want, you'll first need to get your strength.

172
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:18,290
So eat.

173
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,100
I'm here as your guardian at the moment.

174
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,270
So listen to me while I'm here.

175
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:31,130
You really have a knack for making me speechless.

176
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,379
I thought about what you said yesterday.

177
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,020
And I'm really frustrated with myself.

178
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,310
What do I really want?

179
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:44,000
You should find that out on your own, too.

180
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,570
Who am I giving advice to right now?

181
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,020
She's muddle-headed, isn't she?

182
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,540
How do you take someone else's phone?

183
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,900
 I'm worried about you. 

184
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,479
 You're not worried about Inhyung? 

185
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,820
   

186
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,679
Yes.

187
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,150
And the driver?

188
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,180
   

189
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,079
How are you going to handle this?

190
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,320
We put out articles saying it's only a pre-release production guide.

191
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,960
Let's think about whether we'll actually release it.

192
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,360
This...

193
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,200
Isn't this Lee Geunyoung?

194
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,310
Definitely not.

195
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,830
Definitely not?

196
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,600
How can you trust an anti-fan?

197
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,960
Thinking back on it now,

198
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,650
she was meeting with journalists to expose Hoo Joon's girl problems.

199
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,430
Back then, there was a misunderstanding.

200
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:47,340
We think that their trust has grown since they're on the show together.

201
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,000
Still.

202
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,606
- Keep your eye on her. 
 - Yes, sir.

203
00:15:51,606 --> 00:15:56,210
We stopped Joon from doing whatever the heck he wants.

204
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,070
We can't let some girl be a problem.

205
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,470
Make sure you manage him.

206
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,979
- Understand? 
 - Yes.

207
00:16:00,979 --> 00:16:04,870
Go meet up with the journalists and take care of this.

208
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,890
About Joon...

209
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,960
Why are you here?

210
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,546
Where's Joon?

211
00:16:12,546 --> 00:16:14,090
Hello?

212
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,550
Yes.  Yes...

213
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,570
Where have youâ€”

214
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,060
You okay?

215
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:37,568
You must've really been worried.

216
00:16:37,568 --> 00:16:39,260
What are you saying?

217
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,500
Never mind.

218
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,370
You just looked worried.

219
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,670
You're physically okay?

220
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,744
Don't do this ever again.

221
00:16:49,744 --> 00:16:51,500
What?

222
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,860
Being here like this?

223
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,979
Or...

224
00:16:54,979 --> 00:16:57,540
leaking your single?

225
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,380
You knew...

226
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,610
that it was me?

227
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,350
It may sound like an excuse,

228
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,579
but I just thought that

229
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:21,280
people might be interested in me just a little.

230
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,090
That was why.

231
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,420
In the end, nobody cared.

232
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,580
Why do you think that way?

233
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,540
You sang it well.

234
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,790
At least I got your attention.

235
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,479
So it wasn't a total failure.

236
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,460
I'm sorry.

237
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,258
To you...

238
00:17:46,258 --> 00:17:48,310
and to Geunyoung.

239
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:51,920
I really didn't think she'd be blamed for it.

240
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,475
I know.

241
00:17:53,475 --> 00:17:57,250
She got mad at me when I said sorry.

242
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,500
She's a great person.

243
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,150
Really understanding.

244
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,280
I'm not.

245
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,220
You were.

246
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,870
Back then.

247
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,270
Was I?

248
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,980
I don't even remember.

249
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,250
How I was.

250
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:21,900
Only you remember how I used to be.

251
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,640
I didn't call Jaejoon.

252
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,270
Take good care of yourself.

253
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,460
I'm jealous of Geunyoung.

254
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,920
She saved you as "Yama."

255
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,879
I'm just a "Stranger."

256
00:18:45,879 --> 00:18:47,940
It's so depressing.

257
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,620
I sent that text earlier.

258
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,110
She took my phone and left hers here by mistake.

259
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,100
 Really? It really was Who Joon? 

260
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,470
 I'm pretty sure. 

261
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,220
 With the anti-fan? 

262
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,079
 I thought I saw someone like her, 

263
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:06,920
 but I just decided it couldn't be. 

264
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,870
 But there was also a guy who looked like Who Joon. 

265
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,970
 You can tell when you see them, 

266
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,830
 celebs have that aura. 

267
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,800
Sir.

268
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,579
I think I've got a scoop.

269
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,620
   

270
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,430
Why are you here?

271
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,430
I...

272
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:50,830
had some business here.

273
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,500
What brings you here Jaejoon?

274
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,500
Were you with Inhyung?

275
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,770
The hospital called me first.

276
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,500
I guess I was the last person she called.

277
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,179
Why didn't you call me?

278
00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:12,350
I was so flustered.

279
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,270
Listen to what I have to say first.

280
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:17,680
I don't know what Inhyung said, but I have to see her now.

281
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,420
So please try to understand.

282
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:23,140
I don't know why everyone just wants me to understand things.

283
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,320
I don't want to get between you,

284
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,350
but please just wait first.

285
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,679
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

286
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,300
Hey, let me go in first then.

287
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,279
I'll let her know that you're here.

288
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:37,520
I think she'll be surprised.

289
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:09,796
So we all... meet here.

290
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:16,680
But... how'd you know about this?

291
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,070
I knew because the hospital called me first and...

292
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:24,060
the last person she called was me.

293
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,440
I told you that.

294
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,420
So I... not knowing what to do, called him.

295
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,400
Geunyoung,

296
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,230
why didn't you call me first?

297
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,900
I just didn't know what to do.

298
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:42,140
Oh, right!  And he just happened to call at that time.

299
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,410
Right?

300
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,179
You can stop Geunyoung.

301
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,790
It just happened.

302
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,230
But... I don't think that's important.

303
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,490
It just happened?

304
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:58,630
   

305
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,579
You just happen to be the first person on her speed dial?

306
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:07,370
This isn't important?

307
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:09,160
What about you?

308
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,510
You just found out that your girl is in the hospital. Don't you think that is important?

309
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,190
Shouldn't you check if she's okay?

310
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,960
It sounds like you think I don't worry about her.

311
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,920
Do you think you're the only one who deserves to come and worry over her?

312
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,120
Stop it, everyone.

313
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,720
What's wrong?

314
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,870
Word must have gotten out.

315
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,210
Journalists are in the lobby.

316
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:32,125
That's good.

317
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,370
- I'll just tell them everything. 
 - You really want that?

318
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:36,260
Just go.

319
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:40,300
Nobody will care that I'm hospitalized anyways.

320
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,538
Inhyung, just stay still for now.

321
00:22:42,538 --> 00:22:46,270
Then first... let's get Geunyoung out.

322
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,220
And if she does?

323
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:56,660
How about... we do it like this?

324
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,820
I wonder if she got out all right.

325
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,580
Stop worrying about others.

326
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,250
You made me do it.

327
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:31,940
Fortunately, she got out fine.

328
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,650
You'll be okay?

329
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:38,400
I just need to lie in bed, eat, and sleep when I want to.

330
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,679
That's easy.

331
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,150
Worrying doesn't suit you.

332
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,370
You do worry me.

333
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,996
Yes, Heegeon.

334
00:23:51,996 --> 00:23:52,990
Thanks.

335
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,800
We'll be out in a sec.

336
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,240
Yes.

337
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,730
Thank you, Geunyoung.

338
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,650
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

339
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:10,580
Let's go.

340
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,070
It's time to brief them.

341
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,380
 (I have to go.) 

342
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,060
 (Bye.) 

343
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,866
It's Who Joon.

344
00:24:33,866 --> 00:24:35,980
Who Joon! Why are you here?

345
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,890
Who's in the hospital?

346
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:40,540
Lee Geunyoung has been hospitalized.

347
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,980
She must've been stressed quite a bit due to being blamed for the leak.

348
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,610
What she needs the most right now is absolute stability from extreme stress.

349
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,879
Therefore, she'd appreciate it if everyone would leave.

350
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:53,920
People point to Lee Geunyoung as the person behind the leak incident.

351
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,250
You're saying it's not her?

352
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,480
Yes.

353
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,210
I never even took the song to the shoot.

354
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:01,120
Or let her listen to it.

355
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,020
She's didn't have a reason or the means to leak it.

356
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:07,710
We're here to apologize to Lee Geunyoung

357
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,179
for causing her to be blamed for no reason.

358
00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:11,770
We're on good terms now.

359
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:17,760
Please refrain from blaming Lee Geunyoung for the leak from now on.

360
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,790
Thank you.

361
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,917
Then, who's behind the leak?

362
00:25:21,917 --> 00:25:24,830
   Is there any chance that Lee Geunyoung will get cut from the show because of this? 

363
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,470
  Is there any possibility that filming will start soon? 

364
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,750
 Please comment! 

365
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,870
I thought you were gone.

366
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,070
You aren't.

367
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:45,570
You wanted me gone and now you're surprised I'm not?

368
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:49,390
If I knew you'd let me, I would've been gone by now.

369
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:59,170
No matter how much you try to disappear, someone will contact you...

370
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:05,310
No matter how hard you try to keep them apart, they still seem to be somehow connected.

371
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:08,250
Did you keep in touch like this?

372
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,350
Stranger?

373
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,130
You asked him why you were saved as a "stranger"?

374
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:17,390
We didn't keep in touch.

375
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,270
I just had his number.

376
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,079
Why? Just why?

377
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,960
Why do you still have his number?

378
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,450
Oh. You just had him as your first person on speed dial because you thought you'd reach him before you die?

379
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:33,570
Aren't you tired of these conversations?

380
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:36,890
He doesn't even actually care.

381
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,920
What?

382
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,520
Because you think his feelings are elsewhere,

383
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,720
because you think someone else is more important to him,

384
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,250
you're feeling down?

385
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,610
Just stop it.

386
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:48,610
Stop what?

387
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:49,579
You stop it!

388
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:50,820
Let's really stop.

389
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,330
The contract and...

390
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:54,250
You and I...

391
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,518
Let's just stop seeing each other.

392
00:26:56,518 --> 00:26:58,550
Stop seeing each other?

393
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,100
Hey.

394
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:08,440
You're only sorry to Joon? Huh?

395
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,690
You always have been.

396
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:15,580
You only tried to get what you wanted from me.

397
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,390
I've given it some more thought.

398
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:26,350
I don't think I will just let you go.

399
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:30,579
So don't ever act impulsively again.

400
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,830
I told you.

401
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:38,579
Whatever decision you make, it'll be the wrong decision.

402
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,820
Hey!

403
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,812
You scared me.

404
00:27:58,812 --> 00:28:01,600
You just throw things at me now?

405
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,760
What the hell are you doing?

406
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,270
You didn't read the news? Didn't you block it?

407
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,020
Why were you at the hospital?

408
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,190
Are you Oh Inhyung's guardian?

409
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,150
It was Lee Geunyoung. You didn't read it?

410
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,579
Don't try to fool me!

411
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,990
I thought kicking Inhyung out would make you come to your senses.

412
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,600
Do you want me to get rid of her for good to that you'll come back to reality?

413
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,428
Do it.

414
00:28:27,428 --> 00:28:29,138
And see what I'll do.

415
00:28:29,138 --> 00:28:31,670
You've done nothing right.

416
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,070
Quit it with that kind of talk.

417
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:37,650
Don't treat us like objects that you can just throw away.

418
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,470
Fine.

419
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:41,390
You're afraid to be kicked to the curb, too.

420
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,650
That's how celebs are.

421
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:43,620
You know?

422
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,440
"It's tough. I don't have any freedom."

423
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,650
Ones who complain when they're popular,

424
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:51,612
they all miss the old times when people forgot about them.

425
00:28:51,612 --> 00:28:53,520
So get it together.

426
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:59,170
You'll learn someday... what it means to get it together.

427
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,760
That punk...

428
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:33,220
 Will I really miss this when I'm forgotten? 

429
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:39,750
   

430
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:44,670
I know it's you. Talk.

431
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:49,180
Calling me at this number, I guess I'll have to save you, too.

432
00:29:49,979 --> 00:29:53,606
You were hiding your other number like this?

433
00:29:53,606 --> 00:29:54,670
Why?

434
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:58,034
 Were you hoping that Inhyung would come back to you? 

435
00:29:58,034 --> 00:30:01,170
You have that little confidence in your own woman?

436
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,779
When you abandon her, I take her.

437
00:30:04,779 --> 00:30:07,570
When I abandon her, you take her.

438
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:10,870
 It's so funny when you think about it, right? 

439
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,832
Let me tell you again.

440
00:30:12,832 --> 00:30:16,190
- If you treat herâ”€
 - What will you do if I do?

441
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:20,240
From now on, I won't hold back.

442
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,330
Hold back?

443
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:25,240
You think you've been holding back till now?

444
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,290
Please stop it.

445
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:32,120
I tried to understand you until now but if you keep doing this...

446
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,620
there'll be nothing to understand.

447
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:40,052
With this number or another, I'll call when I need to.

448
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,610
 Wait. Wait! 

449
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:58,390
 Stop right now! 

450
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,780
  - Where is it? 
 - Brake! 

451
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,790
 - I told you to brake! 
 - Oh my god! 

452
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:03,740
Is it fun?

453
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,770
I'm done.

454
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,166
What the?

455
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:09,779
You still haven't gone home...?

456
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:11,306
Of course.

457
00:31:11,306 --> 00:31:12,330
It's late.

458
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,570
Let's go. Let me take you home.

459
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:14,580
What?

460
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,790
You're not going to show me?

461
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,410
You don't trust me?

462
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,220
Let's go.

463
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,879
You trust a trustworthy person.

464
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:22,570
How can I trust you?

465
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:32,470
Let's just think that this was the right way for everyone.

466
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:36,110
Lee Geunyoung, mind your own business from now on.

467
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:39,270
Are you problem solver?

468
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:43,360
I'm bored, sleepy, and want to go home.

469
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:48,310
Yes.

470
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,979
Your pizza's here.

471
00:31:49,979 --> 00:31:52,570
Pizza?

472
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:55,579
I didn't order any pizza.

473
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,260
Then...

474
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,850
Did you order me?

475
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,079
How did you get here?

476
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:12,180
No one's outside?

477
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,779
Everyone left after I left.

478
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:15,820
Hungry? Let's eat pizza.

479
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,960
Wow. I was so hungry.

480
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,079
How did you come up with such a wonderful idea?

481
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:22,096
It's nothing extraordinary,

482
00:32:22,096 --> 00:32:23,290
but you should pat me on the head too.

483
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:26,020
But I actually wanted tteokbokki.

484
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:31,130
I guess I ordered the wrong thing.

485
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:34,070
Then shall we... make our escape?

486
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,979
Escape?

487
00:32:34,979 --> 00:32:36,910
Really?

488
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:39,970
Let's get you changed.

489
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:42,360
You're crazy.

490
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,010
I won't look.

491
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:46,570
- Seriously, I won't look. 
 - What? Get out. Go.

492
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,140
I said I won't look.

493
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:08,700
 â™« When it rains, it becomes your umbrella, 
and the shade on a hot day â™« 

494
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:14,779
 â™« Footsteps walking side by side with you â™« 

495
00:33:14,779 --> 00:33:19,140
 â™« There is nothing better than this â™« 

496
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:23,820
 â™« My heart that I couldn't tell youâ™« 

497
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:27,960
 â™« Now everybody knows â™« 

498
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,179
 â™« I love you â™« 

499
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:39,700
 â™« I want to reach the end of the world, 
 that my love is only you â™« 

500
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:45,200
 â™« I hold your hand casually...â™« 

501
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,700
Wow.

502
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:51,750
Wow. For real.

503
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:54,410
Home sweet home.

504
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,720
You seem to think this really is your house.

505
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,275
I probably know more about this house than you.

506
00:34:02,275 --> 00:34:05,030
Except for the second floor.

507
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:07,560
Then come up with me.

508
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,560
Really?

509
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,279
It's not that hard to do.

510
00:34:11,279 --> 00:34:12,406
Let's go.

511
00:34:12,406 --> 00:34:14,180
Really?

512
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,790
You're so happy.

513
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,710
What the?

514
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:29,070
It changes every day, the hiding spot.

515
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:35,970
â™«  How can you ever live life the best with everything 
 you love put to the test?  â™«

516
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,800
â™«  And when you need to get something off your chest, 
 I'm here for you  â™«

517
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:41,240
â™«  Here for you  â™«

518
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:45,180
â™«  Even if your up just lying awake, 
 and when you call me up just by mistake  â™«

519
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,230
What the?

520
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,590
â™«  I'll always just be a phone call away  â™«

521
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,790
â™«  I'm here for you, here for you  â™«

522
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:54,460
The room you've been keeping secret was a gaming room?

523
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,420
Do you know how valuable this is?

524
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,210
This is so nice.

525
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:01,920
From a journalist's point of view, this is boring.

526
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,170
Boring? Look at these.

527
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,110
You see these?

528
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,080
Those are important antiques.

529
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,284
As a journalist, my pride is hurt.

530
00:35:12,284 --> 00:35:14,040
- Wooden crafts? 
 - I made them myself.

531
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,679
- Really? 
 - A rabbit!

532
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,560
You did a good job.

533
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,230
â™«  I'm here for you  â™«

534
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,300
â™«  I'm here for you, here for you  â™«

535
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:24,750
So cute.

536
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,390
Same, right?

537
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:31,610
This child grew up to be Hoo Joon.

538
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,730
Little brat.

539
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:39,760
Oh. Your mom?

540
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,480
Yes.

541
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,920
She's so pretty.

542
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,970
What are you looking at?

543
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:03,780
Nothing.

544
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:19,060
Good job today.

545
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:19,979
Were you surprised?

546
00:36:19,979 --> 00:36:23,140
I didn't know Jaejoon would do that in front of you.

547
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:28,070
Even Jaejoon... must've been embarrassed.

548
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,379
By the way, were there times that you three were that close?

549
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:38,510
There was a time like that.

550
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:41,140
I thought all three of us would be forever...

551
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:47,240
We all hoped that we'd be big stars and everything would go well.

552
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,618
But you had your debut first?

553
00:36:50,618 --> 00:36:54,020
Yeah, but I was still an unknown.

554
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:57,646
Because of the fake life Youngseok made for me...

555
00:36:57,646 --> 00:37:01,679
I never dreamed that I would be loved so much.

556
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:06,570
You guys were so close.

557
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,580
What happened?

558
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:11,340
Everything Youngseok did succeeded.

559
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:14,210
So the company only focused on me.

560
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:18,120
Jaejoon and Inhyung who were about to have their debut...

561
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,760
were not a priority anymore.

562
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,099
Then after enduring it for so long,

563
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,776
Jaejoon finally... started his own company.

564
00:37:27,776 --> 00:37:30,370
And he tried to bring me along with him.

565
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:36,490
But I... couldn't do it.

566
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,420
Why not?

567
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,940
 I'm asking you to please wait a bit longer. 

568
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:45,750
 Can you just wait a few more days for the money for the surgery? 

569
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:47,130
 What? 

570
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,250
 What do you mean? Delay it? 

571
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,974
 You told me it needs to be done. 

572
00:37:51,974 --> 00:37:55,679
 You want me to take a sick child out of the hospital? 

573
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:58,120
 H-Hello? 

574
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,116
He didn't even have money for his kid's surgery.

575
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:06,620
He bet everything he had on me.

576
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,910
I just couldn't.

577
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,260
You should've told Jaejoon.

578
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:19,060
If you did, I don't think it would've come to this.

579
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:24,979
Those two had already made up their minds.

580
00:38:24,979 --> 00:38:27,746
I didn't want to burden them.

581
00:38:27,746 --> 00:38:29,850
I couldn't tell them.

582
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:39,240
By any chance... do you think he did it on purpose?

583
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,750
Because he hated you,

584
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,730
Jaejoon deliberately made Inhyung...

585
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:45,030
It couldn't have been.

586
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:47,790
The two must've had it rough.

587
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:51,850
And they must've counted on each other.

588
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:57,470
I was gone because of all the sudden shoots we did abroad.

589
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:00,100
It must've been hard for Inhyung.

590
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,860
Why?

591
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:16,720
I feel more comfortable now that I'm home, and suddenly I'm feeling sleepy.

592
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,770
I'll go to bed first.

593
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:42,880
 â™« Can you hear my heart? â™« 

594
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,450
 And what if she comes back? 

595
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,680
â™«  Can you see my words?  â™«

596
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,220
 I just can't ask you that question. 

597
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,520
â™«  On this cold and dark night  â™«

598
00:39:54,520 --> 00:40:01,780
 â™« I want to hear your warm voice â™« 

599
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:05,580
â™«  I can see that heart  â™«

600
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,120
 When you're nervous, 

601
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,979
 do you know I get scared? 

602
00:40:10,979 --> 00:40:16,820
 I don't want to lose anyone anymore. 

603
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:23,850
â™«  I can't sleep tonight  â™«

604
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:28,860
â™«  Because you're growing around me  â™«

605
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,610
Yes, Jihyang.

606
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:55,679
 Where are you? 

607
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:02,070
To be honest... I came home yesterdayâ€”

608
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,330
 With Joon right? 

609
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:06,110
Then by any chance...

610
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:08,350
is Joon there?

611
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:09,350
No.

612
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:12,690
He left after dropping me off.

613
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:15,179
Joon's not home and I can't reach him.

614
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:18,600
You can't reach him?

615
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,579
I think... he's been kidnapped.

616
00:41:22,579 --> 00:41:24,790
Kidnapped?

617
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,580
Oh. Jihyang.

618
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,718
Did you guys drink yesterday?

619
00:41:34,718 --> 00:41:36,138
A little...

620
00:41:36,138 --> 00:41:37,980
So he must've taken a taxi home.

621
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,330
You can see the taxi on the security camera,

622
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:42,510
but the license plate's not visible.

623
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:44,166
And then there's this.

624
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:46,550
His last text.

625
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,290
   

626
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,228
The cops will find him, right?

627
00:41:58,228 --> 00:42:01,970
We asked them to keep it private.

628
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:04,986
If they ask for ransom, it's a definite kidnapping.

629
00:42:04,986 --> 00:42:07,610
It's weird they haven't made any demands.

630
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:10,190
Call us right away if you hear something.

631
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:13,260
We'll do some more investigating.

632
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,860
- Thank you. 
 - Please.

633
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,120
I have to change his schedule and stop word from spreading.

634
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,650
You'll keep it low-key for a while?

635
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:25,150
Yes. This is serious.

636
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:28,180
If we hear nothing until tomorrow, we might have to go forward with it.

637
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:31,820
You get some rest. I'll go look around his house for some more clues.

638
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,730
No. I'll go with you.

639
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:36,350
Okay. Let's go.

640
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:43,648
We have to be quick.

641
00:42:43,648 --> 00:42:46,300
He said it was a fan.

642
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,370
Wait. The hat.

643
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:54,779
This hat.

644
00:42:54,779 --> 00:42:55,650
Is this sponsored?

645
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:57,870
No, it arrived by mail.

646
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:01,040
Joon thought it was shady since it had no address.

647
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,370
I think I saw this somewhere.

648
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:10,670
This hat.

649
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:12,110
I saw it on one of the fans.

650
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:13,710
What?

651
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,080
The "H!"

652
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,224
H. H. H!

653
00:43:19,224 --> 00:43:19,879
H?

654
00:43:19,879 --> 00:43:20,820
Hat!

655
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,440
I think he tried to say "hat."

656
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,432
It stopped at "h."

657
00:43:24,432 --> 00:43:27,450
   

658
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:29,870
A female fan kidnapped him then?

659
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:31,570
The fan was male.

660
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:33,420
Wait.

661
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:38,520
Yuri!

662
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,270
 Geunyoung. 

663
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:40,830
Why do you ignore my texts?

664
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:43,580
Have you seen this hat before?

665
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,270
That hat...

666
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:49,820
 One of his guy fans always wears it. 

667
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,170
 He said he'd gift it to him. 

668
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,580
-  He must have.  
 - Right.

669
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:55,440
So you know the guy with the hat?

670
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,650
 He's really famous among the fans. 

671
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:00,750
 A male fan of a male star. 

672
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:04,250
 And it's rare for male fans to show up every time. 

673
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,430
 Why do you ask? 

674
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:07,280
Is the TV station looking for that male fan?

675
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,228
 Will he be on TV with him? 

676
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:10,360
Can you say that I'm a guy?

677
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,190
No. It's not that. Don't worry.

678
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:16,910
Do you know his name or phone number?

679
00:44:19,979 --> 00:44:24,670
That guy... is working at a shipping company part-time.

680
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:28,640
 So he told us to give him the gifts to send since he can do it easily. 

681
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,070
 He said he'd deliver them safely. 

682
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:33,730
Okay, Yuri. Thanks.

683
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:36,400
Maybe he's working at this company.

684
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,898
Let's go.

685
00:44:37,898 --> 00:44:40,060
Bring the hat.

686
00:44:44,979 --> 00:44:46,000
What did they say?

687
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,620
He's out on his delivery run today.

688
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,570
The police checked his house and he's not there.

689
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:51,770
We should search where he's working.

690
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:53,520
Let's go.

691
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:59,290
Do you think it's because Joon didn't wear the hat he'd gifted?

692
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:02,550
That's no reason to kidnap someone.

693
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:04,150
That's how it is nowadays.

694
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:06,920
We have to pray nothing happened.

695
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:11,540
I shouldn't have sent him home like that...

696
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:17,690
This wouldn't have happened if he didn't go out so late.

697
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:20,540
Don't blame yourself. It's not your fault.

698
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:22,920
Even now, you're helping me.

699
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,210
If it weren't for you, the mailing company,

700
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:28,560
I wouldn't have ever thought of it.

701
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,930
Excuse me, this package here.

702
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:36,220
I got it earlier in the day.

703
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:46,600
He's not here yet.

704
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:52,470
Is that the courier company?

705
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,180
Right.

706
00:45:58,610 --> 00:46:00,579
Can you see?

707
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:03,120
I don't think it's him.

708
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,140
Let's wait.

709
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:12,320
It's the same company.

710
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,090
That man...

711
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:22,960
Right?

712
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:29,040
Hello. You're Kim Dahyeon, right?

713
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,279
Yes.

714
00:46:30,279 --> 00:46:32,622
I think it's him.

715
00:46:32,622 --> 00:46:33,520
Wait.

716
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,650
 Can you please check? 

717
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:37,590
 Oh, yes. 

718
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:39,600
Joon!

719
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:45,070
Let's go.

720
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:57,400
You're all surprised, right?

721
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:01,100
First of all, the package is yours, right?

722
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:03,670
Please check to make sure it's yours.

723
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:05,570
It can't go to anyone else.

724
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:11,332
The person who sent the package, also sent me here as part of the package.

725
00:47:11,332 --> 00:47:16,100
Along with the package he wanted me to make sure I say this.

726
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:21,562
Now... he wants to look at only one woman.

727
00:47:21,562 --> 00:47:23,890
And be by her side only.

728
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:27,080
He was very romantic.

729
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,390
He was, right?

730
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:34,080
Do you want to meet this romantic guy?

731
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,750
 Yes! 

732
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:36,720
Okay.

733
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,290
Then shall we... give him a round of applause?

734
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:07,640
Dahyeon, will you marry me?

735
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:21,900
Doyoung, you should put this on me.

736
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,852
Should I do it myself?

737
00:48:23,852 --> 00:48:25,490
Right.

738
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,879
There's not another man like this in the world.

739
00:48:39,879 --> 00:48:47,430
I think she's found the one who will stay by her side, through thick and thin.

740
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:59,779
 â™« I wonder what is love â™« 

741
00:48:59,779 --> 00:49:04,200
 â™« I wanna know what is love â™« 

742
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:08,350
â™«  Your lovely look  â™«

743
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:12,420
â™«  What is this taste?  â™«

744
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:16,540
 â™« I wonder what is love â™« 

745
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:21,270
â™«  There is no answer, it's just a question  â™«

746
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:27,400
â™«  Are you falling in love too?  â™«

747
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,720
 â™« Love, I've been looking the whole time â™« 

748
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:37,920
â™«  Then you appear out of nowhere  â™«

749
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:46,400
 â™« Love, keeps getting bigger and bigger â™« 

750
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,440
â™«  When I think of you once in a while  â™«

751
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:55,150
â™«  I wonder if this is what love is  â™«

752
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:59,170
 â™« I think I like you â™« 

753
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:01,080
 â™« I do â™« 

754
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,390
 â™« Yeah, I do â™« 

755
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:05,170
 â™« I wonder what is love â™« 

756
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:08,020
I thought he'd reject me right away.

757
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:10,960
I did it without thinking.

758
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,300
She really loves you.

759
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:18,770
So going to your concerts made me into a fan myself.

760
00:50:20,179 --> 00:50:22,450
I have nothing.

761
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:26,390
Yet I wanted the proposal to be memorable.

762
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:28,500
You've helped me...

763
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,920
I'm so sorry and thankful.

764
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,070
Thank you.

765
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:33,290
No problem.

766
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:36,810
Make sure you guys have a happy life.

767
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:40,970
Let's go.

768
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,360
Be happy.

769
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,130
Thank you.

770
00:50:57,539 --> 00:51:02,219
He kidnapped me and started begging me.

771
00:51:02,219 --> 00:51:05,370
I had no other choice.

772
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:06,610
I'm sorry for not telling you.

773
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:09,070
I wanted to do it quickly then go home.

774
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:11,080
Be quiet.

775
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:29,062
Go rest.

776
00:51:29,062 --> 00:51:31,380
You, too.

777
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:34,080
Good job today, Jihyang.

778
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,120
Drive safely.

779
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:39,540
You must've been worried.

780
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:41,140
Why?

781
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:44,674
Just... your face.

782
00:51:44,674 --> 00:51:45,928
Never mind.

783
00:51:45,928 --> 00:51:47,480
Rest. Let's go.

784
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,470
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

785
00:51:55,470 --> 00:51:56,500
What about my face?

786
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:00,779
I think I've aged at least three years today because of you.

787
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:08,570
 Your face makes me want to stay. 

788
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:10,479
 You're staying at home, right? 

789
00:52:10,479 --> 00:52:12,870
 Let me console Jihyang. 

790
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:19,860
   

791
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:22,570
Hello?

792
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,220
What?

793
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:29,910
You're still mad?

794
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:32,800
You really have nothing to say?

795
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,800
What?

796
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,840
You and Geunyoung.

797
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:37,764
Joon,

798
00:52:37,764 --> 00:52:40,079
you are not obligated to tell me your love story.

799
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,960
Still, tell me how you feel at least.

800
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,250
I don't know how much I should interfere.

801
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:47,625
I don't want to make a mistake.

802
00:52:47,625 --> 00:52:51,740
You never knocked before anyways. (Never interfered)

803
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:54,690
Not to you,  but to Geunyoung.

804
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:02,910
We... are back to feeling awkward again.

805
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:04,980
Right.

806
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:09,680
I shouldn't have asked to see you.

807
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,900
You're uncomfortable with me.

808
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,310
I'm sorry.

809
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:15,890
It's not that.

810
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:19,620
I am a little confused though.

811
00:53:35,279 --> 00:53:39,750
I'm not bothering you, am I?

812
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:42,000
You do this for Inhyung, too?

813
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,320
You're so gentle.

814
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:47,460
I wonder why Inhyung always looks sad.

815
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:52,599
When I saw you at the hospital,

816
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:56,540
it made me wonder if I actually knew you.

817
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:59,140
I was mistaken, right?

818
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:03,530
Not totally.

819
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:07,590
Would you like some soju?

820
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:17,500
It's funny, but...

821
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,840
I was thinking about it and...

822
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:24,920
Joon must think that I'm bullying Inhyung.

823
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,430
But what about Joon?

824
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:29,330
Not only does he stay on my girl's mind,

825
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:31,894
he also stays in contact with her.

826
00:54:31,894 --> 00:54:35,596
Do I have to understand that as well?

827
00:54:35,596 --> 00:54:39,270
But they say there's nothing between them anymore.

828
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:40,520
You're too...

829
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,746
You believe them?

830
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:45,240
I guess that's why I like you.

831
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,362
You're so willing to believe.

832
00:54:48,362 --> 00:54:51,280
I thought maybe you'd believe me.

833
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:57,480
But... you've changed, too.

834
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:03,090
Just like everyone else... you only believe Joon?

835
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,350
It's not that.

836
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:10,060
If that's not the case, then...

837
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:14,720
can't you keep... being friends with me?

838
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:27,090
I... am a simple-minded person.

839
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:30,390
I don't want to get wrapped up in what's going on between you three

840
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:33,270
without knowing what's happening.

841
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:35,574
I don't want to make mistakes.

842
00:55:35,574 --> 00:55:39,000
I wanted to tell you that.

843
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,779
Okay.

844
00:55:40,779 --> 00:55:43,910
Sorry for getting you into this.

845
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:50,870
Shall we go now?

846
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:52,390
Let me take you home.

847
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:55,740
We're friends but I don't even know where you live.

848
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:58,284
Why should you?

849
00:55:58,284 --> 00:55:59,290
I mean...

850
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:00,960
You have to call a driver after drinking like this.

851
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,390
After this last shot, let's each find our own way home.

852
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:07,940
- You-- 
 - Cheers.

853
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:23,980
Joon.

854
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,480
You're a big star.

855
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,218
Be careful out on the street.

856
00:56:27,218 --> 00:56:31,179
What do you mean? I'm going inside now anyway.

857
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:34,270
By the way, I'll go to Japan tomorrow.

858
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:38,330
When I come back, let's meet those men from that reunion.

859
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:39,979
Yes. Have a good trip.

860
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:40,770
Good night.

861
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:42,730
Bye.

862
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:50,230
Come on. My shoes are untied.

863
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:52,920
Bye, Jihyang.

864
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,800
Bye.

865
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,770
Why are you here and not at home? You're going to make Jihyang worry.

866
00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:16,420
I told you to stay at home. Where have you been this late at night?

867
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:18,050
Do I have to report to you?

868
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:20,079
Report everything to me.

869
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:22,760
Never mind. Get in.

870
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,490
Where are we going?

871
00:57:24,490 --> 00:57:27,580
Just trust me and get in, okay?

872
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:36,430
Is it okay to travel this far?

873
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:38,400
You should've stayed at home today.

874
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,500
Why should I?

875
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:42,760
I wanted to come once before, but I wasn't able to.

876
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,079
You said you'd console Jihyang.

877
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:47,970
You worried him all day and now this?

878
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:49,779
I'm here because of you.

879
00:57:49,779 --> 00:57:51,320
What?

880
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,950
It's a nice breeze, you know?

881
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:57,930
I just didn't want you to worry him again.

882
00:57:57,930 --> 00:57:58,860
Are you my mother?

883
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:00,580
What's with all the nagging?

884
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:02,120
Even my mom didn't nag this much.

885
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:05,440
I'm just worried.

886
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,500
You're worried?

887
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:07,540
Why?

888
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:10,290
When I was gone, did you cry, like this?

889
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:11,770
Cry?

890
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:13,670
I didn't cry.

891
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:16,079
By the way, you said you were going home.

892
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:18,240
Where have you been?

893
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,660
Nowhere...

894
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:21,660
Just out.

895
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:22,830
You're avoiding the question.

896
00:58:22,830 --> 00:58:25,540
Are you my father now? Why so interrogative?

897
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:28,350
Even my father doesn't do this.

898
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:31,780
Always getting the last word.

899
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:33,860
Are there even fish here?

900
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:35,830
All you do is complain.

901
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:38,140
You have to be patient when fishing.

902
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:40,380
Don't you know patience is a virtue?

903
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:42,040
I just don't understand.

904
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,070
There are so many things in life that require patience.

905
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:45,650
Like what would you be waiting for?

906
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:47,700
I have a lot of things I'm waiting for.

907
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,570
A lifetime is just full of waiting.

908
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:51,080
A top star like you wouldn't know, right?

909
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:54,150
For example, waiting to get a promotion at work.

910
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:58,060
Waiting to buy your own house after working and saving money for years.

911
00:58:58,060 --> 00:58:58,810
What else?

912
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:02,480
Waiting for that one person who truly loves...

913
00:59:07,470 --> 00:59:11,420
Did you bring me here to teach me about the virtue of patience?

914
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:14,668
Aren't you waiting for something?

915
00:59:14,668 --> 00:59:16,225
Nope.

916
00:59:16,225 --> 00:59:18,520
You don't know what today is?

917
00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:20,940
What day is it?

918
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:23,330
You're expecting something now.

919
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:26,096
It's nothing much.

920
00:59:26,096 --> 00:59:27,520
Our show's third episode.

921
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,120
What the heck?

922
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:33,180
I not once ever waited for this.

923
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:35,870
God. It's on again.

924
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:38,820
It's better than watching it alone.

925
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:40,610
You'll be too stressed watching it alone.

926
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:41,710
Let's watch it together.

927
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:44,120
I don't have to.

928
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:50,970
Here.

929
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:56,920
 Shall we go, Geunyoung? 

930
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,820
This feels like it was yesterday.

931
00:59:58,820 --> 00:59:59,979
 Yes. 

932
00:59:59,979 --> 01:00:01,464
What?

933
01:00:01,464 --> 01:00:02,920
It's that day.

934
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,940
 Geunyoung, wait a minute. 

935
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:06,179
 Stop the car!  Stop the car! 

936
01:00:06,179 --> 01:00:07,590
 Brake! 

937
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:09,879
 Put the brakes on! 

938
01:00:09,879 --> 01:00:11,652
 I can't! 

939
01:00:11,652 --> 01:00:13,960
Wow. I didn't know they filmed that.

940
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:14,979
They did.

941
01:00:14,979 --> 01:00:15,710
What?

942
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:18,770
How can they put this on the show?

943
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:21,260
 Did you get hurt anywhere? 

944
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:23,732
This is a big problem.

945
01:00:23,732 --> 01:00:25,870
You think it's funny? Huh?

946
01:00:25,870 --> 01:00:27,330
They'll curse me again.

947
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:29,430
You wouldn't know how I feel.

948
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:32,120
Han, you bastard!

949
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,370
I'm calling him.

950
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:36,210
Hey. Hey.

951
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,370
Lee Geunyoung.

952
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,390
This isn't an accident.

 Are you dating, Geunyoung? 

965
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,330
 What? 

966
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:41,120
 Let's release that single officially. 

967
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:44,150
 I don't know if it's right to keep letting her stay there. 

968
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:48,360
 Stay here. I'll be good to you. 

969
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:49,480
 Change into this. 

970
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,320
 Why is this here? 

971
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,210
 I have to stay the night because I'm drunk. 

972
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:55,370
 The ring you picked up in Japan... 

973
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:57,040
 - ...it's my father's. 
 - What? 

974
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:03,390
 You know what happens to your precious Joon if I let this slip.
