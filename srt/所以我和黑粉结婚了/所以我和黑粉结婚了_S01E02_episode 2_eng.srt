1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,970


2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,350
   

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,420
   

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,930
   

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,820
   

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,640
   

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,990
   

8
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:53,370
   
   

9
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,600
Come on.

10
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,610
How come no one's calling me?

11
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,390
Hoo Joon's duplicity is an exclusive.

12
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,990
Move out of my way.

13
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,180
   

14
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,540
Are you regretting it now?

15
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,070
Regret what you've done to your mom's place.

16
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:39,470
Please go back.

17
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,340
My boyfriend will move in.

18
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,350
Are you getting married?

19
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,590
Do we have to?

20
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,540
This girl.  Seriously... Hey!

21
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,370
You think you're all grown up? At--

22
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,580
Shut up.

23
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,110
I'm fine on my own.

24
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,670
Please do the same for yourself.

25
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,590
Be good.

26
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,940
Bye.

27
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,800
Don't do anything stupid.

28
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:12,170
What's there to do?

29
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,670
Hello?

30
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,170
Are you a journalist?

31
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,070
- Enjoy. 
 - Thank you.

32
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,700
So this is what...

33
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,570
I should be doing?

34
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,470
What am I? A wreath?

35
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,570
Why do I always go to grand openings?

36
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:51,300
They just use my name.

37
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,500
Smile.

38
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,130
I'm chewing.

39
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,190
Hello.

40
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:05,620
It's an honor having you here.

41
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,170
May I take a photo?

42
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,520
- Huh? 
 - Okay.

43
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,020
And an autograph, please.

44
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,190
   

45
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:40,040
   

46
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:44,590
You're as witty as you are popular.

47
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,580
And on your way back,

48
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,570
we'll have some coffee ready for you.

49
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,420
No.

50
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,870
I can't just take them for free.

51
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,310
Great job today.

52
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,010
My card, please.

53
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,140
What?

54
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,070
For the coffee and lunch, right?

55
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,440
- 750 dollars. 
 - Here you go.

56
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,370
Okay.

57
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,720
This is the company card so we'll be reimbursed.

58
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,270
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you.

59
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,680
I saw the girl yesterday.

60
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,970
From Florence.

61
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,080
Florence?

62
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,600
Who's that?

63
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,400
The girl group that broke up before they were successful.

64
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,620
It was the pretty girl from there.

65
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,640
Her name was...

66
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,290
Inhyung or something.

67
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,000
She's now just squandering money.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,570
And it's her shady sponsor's money.

69
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,540
She was shopping at a mall.

70
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,420
That's probably true for all celebrities without fame.

71
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,330
I know.

72
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,460
They're gold diggers.

73
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,280
What the heck!

74
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,360
I'm sorry. My mistake.

75
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,390
I'll pay for your clothes.

76
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,330
You don't have to pay for them.

77
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,690
Just buy me a cup of coffee later.

78
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,500
Gold digger?

79
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,430
What?

80
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,990
My mistake. I'm sorry.

81
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,660
This is why you don't talk crap about someone.

82
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,190
What?

83
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,310
That is so low.

84
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,520
Thanks for letting me know.

85
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,040
We'll compensate.

86
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,870
We're sorry.

87
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,980
Please call us here.

88
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,420
Are you Choi Heegeon?

89
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,970
Hello, Geunyoung.

90
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,430
I'm Choi Heegeon from Attention.

91
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,480
I don't have a card.

92
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,960
   

93
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,070
We were in the same field.

94
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:03,290
I'll get right to the point.

95
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,270
Why did you throw your heel?

96
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:10,170
Because of Who Joon's duplicity?

97
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,890
Yes, exactly.

98
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,970
Since you told me the reason,

99
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,490
could you tell me about his duplicity?

100
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,540
So let's hear it.

101
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:27,910
The story begins at the grand opening of JJ's club.

102
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:32,180
 We were there to cover Who Joon. 

103
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:37,820
 Then Who Joon was with a woman. 

104
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,970
An exclusive, right?

105
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,030
Can you just walk away from it?

106
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:42,970
No.

107
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,870
 I was just watching because I was curious. 

108
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,210
 Who Joon saw me. 

109
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,070
He then smashed my camera...

110
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,320
You didn't explain it to him?

111
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,960
I tried.

112
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,110
But I'm not much of a drinker.

113
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,660
So I threw up a little bit.

114
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,400
Then he was going crazy.

115
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,670
And he said...

116
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,540
 ...because of trash like you. 

117
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,330
He called me trash.

118
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,870
What's more important...

119
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,670
is that he got me fired.

120
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,330
This duplicity of Who Joon.

121
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:25,050
I thought I should let the world see the truth.

122
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,370
What do you get out of it?

123
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,720
Reinstatement.

124
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,750
I don't think that will get your job back.

125
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,370
Huh?

126
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,420
Look.

127
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,070
A company that would reinstate you

128
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:45,110
wouldn't have fired you in the first place.

129
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,220
Are you crazy?

130
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,940
I just told you to have lunch there.

131
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,250
You bought everything there?

132
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,500
And picked a fight with a customer?

133
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,720
They were talking crap about a celebrity.

134
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,770
They weren't even talking about you.

135
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,000
What is it to you?

136
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,560
We're in the same industry.

137
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,910
I mean...

138
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:10,260
What's the need for mysticism if you keep doing this?

139
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,020
Why were you at the club?

140
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,040
Was it out of friendship?

141
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,600
I had no choice.

142
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,640
You say that a lot recently.

143
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,970
That's how you become obsolete.

144
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,590
Maybe you're talking for yourself.

145
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,290
If I do, you can just abandon me.

146
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,010
How dare you!

147
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,320
Do you think it was all you?

148
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,530
Every time you messed up, I was there to clean it all up.

149
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,410
Is that why you abandoned JJ and Inhyung?

150
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,580
To use me like a puppet?

151
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:58,530
If you're still not over it, get over it now.

152
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,960
You wouldn't have been here, otherwise.

153
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,370
You know all too well.

154
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,910
This version of me wouldn't have been here.

155
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:10,040
Only if you didn't abandon them like that.

156
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,570
Hoo Joon!

157
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,870
â‚©3,000.

158
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:50,620
 Lee claims to have been fired because of Who Joon. 

159
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,180
 Is Who Joon that capable? 

160
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:59,140
 She vented, but we wanted to know if what she knows is the truth. 

161
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:04,050
I wasn't venting. I just got emotional.

162
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,850
This guy...

163
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,100
Yes.

164
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,520
 The comments are crazy. 

165
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,920
The comments?

166
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,730
What do they say?

167
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,290
 Stop writing novels. 

168
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,570
 What a novel way to be an anti-fan. 

169
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:21,330
 She's definitely a gold digger. 

170
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:25,670
 Let's find out who she is. 

171
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,920
 Geunyoung, are you okay? 

172
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,790
Mijeong, I can't hold back anymore.

173
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,830
 Geunyoung. '

174
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,620
 Lee Geunyoung! 

175
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,870
Okay, okay, okay.  That's it.

176
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,990
Why did you want an IV all of sudden?

177
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,230
I've been tired.

178
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,220
I didn't want to collapse during the meeting.

179
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,360
Your meeting is at the publishing company.

180
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,220
What about the company?

181
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,580
Don't worry. She's not even there.

182
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,460
I don't know if you should thank yourself or our boss,

183
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,700
but she's been taken care of.

184
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,120
Taken care of?

185
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,620
She was fired?

186
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,350
That's what you wanted.

187
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,500
You're done.

188
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,470
Let me get the nurse.

189
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,890
They didn't have to fire her.

190
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,870
Long time, bro.

191
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,500
 Hey. 

192
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,760
 You read my story today? 

193
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,590
Yes, I did.

194
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,960
You should watch out for her.

195
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,700
She was pretty professional about it.

196
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,920
 I emailed Jihyang the email she sent me. 

197
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,180
Okay.

198
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,810
Thank you for always doing this for me.

199
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,370
Reporter Choi?

200
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,690
I wanted to give it to you later.

201
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,570
Here.

202
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,970
Yes, boss.

203
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,370
We're on the move.

204
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,950
Huh?  Yes.

205
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:49,970
Hey, Joon.

206
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,430
I guess the girl is making a scene.

207
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:55,550
Soohwan got you an interview.

208
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,770
Let's go to the office.

209
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:31,750
 I'll be the savior of the girls who don't know any better. 

210
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:47,140
   '

211
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,480
Who Joon, you double-faced man!

212
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,590
Wake up! Wake up!

213
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:18,680
I know what you've done!

214
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,150
Come out and ask for forgiveness!

215
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,900
Auntie, don't try to fabricate things.

216
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,190
Auntie?

217
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,710
Don't be so rude by speaking down to me. Kid.

218
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,900
Stay out of it.

219
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,440
Auntie, you stay out of it!

220
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,020
What are you even doing here?

221
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,420
 - I know! 
 - Get lost! 

222
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,580
You're the violent one.

223
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,570
I'm voicing my opinion as a citizen of a democratic country.

224
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,420
Then go to parliament.

225
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,990
Why pick a fight here?

226
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:55,750
Kids, do you think he cares that you're here?

227
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,110
He might get you fired if he could.

228
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,170
Be thankful that you're students.

229
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,810
Don't stay here.

230
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:06,420
Go home and cheer your parents up.

231
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,970
I don't have parents.

232
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,570
Huh?

233
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:20,570
Anyways, you're like ATM machines that buy his albums.

234
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,450
Right.

235
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,990
ATM machines with feelings though.

236
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,630
No, who says that?

237
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,620
Guys!

238
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,320
Crush her.

239
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,990
Who Joon is here!

240
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,570
Are you okay?

241
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,770
Guys.

242
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:28,770
Guys, this breaks my heart.

243
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,170
There are people who like me that like you.

244
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:39,360
But there are people who hate me as well.

245
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,810
 No! 

246
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,430
I think she...

247
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:49,080
is a fan who expresses herself in a unique way.

248
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:55,690
She hates me for her misunderstanding.

249
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,670
I'll be the first...

250
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,530
to embrace her.

251
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:13,840
I'll try so that she becomes my fan someday.

252
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,980
Have faith.

253
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,370
Let's go.

254
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,790
- Let's go. 
 - Where are we going?

255
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:30,670
Where are we going?

256
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,020
Let's just go first.

257
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,810
   

258
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:02,180
Let me talk to her for a second.

259
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,140
I'll close it.

260
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:13,870
Happy?

261
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,760
Well...

262
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,180
I did get your apology.

263
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,950
- My job... 
 - I thought you just needed an apology.

264
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,960
Now you're asking for more?

265
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,580
I thought you were going to embrace me.

266
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,450
Maybe you got fired because you suck?

267
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,560
You write when you don't even know the truth.

268
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,510
- You call yourself a journalist? 
 - Hey!

269
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,720
Were you always this volatile? Or are you having mood swings?

270
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,570
Also, without truly knowing me, why do you keep defining how I am supposed to be?

271
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:45,720
Yeah?

272
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:51,450
Is that why... you defined me with this crap?

273
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,730
He got me again.

274
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:21,180
Stop it. The weather is already blue.

275
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,060
Hey.

276
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:26,820
Hoo Joon is getting more popular by embracing an anti-fan.

277
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,960
My friend.

278
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,500
He was putting on another show.

279
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,390
It's like...

280
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:40,460
I'm hugging a large beehive.

281
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,620
Are you okay?

282
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:46,560
You definitely got stung.

283
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,170
I'll bring some water. Then we'll talk some more.

284
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,750
Hello?

285
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,870
 This is Wonder Woman. 

286
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:04,870
 Are you coming to settle your severance pay? 

287
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,120
Yes. I should go.

288
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,930
I should.

289
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:08,850
Definitely.

290
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,800
I'll be there.

291
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,620
I'll get it.

292
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,970
I'll be there.

293
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,960
Okay.

294
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:23,140
Don't go anywhere!

295
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,020
   

296
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,720
   

297
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,020
   

298
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,070
This is amazing.

299
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,280
Isn't that Geunyoung?

300
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:54,390
We'll try to get the interview as you want it.

301
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,750
Thank you.

302
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,220
No problem.

303
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:04,190
The girl who threw her heel at Hoo Joon?

304
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:08,330
I worked with her when that happened.

305
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:14,020
A lot of reporters are here to interview her ex-coworkers.

306
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,450
Goodness.

307
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,220
That's too bad.

308
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,710
Reporters are everywhere.

309
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,520
Lee Geunyoung, right?

310
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,540
Hoo Joon's giving you trouble?

311
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,650
How did you...

312
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,970
I saw you in front of my club.

313
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,840
I have your heel, too.

314
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,330
Really?

315
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,500
Thank you.

316
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:56,660
They say people change when they're famous.

317
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,210
You can't really trust them.

318
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,920
Did he treat you badly once he became a star?

319
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,920
He did.

320
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,460
I knew it.

321
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:09,100
He changes completely when he's not in front of fans.

322
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,000
Wow.

323
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,330
Embrace my anti-fan?

324
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,540
I knew he was up to something.

325
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,500
Are you... going to...

326
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,280
let it go?

327
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,420
I don't want to.

328
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,170
But there isn't much I can do.

329
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,620
Why not?

330
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,860
There are people rooting for you.

331
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,500
I'm sure there are.

332
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,350
I'm sure.

333
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,970
You have me.

334
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,540
Right.

335
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,080
See you next time.

336
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,660
I must've taken your time.

337
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,330
Bye.

338
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,390
Cool.

339
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,560
He's nice.

340
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,590
Lee Geunyoung!

341
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,690
Did you really get fired because of Who Joon?

342
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,370
Evidence?

343
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,870
Aren't you just a gold digger?

344
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:15,790
No.

345
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:18,980
It's the truth that Who Joon is involved with my layoff.

346
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,850
Who Joon said he'd embrace you.

347
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,520
Did you get compensated?

348
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,090
Compensated?

349
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:26,000
Aren't you listening?

350
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,500
I just told the truth.

351
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,110
Are you Who Joon's anti-fan?

352
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,840
Is that why?

353
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,570
Yes, I'm his anti-fan.

354
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:33,920
Yes, I am.

355
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:39,040
If knowing his duplicity and revealing it means I'm his anti-fan,

356
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,190
then yes. That's me.

357
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,430
Guys.

358
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:49,430
I know his other side better than anyone.

359
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:52,740
And I can also reveal it.

360
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,850
   

361
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,470
   

362
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,930
   

363
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,070
Lee Geunyoung...

364
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:15,980
Honey!

365
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,000
What?

366
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,270
Geunyoung, this brat!  My god.

367
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,170
What?

368
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:21,830
Geunyoung?

369
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,680
Why would she be in the newspaper?

370
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,770
Look here.

371
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:29,870
Hello?

372
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:33,790
 How dare you to answer your phone like that? 

373
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:37,180
I almost got a heart attack reading the paper.

374
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,470
 I didn't know you read the newspaper. 

375
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:41,310
What is this?

376
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,860
You know what?

377
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,270
I almost cut myself.

378
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,970
That hurts.

379
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:48,270
Mom.

380
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,870
At least it wasn't a headline.

381
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:51,220
 Anyways, 

382
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:55,870
if you got fired, come down here and pick apples.

383
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,070
I'll get rid of your place.

384
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:58,830
 Okay? 

385
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,170
No, Mom!

386
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,410
She's getting...

387
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,210
Mom?

388
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,480
I'm not your mom.

389
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,280
I'm a producer from GBC, Han Jaewon.

390
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,320
Is this Lee Geunyoung?

391
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,360
What's that?

392
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,310
The butterfly effect.

393
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:29,320
You... said you'll embrace your anti-fan.

394
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:38,310
   

395
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,270
   

396
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,520
You're crazy.

397
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,070
I'm not doing this.

398
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:52,000
You told me to come for this?

399
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,190
No...

400
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,540
It'll be fun!

401
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,980
Recently, there have been shows with stars.

402
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,470
This is unique.

403
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,760
You said we'd do it?

404
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,470
My gut feeling tells me that we should.

405
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:08,170
Just listen to me. It feels good.

406
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:11,580
They must've paid handsomely.

407
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,830
What now?

408
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,670
Are we producing it?

409
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:19,370
Or are they giving us deals for other stars?

410
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,820
You've really changed.

411
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,180
You know it well now.

412
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,140
We can do this.

413
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:41,700
You'll be doing the company and the rookies a favor.

414
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,680
Is this the wrong time?

415
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,870
What's wrong?

416
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,510
Nothing.

417
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:01,340
Your brother must be nervous to be on a reality show.

418
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,300
A reality show?

419
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,290
What about me?

420
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,230
I know.

421
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:09,870
Your brother needs to do a good job so that you can be on shows.

422
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,710
Right?

423
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,560
Lee Geunyoung.

424
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,640
Hello.

425
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,390
Nice to meet you.

426
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,570
We run a reality show.

427
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:33,980
A reality show?

428
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:37,030
I'm here for an interview.

429
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,130
Look.

430
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,580
So I married the anti-fan.

431
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,550
Marry?

432
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:48,790
I'm not ready to get married.

433
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,570
She's really something.

434
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,620
She's already surprised.

435
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:58,410
You'll live with him and try to understand each other.

436
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:03,160
And eventually, you become one!

437
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,770
I like that. Becoming one.

438
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:07,040
I can already picture the end scene.

439
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,170
Them holding hands,

440
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:12,240
- and the birdsâ€” 
 - Stop.

441
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,070
You've once burned 100 birds.

442
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,060
Four more.

443
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:22,460
As you know, you've become a symbol of the anti-fan.

444
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,020
It's not necessarily bad.

445
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:27,650
It can happen, right?

446
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,350
You're right.

447
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,470
That's why.

448
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:34,470
A high and mighty star lives with a normal person.

449
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:39,060
Is it better to get to know each other or not?

450
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:43,440
So what? I'm the anti-fan and Who Joon's the star?

451
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,370
Exactly.

452
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,530
It's Who Joon.

453
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,170
You want me to live with Who Joon?

454
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,260
Yes.

455
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:55,170
Didn't you declare war with him?

456
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:57,410
How will you beat him though?

457
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:58,290
Geunyoung,

458
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:02,120
you have to hit rock bottom and climb back up.

459
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,770
Okay?

460
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:09,360
I knew I hit rock bottom.

461
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,240
Not this low though.

462
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,290
There must be other anti-fans.

463
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,830
Look into them.

464
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:20,200
I'll make sure to watch the show.

465
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:25,470
We're paying you a lot.

466
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,520
All time high.

467
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,650
   

468
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:33,940
   

469
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,940
   

470
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,700
   

471
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,240
   

472
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,620
   

473
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,770
   

474
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:47,050
   

475
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,750
   

476
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:51,510
   

477
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:54,420
Hey, think about it realistically.

478
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,960
They're even paying you a lot.

479
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,580
Still. Living with him is a bit...

480
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,120
Don't you need money right now?

481
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,950
I do but...

482
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:07,020
That really makes me a gold digger.

483
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,670
Let's get more realistic now.

484
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:12,670
Realistically, you're leaving this place next week.

485
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:14,510
Next week? Why?

486
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:17,140
I told you my boyfriend is moving in.

487
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,970
Your mom is getting rid of your place.

488
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:22,440
She said, "Realistically, it's a waste of money."

489
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,970
I don't want to be realistic.

490
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,870
Accept the reality.

491
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,370
Who knows?

492
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:32,370
You might actually get some evidence on him.

493
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,720
That's an exclusive.

494
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,830
It might even get you reinstated.

495
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,820
Is that so?

496
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,410
No.

497
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,830
I know him by now.

498
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:46,730
On top of that, they're probably on his side.

499
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,020
They will just make me look stupid.

500
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,330
You're facing the reality.

501
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:54,720
Then, how will you beat him?

502
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,080
You'll see him by being on the show.

503
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,250
Who knows?

504
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,910
Many journalists get famous by being on TV.

505
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:05,570
Your life may turn around.

506
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:08,590
A turnaround?

507
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,190
If I get famous,

508
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:17,480
will people listen to me?

509
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,150
Sir.

510
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:25,220
I will...

511
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,460
give it a shot.

512
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,930
 You will? It'll be fun. 

513
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:32,500
But Who Joon's not doing it.

514
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,070
You're his anti-fan.

515
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:38,340
If Who Joon doesn't do it, then it's over.

516
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,990
So Who Joon just needs to say okay, right?

517
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:46,570
By when?

518
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,180
 Who is she? 

519
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,680
 An employee maybe? 

520
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,600
 What's your business here? 

521
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,570
I'm here to meet Who Joon.

522
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:01,470
 Please, call his manager. 

523
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,470
Hey!

524
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,970
Get out.

525
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:13,760
 The world is full of people. It's like being on the bus. 

526
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,390
 He was so hard to meet. 

527
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:22,170
 Do we really live in completely different worlds? 

528
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:36,510
 What's he looking at? 

529
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:39,070
 Never seen a bus full of people? 

530
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,000
 What the? 

531
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,550
 He's kind of familiar. 

532
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,730
 It's Hoo Joon! 

533
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,080
You sure Hoo Joon will be here?

534
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,100
I brought you here, but don't make a scene.

535
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,360
I never make a scene.

536
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:29,070
Don't worry about me.

537
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:31,020
Go do your job.

538
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,270
All right.

539
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,960
See you later.

540
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,370
Holy crap.

541
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:07,680
- Do it with me. 
 - What?

542
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,000
I mean...

543
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,070
You heard about the show, right?

544
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,950
Be on the show with me.

545
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,790
The show?

546
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:19,770
You actually said you'd do it?

547
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,370
I mean...

548
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:23,250
We are not friends.

549
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,830
But the show didn't sound bad.

550
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,800
What? You need money?

551
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:32,180
Yes.

552
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:35,070
I got nothing in my life because of you.

553
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:37,390
I got fired.

554
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:41,070
Women in the bathroom give me dirty looks and people treat me like a bug.  Because of the staring,

555
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,390
I can't even go outside.

556
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:45,270
So take responsibility.

557
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:48,600
If you're that confident, don't avoid me and take me on.

558
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,070
You got everything.

559
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:53,130
You could give me a chance.

560
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,510
Don't even dream about it.

561
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:20,270
I won't see you again ever.

562
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,940
I'll be right there.

563
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,530
Yes.

564
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,640
You got an official anti-fan.

565
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,160
Official.

566
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,350
Not everyone gets that title.

567
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:58,220
You're a huge star.

568
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,840
What I wonder is...

569
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,800
what happened that night?

570
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:22,200
I feel like you got caught.

571
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,720
That's why you embraced her.

572
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,000
Why care so much about an anti-fan?

573
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,780
I heard you're also doing a reality show with her?

574
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:36,180
They say she's not willing to do it.

575
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,130
So I thought, why don't we do it?

576
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,820
I'm talking about Inhyung, of course.

577
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,630
The one you know.

578
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:49,770
You don't know what the show is about?

579
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:52,170
You have to be an anti-fan.

580
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,480
You don't know it, right.

581
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,470
Inhyung hates you, too.

582
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,700
And what's more, she'll be much better than that journalist.

583
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,970
Do you have to talk like that?

584
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:06,350
To be honest,

585
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,090
it's not what you want either. Right?

586
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,470
This is just work.

587
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,710
Oh.

588
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:16,330
Is it uncomfortable with her?

589
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:17,390
You don't want to?

590
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:19,140
What if I don't?

591
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,570
You can't do that.

592
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:22,470
Let's make Inhyung famous.

593
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:25,570
It was once your wish as well.

594
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:28,580
Why don't you try it then?

595
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:32,200
I already have a meeting with the director.

596
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,310
Don't worry too much.

597
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,940
We'll make it happen.

598
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,140
Wait!

599
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,300
Jihyang! Whatever that nonsense, tell them I'll do it.

600
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,540
But only with that journalist.

601
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,290
Why all of sudden?

602
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:02,350
You don't have to.

603
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:04,070
It's fine.

604
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:06,670
I'll just make it a mess.

605
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:08,350
Take care.

606
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,410
You're not picking up?

607
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,600
Who is it?

608
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,770
PD Han Jaewon?

609
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:25,020
Just tell him I'm dead.

610
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,900
Hello?

611
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,670
Geunyoung is...

612
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:32,990
Okay.

613
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,830
Bye.

614
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:39,090
Hoo Joon said okay.

615
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:42,580
- He did? 
 - Yes.

616
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,560
I guess Hoo Joon is curious about you after all.

617
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,470
He's doing it now.

618
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,880
Here.

619
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,820
Read it and come in.

620
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,350
Lee Geunyoung, this is your last chance.

621
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:12,510
You can't live like this forever.

622
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:15,570
Let's get some evidence on him.

623
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:19,670
Shouldn't there be a clause on him if he causes me bodily harm?

624
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,760
Or...

625
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,750
what if he curses or hits me?

626
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:27,270
Emotional and physical damage...

627
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,440
You...

628
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,860
don't ever touch me again.

629
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,970
You both made a good decision.

630
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:23,120
Now that you have both signed, there's no turning back.

631
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,070
Yes, that's a contract violation now.

632
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:27,980
Then, there will be a cancellation charge.

633
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,600
My apologies.

634
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,380
I can't speak dishonestly.

635
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,520
She is a wild journalist.

636
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:36,810
Actually, it would be funny.

637
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,970
You guys fighting and calling it quits during the shoot.

638
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,890
Why would you say that? We haven't even started yet.

639
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:43,380
Are you kidding me? 
  (Literally: It's only a fart.) 

640
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:47,640
Things must be going well. I hear a lot of laughter.

641
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,250
The director is here.

642
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:52,510
Of course, there must be high expectations.

643
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:55,370
The entertainment department depends on it.

644
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,800
Take good care, please.

645
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,570
I will do my best.

646
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:05,060
Oh, you must be the anti-fan.

647
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,790
It's Lee Geunyoung.

648
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:10,020
Ms. Anti-fan, please take good care.

649
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,810
Wait a minute.

650
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:15,870
You two suit each other really well!

651
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:17,220
Director!

652
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,790
That's overdoing it.

653
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,560
They don't suit each other at all.

654
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,910
A complete lie... I'm sorry.

655
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:25,470
She's so honest.

656
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:27,370
You got caught lying though.

657
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:28,880
I know, right?

658
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:35,770
I have a meeting now. Take good care, everyone.

659
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,270
Now that we're about to film, how does it feel?

660
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:42,210
It'll be fun. Right?

661
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:45,650
Honestly, I don't even know what to do.

662
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:47,930
No worries.

663
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:51,370
You did your part when you declared yourself an anti-fan.

664
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:57,600
Just be yourself and find out who the real Hoo Joon is.

665
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,280
Look in front of you.

666
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:27,880
Wait.

667
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,070
Are we filming here?

668
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:32,560
I guess the boss offered this place.

669
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,510
I'll be back.

670
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,070
This is not happening.

671
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:43,430
Why is everyone doing this to me?

672
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,770
- You let them in without even asking me? 
 - Why?

673
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,350
 What do you mean, "Why?" 

674
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:56,000
You don't remember giving it to me?

675
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,830
I meant that the place is like yours.

676
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:01,020
It's not quite yours. It belongs to the company.

677
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,620
We never made the official transfer of ownership.

678
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:07,210
So you... lied to me.

679
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:10,380
You don't even live there. Who cares.

680
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,800
 Are you hiding something there? 

681
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:16,380
He hung up.

682
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:21,950
Joon, there is no other way. Let's just go in.

683
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:23,400
Come on.

684
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,170
Wow

685
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:52,610
It's so spacious here.

686
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,930
Look at the second floor.

687
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,720
The second floor is off-limits.

688
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,210
The show will only be shot on the first floor.

689
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:06,620
That's fine.

690
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:10,050
The second floor will be hard to work with.

691
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:11,220
Care to look?

692
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,920
- Yes. 
 - This way.

693
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:21,830
This is the bathroom.

694
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:24,180
Wow!

695
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,920
What in the world!

696
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,370
There is a personal sauna.

697
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:32,240
Joon really likes the sauna, so we built this place for him.

698
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,710
All for this sauna.

699
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:37,490
Such a cool house.

700
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:39,550
We're here to look.

701
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:42,310
Your house is amazing.

702
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:44,110
Thank you.

703
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:48,350
I guess people do live in places like this.

704
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:49,870
Does the house feel empty?

705
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:52,270
It's because no one really lives here.

706
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:58,720
We got off on the wrong foot, but please take care of Joon.

707
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,820
Who needs to take care of whom.

708
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:03,660
And since you don't have a manager,

709
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,750
if something happens, call me.

710
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:06,750
Are you crazy?

711
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:09,110
Why would you act as her manager?

712
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:11,520
He's doing that on purpose.

713
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,650
And just in case,

714
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:16,530
can I have your number?

715
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:20,120
People can be so different.

716
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,060
Pardon?

717
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:22,720
Yes? It was nothing.

718
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,870
I can hear you.

719
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:27,100
Feel free to look around.

720
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:34,150
This is what adults meant by making good friends.

721
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:36,510
You know I can hear you.

722
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:39,170
Even your study.

723
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:42,330
Your house is perfect.

724
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:44,300
All we need to do is film.

725
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:48,470
Producer, please do not expose the location.

726
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:51,380
The passcode is 0227.

727
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:52,670
Don't share that with anyone.

728
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:55,270
That shouldn't be a worry.

729
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:58,320
We'll have a meeting soon.

730
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,970
See you at the first shoot.

731
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:01,770
Geunyoung, will you leave now?

732
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:03,430
Yes, of course.

733
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:04,970
The house is nice.

734
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,160
But the air feels a little musky.

735
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:09,800
Does it?

736
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:17,310
Mijeong!

737
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:19,830
I finally signed the contract.

738
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:22,600
Oh, today was the moving day.

739
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,350
Did it go well?

740
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:26,080
Somewhat.

741
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,080
- Nice to meet you. 
 - Hello.

742
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,970
I was so out of it last time.

743
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:31,510
No worries, it was my fault.

744
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:34,560
It was my fault.

745
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,390
Oh right! Geunyoung,

746
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:38,410
I heard you're shooting a reality show.

747
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:42,710
I'm curious. Do you and Hoo Joon live together now?

748
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:44,770
No, we don't.

749
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:46,970
Why would I live with that jerk?

750
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,300
We don't actually live together.

751
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,600
I'm sure it's just a concept.

752
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,760
Adorable.

753
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,990
You're so adorable.

754
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:00,670
Shinhyuk is so naive.

755
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:05,730
He thought you guys would really live together.

756
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:09,250
They're actually filming in reality.

757
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:11,170
Look. Geunyoung, you too.

758
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:15,070
In other reality shows, the actors live together.

759
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:19,420
And... actors live together in "Three Three Meals," and all dating shows like "Love Signal" live in the same houseâ€”

760
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,170
Honey,

761
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:22,430
Instead of study,

762
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:24,740
you must have been watching TV.

763
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,720
No...

764
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,020
that's not what I've been doing.

765
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,770
I didn't watch any shows today.

766
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:34,570
Ah, I guess I should be getting ready to go now...

767
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:35,970
What do you mean?

768
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:38,080
You don't have a place to go.

769
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,270
You can live here.

770
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:41,540
Are you out of your mind?

771
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:44,040
It will be fun. The three of us.

772
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,370
Right, Shinhyuk?

773
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:46,870
Yes.

774
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:50,080
Of course! I'm staying here for free, too.

775
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,720
See. He's totally okay with it!

776
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,880
Shinhyuk would be so uncomfortable.

777
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,030
What would be uncomfortable?

778
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:59,220
We can sleep in the room together.

779
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:00,270
Room?

780
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:03,510
I meant us two.

781
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:05,470
And this guy in the living room.

782
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,500
Anyways, we're pulling an all-nighter.

783
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:14,700
Raise your glass. Cheers!

784
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,590
Cheers!

785
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:32,040
â™«  I wonder what is love  â™«

786
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:35,510
â™«  I want to know what is love  â™«

787
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:40,470
â™«  Your lovely look  â™«

788
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:44,870
â™«  What is this taste?  â™«

789
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:48,990
â™«  I wonder what is love  â™«

790
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:53,780
â™«  There is no answer, it's just a question  â™«

791
00:48:53,780 --> 00:49:01,790
â™«  Are you falling in love too?  â™«

792
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:03,420
â™«  Love  â™«

793
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,970
â™«  I've been looking the whole time  â™«

794
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:10,150
â™«  Then you appear out of nowhere  â™«

795
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,870
â™«  Love  â™«

796
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:19,020
â™«  Keep getting bigger and bigger  â™«

797
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:22,800
â™«  When I think of you once in a while  â™«

798
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,540
â™«  I wonder if this is what love is  â™«

799
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:31,600
â™«  I think I like you  â™«

800
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,410
â™«   I do  â™«

801
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:35,670
â™«  Yeah, I do  â™«

802
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:39,970
â™«  I wonder what is love  â™«

803
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:52,070
What the?

804
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:54,030
Are they still drinking?

805
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:58,620
I'm so happy to be living with you.

806
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:02,770
 Me too. I'm happy, too. 

807
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:05,680
 I can't live without you. 

808
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,350
 Me too. 

809
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:09,770
 I can't live without you either. 

810
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:12,430
 - Really? 
 - Really. 

811
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:13,890
 I'm like that, too. 

812
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:19,730
Honey, there are mosquitoes here. Should we go inside?

813
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:21,490
No.

814
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,820
 Geunyoung will wake up. 

815
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:27,470
 Then shall we sleep in the living room? 

816
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:28,970
 We can't do that either. 

817
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:33,000
 Geunyoung will turn off the light. 

818
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,220
 Tell her to leave. 

819
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:35,770
 No. 

820
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:38,350
 She has nowhere to go. 

821
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:41,850
 No, I was talking about the mosquito. 

822
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:43,340
 Go away, mosquitos. 

823
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,170
Hello, everyone.

824
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:47,390
How's the concert?

825
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:53,090
 I feel like I'm with all of my fans from around the globe. 

826
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:55,400
Are you guys having fun?

827
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:01,720
What everyone is curious about and wants to ask, could you write it down and send it to me?

828
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,660
Y. A. M. A.

829
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,110
Oh, Yama?

830
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:07,810
 You still haven't cracked it? 

831
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:09,390
I hope he tells us.

832
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:10,810
Please.

833
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:14,310
 I believe you can find out what it is. 

834
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:16,500
I'll go prepare for the next song.

835
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,840
Where are you going?

836
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,670
I'm not going anywhere.

837
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:42,110
I'll stay next to Mijeong.

838
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:43,700
Mijeong.

839
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:47,460
Mijeong.

840
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:49,590
Be happy.

841
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:25,320
Right. First...

842
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:28,040
let's just survive for a few days.

843
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:33,030
It's my house.

844
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,150
What the?

845
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,470
What?

846
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:53,570
She actually moved into my place?

847
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:54,970
When?

848
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:58,070
I'm not sure about that.

849
00:52:58,070 --> 00:53:00,830
 Why don't you call your mom? 

850
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:03,120
Are you serious, Mom?

851
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,970
I didn't tell you?

852
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:09,040
Man, I'm so forgetful nowadays.

853
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:12,270
Mom, you should've told me.

854
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:15,780
You can just come home.

855
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:17,540
 I got another job. 

856
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:20,100
So send my stuff back to Mijeong's. Okay?

857
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:22,270
This daughter of mine.

858
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:25,850
She has a temper just like her dad.

859
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:37,170
Leave Geunyoung's stuff alone. She wants it back.

860
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:40,640
Just clean up your stuff.

861
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,460
The storage is full of useless stuff.

862
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:48,890
Why do you think? You always shop impulsively, so there are too many.

863
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:53,470
I need them when I buy them.

864
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:57,090
Wherever I look there is an encyclopedia of "great men," are you saying we need all of them?

865
00:53:57,090 --> 00:53:59,750
I should just send it to Geunyoung.

866
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:04,520
 It's two months minimum. 

867
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:27,300
Oh my goodness.

868
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,150
What are you looking at?

869
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:32,080
You'll be better off at home.

870
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,740
I know.

871
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:36,320
I want to go home myself.

872
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:56,430
Yes.

873
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:58,000
 Where did you go? 

874
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,870
You don't even have electricity.

875
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:01,800
You'll wake everyone up.

876
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,810
You don't know that I've got friends.

877
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:08,330
Stop lying to me right now.

878
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:10,870
I'm serious.

879
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:12,560
To be honest,

880
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,470
I knew Shinhyuk would move in so I called someone.

881
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:18,520
I forgot to tell you about it.

882
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,220
 Really? 

883
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:21,020
Tell me her address and number then.

884
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:24,150
 I'm not a kid. 

885
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:28,070
So you be happy with Shinhyuk. Okay?

886
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:29,670
Still...

887
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:32,420
It's fun to live together.

888
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:34,900
You won't be comfortable there.

889
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:38,140
 You sure you have a place? 

890
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:40,870
I'm serious. Trust me.

891
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:41,890
 Okay. 

892
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:43,600
Call me if anything happens.

893
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:44,770
Okay.

894
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:47,540
Goodnight.

895
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:07,600
 He will make our hearts flutter. 

896
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:10,970
 It's the news of Who Joon. 

897
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:16,220
 He's going to be on a reality show. 

898
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:19,620
 It'll be the first time since his debut. 

899
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,310
 According to the producer, 

900
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:27,800
 when Who Joon embraced his anti-fan in front of his house, 

901
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,430
 he thought about the concept of this show. 

902
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:32,940
 That's why the title is called, 

903
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:37,480
 "So I Married The Anti-Fan." 

904
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,770
 Don't worry, guys. 

905
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:40,610
 In reality... 

906
00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:42,890
It's Who Joon's anti-fan!

907
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:04,970
How do they recognize me?

908
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,960
Why are you guys so loud?

909
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:36,320
I don't think so.

910
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:54,970
 Lee Geunyoung. 

911
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:58,750
 Now's not the time to be proud. 

912
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:01,310
 You'll be in the house in two days anyways. 

913
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:05,120
 Nobody will stop me from getting there sooner. 

914
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:45,470
Nobody is here, right?

915
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:50,270
What was the password?

916
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:56,140
 The password is 0227. 

917
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:58,120
 Only you two should know it. 

918
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,780
 It's open 

919
00:59:12,110 --> 00:59:13,710
Anybody there?

920
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:21,420
Nobody is here, right?

921
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:25,350
I'll just stay the night.

922
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:27,140
I told you.

923
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:28,600
Okay?

924
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:37,480
This is nice.

925
00:59:40,270 --> 00:59:41,970
I'm hungry.

926
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:51,640
Why is the empty fridge plugged in?

927
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:58,920
To my eventual safe night.

928
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:07,820
That's good.

929
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:15,870
What?

930
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:26,900
 It's closed. 

931
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,340
â™«  Looking at you looking  â™«

932
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:04,770
â™«  I know this is something, I wanna do it right   â™«

933
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:06,860
â™«  Do it right  â™«

934
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:08,880
â™«  And usually I move fast  â™«

935
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,920
â™«  But this I want it to last, I wanna do it right  â™«

936
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,660
â™«  Do it right  â™«

937
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:18,030
â™«  So I try to keep my patience  â™«

938
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:23,270
â™«  To make the best of it, but I'm still breathless  â™«

939
01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:25,890
 What's your relationship? 

940
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:28,100
 You're afraid I'll take her when you abandon her? 

941
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:30,490
 You know I get over things quickly. 

942
01:01:30,490 --> 01:01:32,620
 I also picked up a doll from the street. 

943
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:34,270
 I need to play with it. 

944
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:36,100
 We're shooting! 

945
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:37,520
 Let me ask you something. 

946
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,810
 How do you know Jaejoon? 

947
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:45,170
 Stop! Brake! 

948
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:47,140
 Stop trying to feel me up. 

949
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:49,270
 How is he nice in any way? 

950
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:52,090
 Please save me. 

951
01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:59,680
