1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,770


2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,350
   

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,220
   

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,930
   

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,720
   

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,520
   

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,890
   

8
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,270
   

9
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:51,640
   

10
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,470
- See you later. 
 - Let me watch you go.

11
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,120
 Then... 

12
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,010
Let me recharge my battery.

13
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:36,930
Hurry and go.

14
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,070
I'll really go then?

15
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,870
You'll be late.

16
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,990
That's right...

17
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,770
 You guys tricked me? 

18
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,180
Are you mad because we tricked you about Inhyung,

19
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,470
or is it...

20
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,080
because it is Inhyung?

21
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,970
What?

22
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,220
It's both, you punk.

23
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,060
Happy?

24
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,850
The concept of the song was an unknown, rookie singer anyways.

25
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,520
That's why it doesn't matter even if it's her.

26
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,340
She's a known rookie now.

27
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,430
She was at the same agency as Hoo Joon.

28
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,140
They shared the same pot of rice.  
  (Lived under the same roof.) 

29
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,313
You don't know how this is going to trace back to you?

30
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,560
That's good. It's not wrong.

31
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,310
Besides,

32
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,640
I didn't come this far without one or two bites. 
  (Having had a few scandals that didn't bring him down) 

33
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,680
Why do this? You're good at covering these up.

34
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,680
Right.

35
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,640
But...

36
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,060
it's because there's someone going crazy,

37
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,680
saying that he knows the truth.

38
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,370
Jaejoon, that bastard.

39
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,520
I should've cut ties with him from the beginning.

40
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,470
Sir.

41
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,640
Both Jaejoon and Inhyung were with you,

42
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,890
before you met me.

43
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:56,640
You bastard.

44
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,600
That's why you helped them all this time?

45
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,020
- And you tricked me? 
 - Just...

46
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,410
make it look like you generously let Inhyung feature on a song.

47
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,440
You're not the type of person who can't eat because you're afraid you'll get sick, right?

48
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,830
I'll go upstairs first.

49
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,820
Don't respond to the reporters one by one.

50
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,520
Before the word gets around that it's Inhyung,

51
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,920
cover it up with a new song.

52
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,820
Understood.

53
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,290
I'm leaving.

54
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,350
Gosh.

55
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,060
- Jihyang. 
 - Yes.

56
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,720
- Please do a good job. 
 - Yes, sir.

57
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,160
Good night, sir.

58
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,880
- He left? 
 - Yeah.

59
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,180
By the way,

60
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,770
why did Inhyung say she doesn't have an agency?

61
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,140
That probably made Jaejoon even madder.

62
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,720
Youngseok must've been flustered, too.

63
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,710
Jaejoon must've called him to rant.

64
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,140
He probably did.

65
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,100
Can you look into what's happening?

66
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,370
Okay.

67
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,720
And Joon, about the ring...

68
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,640
The group is meeting soon.

69
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,740
Really? Can you go just in case?

70
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,430
And about the ring...

71
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,670
- I found it. 
 - What?

72
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,130
Where?

73
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,090
There's someone...

74
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,620
who keeps finding it.

75
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,370
Hello?

76
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,600
Is everything okay?

77
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,680
 Why wouldn't it be? We just saw each other. 

78
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,560
You know, just checking.

79
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,770
What's wrong with your voice?

80
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,070
What's wrong with my voice?

81
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:08,035
I can see your expression by just hearing your voice.

82
00:06:08,075 --> 00:06:10,485
Something must be bothering you.

83
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,870
Yes.

84
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,720
I left...

85
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,870
Lee Geunyoung there.

86
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,890
Why?

87
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,900
Did your heart just melt because it was too sweet?

88
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,090
Good night.

89
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,690
Lee Geunyoung.

90
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,640
Good night.

91
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,070
What the heck?

92
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,970
Why did he call?

93
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,190
He must be crazy.

94
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,670
Ouch.

95
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,970
Did you look into the ring?

96
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,310
I asked around.

97
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,140
But it wasn't easy to find out.

98
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,930
But one of the friends had a photo.

99
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,850
So I'm trying to get that first.

100
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,270
Knowing his face would—

101
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,150
That person...

102
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,310
We have to find him no matter what.

103
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:14,970
Yes.

104
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,600
I'll let you know when I have.

105
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,230
Go.

106
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,070
The ring...

107
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,020
It must be important.

108
00:08:05,682 --> 00:08:07,210
Mom.

109
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,860
Do you know?

110
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,680
What it means?

111
00:08:20,948 --> 00:08:23,915
It's about time she picks up, just once.

112
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:34,740
   

113
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,270
Mr. Kim,

114
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,640
is this how it's going to be?

115
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,930
You were only supposed to select a rookie.

116
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,350
We're professionals here, sir.

117
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,140
If after we make her popular,

118
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,640
you sign the contract with her again. It's a win-win, right?

119
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,850
 Why? 

120
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,770
 The re-signing is completely off? 

121
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:09,970
Excuse me.

122
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,180
It's SP Group that invested.

123
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,140
And we want only rookies.

124
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,270
Huh?

125
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,620
Listen, even for SP...

126
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,130
the ultimate goal is ratings. No?

127
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,850
It was a business promise.

128
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,890
The investor doesn't want it.

129
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,060
Don't you know whose money you're using for the show?

130
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,060
 Mr. Choi. 

131
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,970
Right now,

132
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,470
our show is the number one trending topic.

133
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,560
 What's more. 

134
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,520
 If Oh Inhyung really doesn't have any potential, 

135
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,580
 she'll be voted out. 

136
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,470
 This kind of intimidation... 

137
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,380
I won't allow it.

138
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,730
I have a shoot. Bye.

139
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:45,890
Hello—

140
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,250
Hey—

141
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,820
Damn it!

142
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:00,860
You were training with Hoo Joon at the same agency.

143
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:05,580
How did it feel watching Hoo Joon becoming a top star?

144
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,680
Joon was always the ace even when we were training.

145
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,020
I expected he would succeed.

146
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,020
Still...

147
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,890
If it were me,

148
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,890
I wouldn't feel all that great.

149
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,640
Maybe it wasn't jealousy.

150
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,190
But still... you're only a human.

151
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,670
Your close friend is there becoming a top star...

152
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,800
It wasn't jealousy.

153
00:10:33,715 --> 00:10:34,695
That time...

154
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,890
Me being...

155
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:40,870
the only one spending so long as a trainee, I...

156
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,600
I'm sorry.

157
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,680
Don't be.

158
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,270
Is that why you hid the fact that you guys are close?

159
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:58,960
Rumor has it that you hid your friendship with Hoo Joon.

160
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,770
Maybe it's that...

161
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,460
You guys are in such different places.

162
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,570
Yes.

163
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:16,620
Because he's now in such a different position...

164
00:11:17,975 --> 00:11:22,125
That's why... our relationship has grown a bit awkward, I think.

165
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,270
Cut.

166
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,760
It's good.

167
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,270
Thank you for picking me, Producer.

168
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,430
No, thank you.

169
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:33,180
It's because you did well.

170
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,560
By the way,

171
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,310
an interview with Hoo Joon would be great for the show.

172
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,640
- Right? 
 - Yes.

173
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,680
Would that be possible?

174
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,020
It's fine if it's not, but

175
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,930
it would help solidify your position.

176
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,780
Right?

177
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,970
Yes.

178
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,470
Let me ask him.

179
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,600
Ask him and let us know.

180
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,140
Okay?

181
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:53,810
Yes.

182
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,310
Good job, everyone.

183
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,930
Good job!

184
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:02,160
- Good job. Give it to me. 
 - Here.

185
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,870
You said you'd get Hoo Joon or something.

186
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,050
Was that just empty talk?

187
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,340
It's still ongoing.

188
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,860
Okay.

189
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,970
If you've come all the way here just to ask that,

190
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,960
go back and wait.

191
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,170
About Oh Inhyung on that audition program—

192
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,180
Never mind that!

193
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,140
The producer didn't listen to me saying we only want rookies.

194
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:27,620
Do you think I came all the way here without understanding the circumstances?

195
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,560
That used-up rookie is now seeing the light of day.

196
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,275
How can you let her talk about canceling her contract!

197
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,580
Ugh, my throat hurts.

198
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,644
Who was the one who said to just "cut her out?"

199
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,560
The value of the commodity just increased.

200
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,470
Right.

201
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,310
That TV producer got it done immediately

202
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,470
what you couldn't for six years.

203
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,720
That nothing of a girl, do I have to take care of her contract myself?

204
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,350
Since she's nothing,

205
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,930
stop fussing over it and mind your own business.

206
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,470
I'll take care of it myself.

207
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:05,880
Do you know that nobody in the family expects that you'll take care of it?

208
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,820
This will be your last chance.

209
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,600
Let me give you one last piece of advice.

210
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,370
You're not in a position to think for others right now.

211
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,220
That bast—

212
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:01,020
 How about a get-together at the chicken place? 

213
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,420
Good!

214
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,970
What are you do—

215
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,470
   

216
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,310
Hey.

217
00:14:16,335 --> 00:14:19,515
What do you think about the tempo for this song?

218
00:14:19,515 --> 00:14:20,560
It's good.

219
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,430
   

220
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,970
What's good? It's messed up here.

221
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,970
   

222
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,900
   

223
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,770
   

224
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,470
   

225
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,120
What are you doing?

226
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,820
Wait a minute.

227
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,570
Hello?

228
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:43,020
Where are you going?

229
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,520
 Wow. 

230
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,560
 You're surprisingly obsessed with me. 

231
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,060
 Is that why you called me? 

232
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,470
Wow. This woman is unexpectedly pushy.

233
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,100
Then you aren't going to tell me who you're meeting?

234
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,490
It's an overdue get-together at Mijeong's chicken place. Happy?

235
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,250
Oh yeah?

236
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,130
It'd be nice to go together.

237
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,430
 The recording is taking a lot of time today. 

238
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,560
Next time then.

239
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,930
Let's go together next time.

240
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,930
 Okay. 

241
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,680
Don't drink too much. Okay?

242
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,310
Don't go home too late.

243
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,140
You'd better not smile in front of people.

244
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:16,040
I thought you were crazy busy today.

245
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,430
Stop nagging me and go work.

246
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,180
 Wow. 

247
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,270
I'm sad.

248
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,020
I'm not nagging, I'm worried.

249
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,270
 You're making me sad. 

250
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,310
Joon.

251
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,820
Come in.

252
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,750
I'll call you later.

253
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,040
   

254
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:07,810
 Your call has been forwarded... 

255
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,230
Lee Geunyoung.

256
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,610
Do you think avoiding me will make you two happy?

257
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:17,520
Even you take his side...

258
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,620
It's hard to see Geunyoung's face these days.

259
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,570
It feels like you're a celebrity now.

260
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,080
Not a celebrity.

261
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,970
By any chance,

262
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,390
are you dating someone?

263
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,100
What?

264
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,100
Hey.

265
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,560
I don't have the time.

266
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,430
Oh.

267
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,480
Shinhyuk, at this hour?

268
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,010
Shinhyuk, you're here!

269
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,370
Hi.

270
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,150
Honey,

271
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,670
are you done studying today?

272
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,350
Yes.

273
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,170
It was a very long day.

274
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,470
Geunyoung,

275
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,930
Hoo Joon's busy. Right?

276
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:52,680
Well, yeah.

277
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,930
I guess so.

278
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,100
She wouldn't know the details.

279
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,770
They're just on a show together.

280
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:01,560
Such top stars live differently from us.

281
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,540
Right, Geunyoung?

282
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,310
He's living such a cool life.

283
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,880
He's cool.

284
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,640
Oh!

285
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,600
Doesn't the show air today?

286
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,220
What?

287
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:12,930
Hey.

288
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,100
Don't put it on.

289
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,350
Let's watch it.

290
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,390
It's embarrassing.

291
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,880
It must be when you went to Japan.

292
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,610
   

293
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,650
   

294
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:35,270
Were you in Japan for his commercial?

295
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,890
That and other things.

296
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,520
That model...

297
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,350
Isn't she the one who got famous on that audition program?

298
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:45,020
She's so pretty. How was she not popular for so long?

299
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,430
You must've seen her in real life.

300
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,270
How is she?

301
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,220
Is she pretty?

302
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,520
Yes. She's pretty.

303
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,970
She looks the same in real life.

304
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,220
To play his love interest,

305
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,170
she must really be close to him.

306
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,890
I heard they were at the same agency.

307
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,310
Hoo Joon's agency?

308
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,680
Who is she?

309
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,180
The name is On Inhyung.

310
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,220
She's at JJ's agency.

311
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,060
Six years ago, she had her debut with a group called Florence but failed.

312
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,850
Recently, she was on an audition program

313
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:12,140
where it was revealed that she was at the same agency as Hoo Joon before her debut,

314
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,860
resulting in the attention she's currently getting.

315
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,940
You're amazing, Shinhyuk.

316
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,930
When did you memorize all that?

317
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,970
It's a wonder your memory doesn't help your studies.

318
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,370
Come on.

319
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,590
Mijeong.

320
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,500
I was thinking...

321
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,770
Should I try becoming a star?

322
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:33,600
What?

323
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,640
I mean...

324
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,680
I think I have the potential needed to be a celeb.

325
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,380
Potential.

326
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:40,850
Honey,

327
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,930
instead of potential,

328
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,450
what about your financial wealth?

329
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,140
Oh.

330
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,350
Wealth is nice.

331
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,390
Yes, wealth is nice.

332
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,770
Cheers to Shinhyuk's potential wealth.

333
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,170
Cheers.

334
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,020
I mean...

335
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,390
I want a cool life like Hoo Joon,

336
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,390
not a harsh life trying to pass an exam.

337
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:00,520
Stop joking around. Why do this in front of my friends?

338
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,310
I'm not joking. Why would I?

339
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,310
Then what?

340
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,300
What about all my time that I have invested in you?

341
00:19:07,695 --> 00:19:09,290
Invested?

342
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,610
Invested.

343
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,280
- That's not— 
 - I'm sorry. I'll get going first.

344
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,310
♫  Better get on it, we're gonna get on it  ♫

345
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:39,190
♫  And that now the chicken wins, the bitch isn't my thing  ♫

346
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,550
♫  We're gonna get on it  ♫

347
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,970
Oh Inhyung.

348
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:48,330
Trying to soar high on Hoo Joon's wings?

349
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,960
There's someone else who just can't watch that happen.

350
00:20:00,515 --> 00:20:02,655
You must be worried, Mr. Bae.

351
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,800
 What the hell are you up to? 

352
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,140
I mean...

353
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,720
You didn't even know about the commercial?

354
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,610
I don't feel comfortable with it either.

355
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:16,730
I think it'd be better for you to listen to what I have to say.

356
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,095
If you think I'm up to something,

357
00:20:19,095 --> 00:20:21,285
I'll just have it my way.

358
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:26,140
Maybe we laughed too hard when he was serious.

359
00:20:26,995 --> 00:20:27,995
You know,

360
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,170
being a prosecutor's girlfriend sounds cool,

361
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,520
but a celeb's girlfriend isn't so bad either?

362
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,390
Right, Geunyoung?

363
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,600
What?

364
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,800
Me?

365
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,800
I don't know.

366
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,870
Shouldn't you call him at least?

367
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,970
- It's— 
 -  You're drinking too much again. 

368
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:46,920
 Maybe go home now? 

369
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,270
 I'll be outside. 

370
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,350
It's already that time.

371
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,220
Leaving already?

372
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,170
Wow. It's so late.

373
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:03,100
Living in your colleague's house must be tough.

374
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,720
It's not that.

375
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,640
I forgot that I have a shoot tomorrow.

376
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,350
Okay.

377
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,970
You should go.

378
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,120
It's late.

379
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,385
I'll get going first.

380
00:21:13,385 --> 00:21:16,170
Make up with Shinhyuk.

381
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,100
- Should I get you a cab? 
 - No, thanks.

382
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,410
I can do it myself.

383
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,720
Stay inside, it's cold.

384
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,470
Bye.

385
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,020
Bye, guys.

386
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,770
You're not that drunk.

387
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,860
When did you come? Did you wait long?

388
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,500
You're here after work? Why is your phone turned off?

389
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,710
Did you eat?

390
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:57,370
So many questions. How did you hold back all day?

391
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:00,070
I had to come. You're drinking late at night.

392
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,510
There's a lot of people here. What if someone sees you?

393
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,110
- Shall we go? 
 - Yes.

394
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,910
So... did you and your friends have fun without me?

395
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,800
I thought you'd be drunk.

396
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,600
Remember Shinhyuk? Mijeong's boyfriend.

397
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,320
It was a mess today. Shinhyuk said he wants to be a celeb all of a sudden.

398
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,070
What?

399
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,080
He said he wanted to be my lawyer.

400
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,250
I know.

401
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,010
That's what everyone thought.

402
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,410
But now he says he wants to be a star. So Mijeong got mad and the two...

403
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:31,260
Wait. Is that something to get mad over?

404
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,110
What's wrong with a celeb, huh?

405
00:22:35,865 --> 00:22:38,155
But considering Shinhyuk's look...

406
00:22:38,155 --> 00:22:40,270
A celeb...

407
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,970
But you never know.

408
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,430
He could suddenly make it.

409
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:46,060
You never know.

410
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:50,090
I never guessed that we'd be in a relationship like this.

411
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:53,928
"A relationship like this?"

412
00:22:53,928 --> 00:22:55,380
Huh?

413
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,430
Well...

414
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:00,070
Late night...

415
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,090
Just us two...

416
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:04,070
Sitting here together...

417
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,320
So many stars.

418
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,140
You're right.

419
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,790
What?

420
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,980
Want me to pick that one for you?

421
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,250
Ew. Stop it.

422
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,170
Why? In "this" kind of relationship, I'd be like "I'll get that star for you!"

423
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:22,460
Ew. Don't do that. It's too cheesy.

424
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,480
Looking at...

425
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,810
twinkling stars like this...

426
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:31,920
reminds me of someone.

427
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:36,570
What the?

428
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,750
You're not looking at me like that because you don't know who, are you?

429
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,270
Who is it? Which jerk?

430
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:46,760
Did you want to be a shining star like that?

431
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:55,570
I didn't really want to shine.

432
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,350
I had to shine.

433
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,570
I got someone else's precious opportunity.

434
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:10,660
And as I tried to shine, I made so many mistakes.

435
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,870
Do you know that saying?

436
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,829
"To trick someone once...

437
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:17,827
you have to lie about at least seven other things..."

438
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,650
Once I started, there was no end to it.

439
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,310
From an American student...

440
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,270
to a son of a wealthy family.

441
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:30,861
Even my birthday, December 31st, is in line with year-end ceremonies, like fate.

442
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:32,450
Oh.

443
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,830
Did I tell you it was fake?

444
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:37,290
My real birthday is February 27th.

445
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,920
0227.

446
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,060
That's the passcode for the penthouse.

447
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,310
Right.

448
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:45,580
I set it as the passcode so I wouldn't forget it.

449
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:49,670
Because I might forget who I really am.

450
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:52,077
Well, it really doesn't matter.

451
00:24:52,077 --> 00:24:54,977
In reality, I'm a country boy from Alaska.

452
00:24:54,977 --> 00:24:56,921
Some kid who doesn't even know who his dad is.

453
00:24:56,921 --> 00:24:59,870
You're still... looking for your father?

454
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:05,470
All I know about my father... is the ring you found last time.

455
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:09,210
So Jihyang's going to the gathering with the people who made the rings.

456
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:12,620
Well then... you might find him.

457
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,560
Maybe.

458
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,480
But... I'm afraid of that too.

459
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:25,450
Like my mom and Inhyung... I might not be able to protect him.

460
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,230
Don't be afraid.

461
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:35,370
Your mom must know that it's not that you didn't try.

462
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,460
And Inhyung, too.

463
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:40,290
♫  I just thought if I spent all that time  ♫

464
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:44,850
♫  Everything would be forgotten  ♫

465
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,070
That's why now I have someone who I really want to protect.

466
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:51,310
♫  When I close my eyes  ♫

467
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:54,810
You're looking at me because you don't know?

468
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:59,120
By the way, I'm really curious.

469
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,240
Why is it you like me so much? Huh?

470
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,030
I've been thinking.

471
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,680
When you're next to me,

472
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,550
I don't feel insecure.

473
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,820
I feel so confident.

474
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,370
I'm just kidding.

475
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:13,300
Are there ever reasons for liking someone?

476
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,180
I just do.

477
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:18,520
♫  It flows and comes to me like a river  ♫

478
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:27,650
♫  A love that I can't go back and forget  ♫

479
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:33,370
♫  It's blowing, blowing in my chest  ♫

480
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,580
How long has it been?

481
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:46,360
You must've been in a hurry, CEO.

482
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,420
Still the same.

483
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,030
What crap are you up to?

484
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,330
Crap?

485
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:02,270
I told you it was an offer.

486
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,810
Do you think I don't know you?

487
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,330
Don't try to fool me.

488
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:08,310
Just quickly say what you have to, you bastard.

489
00:27:09,262 --> 00:27:10,992
Bastard...

490
00:27:10,992 --> 00:27:13,185
When did you get kicked out for not being a bastard?

491
00:27:13,185 --> 00:27:15,010
What?

492
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:15,980
Hey.

493
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,680
You're the one who ran away from home because you didn't like it.

494
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,400
You didn't want to see Joon get big.

495
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,460
You were so timid and ran away.

496
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:28,020
Get it together, sir.

497
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,170
So that you don't have to clean up after him

498
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:33,935
when Joon, your still-huge star, makes a fool of you.

499
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,770
You must not like how Joon's tied to the past either.

500
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:51,320
You must hope that he listens and just keeps making money.

501
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,690
Think about it.

502
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:54,970
In this business,

503
00:27:54,970 --> 00:28:00,430
how many people do you think... know about Joon and Inhyung?

504
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:04,400
You and me.

505
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,270
So what?

506
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:08,397
You're trying to expose them or what?

507
00:28:10,575 --> 00:28:12,330
We're in the same line of work.

508
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:15,110
You have looked down on me too much.

509
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,120
Hear me out.

510
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:21,645
When I expose them, what do you and I get out of it?

511
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,270
Even if word gets out,

512
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:27,670
Joon and Inhyung's, their value will drop.

513
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,480
Let's merge.

514
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:37,340
When their agencies become one, the rumors going around right now will die down.

515
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,620
It'll also shut me up.

516
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:46,050
You crazy bastard.

517
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:48,970
Is this the offer you talked about?

518
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:53,560
And do you think Joon's past is worth something?

519
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:59,370
Please don't... embarrass yourself by being stupid and rehashing old scandals before his debut.

520
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,250
Just take care of Inhyung well.

521
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,830
Okay?

522
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,180
Bye.

523
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,080
You are not in a position to say that.

524
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,570
Why do you think only I know about that?

525
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:32,160
We're here.

526
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,040
Get some rest.

527
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,600
Thank you.

528
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,460
By the way... about this place...

529
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,970
I'm moving out.

530
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:42,270
At first, I had my reasons.

531
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,770
But now I make money from the show.

532
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:44,970
Wait a minute.

533
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:45,690
No.

534
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,720
- What? 
 - No. I don't feel safe.

535
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,770
Just stay here.

536
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:49,970
What do you mean you don't feel safe?

537
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,830
Me staying here is more unsafe.

538
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,690
Let me just look for places first.

539
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:54,570
No.

540
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:55,710
Don't think about it.

541
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,890
See you tomorrow.

542
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:59,740
You're staying.

543
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,960
I'll think about it.

544
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,970
Drive safely.

545
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,270
Don't get out.

546
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,960
I'm scared you might run into people.

547
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,600
Bye.

548
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,930
Get some rest.

549
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,070
Why did he come back?

550
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,770
You did the laundry.

551
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,370
I... want to tell you before you get the wrong idea.

552
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:04,430
I'm staying here just for a little bit because of personal problems.

553
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:08,270
I told you last time we ran into each other at the office.

554
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:11,900
I said please take good care of Joon so his image isn't damaged.

555
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,360
Yes.

556
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:19,930
But... did I do him some harm?

557
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:23,280
A young man can surely date.

558
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:29,170
But if he's a top star, it's a different story.

559
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:34,200
A trivial love affair... doesn't end well.

560
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,310
A trivial...

561
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,370
That's a bit harsh.

562
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:42,040
Harsh?

563
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,110
Let me be a little more harsh.

564
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,500
Lee Geunyoung?

565
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:49,470
What did you think dating a top star would be like?

566
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:54,440
Do you want to see Joon... fall in an instant?

567
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:57,645
Well, Joon is like that.

568
00:31:57,645 --> 00:32:00,670
He just can't stay still if someone seems pitiful.

569
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:03,100
Just like he did to Inhyung.

570
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,370
Let me give you some advice.

571
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:08,960
Meet someone on your level.

572
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:17,970
I'm going to tell myself that you're worried about Hoo Joon...

573
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:21,210
That you're being harsh to protect him.

574
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:22,350
But...

575
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:26,890
you don't trust Hoo Joon at all even though you've known him longer than me?

576
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:29,090
Isn't it up to us

577
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:32,220
to decide what our relationship will be like?

578
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:36,820
You think you two can decide by yourselves?

579
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,700
All right.

580
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,750
Let's say he chose you, giving everything else up.

581
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,500
Then?

582
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,170
Will you two be happy?

583
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,470
What about him?

584
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,290
The public will turn away from him in an instant.

585
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:51,370
And Joon will have to bear all that.

586
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:55,210
Can you bear him like that?

587
00:33:03,285 --> 00:33:06,910
I feel like I got to know more about Joon today.

588
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:12,930
I'll get going, knowing that you will make the right decision on this.

589
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:16,270
If it were me, I would move out of this house after the shoot tomorrow.

590
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:19,120
Do you know how dangerous it is to stay in this house?

591
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,720
Tell me if you don't have a place to stay.

592
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,550
I'll go.

593
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,260
 The door is locked. 

594
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,940
You scared me.

595
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,540
What are you doing there?

596
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,960
What about you?

597
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,670
He said you left the recording studio earlier.

598
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:08,600
I went for a drive.

599
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,540
What is it?

600
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,390
Is something wrong?

601
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,620
Joon, about the ring...

602
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:26,620
I went to see them and no one was keeping in touch with him.

603
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,580
After graduation, there was talk about his marriage.

604
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,810
After he went abroad, he didn't keep in touch.

605
00:34:35,932 --> 00:34:38,402
Do you think it was my mom?

606
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,210
Possibly.

607
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:44,010
I'll ask around more.

608
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:47,720
There may be someone who was close to him in college.

609
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:55,320
And... I got his old picture.

610
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:08,160
He's right.

611
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:12,670
I was going to move out anyways.

612
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:16,715
I'll move out after the shoot is over tomorrow.

613
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:26,730
With severance pay and the appearance fees, I should be able to get a studio apartment?

614
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,440
   

615
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:46,070
 I'll get going, knowing that you will make the right decision on this. 

616
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:50,570
Right.

617
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,350
Later.

618
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,940
I can tell him later.

619
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:17,720
♫  Baby, you~  I still love you  ♫

620
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:26,220
♫  Baby, you~ I'm still with you  ♫

621
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:32,420
♫  I'm in the cold, girl, I hold you close  ♫

622
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:36,350
♫  Oh where do we go from now  ♫

623
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:43,270
♫  Baby, you~  I'm still with you  ♫

624
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:46,220
It's the last time for this place, too.

625
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,720
Good. I don't have to hide anymore.

626
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,090
Goodbye.

627
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,940
Take care.

628
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:01,750
It's my first time getting attached to an emergency exit, too.

629
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,070
- Hello. 
 - You're here.

630
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,770
- Hello. 
 - You're here.

631
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,350
Baby.

632
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:22,890
Is something wrong?

633
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,900
You don't look well.

634
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,020
I'm fine.

635
00:37:35,932 --> 00:37:38,422
 (Are you okay?) 

636
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,200
What's up?

637
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,360
You scared me.

638
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,360
Thinking about me?

639
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,170
Someone will hear you.

640
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,660
No one's here.

641
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,770
Did you see this?

642
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:22,980
All the articles about Oh Inhyung.

643
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:23,860
See?

644
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,500
My hunch was right.

645
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,400
I told you it'll become a hot topic.

646
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:32,570
What kind of hunch do you get about us?

647
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,670
I said stop.

648
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,310
You like it, too.

649
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,370
What?

650
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,170
What?

651
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:46,390
Hey!

652
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,900
How long have you been standing there?

653
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,610
I j-j-just got here.

654
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:56,430
The cast is on standby.

655
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,600
Let's go then.

656
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,520
You better watch out.

657
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,350
Sorry.

658
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:22,040
 Can you open the door? 

659
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,330
 Hang in there, Lee Geunyoung. 

660
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:27,750
 You'll miss all this when it passes. 

661
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:31,310
 Are you drunk? 

662
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:35,770
 Every time I'm about to say something nice, you always let the steam out.. 

663
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:44,560
What is it?

664
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,730
It's nothing.

665
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:54,400
We're all ready. Please wrap it up.

666
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,290
What should we do today?

667
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,210
Anything you want to do?

668
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:05,270
Well, there's nothing that we can really do at home anymore.

669
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,670
Maybe we should've gone on a trip before it gets colder.

670
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,160
Let's go then.

671
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,610
- Right now? 
 - Yes.

672
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:11,870
Isn't that what trips are all about?

673
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:12,920
That's true but...

674
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,140
You two okay with it?

675
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,590
Well... yes.

676
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,290
Well... yeah.

677
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,290
Well then.

678
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:22,170
Ms. Noh, please talk with Geunyoung about where to go.

679
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:26,120
And Joon... have a word with me?

680
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,330
For real.

681
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:38,960
He's good at making people flustered.

682
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,360
Isn't he?

683
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,840
He is.

684
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,710
What did you want to talk about?

685
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:47,590
You didn't hear it yet, right?

686
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:49,120
About what?

687
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:52,670
To be honest, today will be our last shoot.

688
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:54,130
What?

689
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:55,580
What are you talking about all of sudden?

690
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,730
Is there a problem?

691
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:00,575
No. Not so much a problem, but...

692
00:41:00,575 --> 00:41:03,385
I think it's partly scheduling and...

693
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,410
partly the higher ups.

694
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:10,210
Well, I'm flustered, but there's nothing we can do.

695
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:12,520
Does Lee Geunyoung know?

696
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,800
So what I wanted to tell you was...

697
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:20,060
Where should we go?

698
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:24,140
Geunyoung.

699
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,190
- Yes? 
 - Why do you look like that?

700
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:28,110
Did you want to do something here?

701
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,330
No.

702
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:31,910
That's true.

703
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:36,390
I'm sure you have gotten tired of this house.

704
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:37,620
It must be frustrating.

705
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,180
How about going to the beach? Huh?

706
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,720
Sure.

707
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,970
Just a second.

708
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:51,770
You're right.

709
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:56,060
I'm sure I'll be tired of coming here...

710
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,640
 Geunyoung. 

711
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,710
 You're surprised right? 

712
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,930
 A video message... 

713
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:14,560
 I'm really embarrassed to do this... 

714
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,880
 Today, I... 

715
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,170
 have something to tell you. 

716
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:23,230
 I'm really sad but... 

717
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:29,370
 Today is the last shoot... for our show. 

718
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:32,230
 As we did the show together... 

719
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:35,770
 I feel like I've made it difficult for you. 

720
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,100
 I'm so sorry for that. 

721
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:40,730
 But... 

722
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:46,440
 I'll never forget all the moments we shared here together. 

723
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,575
 I don't know where to start... 

724
00:42:49,575 --> 00:42:51,570
 I'm sure of one thing. 

725
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:54,040
 I may have met you as my anti-fan, 

726
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,130
 but, in this moment, I... 

727
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,570
 am your fan, Geunyoung. 

728
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:06,890
 I will never forget all the time we spent together. 

729
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:35,740
From the bottom of my heart,

730
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,530
thank you, Geunyoung.

731
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:03,260
Why are you crying?

732
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,080
It's okay.

733
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:15,870
Why?

734
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:18,120
Why? Why do they want to end it so suddenly?

735
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:21,570
And besides that, why did you fool me, too?

736
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:23,680
I didn't fool you.

737
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,730
I just couldn't tell you.

738
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:27,460
Why not?

739
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:31,850
You know better than anyone the mindset I started this show with.

740
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:34,330
I know all that.

741
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:37,260
So how could I tell you that it's the last shoot?

742
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:40,250
Still, you should've told me first.

743
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:41,930
I'm sorry.

744
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,270
Next time, I'll tell you first, no matter what.

745
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:46,210
Forget it!

746
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:48,570
- Angry? 
 - Very.

747
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:50,930
So cute.

748
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:53,490
You must be out of your mind!

749
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,180
Let's go.

750
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,450
Let's go.

751
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:58,380
I'll promise you.

752
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:06,270
Mr. Han. Mr. Han?

753
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:10,560
   
   

754
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,210
What?

755
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:12,390
You know what.

756
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:14,390
The show went on for long enough.

757
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:16,010
You'll have a lot of work now

758
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:19,100
 for your new album and concerts. 

759
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,690
I've worked it out with the station, too.

760
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:26,170
At least once.... you could've talked with me.

761
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:30,120
Hello?

762
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:34,640
Joon.

763
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,320
- Let's finish the shoot and talk again. 
 - Okay.

764
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:48,770
Report everything outside of the official schedule to me.

765
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:51,220
Where he goes. Who he meets...

766
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:53,520
Everything.

767
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:57,960
Cut the tail before it gets too long.

768
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,730
Tie the feet before they walk all over you.

769
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:09,090
Why did you cry as if we're actually breaking up?

770
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:10,440
It's so embarrassing.

771
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,330
We shouldn't break up. Lee Geunyoung will be in trouble.

772
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:13,580
I was so surprised.

773
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:14,770
I had no idea.

774
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:15,750
Don't be sad.

775
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:16,890
It's good that it's over.

776
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:18,180
Let's go on dates without the cameras.

777
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,410
 Let's hurry up and get out of here. 

778
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,750
We'll roll the camera now.

779
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:28,960
Just follow the car in front.

780
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,130
Please be ready.

781
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:33,980
Shall we go now, Geunyoung?

782
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,470
Oh!

783
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:38,430
Seatbelts, of course.

784
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:41,400
We can't be in another accident.

785
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,330
 Go. 

786
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:52,720
   
   

787
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,460
Don't be so alarmed.

788
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:09,210
I'm not here to do anything.

789
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:16,070
You sent me content certification, but I'm doing my best for you.

790
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:18,720
What are you actually doing?

791
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:24,000
You're not one to keep your cool when Joon and I are involved.

792
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,460
Whatever your "best" is...

793
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:29,400
please don't do it. Do nothing.

794
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:32,220
Am I...

795
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:35,250
one to break the wings you desperately grew?

796
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:36,850
Hm?

797
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:38,720
And by the way,

798
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,790
people in the industry are putting you two together very well,

799
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:45,795
even without any help from me.

800
00:47:45,795 --> 00:47:47,980
It's making my mouth itch.  
  (Makes him want to tell all) 

801
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:49,970
What does that mean?

802
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:51,320
Don't you understand me?

803
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,940
Just quit getting involved and stop whatever you're doing.

804
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:56,310
Let me finish what I was saying.

805
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:58,130
I was thinking...

806
00:47:58,130 --> 00:47:59,970
Let's go back to the old days...

807
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:03,220
to Shooting Star where you, Joon, and I were all together.

808
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:07,270
Then all of us can get what we each want.

809
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:08,640
Think about it.

810
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,830
Joon is finally helping you now.

811
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:14,970
I can't just let this go to waste.

812
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:17,520
It's true for both you and me.

813
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:20,520
What?

814
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:23,220
You want to.

815
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:24,870
Think about it and tell me.

816
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:25,930
I'll help you.

817
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:26,930
You already helped.

818
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:31,730
It's not that... I learned nothing from you.

819
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:34,595
I learned

820
00:48:34,595 --> 00:48:40,370
how pathetic it is to try and catch up with others and fail.

821
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:44,620
Can you leave now?

822
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:49,580
If I want to catch up with all the fresh, young girls, I have no time for this.

823
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:11,620
 You were the one driving in the beginning. 

824
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:13,710
 I'm the one driving in the end. 

825
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:15,540
 Thinking about that day... 

826
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:16,750
It's the last time.

827
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:19,770
Let's have fun without caring about anyone else.

828
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:21,460
Okay?

829
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,290
Wow. It's nice.

830
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:47,290
It's nice.

831
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:50,330
It's good that we came, right?

832
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:53,000
Well since it's our last shoot,

833
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,770
please give us some sweetness, like you guys are really dating.

834
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:58,290
We didn't look that close?

835
00:49:58,290 --> 00:49:59,140
No.

836
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:01,390
Maybe a little, compared to the beginning.

837
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:04,755
But you guys are not necessarily sweet to each other.

838
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:08,920
What do we do now?

839
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:14,170
What do real couples... do at the beach?

840
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:16,430
Let's just try it.

841
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:27,960
You're telling me Inhyung is suing me?

842
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:40,330
Is this how far she'll go to cut ties with me?

843
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:46,390
Were you that sick of me?

844
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:54,020
It's not all that great.

845
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,470
I guess couples like it even when they're just walking together.

846
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:59,140
That's true.

847
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:01,600
If it's not all that great,

848
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,310
can't he make it all great?

849
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:07,390
I don't care how much they dislike each other,

850
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:10,170
can't they just act like a real couple in places like this?

851
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:12,100
Like... Bam. Hold hands.

852
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:12,770
Bam.

853
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:13,970
- Putting your— 
 - You two!

854
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:16,400
Hold hands...

855
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,820
They did.

856
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:25,770
It's okay.

857
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:31,790
I couldn't enjoy normal things like this.

858
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:34,180
Seeing it all from next to you,

859
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:38,500
I thought being popular and fancy wasn't all that great.

860
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,970
In terms of these things,

861
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:43,390
I was so confident that I never regretted it.

862
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:47,060
Thinking about it now,

863
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:48,950
I do have some regrets.

864
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:51,180
Everyone regrets things.

865
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:53,100
No one is perfect.

866
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:54,100
That's why now,

867
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,680
I won't do it anymore.

868
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,100
Someone said...

869
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,960
"Don't be afraid."

870
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,920
"All this will pass."

871
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:05,620
I'm hungry.

872
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,320
Aren't you hungry?

873
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,360
I was hungry for a while.

874
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,120
You are hungry, right?

875
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:13,180
Did you hear that Producer?

876
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:16,790
We're working here and you're not even feeding us?

877
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:18,020
Let's eat something first.

878
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:19,560
I heard you loud and clear.

879
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:21,220
Cut!

880
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:23,000
It's a cut!

881
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,070
Hurry! Hurry.

882
00:52:26,295 --> 00:52:27,115
No other clothes, right?

883
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:29,120
- Here— 
 - No. It's okay.

884
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:29,970
It's fine.

885
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:31,470
You'll catch a cold.

886
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:33,220
It's really fine though.

887
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:34,970
I'm not even a celebrity.

888
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:37,270
You'll catch a cold.

889
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:38,920
Yes.

890
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:44,600
It's the CEO of Spigen Entertainment.

891
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:45,310
Yes.

892
00:52:45,357 --> 00:52:47,557
- Send him in. 
 - Okay.

893
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,720
What brings you all the way here?

894
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,680
There's something urgent.

895
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,640
And you don't come when I tell you to.

896
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,360
Have a seat.

897
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,720
You're here because of Oh Inhyung's lawsuit?

898
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,640
What should we do?

899
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,970
Do you want to settle or continue?

900
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:12,390
It's a breach of contract.

901
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:16,690
Can I make her pay a hefty fine?

902
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:18,680
As I told you earlier,

903
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,350
it's not that kind of contract.

904
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:22,600
I'm your legal representative,

905
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,470
not your fixer to get what you want.

906
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:29,650
Are you always so uptight?

907
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:31,100
Sorry?

908
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,770
Let's put off the lawsuit for a while.

909
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:37,650
It's not like we're running short on time.

910
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:39,720
By the way,

911
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,720
what if someone were to get sued for exposing someone's past without evidence?

912
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,030
What would... happen?

913
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:50,470
That often happens in show business.

914
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:53,170
Who is it exactly?

915
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:54,220
Is it you?

916
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:54,970
No.

917
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:56,060
It's not me.

918
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:58,060
Let me look for precedent.

919
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:05,720
   

920
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:14,970
That...

921
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:17,100
What does that Latin there mean?

922
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,520
What?

923
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:21,890
Oh.

924
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:22,970
It's nothing.

925
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:25,850
It's just... a personal memory.

926
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:27,470
Oh.

927
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:29,035
I see.

928
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:41,760
- Let me give you some fishcake, too. 
 - Thank you.

929
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:48,970
Those two... are acting weird today.

930
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:51,100
Even if it's the last shoot,

931
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,850
why do they look so sad?

932
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:55,170
Is ordering tteokbokki so sad?

933
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:55,930
What?

934
00:54:55,930 --> 00:54:57,450
Why are you looking at me like that?

935
00:54:57,450 --> 00:54:58,140
Nothing.

936
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:02,290
Seeing you work hard makes you look so pretty.

937
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:03,770
What's wrong with you?

938
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:05,170
Am I the only one who felt it?

939
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:06,970
Thank you.

940
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,190
Okay...

941
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:13,170
Wait.

942
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,350
It's fine.

943
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:17,170
Come on.

944
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,310
How is it?

945
00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:23,360
Is it good?

946
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,310
It's yummy.

947
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:27,470
There's a really good tteokbokki place in Dangjin.

948
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:32,350
That place has really good tteokbokki.

949
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:34,350
- Let's go together some time. 
 - Dangjin?

950
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:35,970
I never heard of the place.

951
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:39,120
That place must've gotten so famous after you visited.

952
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,850
What's amazing is that

953
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:43,100
the owner there doesn't know who I am.

954
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:45,640
No way. How can she not know who you are?

955
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:46,720
I'm serious.

956
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,220
That's not important to her.

957
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:49,970
She only cares about her tteokbokki.

958
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:51,390
- Craftsmanship. 
 - Wow.

959
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,560
The place must really be amazing.

960
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,070
Why aren't you eating?

961
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:58,430
I feel full... just watching you eat.

962
00:55:58,430 --> 00:55:59,310
Let me feed you, too.

963
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:00,830
Say "ah."

964
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:03,890
Fishcake is so good!

965
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:04,970
Take one more bite.

966
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:06,020
It's so good.

967
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:07,020
- Oh yeah? 
 - Yeah.

968
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:09,510
- Together. 
 - "Ah."

969
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:10,850
Good job.

970
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:12,950
Ah!

971
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:16,670
Dangjin is famous for tteokbokki?

972
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:18,520
I don't really know about that.

973
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:21,680
But they are definitely weird today.

974
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,140
It's better than them fighting till the end.

975
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:26,250
Good job.

976
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:29,770
Look into this guy, too.

977
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:31,640
He's an attorney named Jo Haeyoon.

978
00:56:31,665 --> 00:56:33,575
I'll send his name card.

979
00:56:33,575 --> 00:56:36,710
And he's in his fifties...

980
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:39,560
 But one of the friends had a photo. 

981
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:42,690
 So I'm trying to get the photo first. 

982
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:48,020
Did you get the picture of the ring owner?

983
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:49,550
Yes.

984
00:57:15,545 --> 00:57:17,115
This is the end?

985
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,970
You're not adding something at the end?

986
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:22,060
"Thank you" means so much to me.

987
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:23,810
- I'm thankful for many things— 
 - Come on.

988
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:24,970
Give it to me.

989
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:27,020
- Give it to me. 
 - Why?

990
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:28,810
- It's— 
 - You'll write something weird.

991
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:31,320
- I won't. Trust me this once. 
 - No. No.

992
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,350
Hand it over.

993
00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:33,560
You'll hurt your hands.

994
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,490
Rather than this,

995
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:37,140
adding this...

996
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:39,520
like this...

997
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,640
I knew it.

998
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,430
Look. It's much better.

999
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:45,030
- It looks better. 
 - NO.

1000
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:46,810
Can you add your autograph?

1001
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:47,890
I will.

1002
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:50,810
Doing autographs like this my whole life is going to kill me.

1003
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:54,700
♫  Your lovely look  ♫

1004
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:58,900
♫  What is this taste?  ♫

1005
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:03,170
♫  I wonder what is love  ♫

1006
00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:07,970
♫  There is no answer, it's just a question  ♫

1007
00:58:07,970 --> 00:58:15,270
♫  Are you falling in love too?  ♫

1008
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:25,450
Coming to the beach in winter is pretty nice, too.

1009
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:27,090
Today...

1010
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:29,680
is our last day.

1011
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,060
It feels weird.

1012
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:31,930
Right?

1013
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:32,930
I know.

1014
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:34,380
Don't forget...

1015
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:36,770
about the time we spent together.

1016
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,170
How can I?

1017
00:58:40,212 --> 00:58:42,712
I had such a hard time.

1018
00:58:42,712 --> 00:58:44,500
You're right.

1019
00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:00,570
Thank you, really.

1020
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:04,220
Are you cold?

1021
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:06,285
Don't take it off for me.

1022
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:08,230
I hate that.

1023
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:09,970
I was trying to do this because it's cold.

1024
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:11,320
You're mistaken.

1025
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,140
Oh.

1026
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:13,220
I knew it.

1027
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:16,170
I was mistaken again.

1028
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:25,540


1029
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,370
Here.

1030
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:30,270
Not cold anymore, huh?

1031
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:33,720
I'm fine.

1032
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:39,570
They finally look like lovers.

1033
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:42,730
What a shot.

1034
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:47,520
Cut.

1035
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,810
That'll be it.

1036
00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:49,970
Good job, everyone.

1037
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:50,680
Jihyang.

1038
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:51,720
 Good job, everyone! 

1039
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,140
What's next on Joon's schedule?

1040
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:56,370
It's really over now.

1041
00:59:56,370 --> 00:59:59,410
Great job till the end.

1042
00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:01,220
This isn't the end.

1043
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:04,360
It's only the beginning now.

1044
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:14,820
♫  Baby, you~  I still love you  ♫

1045
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:23,310
♫  Baby, you~ I'm still with you  ♫

1046
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:29,130
♫  I'm in the cold, girl, I hold you close  ♫

1047
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:33,140
♫  Oh where do we go from now  ♫

1048
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:40,320
♫  Baby, you~  I'm still with you  ♫

1049
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:44,150
♫  With you  ♫

1050
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:52,500
♫  Girl, I remember...  ♫

1051
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:57,270
 You're hiring an intern, right? 

1052
01:00:57,270 --> 01:00:58,310
 Your delivery is here. 

1053
01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:00,560
 Which one hurts more? 

1054
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:04,280
 When I was ruining Inhyung or thinking about Lee Geunyoung now? 

1055
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:07,600
 Inside the laptop of Lee Geunyoung, Hoo Joon's anti-fan, 

1056
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:11,470
 Hoo Joon's duplicity was recorded. 

1057
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:13,680
 It's true that I wrote it. 

1058
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,680
 I'm so sorry. 

1059
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,810
 I acknowledge everything as of today. 

1060
01:01:17,835 --> 01:01:21,635
 And I'll wait... to humbly accept your decision. 

1061
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:29,850
