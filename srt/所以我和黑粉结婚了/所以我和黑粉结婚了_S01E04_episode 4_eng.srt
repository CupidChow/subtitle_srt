1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,770


2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,350
   

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,220
   

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,930
   

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,720
   

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,720
   

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,890
   

8
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:51,640
   
   

9
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,670
I really need to use the bathroom.

10
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,560
Okay.

11
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,520
His manager said to call if I need anything.

12
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,260
I really need something now.

13
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:32,140
Don't think about me for now and do...

14
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,414
He's been gone for a while.

15
00:01:36,414 --> 00:01:38,520
   

16
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,930
It must be important.

17
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,720
If you can excuse me,

18
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,470
can I take this call?

19
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,650
Sure.

20
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,560
 Please save me. 

21
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,040
 I'm in the penthouse. 

22
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,550
What should I do?

23
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,970
Sometimes stalking fans come to my house.

24
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,520
They must've set off the alarm.

25
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,310
My neighbors are going crazy.

26
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,190
I think I need to be there.

27
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,620
Okay, then. We'll call it a day.

28
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,226
Thank you for your time.

29
00:02:26,226 --> 00:02:31,060
I'll see you when the screenplay is done.

30
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,930
Thank you.

31
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,520
See you soon.

32
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,390
Let's focus.

33
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:39,070
Focus.

34
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,370
How dare she call.

35
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:56,560
Hey!

36
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,450
Why is he here?

37
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,579
Where is she?

38
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,040
Don't tell me she's not here.

39
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,390
Lee Geunyoung!

40
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,390
Lee Geunyoung.

41
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,310
This is embarrassing.

42
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,080
Is she kidding me?

43
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,030
Can you open it?

44
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,650
Open it, please.

45
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,470
You're not desperate enough

46
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,020
Hurry.

47
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,040
Open it.

48
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,570
It was an accident. Goodbye.

49
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,140
I don't know what to say.

50
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,190
Wow. I was about to die.

51
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,930
You're so dirty.

52
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:06,140
What is this?

53
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,330
I mean...

54
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,060
The staff came here all of sudden.

55
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,020
And I got locked out.

56
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,270
Yes.

57
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,320
It's nothing. I'll be there.

58
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,379
I'll tell you in person.

59
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,360
You.

60
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,250
I'll kill you if you get caught.

61
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,550
I almost died trying not to.

62
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:39,670
Shouldn't he at least ask if I'm okay?

63
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,830
What a rude punk!

64
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,620
I'm hungry.

65
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,520
 We need some of your things for the shoot tomorrow. 

66
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,760
 Just things you use daily. 

67
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,350
Hey.

68
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,810
I guess it actually is a reality show.

69
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,180
They're asking for your stuff.

70
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,640
The only thing fake is him.

71
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,750
Oh yeah. I have something.

72
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:18,070
Why did he send historical biographies?

73
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,720
You're really something.

74
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,850
What is this?

75
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,140
He's driving me crazy.

76
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,280
He must've bought them.

77
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,979
Can I just leave them here?

78
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:31,890
Nope. You can't. Never.

79
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,890
My room is already full of books.

80
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:37,140
You should gift it to Hoo Joon. He must have a biography of his own.

81
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,442
He'll like it.

82
00:05:38,442 --> 00:05:40,720
I'll just use them as ramen trivets.

83
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,642
Your friend's feeding you ramen?

84
00:05:43,642 --> 00:05:46,020
You sure you're comfortable there?

85
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,220
Of course.

86
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,550
I love it there.

87
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,979
How will I take all these?

88
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,310
Should I ask Shinhyuk to send them to you by mail?

89
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,566
Yes, that'd be better.

90
00:05:59,566 --> 00:06:01,060
Make sure I pay for it.

91
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,350
Okay.

92
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,979
Sir.

93
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:06,930
An entertainment news story about Hoo Joon.

94
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,979
He's doing a show with his anti-fan.

95
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:11,850
The first shoot is complete.

96
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:16,180
It didn't go smoothly. There was a minor car accident.

97
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,310
But Hoo Joon hasn't been on a variety show in a while.

98
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,660
So the attention...

99
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,720
So?

100
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:30,179
So we were having a meeting about putting you on a variety show as well.

101
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,130
Am I his copycat?

102
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:38,210
Please, let's be creative.

103
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,979
I'm counting on you.

104
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:41,890
Yes, sir.

105
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,379
How did you feel when you got the proposal?

106
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,640
It was original.

107
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,270
You were okay with it?

108
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,032
She's your anti-fan.

109
00:06:52,032 --> 00:06:56,324
First, I wanted to do something with my fans.

110
00:06:56,324 --> 00:06:57,430
Well,

111
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,510
an anti-fan is a fan after all.

112
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,270
Besides all that,

113
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,180
as I get close to people by being on this show,

114
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,140
I feel as if I could actually hold hands

115
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,350
with the people who don't like me.

116
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,390
Are those your expectations?

117
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,310
Yes, exactly.

118
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:16,020
I want to be someone you can connect with,

119
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,560
rather just some celebrity who's distant.

120
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,600
Like a real person.

121
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,270
How was the first shoot?

122
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:29,970
I've never been so surprised by anyone.

123
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:32,580
 Bull crap. 

124
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,680
 No luck. 

125
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,112
Hello.

126
00:07:37,112 --> 00:07:39,140
Is this everything?

127
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,730
I mailed it.

128
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,060
This is enough.

129
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,560
 Please prepare for the shoot. 

130
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,830
 We're done here. 

131
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,580
Welcome, Lee Geunyoung.

132
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,600
Come in.

133
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,350
 It's that smile. 

134
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,760
 He's a professional. 

135
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,590
 Then... 

136
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,870
Nice to see you.

137
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,890
Shall we unpack first?

138
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,470
What did you bring Geunyoung?

139
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,470
I brought...

140
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,770
You must really like your biographies.

141
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:50,890
Yes.

142
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:54,979
My dad bought them for me so I can be a great person myself.

143
00:08:54,979 --> 00:08:57,430
So I always read them.

144
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,350
You should too.

145
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,579
It'll help you sleep.

146
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,680
Socrates.

147
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,020
"Know yourself."

148
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,770
It's a good book.

149
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:11,510
I didn't pack much.

150
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,870
There's no way that woman is sane.

151
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,206
 My guitar and fan letters... 

152
00:09:18,206 --> 00:09:20,390
I've been writing songs.

153
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,560
So I play the guitar whenever I get inspired.

154
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,320
I want to play for my fans soon.

155
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,600
Whenever I'm down and exhausted,

156
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,760
reading the letters cheers me up.

157
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,400
You can never throw them away.

158
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,700
My number one treasure.

159
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,398
Awkward, right?

160
00:10:09,398 --> 00:10:12,270
Is there nothing you are curious about...

161
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,170
or want to say to me?

162
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,560
Shall we eat something?

163
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,920
We have nothing at...

164
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,320
...home. Don't you think?

165
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,970
The kitchen is so empty.

166
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,680
We can order food.

167
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,320
Don't you think so?

168
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,560
We just moved in.

169
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,890
Jajangmyeon maybe?

170
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,560
Sweet and sour pork, too.

171
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,970
Do you want it?

172
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,140
I'll order it.

173
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,690
Yes.

174
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,690
I pressed 11 instead of 1 on accident.

175
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,410
I meant to order one of each.

176
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,690
Geunyoung, you sure can shock people.

177
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,770
Come sit. Let's eat.

178
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,270
We do have something in common.

179
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:14,390
I just can't get people who pour the sauce on top.

180
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,840
You should've told me sooner.

181
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,670
I pour the sauce.

182
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,094
Geunyoung is really funny.

183
00:11:28,094 --> 00:11:31,810
Geunyoung, we don't even have each other's number.

184
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,900
Can I get your number?

185
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,120
Here.

186
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,600
 Do you want to die? 

187
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,260
Enjoy your food.

188
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,520
   

189
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,770
   

190
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,930
   

191
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,210
   

192
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,640
Cut.

193
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,140
Let's eat, too.

194
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:25,980
It's a cut. Let's clear away the gear and eat.

195
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,979
You can have these.

196
00:12:29,979 --> 00:12:31,810
We're eating out.

197
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,070
You were really funny.

198
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,890
You can get some rest while the staff goes to eat.

199
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,390
Turn off the cameras.

200
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,930
Let's go to the restaurant in front.

201
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:43,350
Can we wait with him here?

202
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,720
Can I actually talk to you?

203
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,192
I'll be back. You have them here.

204
00:12:49,192 --> 00:12:50,560
Okay.

205
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,822
Let's go.

206
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:54,960
 I'm hungry, too. 

207
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,432
Is the mic off?

208
00:13:02,432 --> 00:13:04,370
It is off.

209
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,060
Hey, you!

210
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,979
Why aren't you reading my texts?

211
00:13:09,979 --> 00:13:12,350
We can use our phone during a shoot?

212
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:15,220
I didn't know.

213
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,600
And what about the sweet and sour pork?

214
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,879
You should've told me about the sauce.

215
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:22,872
I'm sorry.

216
00:13:22,872 --> 00:13:26,930
Joon is like Cinderella so he should go when the camera is off.

217
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,720
This one doesn't have sauce on it.

218
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,760
You eat it. I don't want it.

219
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,150
 Where is everyone? 

220
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,720
What are you talking about?

221
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,870
They're here.

222
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,540
Here.

223
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,566
They need to eat as well.

224
00:13:50,566 --> 00:13:53,030
I know.

225
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,079
What are you watching?

226
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,420
Let me watch it too.

227
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,540
Let's watch it together.

228
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,379
Why are you so secretive?

229
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,270
   

230
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,730
How do you do this?

231
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,810
So something must be in there.

232
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:21,270
Huh?

233
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:25,440
Lee Geunyoung, you are more of naughtier than you look.

234
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,650
Naughty?

235
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,060
Where are you going?

236
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,180
I'm looking around. The house is huge.

237
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,860
Don't ever go to the second floor.

238
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,260
What do you have hidden that is so "naughty"?

239
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,310
Hey!

240
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,110
If I say don't, then don't.

241
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,830
What am I? Your pet?

242
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,680
Geunyoung, good job today.

243
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,890
Make sure you lock up.

244
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,140
I'm taking my leave.

245
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,179
Bye.

246
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,610
Great work today.

247
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,560
Doyoon!

248
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,560
Hurry up!

249
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,440
- Good work today! 
 - Let's go! Hurry!

250
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,520
We'll miss it.

251
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,050
It's going down!

252
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,200
   

253
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:18,170
I'll play some games while I wait.

254
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,390
Hey!

255
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,220
You.

256
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,720
It's you guys.

257
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,979
Who Joon's fans.

258
00:16:44,979 --> 00:16:47,520
Milky Way.

259
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,680
This is unfortunate.

260
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,970
Who Joon already left.

261
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:55,279
Should I get some autographs for you?

262
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,050
How dare you try to make a deal?

263
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,220
What are you doing?

264
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,310
Huh?

265
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,979
How old are you?

266
00:17:09,979 --> 00:17:11,350
Eighteen.

267
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:14,540
We're eighteen, so what?

268
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,900
I'm...

269
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,180
27 years old.

270
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,640
So what?

271
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,920
What?

272
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,779
Hey!

273
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:32,460
You'd better not do anything weird to Joon.

274
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:38,310
 I almost got a heart attack reading the paper. 

275
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,600
 What is this? 

276
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,679
 I almost cut myself... 

277
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,220
Let's go.

278
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,060
She's dirty now.

279
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,410
Look at her.

280
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,870
Let go.

281
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,870
No pictures at least.

282
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,810
If you did it, only you guys look at it.

283
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:04,500
Don't post it anywhere.

284
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,340
- Let's go. 
 - She's dirty.

285
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,070
 Send it to me. 

286
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,570
My goodness.

287
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:22,060
You always tell us to come.

288
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,660
You've come for us.

289
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,640
You must be tired from your schedule.

290
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,660
I should get something for you to recover.

291
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:32,720
Hey.

292
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,430
You're shooting a commercial next weekend.

293
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,890
Commercial? Which one?

294
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,310
It's for coffee.

295
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,179
You're perfect for it.

296
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,810
But the shoot is in Japan.

297
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,979
How's the schedule?

298
00:18:44,979 --> 00:18:48,420
We can work it out with the reality show.

299
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,200
   

300
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,640
SP Group?

301
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,720
Why?

302
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,310
Because it's JJ's family?

303
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,970
Don't worry about it.

304
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,140
His family abandoned him.

305
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,020
Come on.

306
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,520
Can you not talk like that?

307
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,520
What is there between us...

308
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,930
What about you?
Does being nice make you feel better?

309
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:17,970
Don't pretend like you're nice, it doesn't suit you.

310
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,050
Yeah?

311
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:23,100
Then I should just say whatever I want to you or on air.

312
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,430
Your temper.

313
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,780
Aren't there many things we don't want to do, even if the floor is dirty?

314
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,079
Take a look at yourself.

315
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:34,470
If one is kicked out by those close to him, he'll be treated the same elsewhere.

316
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,600
Sounds like you are telling me of being careful of being kicked out.

317
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,390
Why do you take it like that?

318
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,660
Are you type A?

319
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,430
I have to get going.

320
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,020
Work out the schedule.

321
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,680
Get some sleep.

322
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,638
Your health is everything.

323
00:19:51,638 --> 00:19:53,546
I'll be right back.

324
00:19:53,546 --> 00:19:56,980
- Bye. 
 - Take care.

325
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,680
 Bro. 

326
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,779
 Joon. 

327
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:22,970
 My dad is buying me an entertainment company. 

328
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:23,930
 Oh? 

329
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:27,520
 When he does, come with me. 

330
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,420
 You will? 

331
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,340
 Jaejoon, 

332
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,040
 I don't think I can. 

333
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,679
 Youngseok brought me to Korea. 

334
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,820
 He's been so nice to me. 

335
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,060
 Then, what about me? 

336
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,232
 Don't be that way. 

337
00:21:03,232 --> 00:21:05,079
 It's different, as you know. 

338
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:06,570
 Different? 

339
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:12,520
 You're popular now, isn't that so? 

340
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,100
 Why are you like this? This is not like you. 

341
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,800
 What? 

342
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,310
 What's like me then? 

343
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,394
 Huh? 

344
00:21:22,394 --> 00:21:26,020
 Just holding back when you get all my songs? 

345
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,870
 Do as you wish. 

346
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,060
 Inhyung is walking out with me. 

347
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,790
 Inhyung is? 

348
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,500
 Do you think she wants to stay? 

349
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,230
 She hasn't had her debut here yet. 

350
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,430
 What will Inhyung say... 

351
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,130
 when she finds out you're staying? 

352
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,860
 Right. 

353
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,280
 Jaejoon. 

354
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,770
 You... 

355
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,440
 take care of Inhyung. 

356
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:18,080
 Make sure she has her debut. 

357
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:23,020
 And you be successful, too. 

358
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,579
 And in the future... 

359
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,179
 Gosh. 

360
00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:33,720
 You're selfish. 

361
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:44,130
   

362
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,970
Sorry.

363
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:01,880
 What is this? 

364
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,270
I know.

365
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,270
What is this?

366
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,170
Always when I'm busy.

367
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:17,408
Mom, I'm busy. I'll call you back.

368
00:23:17,408 --> 00:23:19,979
You really got work?

369
00:23:19,979 --> 00:23:21,816
Of course.

370
00:23:21,816 --> 00:23:23,140
You had lunch?

371
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,879
 Of course. 

372
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:26,680
Okay then.

373
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,580
Make sure you eat enough.

374
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,600
Okay.

375
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,480
Don't worry.

376
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,630
Okay.

377
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:36,680
Bye.

378
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,920
Make sure she read Aristotle.

379
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:46,140
Always when I'm busy.

380
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,880
Hey.

381
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,850
They're just asking for anyone to do the commercial.

382
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,510
Inhyung, did you finish?

383
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,640
Who should I recommend?

384
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,390
Then just anyone who volunteers.

385
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,560
Don't worry about it.

386
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,020
Everyone would volunteer for a commercial.

387
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,979
And the main part is Hoo Joon.

388
00:24:24,979 --> 00:24:26,640
Hoo Joon's counterpart?

389
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,130
Then shouldn't the CEO decide?

390
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,520
CEO?

391
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,850
You think so?

392
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,880
I'll do it.

393
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,720
Huh?

394
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,890
You said anyone, right?

395
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:41,060
Then the oldest trainee should go, right?

396
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,100
Well...

397
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,580
that's not a bad idea.

398
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,779
You went shopping?

399
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:07,920
Nice living, huh?

400
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,979
Not at all.

401
00:25:09,979 --> 00:25:13,580
Nothing is in the house.

402
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,362
By the way,

403
00:25:15,362 --> 00:25:18,172
did you buy all that despite what the house looks like?

404
00:25:18,172 --> 00:25:19,640
It's not your house.

405
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,970
They're pretty.

406
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,220
You bought things for the house?

407
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,520
I should've.

408
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,770
It's okay.

409
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,270
I should buy these.

410
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,980
Let's go in.

411
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,930
Joon,

412
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,740
let's go.

413
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:42,460
Let's go.

414
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,600
 What? 

415
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,170
 He hurt his foot? 

416
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,120
Did he fall or something?

417
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,420
Please set that inside.

418
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,379
Mr. Han, Hoo Joon is here.

419
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,920
 What? 

420
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,810
What do we do?

421
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:08,810
You're hurt?

422
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,930
Because I was stiff during practice,

423
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:13,530
what should I do since my legs are like this?

424
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,579
It's okay.

425
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,970
You have your wife.

426
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,220
I'm sorry, Geunyoung.

427
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,270
Can you get me some water?

428
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:37,360
Sure.

429
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:48,590
Thank you, Geunyoung. Without you, this would have become a big deal.

430
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,970
No problem.

431
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,100
How clumsy!

432
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,190
Is the camera okay?

433
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:04,570
I'm sorry. Can you get some napkins or a towel?

434
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,560
I'm sorry, Geunyoung.

435
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,198
No problem.

436
00:27:11,198 --> 00:27:13,800
 Sorry, just let me take care of it 

437
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,520
I've been so out of it recently.

438
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,770
 It can't be. 

439
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,200
 No way. 

440
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,720
I also got it on the floor.

441
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,740
I'll do it.

442
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,140
I'm sorry for this.

443
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,890
You're hurt. There's nothing you can do.

444
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,770
There... right there.

445
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:36,520
Okay.

446
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,970
That's a lot of water.

447
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:43,180
I don't feel so well today.

448
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,579
I hope you get better soon.

449
00:27:45,579 --> 00:27:48,618
Shall we watch TV?

450
00:27:48,618 --> 00:27:50,310
Where's the remote?

451
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:53,180
 This bastard... 

452
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:56,690
The remote is over there...

453
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,810
Since it's close...

454
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,900
No. No.

455
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,310
Thank you so much.

456
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,470
Here.

457
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,390
Let's watch a movie.

458
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,350
We got movies.

459
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:10,220
Let's eat cake while watching the movie.

460
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,538
My foot though...

461
00:28:12,538 --> 00:28:14,979
Gosh, I'm so useless.

462
00:28:14,979 --> 00:28:18,270
 He's made his mind up.   

463
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,560
I'll go get it.

464
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,890
Huh?

465
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:24,210
 Send me the address. 

466
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,550
 Stay with her. 

467
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,650
 Follow her. 

468
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,350
Oh.

469
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,270
Long time no see.

470
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,680
Wow. Are you shooting?

471
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,850
Hoo Joon must like the cakes here.

472
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:53,930
Wow.

473
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:58,020
No wonder you're the main journalist for Hoo Joon, you seem to know everything.

474
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,390
I heard you were offended.

475
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,810
Please understand.

476
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:03,720
You were a journalist yourself.

477
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,310
Not that type of journalist.

478
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,520
Why are you being a stiff? (Unflexible)

479
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,770
Honestly, you're doing this because you need it.

480
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,680
Maybe even using Hoo Joon.

481
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,220
What?

482
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:20,579
I'll be expecting a lot of fun articles.

483
00:29:20,579 --> 00:29:23,140
Don't get tired... and take one of these and go.

484
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,210
Goodbye.

485
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,850
Playing cat and mouse?

486
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:33,730
Maybe it's expired.

487
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,912
I eat them at home.

488
00:29:35,912 --> 00:29:37,270
The peach tart, please.

489
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,400
Peach tart.

490
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:48,000
   

491
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:52,250
They do look good.

492
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,660
Geunyoung,

493
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,970
we'll shoot you coming in with the cake and drinks.

494
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,430
Okay.

495
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,520
Are the drinks ready?

496
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,279
Yes, they are.

497
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,770
Is this okay?

498
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:08,890
This is all you've got?

499
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:09,640
Yes.

500
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,310
I'm sorry. It's all we have.

501
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,720
Energy drinks...

502
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,100
They look okay.

503
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,470
Okay. Let's go with these.

504
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,220
Let's go, everyone.

505
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:22,830
Come with the cake and the drinks after I set them up.

506
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,100
I'm on standby.

507
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,170
It must be a lot of trouble for him.

508
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,390
Let's eat.

509
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,860
I'm fine. You eat.

510
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:09,680
They have such good cakes.

511
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,160
We should've gotten more.

512
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,080
It would've been nice for the staff to try some.

513
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,320
It's so good. Have some.

514
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,000
I'm not really hungry.

515
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,920
What's wrong with me?

516
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,930
What's wrong?

517
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:56,020
My stomach...

518
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:01,560
Stars can go to the restroom, too.

519
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,360
Let's go.

520
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,180
You okay?

521
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,310
What's wrong?

522
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,350
You okay, Joon?

523
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,520
What's wrong?

524
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,720
What's going on?

525
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,470
Someone call 911.

526
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,920
It's an emergency!

527
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,520
Maybe something's wrong with the cake?

528
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,979
Who took the shot?

529
00:32:24,979 --> 00:32:26,560
You got nothing at the shop?

530
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,310
I shot from outside because I didn't have approval.

531
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:31,520
Maybe it's the drink.

532
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,140
Did you try it?

533
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,470
I didn't.

534
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,970
Why didn't you?

535
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,600
Is that how you work?

536
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,770
I'm sorry!

537
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:39,470
Get out!

538
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,140
Stop it.

539
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,310
Get out!

540
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,270
Please stop it!

541
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,350
Get out.

542
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,060
Get out, you prick!

543
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,640
Oh my goodness.

544
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,600
What should I do?

545
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,810
Come on.

546
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:55,479
It was me!

547
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,430
It's not his fault.

548
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:02,310
The drink was okay.

549
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,140
I put something in the drink.

550
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,600
It was a vitamin, but it did look old...

551
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,580
Are you okay?

552
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,350
What should we do?

553
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,979
 Do you think she'll fall for it? 

554
00:33:19,979 --> 00:33:21,720
 We have to make her fall for it. 

555
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,810
 Drink what Geunyoung brings. 

556
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:27,470
 And you collapse, then she must fall for it. 

557
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:36,020
It's a prank.

558
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,979
Excuse us for a second.

559
00:33:44,979 --> 00:33:47,590
Come, Geunyoung.

560
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:56,070
I think you'd better go home today.

561
00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:00,640
You must really hate Hoo Joon as much as you want to kill him.

562
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,310
I'm sorry. I had to ask.

563
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,979
Is he okay?

564
00:34:04,979 --> 00:34:06,600
Of course.

565
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,870
It was a prank.

566
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,979
Yes, it was for you.

567
00:34:14,979 --> 00:34:17,480
I'm so embarrassed.

568
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:39,900
Look who's here.

569
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,578
Wow. You look nice.

570
00:34:42,578 --> 00:34:44,100
Bring me a drink.

571
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,520
I'll embarrass myself even more from now on.

572
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,210
Why?

573
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,270
Never mind.

574
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:55,770
You'll never know how I feel.

575
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,610
How do you feel?

576
00:35:00,279 --> 00:35:03,630
A gift for us after getting paid?

577
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,218
Red ginseng?

578
00:35:07,218 --> 00:35:08,100
Hey.

579
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,430
It's for women.

580
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,820
I need this.

581
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,620
Thank you, my friend.

582
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,770
Come on. Why are you like this again?

583
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:31,560
She says we won't get it.

584
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,770
Isn't this the celebrity disease?

585
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:34,979
Hey!

586
00:35:34,979 --> 00:35:36,970
Geunyoung, cheer up.

587
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:39,520
You're really popular nowadays.

588
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,220
Even my seniors are constantly asking me about you.

589
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:42,810
Yeah?

590
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:46,906
See? She cares so much about public attention!

591
00:35:46,906 --> 00:35:48,640
She's definitely got the celebrity disease!

592
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,110
I'm in big trouble.

593
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:53,020
Even now, I get mean comments.

594
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:56,640
When this airs, I'll be treated more as a criminal and a stupid idiot.

595
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,880
What about the anti-fans who cheer for you?

596
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,100
Guys.

597
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,770
How about you leave some comments?

598
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:05,850
What do you want?

599
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:09,580
"I actually saw Lee Geunyoung in person, and she's a real goddess."

600
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,160
What's wrong with you?

601
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,130
Never mind.

602
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,779
I was wrong this time.

603
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,620
How is it?

604
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,988
I like it.

605
00:36:46,988 --> 00:36:49,420
Of course, you do.

606
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,470
Hey.

607
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,810
What's wrong with your foot?

608
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:53,530
My foot?

609
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:54,980
Your foot.

610
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,970
Oh.

611
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:00,680
I sprained it, but it's good now.

612
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,060
Be careful.

613
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,720
Your body is not yours.

614
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,600
You know that.

615
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,980
   

616
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:44,370
What was I even thinking?

617
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:47,160
It's all because of that journalist.

618
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,930
Mr. Seo,

619
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:59,640
this is Geunyoung.

620
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,670
Can I ask you a favor?

621
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,979
It's late.

622
00:38:24,979 --> 00:38:26,770
Go back.

623
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,180
He left the recording studio.

624
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,560
So he should be home.

625
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,979
You're not coming with me?

626
00:38:54,979 --> 00:38:59,520
Joon probably knows that you didn't mean any harm.

627
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,920
You can do it.

628
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,770
Thank you.

629
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,580
Take care.

630
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:00,179
 You're not uncomfortable here? 

631
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:03,430
 I don't want us to be awkward. 

632
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,930
 Oh, yeah? 

633
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:09,280
 Then we're not awkward. 

634
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,510
 Okay. 

635
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:16,196
 I was worried that I hurt you. 

636
00:40:16,196 --> 00:40:18,610
 I'm starting over. 

637
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,350
 I'll be on the stage again. 

638
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:23,070
 I was there. 

639
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:27,010
 When you had your debut party. 

640
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:30,730
 That's why I couldn't say anything. 

641
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:33,620
 Like a fool, I walked away. 

642
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,050
 It was really hard for me. 

643
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,310
 I was lonely because of you. 

644
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,720
 I know. 

645
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,520
 I made you lonely. 

646
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,056
 I couldn't even persuade you to stay. 

647
00:40:53,056 --> 00:40:55,220
 And I didn't even help you with your debut. 

648
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,780
 But every time I'm next to you... 

649
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,600
 Don't worry about me. 

650
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,880
 Be confident. 

651
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,270
 I am confident. 

652
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:16,840
 Please don't walk around with that look that is your. 

653
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,779
 Even to JJ, say what you like and don't. 

654
00:41:19,779 --> 00:41:21,770
 Tell him. 

655
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:27,480
 And don't wear stuff you don't like. 

656
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:52,820
♫  I just laugh but you don't even notice  ♫

657
00:41:52,820 --> 00:42:01,370
♫  Is this the person you broke up with yesterday?  ♫

658
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:07,540
♫  I just thought if I spent all that time  ♫

659
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:15,000
♫  Everything would be forgotten  ♫

660
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:22,280
♫  When I close my eyes and think of you  ♫

661
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:32,400
♫  I feel like I'm coming back to you any minute  ♫

662
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:39,400
♫  It blows like the wind in my heart  ♫

663
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,570
♫  It flows and comes to me like a river  ♫

664
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:46,910
You selfish prick.

665
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:55,030
♫  A love that I can't go back and forget  ♫

666
00:42:55,030 --> 00:43:00,820
♫  It's blowing, blowing in my chest  ♫

667
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,490
Excuse me.

668
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:11,100
♫  It blows like the wind in my heart  ♫

669
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:18,500
♫  It flows and comes to me like a river  ♫

670
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:26,810
♫  A love that I can't go back and forget  ♫

671
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:36,360
♫  It's blowing, blowing in my chest  ♫

672
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:48,900
♫  It blows... in my heart  ♫

673
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,850
What the heck? What are you doing?

674
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:09,800
You scared me.

675
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,240
What are you looking for?

676
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:21,470
- I... 
 - Leave.

677
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:27,510
I'm here to apologize.

678
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:33,260
About the drink earlier.

679
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,920
I really didn't mean to.

680
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,730
It was really a small prank.

681
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:40,790
Don't prank me like that,

682
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:42,770
if you want to stay in the house.

683
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:52,500
What the heck?

684
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,310
You'd better stop trying to fool me.

685
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:58,110
You're walking fine. Who are you to order me around?

686
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:22,670
 Excuse me. 

687
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:41,820
I can't sleep because I'm curious. Who's that?

688
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:44,620
That'd be an exclusive.

689
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:02,600
    
    

690
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:08,880
How are there so many rumors different about him?

691
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:22,450
He's not gay. He has someone.

692
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:24,390
Who can she be?

693
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:28,800
A married woman? A rich woman?

694
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:35,579
   

695
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:48,610
Why are journalists on his side?

696
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,658
Fake bastard.

697
00:46:53,658 --> 00:46:55,846
Dirty bastard.

698
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:57,970
Rude bastard.

699
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:02,620
Yeah, this is what I'm saying.

700
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:08,130
With the heel.

701
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:13,770
What's Geunyoung up to?

702
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:15,280
Geunyoung, coffee?

703
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,880
Thank you. Thanks for this.

704
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,070
And...

705
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:27,690
Ta-da!

706
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:29,970
The shoe finally returns to its owner.

707
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:31,824
Oh, my heel.

708
00:47:31,824 --> 00:47:34,090
You really had it?

709
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:38,560
Your feet must be bigger than I thought.

710
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,170
Yes.

711
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,850
I'm tall.

712
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,379
Geunyoung, do you know what I was thinking?

713
00:47:48,379 --> 00:47:52,360
The shoe must be preserved as a historic artifact.

714
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,580
That's what I thought.

715
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:56,270
It's not historic.

716
00:47:56,270 --> 00:48:00,179
You don't seem to realize who you are.

717
00:48:00,179 --> 00:48:05,100
Do you know what I was thinking when I found out you were a journalist?

718
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:09,310
I was happy to see a journalist that doesn't succumb to top stars.

719
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:11,879
No. It's not only that.

720
00:48:11,879 --> 00:48:13,850
You even hit him with your heel.

721
00:48:14,979 --> 00:48:16,810
If I didn't...

722
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,610
I wouldn't be here.

723
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:21,570
Come on. Don't be weak.

724
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,160
What's important is that you found out his duplicity.

725
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:31,930
Hoo Joon is somewhat...

726
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:35,960
secretive. Was he always?

727
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,800
Why?

728
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,160
You got something?

729
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,530
In the past...

730
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,120
- I'm sorry. 
 - No problem...

731
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,920
Take it.

732
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:50,710
Yes.

733
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:54,560
Sir, SP Group called.

734
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,550
 It's not an important job, they are needing a model for a commercial... 

735
00:48:57,550 --> 00:48:59,370
Send her if it's a commercial.

736
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:01,660
You can handle that yourself. Can't you?

737
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,380
The counterpart is...

738
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:08,450
You can always depend on me.

739
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:11,714
I expect much more from you.

740
00:49:11,714 --> 00:49:13,020
Okay?

741
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,780
Yes, sir.

742
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:20,350
A commercial.

743
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:22,500
Yes. It's very simple.

744
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:25,379
They always need my help.

745
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:30,279
You were saying?

746
00:49:30,279 --> 00:49:32,300
Oh, never mind.

747
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:35,470
You're here to give this back to me?

748
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:40,920
Yes. And I wanted to make you an offer.

749
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,440
That. You always have to carry stuff to your shoot.

750
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,920
This?

751
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,070
To be honest--

752
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:48,970
Let's sign a contract.

753
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:50,820
What? Me?

754
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:57,720
Jaejoon, you're quite funny.

755
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,370
That's not possible.

756
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:00,680
Why not?

757
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:03,520
You're on a reality TV show.

758
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,850
You need a company to represent you from unfair tactics.

759
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:09,080
Everyone's on Hoo Joon's side there.

760
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:13,800
You have no one to trust at the shoot between the network and Hoo Joon's staff.

761
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,420
Everyone's nice.

762
00:50:20,179 --> 00:50:22,420
Anyways...

763
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:25,279
I'm being serious. I'm trying to scout you.

764
00:50:25,279 --> 00:50:27,120
So think it over.

765
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:32,079
Okay. I'll think it over.

766
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:47,190


767
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,720
Gosh.

768
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,400
Who's there?

769
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,220
 You've got a package. 

770
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:11,640
I shouldn't.

771
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,660
What the?

772
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:46,230
 Hoo Joon is inviting you to a high-end restaurant today. 

773
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:50,310
 I sent the address, but let's go together. 

774
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:52,680
 You said you get lost easily. 

775
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:57,580
It's all wrinkled.

776
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:01,440
This one's so expensive.

777
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:18,170
Is he trying to cut me down by taking me to a fancy place?

778
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,850
Here.

779
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:24,060
Thank you.

780
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:25,970
Goodbye.

781
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:31,320
I'll get to wear it one more time.

782
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,800
It wasn't a bad buy.

783
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:56,560
 Did you wait for long? 

784
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,370
 Welcome. 

785
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:03,010
 I cooked something delicious. 

786
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,140
 How pathetic. 

787
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:14,490
 Lee Geunyoung. 

788
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:19,220
This is the high-end restaurant?

789
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:23,650
Even though I get lost easily, how could I not realize this was the place?

790
00:53:24,979 --> 00:53:25,640
No.

791
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,720
He can't see me in these heels.

792
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,230
No.

793
00:53:29,979 --> 00:53:31,140
Geunyoung.

794
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:32,970
Not coming in?

795
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:34,310
Is this the place?

796
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:35,310
Yes.

797
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:37,350
You know Chef Roy?

798
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:38,180
I do.

799
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:40,720
He's really popular lately.

800
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,790
I hear he's close to Hoo Joon.

801
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:46,020
I wonder what he's like.

802
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:47,730
Come in.

803
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:49,979
The heels are big on you.

804
00:53:49,979 --> 00:53:50,560
They are.

805
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,770
I should change my shoes.

806
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,520
You look pretty.

807
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,960
Don't worry about it.

808
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:02,890
Hello.

809
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:04,560
- You're here. 
 - Oh, yeah.

810
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,890
Hello, Hoo Joon.

811
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:06,680
Hello.

812
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:07,680
You just got here?

813
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,514
Geunyoung.

814
00:54:09,514 --> 00:54:11,890
You look different today.

815
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:12,720
She's pretty, huh?

816
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:13,820
Yes.

817
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:15,430
I like that.

818
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:16,970
Perfect for the occasion.

819
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:18,230
Right, Joon?

820
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:20,000
Huh?

821
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,530
Oh. Yes.

822
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:25,970
The top chef will be here, too. Right?

823
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:27,830
Of course.

824
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:30,000
He should be here soon.

825
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:33,400
There he is.

826
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,370
Long time no see.

827
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:44,880
 Why would two men do that? 

828
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,890
Thank you for your time today.

829
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:48,390
Hello.

830
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:49,979
Nice to meet you.

831
00:54:49,979 --> 00:54:52,860
This is our heroine.

832
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:01,670
I'm the heroine.

833
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,140
A pleasure to meet you.

834
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:08,970
I'm Roy.

835
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,430
Oh. Yes.

836
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:16,470
Nice to meet you.

837
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:21,810
See you guys later then.

838
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:23,310
See you later.

839
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:24,979
Me too.

840
00:55:24,979 --> 00:55:26,020
Hey.

841
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:27,580
Yes, director.

842
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:42,950
Today is the first day I'm cooking for someone.

843
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:44,880
I see.

844
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:50,510
I'm trying it for the first time for you.

845
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:53,150
You see him?

846
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:54,979
Yes, clearly.

847
00:55:54,979 --> 00:55:58,516
Today, he'll help me.

848
00:55:58,516 --> 00:55:59,979
I hear you guys are close.

849
00:55:59,979 --> 00:56:02,100
Wait here for just a bit.

850
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,510
Okay.

851
00:56:15,279 --> 00:56:17,290
Is that too much?

852
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:22,880
You're almost done.

853
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:30,780
 I think he's just as tall as the foreign guy. 

854
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:40,700
 And Hoo Joon is also from overseas. 

855
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:44,150
It won't get on my clothes.

856
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:48,860
 They're comfortable touching each other. 

857
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:51,810
You should look good.

858
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:55,130
 Oh my goodness. 

859
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:00,770
 I can't tell anyone that 

860
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:03,320
 I've met two boyfriends of my ex-boyfriend. 

861
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:08,890
I tried my best, but I don't know how it'll taste.

862
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:10,930
He's good at food, so... 
  (She is referring to him "eating" men) 

863
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:12,192
Huh?

864
00:57:12,192 --> 00:57:14,434
Never mind.

865
00:57:14,434 --> 00:57:17,400
It's Hoo Joon's favorite.

866
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:23,970
It's called a truffle, a precious mushroom.

867
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:26,650
And we made pasta with it.

868
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:29,680
Hoo Joon thinks it's my best dish.

869
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,140
It's good.

870
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,748
You had it before?

871
00:57:33,748 --> 00:57:37,220
Roy's should be different from any you've ever had.

872
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,550
Hoo Joon is quite the epicure.

873
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:42,210
Is that so?

874
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:44,560
You two must be very close.

875
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,020
I didn't know.

876
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:47,810
I only helped,

877
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:49,670
but please try it.

878
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:51,270
Okay.

879
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:08,350
This is so good.

880
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:13,200
Well.

881
00:58:14,270 --> 00:58:18,220
I heard all truffle pasta tasted good.

882
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:19,979
Maybe not?

883
00:58:19,979 --> 00:58:23,320
Was it not pasta? Maybe it was tteokbokki?

884
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:27,970
Let me get it for you.

885
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:29,700
No.

886
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:35,179
I got it.

887
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:43,640
(You better shut up.)

888
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,470
(What?)

889
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:59,520
- What do you think? 
 - It's good.

890
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:04,410
Doyoon says okay. Cut!

891
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:13,920
Am I only here to be the third wheel or what?

892
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:16,900
So annoying.

893
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,970
Geunyoung.

894
00:59:24,979 --> 00:59:27,320
Yes, chef. What's the matter?

895
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:30,479
I thought it would be more comfortable for you to pretend we were strangers.

896
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,240
I didn't know you were so thoughtful.

897
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,690
What's wrong?

898
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:38,810
You still haven't gotten over me?

899
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:40,520
What are you talking about?

900
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,980
You said you'd understand.

901
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:48,178
I'm speechless.

902
00:59:48,178 --> 00:59:50,640
You know what really makes me mad?

903
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,520
If you're so close to Hoo Joon,

904
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,770
you should've known I'd be here.

905
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:57,310
Did we have to run into each other?

906
00:59:57,310 --> 00:59:59,350
I didn't think about that.

907
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:01,020
I didn't know it'd be awkward.

908
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:03,520
Do you think you can use ignorance as a weapon?

909
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,600
Geunyoung.

910
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,020
What now?

911
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:11,910
You kept the shoes.

912
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:17,350
Right. They are limited edition.

913
01:00:17,350 --> 01:00:18,920
Okay?

914
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,070
What's going on?

915
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:26,144
You two know each other?

916
01:00:26,144 --> 01:00:28,100
Joon, it's nothing.

917
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:29,700
Don't worry about it.

918
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:44,180
You two knew each other.

919
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:49,710
♫  I wonder what is love  ♫

920
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:54,140
♫  I want to know what is love  ♫

921
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:58,010
♫  Your lovely look  ♫

922
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:02,500
♫  What is this taste?  ♫

923
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:06,460
♫  I wonder what is love  ♫

924
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:11,290
♫  There is no answer, it's just a question  ♫

925
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:16,370
♫  Are you falling in love too?  ♫

926
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:18,100
 Is this the devil's editing? 

927
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:21,850
 I didn't throw her away. If you're going to be like this, I could come get it back. 

928
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:24,270
 I've never protected anyone. 

929
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:27,282
 You'll have something to protect. 

930
01:01:27,282 --> 01:01:30,390
 I can't ask you to do this hard job. 

931
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:32,430
 Should I try this angle? 

932
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:34,970
 As if there weren't already other things between us, he also has a secret room. 

933
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:37,310
 If our publisher does hire you... 

934
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:39,100
 his scandals? 

935
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:41,890
 She asked what happens if she quits. 

936
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:44,080
 She must've been serious. 

937
01:01:46,429 --> 01:01:51,354
