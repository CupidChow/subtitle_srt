1
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,350
   

2
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,220
   

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,930
   

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,720
   

5
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,040
   

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:31,310
   

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,990


8
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:52,240
   

9
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:21,310
We're late.

10
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,000
Run.

11
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,120
Uncomfortable, right?

12
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,579
This is what I bought on short notice.

13
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:18,060
There were was no business class?

14
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,310
You can put your arms down now.

15
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,270
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,370
I'm sorry I made you miss your flight.

17
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,470
Can you stop making more trouble?

18
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,940
I had something come up.

19
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,360
Why'd you make people miss their flights?

20
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,570
I said I'm sorry.

21
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,750
I know, so...

22
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,870
So what was it then that has made you sorry?

23
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,960
I had to do my laundry in a hurry.

24
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,406
Right.

25
00:03:13,406 --> 00:03:16,632
It probably was nothing since you could lie about it.

26
00:03:16,632 --> 00:03:21,270
But if you're not going to commit, tell me now.

27
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,960
Why didn't you just leave me at the airport then?

28
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,390
You nag too much.

29
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,490
You must be newlyweds.

30
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:32,370
We were like you guys once.

31
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,740
Grandma, we're not married.

32
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,540
Remember how we were once like them?

33
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,310
Looking back, I wonder why we fought so much.

34
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,590
But we're not...

35
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,040
Why is Inhyung in Japan alone?

36
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,100
I was going to follower her,

37
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,020
but she said she shouldn't have her manager with her.

38
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,654
So... why is she in Japan?

39
00:04:09,654 --> 00:04:11,318
A commercial shoot.

40
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:12,520
You didn't know?

41
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,230
I thought you knew since it's Inhyung.

42
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,900
A commercial?

43
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,830
What commercial?

44
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,979
Remember SP Group? I told you before... about the commercial.

45
00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:27,620
They said they just needed anyone.

46
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,030
And Inhyung volunteered all of sudden.

47
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:36,272
You didn't say it was Inhyung.

48
00:04:36,272 --> 00:04:37,980
Right?

49
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,940
Japan? What kind of commercial is it?

50
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,330
It's a coffee commercial with Hoo Joon as the main.

51
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,450
They said they needed anyone for Hoo Joon's costar.

52
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,960
You never said...

53
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,680
it was Hoo Joon.

54
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,379
I meant to tell you.

55
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:03,340
You said I could take care of...

56
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,400
I'm sorry.

57
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,540
Does Inhyung know who the main model is?

58
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,120
Yes.

59
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,100
Get out.

60
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,850
Huh?

61
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,390
Get out now!

62
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,500
Enjoy.

63
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,079
I'm such a big fan.

64
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,330
Can I please get an autograph?

65
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,210
Of course.

66
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,340
Can you hold it?

67
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,970
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

68
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,725
You're not eating?

69
00:06:12,725 --> 00:06:14,750
You can eat it all.

70
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,020
Boss,

71
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,370
this is Hoo Joon's.

72
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,879
You can sell it at an expensive price.

73
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:30,079
I heard that's why top stars don't touch anything at hotels.

74
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,370
Being a top star must be difficult.

75
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,994
Did you see his face?

76
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:37,420
It's difficult to be that handsome.

77
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,910
Can I go to the restroom?

78
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:17,830
My phone.

79
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,579
Come on.

80
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,530
I'm sorry.

81
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:33,480
Are you crazy?

82
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,879
Why didn't you lock the door?

83
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:35,960
Look.

84
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,020
My phone.

85
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,290
You scared me.

86
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,580
You guys can't be separated for one second.

87
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,540
You are newlyweds.

88
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:00,150
   
   

89
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,520
Gosh. You must be tired.

90
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,870
Welcome, Geunyoung.

91
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:36,940
You're finally here.

92
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,579
I was so scared that you might not come.

93
00:08:39,579 --> 00:08:42,620
You didn't think "Oh well?"

94
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,600
What do you take me for?

95
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,960
I said, "It's too bad if you don't come, you won't get filmed."

96
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:52,040
Don't unpack right now.

97
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,379
Can we talk for a second?

98
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:56,470
Let's go.

99
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,230
That way.

100
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,790
Joon must've come to Japan numerous times.

101
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,179
Geunyoung, it's not your first time either?

102
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:07,810
Seriously, what person has never been to Japan before?

103
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,240
It's not even overseas.

104
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,290
That's good then.

105
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,800
Today, Geunyoung takes Hoo Joon on tour.

106
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,950
- Me? 
 - Yes.

107
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:20,068
You've never actually walked the streets before because of your working schedule?

108
00:09:20,068 --> 00:09:20,690
No.

109
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:25,170
That's why today, instead of a top star, you'll be an ordinary person.

110
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,580
Just walk around.

111
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,980
Sounds good, right?

112
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,679
Wouldn't he attract a lot of people?

113
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,620
Just wear a hat and nobody will recognize him.

114
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,370
People only recognize you when you cover yourself to make it obvious.

115
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,779
I didn't hold my tongue again.

116
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,830
People will think "Hoo Joon wouldn't just walk around like this."

117
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,179
- Am I right? 
 - Right.

118
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:46,460
- Right? 
 - Right.

119
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,920
You'll be with them?

120
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,080
- Behind... 
 - We have to scout for the next location.

121
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,370
What are you talking about? We already...

122
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,520
Excuse me.

123
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,970
 Not letting me go? 

124
00:09:59,180 --> 00:09:59,979
Shall we go?

125
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:02,940
What about Rara and Gangyeon?

126
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,432
We're using people hired by the advertiser.

127
00:10:06,432 --> 00:10:07,950
Let's go.

128
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:12,540
Geunyoung,

129
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,710
can you say hello?

130
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,679
Where do you usually go when you come to Japan?

131
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,920
I always go to Shibuya first.

132
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,230
Shibuya is in Tokyo.

133
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,670
Right.

134
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm just sad that Shibuya isn't here.

135
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,330
That's what I meant.

136
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,520
Okay.

137
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,220
You must've come to Japan quite often.

138
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,870
Where should we go first then?

139
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,570
How about some sushi?

140
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,900
Oh. Sushi?

141
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,290
- Yes. 
 - Good.

142
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,830
I'll just follow you then.

143
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,480
Okay.

144
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,350
Shall we go?

145
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,350
- Shall we go? 
 - Yes.

146
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,750
A restaurant tour by Geunyoung.

147
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,229
This way or that way?

148
00:11:21,229 --> 00:11:23,230
- That way? 
 - Yes.

149
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,980
Everything's still the same.

150
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,962
I don't think it's this way.

151
00:11:32,962 --> 00:11:34,160
This way then?

152
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,370
Okay, we are heading toward the restaurant.

153
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,790
I think it's this way.

154
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,600
Here?

155
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,510
Do we go this way?

156
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,620
It's not here.

157
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,920
How long will it take?

158
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,979
Soon.

159
00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:52,650
We're going this way again?

160
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,080
It must be really good.

161
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,079
Yes.

162
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,000
Wondering about how delicious this place is,

163
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,360
I'm looking forward to it.

164
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,010
Where is this...

165
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,150
She has no sense of direction.

166
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:09,790
Geunyoung.

167
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,330
It's easier to find if we know what's around it.

168
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,720
Why don't we use the maps?

169
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,066
Oh.

170
00:12:18,766 --> 00:12:21,020
I kind of forgot.

171
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,770
I'm so sorry.

172
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,430
Don't be.

173
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,040
   

174
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,420
I think I found it!

175
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,860
You said that earlier.

176
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,230
It's like the fourth time.

177
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,379
It's for real this time.

178
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,360
Just ask the name of the place.

179
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,940
I'm 100% certain this place was found by pure luck.

180
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,220
Let me give this a try now.

181
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,410
Wow, amazing.

182
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,940
Turn it off.

183
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,870
Turn it off.

184
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,670
Why?

185
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,450
And when you turn it off,

186
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,140
do it from the back.

187
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,380
The audio is being recorded.

188
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,079
It's your first time in Japan, huh?

189
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:25,820
Why?

190
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,370
Look at the way you eat.

191
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,230
You're so happy to eat it like someone who's never been to Japan.

192
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,070
We walked around for an hour for this?

193
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:33,860
What?

194
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,000
I just like eating.

195
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,150
Right.

196
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,840
I can't believe you ate two in-flight meals.

197
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,730
And you've never been to this restaurant.

198
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,270
Stop pretending.

199
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,079
I have. I'm a regular.

200
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,779
I ate your in-flight meal for you so you wouldn't be in a bind.

201
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:50,820
That's dumb.

202
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,250
You wanted two more after you ate mine.

203
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,210
That's amazing.

204
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,220
You weren't sleeping.

205
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,990
So I wasn't.

206
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:01,270
I don't know what I'm doing here.

207
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,820
This is nice.

208
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:11,030
Japan has good beer.

209
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,670
This is what a business trip is all about.

210
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,170
Loafing around.

211
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,470
Yes, please.

212
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,858
You're done with the first episode, right?

213
00:14:22,858 --> 00:14:24,740
First episode?

214
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:28,860
What?

215
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,410
You've done some weird editing again behind my back?

216
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,480
I'm sure you'll love this episode.

217
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,679
What is it?

218
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:37,312
I'm not telling you.

219
00:14:37,312 --> 00:14:40,879
What can it possibly be?

220
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:45,679
If the show flops, I won't see you for another ten years.

221
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,246
Come on.

222
00:14:47,246 --> 00:14:50,679
Aren't you back because you missed the old days?

223
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:59,450
I made two mistakes that day.

224
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:02,420
The first was setting the pigeons on fire.

225
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:07,788
The second was... setting the night on fire with you.

226
00:15:07,788 --> 00:15:09,574
Come on.

227
00:15:09,574 --> 00:15:12,770
Why is it so sunny? I'm going to get a tan.

228
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:13,790
Let me see.

229
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,500
Did you get a sunburn?

230
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,630
Look. I already got it.

231
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,506
Sun, you piece of crap!

232
00:15:19,506 --> 00:15:20,870
Ms. Noh!

233
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,180
Since you're tanned, you must be sexy.

234
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,590
- I know. 
- Very.

235
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,800
I know.

236
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,050
Should we go over there and tan?

237
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,500
You're just naturally carefree.

238
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,552
I hate you so much I could die.

239
00:15:33,552 --> 00:15:36,700
What would our cast be doing?

240
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,790
Like us?

241
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,420
Here.

242
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,190
Okay.

243
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,540
There are cute things here.

244
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,960
There's a lot of stuff.

245
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,800
What's this?

246
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,079
It's called Mikuji, you pick your fortune.

247
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,430
Pick one.

248
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,320
My fortune?

249
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,570
What's Geunyoung's fortune today?

250
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,730
I don't even know what it says.

251
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,530
Full bloom...

252
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:29,430
(He's speaking in Japanese) 
    

253
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,250
You must speak a little Japanese. 
    

254
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,330
What does it say?

255
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:41,040
"True love does not come to pass through adversity.

256
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,770
Choosing work over love in the future."

257
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,400
It really says that?

258
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,020
Yeah.

259
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,420
"But if you keep this divination chart well,

260
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,220
you can find your true love later.

261
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,390
However, if you forget this chart,

262
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,790
true love will never come."

263
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,430
That's what it says.

264
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,040
You have to keep it well.

265
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,710
Give it.

266
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,070
Keep it safe.

267
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,670
- Give it. 
 - Okay?

268
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,498
Give it to me.

269
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:13,780
What? Give it!

270
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,500
What are you doing?

271
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,340
Keep it safe.

272
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,730
So give it to me.

273
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,050
Why don't you get it?

274
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,060
Why did you take it?

275
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,830
- Okay. 
 - Give it to me.

276
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,930
Here.

277
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:27,190
What's wrong with him?

278
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,130
   

279
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:52,490
Why is she not picking up?

280
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:55,630
She's still not picking up?

281
00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:00,179
I haven't been able to reach her all day.

282
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,079
What have you been  reading all day?

283
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:08,090
Mr. Gu told me specialized crops are trendy now.

284
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,560
Nature and man become one to—

285
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,310
- Stop. 
 - It's very...

286
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,930
Please stop it.

287
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,210
Let's just live our life together.

288
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:19,720
You're the most special crop in our house. A special crop.

289
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,350
Don't specialize in anything else.

290
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,540
Grind the ink stick.

291
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:29,220
I like this the most out of all your works.

292
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,500
"I am the non-light, excluded from all,

293
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,870
and not even treated as light."

294
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:40,210
Let me tell you how to draw eyebrows today.

295
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,974
You go like this.

296
00:18:42,974 --> 00:18:45,860
Straight and straight.

297
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,670
Yes, ma'am.

298
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,460
 Hey, Mijeong. 

299
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,679
 I couldn't reach Geunyoung all day. 

300
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:56,520
 Really? 

301
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,360
I'm not sure where she is.

302
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,779
I haven't seen her for a few days.

303
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:01,180
A few days?

304
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,020
I thought she was living with you.

305
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,370
Oh. That's because...

306
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,830
she's at her senior's house.

307
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,780
 Senior? 

308
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,610
Which senior?

309
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,150
Don't tell me she's living with a man.

310
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,320
Mrs. Lee.

311
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,710
It's not like that.

312
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:20,610
 Kids nowadays don't think living together is wrong. 

313
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,710
 You can't ever do that though. 

314
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,520
Say "ah."

315
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,620
Let me call you back after I find her.

316
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,979
Goodbye.

317
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,420
Are you okay?

318
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,300
I'm sorry.

319
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,520
Water...

320
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,320
Here's your water.

321
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,900
Now I'm okay.

322
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,120
I almost died.

323
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,150
This is why you can't live alone.

324
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,270
Baby.

325
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,890
 Your call has been forwarded to an automated... 

326
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:03,830
Why is she not picking up?

327
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,830
She wouldn't be on a trip with a man, would she?

328
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,860
We have to go first for the commercial.

329
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,000
Okay. I'll tell Mr. Han.

330
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,770
Go.

331
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,350
Bye.

332
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,400
Goodbye.

333
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:37,130
I'm finally free.

334
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,070
What do I do?

335
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,390
I think that was a raindrop.

336
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,070
No.

337
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,070
Don't rain.

338
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,590
Hello.

339
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,420
Mr. Seo.

340
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:28,820
- The advertiser only wants the models to participate in the meeting. What should we do? 
 - I see.

341
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,540
He wants to have a comfortable conversation before filming the shoot.

342
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:35,079
We were not notified beforehand.

343
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:36,540
Okay.

344
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,690
Let's just do as she said.

345
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:40,730
You must be tired too.

346
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,370
Buy me one ramen.

347
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:45,960
You don't have to worry.

348
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,350
Call me if anything happens.

349
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,330
Thank you.

350
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,140
Let's go.

351
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:53,870
Do well.

352
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,679
Thanks.

353
00:22:04,879 --> 00:22:07,680
Welcome, Hoo Joon.

354
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,430
Nice to meet you.

355
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,560
Nice to meet you, too.

356
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,970
I just wanted everyone to be comfortable.

357
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,180
- Nothing more. 
 - Yes.

358
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,730
This is...

359
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,480
...Oh Inhyung.

360
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,460
Your costar in the commercial.

361
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,062
I heard you two know each other?

362
00:22:23,062 --> 00:22:26,050
Yes. That's right.

363
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,020
Long time no see.

364
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,270
I know.

365
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,080
It's been a while.

366
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,020
Please sit.

367
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,860
Yes.

368
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,670
One of my subsidiaries...

369
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,990
is an entertainment company.

370
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:41,460
I asked them to send anyone to be Hoo Joon's partner...

371
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,580
I mean... I asked them to send someone.

372
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,620
And it was Inhyung.

373
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,040
And I heard you two know each other.

374
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,482
"This commercial will go so well."

375
00:22:49,482 --> 00:22:51,160
That's what I thought.

376
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,390
Come.

377
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,340
I said come.

378
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,370
He's the son of the SP Group CEO.

379
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:20,160
If you can excuse me, can I go talk to them?

380
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,970
Sure.

381
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:23,710
I'm sorry.

382
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,579
It's fine.

383
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,970
Let's just eat.

384
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,980
Why are you here?

385
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,440
What are you doing?

386
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,580
They didn't tell you that I'm shooting a commercial?

387
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,880
This is not right!

388
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,970
You're just gone like that?

389
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:49,330
You knew it was going to be him!

390
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,960
Hey. Tell him you can't do it.

391
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,750
Okay?

392
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,750
Never mind.

393
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,579
Tell him that you want someone else for her role.

394
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:01,070
That'll solve everything.

395
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,400
Let's wrap this up.

396
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,034
Jaejoon.

397
00:24:04,034 --> 00:24:07,588
And if I do, will that resolve things?

398
00:24:07,588 --> 00:24:09,540
How will it be resolved exactly?

399
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,710
Joon, please don't.

400
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,850
Mind your own business.

401
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:17,510
Just tell him that you want someone else.

402
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,540
Joon,

403
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,320
I really want to do this.

404
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,270
You don't care that I'm the costar. Right?

405
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,710
I said I care.

406
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,820
I care.

407
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,520
I don't care... who plays the role.

408
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,060
You two figure it out.

409
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,310
Don't do this here.

410
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:43,936
You didn't hear him?

411
00:24:43,936 --> 00:24:47,690
He doesn't care if it's not you.

412
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:51,080
Do you want to do this by selling your pride like this?

413
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,360
They just needed anyone.

414
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,270
When I said I'd do it,

415
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,110
I left all my pride behind me.

416
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,379
What about my pride?

417
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,540
Okay, Jaejoon.

418
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,460
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

419
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:11,040
But I want this to be my new beginning.

420
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,040
Who cares if Joon is in it?

421
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,470
I want to be famous.

422
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:19,110
Are you doing it because of him? Huh?

423
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,664
Okay.

424
00:25:20,664 --> 00:25:23,370
You must've figured things out in your head.

425
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:27,770
If it's Joon, it's much better than someone less famous.

426
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:32,750
But... was that it?

427
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,300
Look.

428
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,500
Your eyes say no.

429
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,460
Your eyes can't lie for one second when you look at him.

430
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,400
That's why I'm saying no.

431
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,520
I am...

432
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,740
telling you no.

433
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,020
American Village or whatever will be ruined.

434
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,950
It's raining too much.

435
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,670
I'll get it.

436
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,420
Thanks.

437
00:26:24,979 --> 00:26:26,000
You're here early.

438
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,140
An advertiser wants to meet the stars alone.

439
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,020
I see.

440
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,920
Joon wants ramen so I'm going to get some.

441
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,600
I'm trying to buy some for the staff, too.

442
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,310
You want some?

443
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,750
Ramen sounds good on a rainy night.

444
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,370
So you're eating.

445
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,100
Yes.

446
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,068
Let's see then... if I add all the staff...

447
00:26:46,068 --> 00:26:47,640
You'll need more fingers.

448
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,379
Won't you need another hand?

449
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:56,130
I knew it.

450
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,970
Inhyung.

451
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,656
You can't fool me.

452
00:27:02,656 --> 00:27:04,879
Who knows better than me?

453
00:27:04,879 --> 00:27:09,680
How you came to me and why you came to me?

454
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,520
I know it the best.

455
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,210
It's me.

456
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,540
Why do this?

457
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:24,590
Have you thought about how I feel?

458
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,720
I hate myself too.

459
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,738
Your jealousy and anger...

460
00:27:29,738 --> 00:27:31,260
Okay.

461
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:35,470
Do you know how infuriating it is to think that

462
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,390
I have to justify things?

463
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:40,379
That's why I'm telling you right now!

464
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:44,540
It's okay for you to say that you need me.

465
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:49,520
Even now, you can say that you're holding back because you need me.

466
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,890
So, please!

467
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:56,700
Please just don't do anything to make me think about him.

468
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,620
I, too...

469
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:02,550
want to be recognized.

470
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,070
At least you should've trusted me.

471
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,980
God.

472
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,220
Why is no one picking up?

473
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,900
Mijeong, why are you looking for me?

474
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,580
I'm here for you.

475
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,540
I can't reach Geunyoung at all.

476
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,960
You said you know that journalist Hoo Joon's friends with.

477
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,120
Call him and find out...

478
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,230
about what has happened.

479
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,720
I heard she's in Japan.

480
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,290
- Really? 
 - Yes.

481
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:33,670
Why isn't she picking up then?

482
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:36,820
It's her first time in Japan, what if she gets lost?

483
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,440
Hey. She's not a kid.

484
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,790
Stop worrying about her and bring me a beer.

485
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,820
Please.

486
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:49,304
You must really like chicken.

487
00:29:49,304 --> 00:29:52,990
All of Mijeong's men love chicken.

488
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,320
Men?

489
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,120
I also liked it when Mijeong worked part-time at a tartare place.

490
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,679
Also, the pork belly restaurant!

491
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:02,480
A Sashimi place too!

492
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,110
You don't have a girlfriend?

493
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,240
Because I heard you have a lot of girls.

494
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,110
My girlfriends would be sad to hear that.

495
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:15,050
I just have a lot of love to give.

496
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:20,179
How nice of you to come when you have so much love to give. I'm so grateful I could die.

497
00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:22,790
What till you die?

498
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:30,830
 - Doesn't it smell hice, huh? 
- Yes. 

499
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,320
 This place is so good. It's still the same. 

500
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,779
Once you eat, you'll be surprised.

501
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,220
Thank you.

502
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,400
I only saw these in Japanese dramas.

503
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,020
It's actually my first time here.

504
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,480
You were worried about Joon making fun of you.

505
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,320
Yes.

506
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,540
You know how I feel.

507
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,979
I thought he would look down on me if it was my first time here.

508
00:30:59,979 --> 00:31:01,780
And he already looks down on me.

509
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:06,270
Joon... is comfortable with you.

510
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,100
No way.

511
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,490
With me?

512
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,900
I know you were probably angry earlier.

513
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,960
I haven't seen Joon joke around in a while.

514
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,570
And he needs to from time to time.

515
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:22,670
He's lucky to have you.

516
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:27,670
I feel useful now that you say that.

517
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,279
Do you know what my nickname was at work?

518
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:31,760
"Do it Geunyoung."

519
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,678
Everyone used to say, "Just make Geunyoung do it."

520
00:31:34,678 --> 00:31:37,766
There's something more in you.

521
00:31:37,766 --> 00:31:40,579
You're such a sweet talker.

522
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:45,950
I feel like you actually like Hoo Joon.

523
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:48,950
Back when I was a road manager,

524
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:52,060
I was on the freeway from Busan to Seoul.

525
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,670
On the road, the car just stopped.

526
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,120
I called the insurance company.

527
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,390
And that's when I knew.

528
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:59,520
I was out of gas.

529
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,760
I was just plain dumb.

530
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,920
So what happened?

531
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,270
We didn't make the appointment.

532
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:07,530
And my boss called me all kinds of names.

533
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:10,479
I thought I was done with Joon.

534
00:32:10,479 --> 00:32:12,380
How are you still here?

535
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:16,070
When I walked out of the room, Joon was waiting for me.

536
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:18,080
So I apologized to him.

537
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,580
And he said, "For what?"

538
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,690
He said, "You're busy and new."

539
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,190
"Of course you'll make mistakes."

540
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,679
"I don't know what he's so mad about."

541
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:26,790
Really?

542
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:27,540
Hoo Joon?

543
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:30,170
Yes, Hoo Joon did.

544
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:33,178
He said he was able to rest because of my mistake.

545
00:32:33,178 --> 00:32:36,170
He was never more happy than in that tow truck.

546
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:38,210
He thanked me.

547
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:42,760
And he asked me to stay and be his manager.

548
00:32:47,708 --> 00:32:49,450
I can't believe that.

549
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:54,850
You can't make up heartfelt stories of him like that.

550
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:56,480
He's a good guy.

551
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,170
He made his debut at a young age.

552
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:02,280
And he learned the world is so tough and calculating.

553
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,130
Therefore, he didn't have the time to be sweet.

554
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:08,876
But he's actually a sweet kid at heart.

555
00:33:08,876 --> 00:33:11,180
I'm a witness.

556
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:17,830
 Just... stay here. 

557
00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:24,800
 I'm doing it so you'll feel hot. 

558
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:26,850
 We're late. 

559
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:28,580
 Let's run. 

560
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,510
Eat them before they get cold.

561
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,730
I don't know why I said all that.

562
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:59,250
Hey!

563
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,420
 That woman... 

564
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:21,560
 I think it's her. 

565
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,280
 And you hurt him deeply. 

566
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,990
 What are they talking about? 

567
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:46,900
 She was crying then, too. 

568
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,750
 She's crying now as well. 

569
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,480
You're here.

570
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,042
I'll distribute them.

571
00:35:07,042 --> 00:35:09,360
It smells so good.

572
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,110
You should've told me.

573
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:23,070
Why do that with people watching?

574
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:30,720
Who's there?

575
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,230
 I'm delivering ramen. 

576
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,270
Mr. Seo.

577
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:38,320
You look...

578
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:42,040
I delivered all the ramen to the people who ordered.

579
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,300
This is what's left.

580
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,370
Yes, thank you.

581
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,810
Is Geunyoung resting?

582
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,730
I think she fell asleep.

583
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:51,610
Good night.

584
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:54,520
Thank you. Good night.

585
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,562
I think it's all soggy now.

586
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:06,770
Help yourself.

587
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,379
Sleep well.

588
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,579
I should let you go.

589
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,952
I just can't yet.

590
00:36:40,952 --> 00:36:43,720
And I still...

591
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,350
I still...

592
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:54,560
 Your message has been recorded. 

593
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:00,460
...need you.

594
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:06,250
♫  Please don't leave me  ♫

595
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:13,010
♫  I'm just a little kid  ♫

596
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:20,410
♫  Do you want to see me heartbroken?  ♫

597
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:24,680
 And I still... 

598
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,280
 I still... 

599
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,610
 That's the end of your messages. 

600
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:42,470
♫  Ah, I'm left alone again  ♫

601
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:54,460
♫  Where will my lonely heart end  ♫

602
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:00,350
   

603
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:03,120
Yes, sir.

604
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,479
Yes.

605
00:38:06,479 --> 00:38:08,330
I'm sorry.

606
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:14,340
I'll... take care of it.

607
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,779
 Let go of me. 

608
00:38:30,779 --> 00:38:33,390
 Hey. 

609
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:35,179
 Are you in your right mind? 

610
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:37,370
 I told you to stay away from her. Yet you bring her all the way here? 

611
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:39,490
 Stop it, Jihyang. 

612
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:41,270
 Don't say my name. 

613
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,960
 How long will you do this? 

614
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,290
 How long are you going to be around him? 

615
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,618
 You're mistaken. Stop it. 

616
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:49,420
 I asked him to come out. 

617
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,590
 If he didn't, I was going to... 

618
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:54,210
 If you were going to abandon him for a prick like that, then it's over with him. 

619
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:56,230
 You were his everything 

620
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,680
 and you hurt him deeply. 

621
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,080
 What are you doing here? 

622
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,080
 His wounds are still not healed. 

623
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,420
 Stop it, Jihyang. 

624
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,390
 Inhyung... 

625
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:07,870
 If you have some conscience, please stay away. 

626
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:10,710
 Okay. 

627
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:13,426
 Jihyang's right. 

628
00:39:13,426 --> 00:39:16,470
 I wasn't being thoughtful. 

629
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:18,800
 I'm sorry. 

630
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:25,190
♫  It blows like the wind in my heart  ♫

631
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:25,970
Don't go.

632
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:32,260
♫  It flows and comes to me like a river  ♫

633
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:41,460
♫  A love that I can't go back and forget  ♫

634
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:47,240
♫  It's blowing, blowing in my chest  ♫

635
00:39:51,390 --> 00:40:00,940
♫  It blows... in my heart  ♫

636
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:17,970
Good morning.

637
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:19,950
You're all up early.

638
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:24,530
A breakfast buffet is a must in hotels.

639
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,940
Enjoy your food, everyone.

640
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,412
Hoo Joon looks...

641
00:40:29,412 --> 00:40:31,200
You caught a cold?

642
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:36,170
Geunyoung also looks...

643
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,540
like she didn't sleep well last night.

644
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:40,940
Everyone looks like they aren't doing too well.

645
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:44,210
What's wrong?

646
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:45,470
Let's get more food.

647
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,400
Why? I just got my food.

648
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,400
More?

649
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,110
 What? 

650
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:57,470
Did you have ramen last night?

651
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,260
No. I didn't.

652
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:03,630
It's your first time in Japan. Why not?

653
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:07,760
The noodles got too soggy.

654
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:11,680
I don't know if it's because of the rain...

655
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,690
or because of someone.

656
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:18,350
Help yourself.

657
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,710
I'm sorry, can you eat it?

658
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:26,579
I'm sorry for the trouble. I'll go upstairs and get some rest.

659
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:28,490
Don't worry about me and eat.

660
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,680
What?

661
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,879
He's being mean again?

662
00:41:34,879 --> 00:41:36,390
He's always mean.

663
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:38,770
It's probably because he's more embarrassed.

664
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:43,570
Who was that woman yesterday?

665
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:45,630
What woman do you mean?

666
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:48,640
Hey!

667
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,979
Don't be surprised.

668
00:41:49,979 --> 00:41:51,390
I won't ask more.

669
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,770
You'll be at the shoot too, right?

670
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:57,380
Of course.

671
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,010
Not coming?

672
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,870
Director, you're here.

673
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:39,610
Okay.

674
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:40,520
How is it?

675
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,150
Very nice thanks to you.

676
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:43,622
You're a professional.

677
00:43:43,622 --> 00:43:45,790
Just a second.

678
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,790
- Where is the female model? 
 - She's not ready.

679
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:49,370
Is the rookie crazy?  Call her.

680
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:50,890
That's interesting.

681
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:53,640
What kind of rookie makes the top star wait?

682
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,540
 They're here. 

683
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:00,279
 I'm sorry. 

684
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,640
 It's her. 

685
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:07,240
 I'm sorry. 

686
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,890
I'm sorry. I apologize.

687
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:13,430
Get ready and let's go.

688
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:16,770
It's okay so don't be nervous.

689
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:20,150
Thank you.

690
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,190
 Hoo Joon's costar is... 

691
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:32,230
 that woman? 

692
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,180
Hello.

693
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,490
Hello.

694
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:40,710
I'm the CEO of her company.

695
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,600
Why is Jaejoon...

696
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,670
Nice to meet you.

697
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:45,900
A pleasure.

698
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,070
Isn't that Oh Inhyung?

699
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:49,610
And JJ is next to her?

700
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:51,380
Sit here.

701
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:54,472
- A weird combo. 
 - Why?

702
00:44:54,472 --> 00:44:58,570
The three were in the same company before.

703
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:02,140
Come on. You know nothing.

704
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:06,080
I need to check on some stuff.

705
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,680
 Here's the script. You'll take a stroll along the beach... 

706
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,510
- Oh, that! 
 - Yeah.

707
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,120
 Reset. 

708
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,620
 Goodness! 

709
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:17,910
- Geunyoung. 
 - Hello.

710
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:19,560
Why are you here?

711
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:23,450
Oh, the female star there is in my company.

712
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,900
Oh... the one I saw at the station?

713
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,900
Right, I said you wouldn't know her.

714
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,060
You don't, right?

715
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,220
Of course not.

716
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,230
How would I?

717
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:37,550
It's so windy.

718
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:05,250
Nice.

719
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:10,976
It must be.

720
00:46:11,276 --> 00:46:13,380
It's worth seeing.

721
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,910
It must be hard to face each other.

722
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:17,720
Huh?

723
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,110
What?

724
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:21,830
It's so sunny.

725
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:23,780
It must be difficult to face each other.

726
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,670
Right.

727
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:37,650
How would it feel?

728
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,680
It must feel indulgent...

729
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:41,930
What?

730
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:47,000
The sand is so soft that my feet feel like they fell in.

731
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,590
You can fall into it.

732
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,070
You like her?

733
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:59,410
The ocean?

734
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:01,970
Not really.

735
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:04,080
It's so windy.

736
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:07,000
Too much wind can become annoying.

737
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:13,870
Even though it's a beautiful sight?

738
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:18,320
There are beautiful landscapes that are unpleasant that I don’t particularly want to see.

739
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:25,179
That's sad.

740
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:48,250
It's getting hot.

741
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:49,330
And stuffy.

742
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:50,810
I know.

743
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:55,000
Maybe since it rained yesterday. The weather keeps changing.

744
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,260
There must be a reason obviously.

745
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,840
There must be something.

746
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:05,470
What did you just say?

747
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:07,270
Me?

748
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:09,034
I said nothing.

749
00:48:09,034 --> 00:48:11,270
I'm hearing things.

750
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:16,130
The shoot must be almost over.

751
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:18,830
Geunyoung, see you next time.

752
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:20,279
Okay.

753
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,250
Do Jaejoon...

754
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:31,100
and that woman have something?

755
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,500
Geunyoung, we'll get ready for our show now.

756
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,114
Okay.

757
00:48:39,114 --> 00:48:41,170
- Finally. 
 - Yes.

758
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:58,440
 I'll have to solve this guy's mystery first. 

759
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:01,880
Shall we start, Geunyoung?

760
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,630
 What exactly happened between them? 

761
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:06,360
Go like this.

762
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,270
You haven't played this before?

763
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:18,680
Oh.

764
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,379
Just like this?

765
00:49:20,379 --> 00:49:21,650
Come on.

766
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:25,150
Oh no!

767
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:46,410
 What? 

768
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:51,510
 My heart must be crazy. 

769
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:04,950
I told you not to reveal your true intentions.

770
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:12,830
Shall we go again?

771
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:20,680
Everyone, stay still. Don't move!

772
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,120
Gosh.

773
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,270
Keep shooting!

774
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,700
Geunyoung!

775
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,430
No, Geunyoung!

776
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:28,416
Geunyoung!

777
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:29,310
Hoo Joon! That's it!

778
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:31,100
Let Hoo Joon do it.

779
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,620
I told you that going into the ocean wouldn't be okay!

780
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:35,879
Are you okay, Geunyoung?

781
00:50:35,879 --> 00:50:38,020
I said let's not do this!

782
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:39,679
Geunyoung!

783
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:40,870
I'm okay.

784
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:41,720
Be quiet.

785
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,930
Geunyoung, are you okay?

786
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:45,740
Hold on.  Are you okay?

787
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:47,860
Geunyoung... Geunyoung!

788
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:49,350
Geunyoung!

789
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:50,820
Don't open your eyes.

790
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,656
Geunyoung!

791
00:50:52,656 --> 00:50:54,390
What should I do?

792
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:56,930
Wake up.

793
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:58,910
Geunyoung.

794
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:00,410
Thank god.

795
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:02,452
You scared me.

796
00:51:02,452 --> 00:51:04,420
Thank god.

797
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:14,979
Don't I get something like a Brave Citizen award?

798
00:51:14,979 --> 00:51:16,190
Good job.

799
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,979
Geunyoung, you want another towel?

800
00:51:19,979 --> 00:51:21,610
I'm fine.

801
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,560
Have you come back to your senses?

802
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,810
AT the beginning of the shoot, you were distracted.

803
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:31,850
Why fall there?

804
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:33,930
Who wants to fall when they fall?

805
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:36,540
You pushed me hard.

806
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,900
From now on,

807
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,190
only focus on me.

808
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,206
Why's he working himself up?

809
00:51:53,206 --> 00:51:54,520
Man.

810
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,770
He's two-faced.

811
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:26,220
I thought he was gay.

812
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,379
I guess he's not.

813
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:34,360
Then the woman is...

814
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:37,896
tteokbokki?

815
00:52:37,896 --> 00:52:39,940
Is it like this?

816
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:43,370
Then what's JJ?

817
00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:56,700
I'm not a detective.

818
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,400
Forget it.

819
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:23,782
My goodness.

820
00:53:23,782 --> 00:53:26,520
You look well-rested.

821
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:32,360
You're not sick?

822
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,300
I didn't know you could worry.

823
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,120
Are you sick?

824
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:42,270
I think I'm fine.

825
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:43,940
I'm well-rested.

826
00:53:45,379 --> 00:53:47,200
Just don't make me sick.

827
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:51,740
Why am I talking?

828
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:52,970
Geunyoung.

829
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:54,520
There's no shoot today.

830
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,810
Do you want to hang out with us?

831
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:57,680
Where is everyone?

832
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,680
Ms. Noh was already gone when I woke up.

833
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,640
They all went shopping.

834
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,810
Are they here to work or hang out?

835
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:04,970
The first episode is today.

836
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:07,310
So they thought we should all watch it together.

837
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:10,600
Come with us.

838
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,430
Leave her. She doesn't want to.

839
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:14,670
Don't beg her.

840
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,770
He must feel better.

841
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:24,220
He's complaining.

842
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:25,179
Come with us.

843
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:27,174
Today's the last day.

844
00:54:27,174 --> 00:54:29,230
Yes, Mr. Seo.

845
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,220
I think I left my wallet in the car.

846
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:46,220
Go to the udon restaurant first with Geunyoung.

847
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:48,130
I'll be right back.

848
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:52,060
He's so forgetful sometimes.

849
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:55,770
I guess you don't realize who makes him that way.

850
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:56,560
What?

851
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:59,160
Let's look around here.

852
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:04,820
This is cute.

853
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,600
They have it in all colors.

854
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,979
It must be a unique character to Okinawa.

855
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:17,618
I should buy these as gifts.

856
00:55:17,618 --> 00:55:20,179
This isn't in Korea, right?

857
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:22,940
What the?

858
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:24,590
Where is he?

859
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:28,020
He's really...

860
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,660
He should've told me he was leaving.

861
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:49,830
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes.

862
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:53,050
Can I help you?

863
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:55,470
I'm sorry.

864
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,020
What should I do?

865
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,180
Why didn't you go first?

866
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:20,470
Where's Geunyoung?

867
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:21,720
She was right here.

868
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,100
You guys were together.

869
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:24,520
I just...

870
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:27,220
Where could she have gone? Seriously.

871
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:29,560
Now she's lost?

872
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,840
It's her first time here.

873
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,400
Her phone doesn't work right now.

874
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:57,760
 Oh, seriously... 

875
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,730
 Where is she? 

876
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:21,330
It's okay.

877
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:24,120
I just need to get to the hotel.

878
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:26,110
Okay...

879
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:29,150
What was the name of the hotel?

880
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:11,630


881
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:20,900
I really want to go home.

882
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:25,170
I shouldn't have come with them.  What is this?

883
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,590
Mom.

884
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,520
I found you.

885
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:43,320
I told you to focus on me.

886
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:47,520
♫  I wonder what is love  ♫

887
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:52,010
♫  I want to know what is love  ♫

888
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:55,980
♫  Your lovely look  ♫

889
00:59:55,980 --> 01:00:00,330
♫  What is this taste?  ♫

890
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:04,430
♫  I wonder what is love  ♫

891
01:00:04,430 --> 01:00:09,130
♫  There is no answer, it's just a question  ♫

892
01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:16,830
♫  Are you falling in love too?  ♫

893
01:00:17,812 --> 01:00:19,396
 I thought you'd embrace her. 

894
01:00:19,396 --> 01:00:21,271
 Protect her till the end. 

895
01:00:21,271 --> 01:00:22,729
 It's you, right? 

896
01:00:22,729 --> 01:00:24,479
 Is the abandoned more scared? 

897
01:00:24,479 --> 01:00:26,396
 Or the person who abandoned you? 

898
01:00:26,396 --> 01:00:29,846
 Hoo Joon walked around with that anti-fan. 

899
01:00:29,854 --> 01:00:31,646
 Are you really trying to kill Hoo Joon? 

900
01:00:31,646 --> 01:00:33,687
 I'll really kill you! 

901
01:00:33,687 --> 01:00:36,579
 This shall pass, too. 

902
01:00:36,579 --> 01:00:39,054
 They won't kill me. 

903
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:44,879
 Geunyoung, I'll have to protect you. 

904
01:00:48,046 --> 01:00:52,896
