1
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,350
   

2
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,220
   

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,030
   

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,720
   

5
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,040
   

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:31,360
   

7
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:39,990


8
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:53,220
   

9
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,300
Lee Geunyoung.

10
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,530
This isn't an accident.

11
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:14,830
 ♫ I want to draw everything I imagined with you ♫ 

12
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,230
 ♫ If I just look at it ♫ 

13
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,800
 ♫ I turn around and regret ♫ 

14
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,370
 ♫ What would it have been like? ♫ 

15
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:29,760
 ♫ Would you be in a different world ♫ 

16
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,570
This isn't a mistake, an accident, nor am I just playing with you.

17
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,280
So don't doubt me from now on.

18
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,110
 ♫ Someone else by my side ♫ 

19
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,590
 ♫ When it rains, it becomes your umbrella ♫ 

20
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,320
That was it?

21
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,037
The thing you wanted to surprise me with?

22
00:01:56,037 --> 00:01:57,340
You succeeded.

23
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,400
It's not like I sent out a missing scene.

24
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,650
Haven't you read the comments?

25
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:04,700
Didn't you see the angry fans who said they would set fire to the broadcasting station?

26
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,670
I'm finally burning down the station after 10 years.

27
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,770
Oh. Really?

28
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,910
But what would have been used for the finishing materials of the broadcasting station?

29
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,010
Why am I even talking to this carefree man?

30
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:23,070
Either the station burns down or I do.

31
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,379
It'll all be the same.

32
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,620
Don't do this.

33
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,310
Let's go have some beer.

34
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,879
I thought the station was going to burn down?

35
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,670
Let's go before it does.

36
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:35,060
How can you think about having a beer right now?

37
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,320
What will I say to them tomorrow?

38
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,460
What?

39
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,270
Are you only starting to worry now when thinking about the shoot tomorrow?

40
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,420
Right.

41
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,300
Of course. Producers are also humans, worrying is a normal thing.

42
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,875
Do you think...

43
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:00,110
Did I come back to you after 10 years for this?

44
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,830
Noh Dohee.

45
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:07,370
Are you... going to keep it burning?

46
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,646
What?

47
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,150
You're finally getting concerned?

48
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,270
But I still don't think you care enough.

49
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,970
Someone who has everything...

50
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,270
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,120
Stop talking.

52
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,820
Why not?

53
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,620
If you do...

54
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,820
I'll want to kiss you.

55
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,500
What I mean is...

56
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,650
I mean that...

57
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,079
It's burning inside for me.

58
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,150
Come on.

59
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,310
You're the best at making mistakes.

60
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,970
I-I don't mean to make mistakes.

61
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,440
What I mean...

62
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,042
So?

63
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:50,270
You're not going to?

64
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,080
Huh?

65
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,610
Then let's just make a mistake.

66
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,820
Drive safe.

67
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,579
Okay.

68
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,520
You're not getting out?

69
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:20,920
What?

70
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,720
Should I stay?

71
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,420
Go.

72
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,590
Don't read the comments, just go to bed.

73
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,879
Make sure to lock the door before you sleep.

74
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,870
I'll be going.

75
00:04:35,179 --> 00:04:37,960
I'll go after you go in.

76
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,140
"This isn't an accident."

77
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,620
He said it was not an accident.

78
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,240
He grabbed my arm like this first.

79
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:11,540
How can I go home comfortably when you are like this?

80
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,370
Go home.

81
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,900
 Please enter quickly.  The doors are closing. 

82
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,110
Cute.

83
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,250
How embarrassing!

84
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,779
 What a witch! 

85
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:31,520
 Aiming her lips while pretending to be an anti-fan? 

86
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,020
 What a twist! Sixth sense level, reversal. 

87
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,910
"She just needs a beating..."

88
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:40,579
This is more serious than I thought.

89
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,400
Should I kill the producer?

90
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,700
When the hell will they show me properly as a normal person?

91
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,130
I can't just blow up the station!

92
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,830
What is Ms. Noh doing?

93
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,110
All she does is laugh and flirt all day long.

94
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,920
As far as I know, that all I know she knows how to do!

95
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,870
Right.

96
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,320
I have some good people on my side, too.

97
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,620
 A traitor! 

98
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,940
 Isn't she a psychopath? 

99
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,750
What the?

100
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,930
 How can she change into an anti-fan? 

101
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,710
You've abandoned me, too?

102
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,394
 I'm the administrator. 

103
00:06:29,394 --> 00:06:31,830
 Let's stop with the judgment for the time being. 

104
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,570
 It seems like she was trying to harm Who Joon. 

105
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,170
I knew it.

106
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,980
Mr. Administrator.

107
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,210
Right.

108
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:43,220
I should at least have one person on my side.

109
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,820
Why does he hate Who Joon so much though?

110
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,580
He knows nothing about him.

111
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,380
   

112
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:18,500
I can't go anywhere anymore because of the fans.

113
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:23,050
Taking a walk before filming has become a luxury.

114
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,960
Now this is my room now, too.

115
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,170
Stop laughing.

116
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,420
Was that accident so funny?

117
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,290
It wasn't an accident.

118
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,070
People are going crazy online right now. Of course, it was a mistake.

119
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,920
I thought you were talking about yesterday.

120
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,284
Geunyoung, you came early.

121
00:08:28,284 --> 00:08:30,579
You're here early, Geunyoung.

122
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,574
Geunyoung.

123
00:08:33,574 --> 00:08:36,670
Did I tell you that yesterday we hit our highest viewer rate?

124
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,930
Oh, Mr. Han.

125
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,020
Did I tell you I got criticized in the worst way imaginable yesterday?

126
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,464
You've just hit rock bottom, not a big deal.

127
00:08:44,464 --> 00:08:47,630
That just means now you can fly─

128
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,150
To be honest, Geunyoung,

129
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,920
we tried our best, too,

130
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,679
but everything was captured on film

131
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:58,290
and we can't just not use it.

132
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,370
Fans will calm down soon.

133
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,710
- Okay? 
 - Wow.

134
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,570
It's not like you to say what you don't mean.

135
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,970
Yeah?

136
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:15,200
To be honest, it's not like you both kissed while you were dating for real.

137
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,940
So at least a situation like that will never happen in real life.

138
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,210
Of course not.

139
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:22,340
That will never happen.

140
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,306
Right.

141
00:09:24,306 --> 00:09:25,379
Geunyoung.

142
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:27,550
It's only a TV show.

143
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,770
Geunyoung.

144
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,390
Why do you keep reading the comments?

145
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:41,920
And honestly, the comments were always mean, not just yesterday.

146
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,480
They were very a bit harsh.

147
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,779
Toxic!

148
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:47,312
I so pissed, Geunyoung.

149
00:09:47,312 --> 00:09:48,770
I'm going to die from the heat.

150
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:52,070
By the way... are you sure you are not feeling well, Baby?

151
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,979
Your skin looks great.

152
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:56,870
Right?

153
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,680
Yes.

154
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,820
Is that true?

155
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,320
Are you dating, Geunyoung?

156
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,370
What?

157
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,790
You can't get caught dating someone until the show is over.

158
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,550
If you—

159
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,290
Did something good happen to you, too?

160
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:17,750
Aren't you the one who's dating?

161
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,479
No.

162
00:10:20,479 --> 00:10:23,520
I've always been difficult to date, okay?

163
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,579
Come on.

164
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,180
Hoo Joon.

165
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,390
You're here?

166
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,740
You saw me coming in.

167
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,310
You enjoyed yesterday's episode, right? But... who's that?

168
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,679
Today, the youngest came instead.

169
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:46,320
Good news is that we hit our highest ratings.

170
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,280
Bad news is?

171
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,180
To be honest, yes, Hoo Joon,

172
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,000
we do care about the negative reactions.

173
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,560
But we can't not show it once it's been caught on camera.

174
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,260
The anger from the fans will die down.

175
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,700
It's not like you kissed while you were really dating.

176
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,920
So, it'll never happen again.

177
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,520
Oh?

178
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,320
You laughed.

179
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,060
That's right.

180
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,550
This is better than the messing around badly with the broadcast.

181
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,988
Yes, this is better.

182
00:11:22,988 --> 00:11:24,720
I'll get ready.

183
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,220
Yes.

184
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,350
She overreacted. She must be in a relationship.

185
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,720
Who's in a relationship?

186
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,190
Huh? Nothing.

187
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,370
Geunyoung just looks much better.

188
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,680
By the way, Joon,

189
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,020
Jihyang's not with you today

190
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,079
and a young man came instead?

191
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,158
Yes.

192
00:11:46,158 --> 00:11:48,680
- Jihyang had some other business. 
 - Oh.

193
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,820
The youngest...

194
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,120
Do your best today.

195
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,790
   

196
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,720
 Let's really stop. 

197
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,270
 The contract and... 

198
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,170
 You and I... 

199
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,079
 Let's just stop seeing each other. 

200
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:37,570
Do you think you get to decide about ending this?

201
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,979
I won't let you.

202
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,970
Did you call the law firm?

203
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:45,990
When are they coming?

204
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:49,610
 They asked that you come and see them. 

205
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,220
What?

206
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,080
Excuse me.

207
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:01,220
We've researched what lovers want to do the most at home together.

208
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:06,020
And we've selected fingernail painting and lying on each other's laps.

209
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,650
We'll do those.

210
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,640
The timing is a little off.

211
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,100
I think I'll get more backlash if we do that right now.

212
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,850
Let's make everything better by doing a good job today.

213
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,079
Indeed.

214
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,450
Hoo Joon always knows a bit about broadcasting.

215
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,300
Let's get started.

216
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,970
Good luck, Geunyoung.

217
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:33,180
We're rolling! Get ready, everyone!

218
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,640
You know the don't care about things like this.

219
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,560
Let's do this well.

220
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,070
It'll be okay.

221
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,790
Doing the nails and what?

222
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,880
I don't know.

223
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,020
Laying on your lap?

224
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:51,070
I think that one's all right.

225
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,520
 ♫ If I just look at it ♫ 

226
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,020
 ♫ I turn around and regret ♫ 

227
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,710
 ♫ What would it have been like? ♫ 

228
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:07,370
 ♫ Would you be in a different world ♫ 

229
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:11,190
 ♫ From someone other than you?♫ 

230
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:15,079
 ♫ I can't even imagine it ♫ 

231
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:19,290
 ♫ Someone else by my side ♫ 

232
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:24,120
 ♫ When it rains, it becomes your umbrella ♫ 

233
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,210
 ♫ And the shade on a hot day  ♫ 

234
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:34,290
 ♫ Footsteps walking side by side with you ♫ 

235
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:39,979
 ♫ That my love is only you ♫ 

236
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:45,280
 ♫ I hold your hand casually ♫ 

237
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:48,100
What's going on with those two?

238
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,156
They look much sweeter than we expected.

239
00:14:52,156 --> 00:14:54,050
 A little harder please. 

240
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,064
- I like that. 
 - I was worried for nothing.

241
00:14:56,064 --> 00:14:58,690
I want to do it like that.

242
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,060
 Jealous? 

243
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,590
 If you're jealous, we can be sweet, too. 

244
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,400
What is this? They told me to come.

245
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,220
You must've waited a long time.

246
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,020
This is our CEO.

247
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,890
I'm Cho Hyun.

248
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,068
It's my first time meeting you.

249
00:15:41,068 --> 00:15:43,470
I heard that I was asked to come and I wondered who made that request.

250
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,770
We've looked at it.

251
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:48,060
Oh Inhyung has only a year left out of seven according to her contract.

252
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,740
And the contract did not explicitly state the termination part.

253
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,179
It looks like you took it lightly when signing with her.

254
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:57,890
So are you saying it's my fault?

255
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:58,790
Well, I get it.

256
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:02,160
You're saying I can't really stop her?

257
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,779
Of course, there's still the penalty part.

258
00:16:05,779 --> 00:16:10,780
If it's taken to court, I think we're the ones at a disadvantage.

259
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,500
In your opinion, there's no option left for us?

260
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,210
There was no advantage from the beginning.

261
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,250
That's why I'm asking you to find other ways.

262
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,560
We're not saying that we won't try to find a solution.

263
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:28,940
But for us, it won't look good to go to court with only a year left.

264
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,390
Isn't that why you are here to take care of it?

265
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,472
We're here because of your father.

266
00:16:33,472 --> 00:16:35,680
And his priority was profit.

267
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,170
Getting angry gets you nowhere.

268
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,560
You know who I am and you still act like this?

269
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,370
You think you'll keep your jobs even after you do this to me?

270
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,970
Please discuss it with your father.

271
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,050
I will excuse myself since I have a meeting.

272
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,020
What the hell?

273
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,580
What?

274
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,458
Is that so?

275
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:26,420
When can I receive it?

276
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,320
Where are you going?

277
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,940
Jaejoon told you to watch me?

278
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,970
Well, I guess I'd watch over me, too.

279
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,900
- Get in the car. 
 - I'm leaving the company.

280
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,580
So pretend like you didn't see me.

281
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:47,600
You're a celebrity. You can't hand out your own profile.

282
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,160
It doesn't look good.

283
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,930
I've been your manager for five years.

284
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,450
You think I would just...

285
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,450
report to him?

286
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,850
Hurry up and get in.

287
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,620
You'll catch a cold.

288
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,780
By the way,

289
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,740
is Lee Geunyoung really trustworthy?

290
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:14,156
Well, thanks to yesterday's episode, "It's My First Love," made everyone forget about the leak and everything... And I was really worried,

291
00:18:14,156 --> 00:18:16,220
but something doesn't feel right.

292
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,850
You saw that it was an accident.

293
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:22,180
And if it does make you feel really uncomfortable,

294
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,000
you should've said something to Mr. Han.

295
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,560
But you've stayed quiet about it.

296
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,220
But still,

297
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:30,810
even their CEO called me because of the all-time high ratings.

298
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,160
I had nothing to say.

299
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,300
Hey, Jihyang, tell them to be more mindful.

300
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,330
We...

301
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,890
have to keep Joon in good condition for his kissing scenes.

302
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,700
Yes, sir, I'll tell them.

303
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,640
By the way,

304
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,620
something funny happened.

305
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,890
The leaked song...

306
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:52,420
It's being shared and going viral.

307
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:56,140
Many people want it released officially through the website.

308
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,879
Whenever Hoo Joon does something, it ends up becoming a hit.

309
00:18:59,879 --> 00:19:00,990
So...

310
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,520
Let's release it officially.

311
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,680
Sir?

312
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,220
It's a leaked version.

313
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,620
Let's fix it a little bit first.

314
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,500
Hey. Are you new to the business?

315
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,790
The song's already fine as I'm seeing it.

316
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:17,130
Why get in all that trouble to fix it?

317
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:21,256
You just like how you don't have to spend more money.

318
00:19:21,256 --> 00:19:24,540
Even spending money is hard work.

319
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,130
By the way...

320
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,790
who's the guest female singer?

321
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,979
Oh, she's...

322
00:19:29,979 --> 00:19:31,670
an indie singer.

323
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,670
She was just the guide, so we're not sure.

324
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,430
All the better.

325
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,900
Indie singers are well-liked nowadays, right?

326
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,520
Let's play with the media and release it officially.

327
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,620
We can then reveal her face on stage later on.

328
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,390
I'll talk with the songwriter.

329
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,820
Our Hoo Joon...

330
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,300
he was born with so much luck in his life.

331
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,680
Whenever something comes up, he comes along to fix it.

332
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,070
What are we going to do, Joon?

333
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,770
Just pretend like you know nothing.

334
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,580
It's not like we're telling him who it is.

335
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,970
He'll find out someday.

336
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,500
She's so desperate, though.

337
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,400
At least, I should do this much.

338
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,100
Don't worry about it.

339
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,430
It will all work out.

340
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,410
Oh.

341
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:29,360
What happened in Japan?

342
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,970
Oh. Someone already picked it up.

343
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,460
Picked it up? Who?

344
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,680
I got his info,

345
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,270
but he doesn't answer his phone.

346
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,940
I did have someone look for him.

347
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,570
I think he...

348
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,970
wants to get away from me.

349
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,272
We'll find him.

350
00:20:49,272 --> 00:20:50,750
And while we do,

351
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,060
let's track down the ring, too.

352
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:53,990
Okay.

353
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,030
Try to get in touch with him for me.

354
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,130
Jihyang,

355
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,190
I have another favor.

356
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,350
I'm so sick of buying delivery food lately.

357
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,680
Sure. My goodness.

358
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,050
Thank you.

359
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:24,270
- Let me carry that— 
 - No, no, no. I'm fine.

360
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:28,390
You're busy. Go take care of the leaked song.

361
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,520
I'm worried.

362
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,180
What are you worried about again?

363
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,560
You think I can't carry this?

364
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,600
Not you. About Geunyoung.

365
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,260
I don't know if we should keep letting her stay here.

366
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,520
Go ahead and leave.

367
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,350
Bye.

368
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,720
- Bye. 
 - Take care.

369
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,979
Thanks, Bro.

370
00:21:44,979 --> 00:21:45,720
Take a rest.

371
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,340
Okay.

372
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,460
He should've told me he was coming.

373
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,140
Hey.

374
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,230
What is all this?

375
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,770
You can't...

376
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:30,470
go outside for a while so you will be stuck here, right?

377
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,430
So?

378
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:34,190
What do you mean so?

379
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,820
He wants to eat?

380
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,540
Are we cooking it here?

381
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,390
You probably didn't eat.

382
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,306
And it's not a time for eating.

383
00:22:47,306 --> 00:22:49,180
Speaking of which...

384
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,770
Many fans know this place now.

385
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:55,580
And I feel uncomfortable every time the staff comes.

386
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,630
Shouldn't I move out before things get more complicated?

387
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,220
Don't do that.

388
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,474
What?

389
00:23:02,474 --> 00:23:05,270
It would be easier for you to come in and out if I'm gone, too.

390
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:07,060
What do you mean better?

391
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,640
I'll be so lonely here.

392
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,979
Just think about it.

393
00:23:09,979 --> 00:23:13,475
There are traces of you everywhere in this house.

394
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:17,220
I clean up every day and I don't even have my stuff here.

395
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,540
Only that room has—

396
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,530
No. Just no for now.

397
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,730
Stay here.

398
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,510
You're going through so much...

399
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,630
because you met me.

400
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,520
All those mean comments...

401
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,410
and that negative attention.

402
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,390
So, you know.

403
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,720
Just stay here.

404
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,680
I'll be good to you.

405
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,620
Good job.

406
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:58,150
I'll cook something.

407
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,579
What?

408
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,690
You'll be amazed.

409
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:08,270
Hello.

410
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,728
Hello.

411
00:24:10,728 --> 00:24:13,820
This is Oh Inhyung, a rookie.

412
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,790
Ms. Noh.

413
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,970
Mr. Kim.

414
00:24:19,979 --> 00:24:21,350
You're doing great these days.

415
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,850
No, I'm not.

416
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:23,810
Maybe I am?

417
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:26,010
Still the same.

418
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,640
What are you looking at?

419
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,390
Oh.

420
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,430
Oh Inhyung.

421
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,890
She's really good.

422
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:32,430
I wonder why she hasn't made it yet.

423
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,462
Oh Inhyung? Who's that?

424
00:24:34,462 --> 00:24:37,480
People around here would say she's a "secondhand rookie."

425
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,270
Mr. Kim,

426
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,850
you're doing an audition program?

427
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:42,810
Yes.

428
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:43,770
Isn't she...

429
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,738
with JJ's company?

430
00:24:45,738 --> 00:24:49,970
JJ didn't even have her on the rookie list.

431
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,440
Well,

432
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,680
they said only "real rookies."

433
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,979
Come on.

434
00:24:54,979 --> 00:24:56,720
Aren't you a professional?

435
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,179
She used to train with Hoo Joon.

436
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:02,630
She's good for media attention.

437
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,960
Oh yeah?

438
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,930
Do you have her number?

439
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:06,810
I'll find out.

440
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:09,270
Please do.

441
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,810
Wow. You can cook.

442
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:23,350
But you can't judge the amount when cooking, right?

443
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:28,680
The original dish. People who are really good at cooking know just how much they need.

444
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,979
You have no idea, right?

445
00:25:29,979 --> 00:25:31,970
I have it all planned out.

446
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:34,220
See, I bet people take care of your food waste for you.

447
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,180
Too much food is bad because then you end up throwing it out.

448
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,220
When you cook—

449
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:41,360
You called someone?

450
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,628
No.

451
00:25:42,628 --> 00:25:44,110
Go check.

452
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,020
I'm scared.

453
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,960
Oh?

454
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,170
What the?

455
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,270
What are you doing?

456
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,150
Aren't you going to open it?

457
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,080
Hey!

458
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,560
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

459
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,560
Welcome.

460
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,460
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

461
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,470
Thank you all for coming.

462
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,890
You're welcome.

463
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:21,870
I was going to quit my part-time job if they didn't let me go on time.

464
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,770
It's such an honor to meet you.

465
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:28,140
- We passed each other last time. I'm— 
 - Yes. You're Shinhyuk.

466
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,430
You know my name.

467
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,020
It's really an honor.

468
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,680
Let's keep the greetings short,

469
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,020
I have food cooking.

470
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,640
You can cook?

471
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,060
It's nothing.

472
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,980
Take a look around.

473
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:42,650
Sit here.

474
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,530
 I can't believe it. 

475
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:49,810
 This place is huge. 

476
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,560
What did you do?

477
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,180
Surprised?

478
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,750
How is it? Are you a little moved?

479
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:01,430
Go have some fun with them.

480
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,640
 The sofa is nice. 

481
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,700
 It's just like on TV. 

482
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,020
 - How have you been? 
 - Oh my god! 

483
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,479
 This is so cool. 

484
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,020
 Enjoy your food. 

485
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,170
 Thank you for the food! 

486
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,979
To be honest,

487
00:27:19,979 --> 00:27:24,010
I didn't think you would actually invite us.

488
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,890
What did you take him for?

489
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:28,760
I believed in you, Big Bro.

490
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,979
Big Bro?

491
00:27:29,979 --> 00:27:32,140
Is Hoo Joon older than us?

492
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,775
Since he was 21 at his debut, he must be 27 right now.

493
00:27:35,775 --> 00:27:38,316
I think we're the same age.

494
00:27:38,316 --> 00:27:41,220
You know a lot about me.

495
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,979
To be honest, the fact that I'm studying law

496
00:27:44,979 --> 00:27:47,520
has a lot to do with you.

497
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,079
A top star can't trust just anyone.

498
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:52,430
And you often sing of things like the law of love

499
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,979
and the laws of attraction, so I knew you cared a lot about it.

500
00:27:54,979 --> 00:27:58,172
I realized how important the law is while listening to you.

501
00:27:58,172 --> 00:28:01,220
I hope you can advise me after you pass the bar exam.

502
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,600
Thank you.

503
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,780
Shinhyuk is funny.

504
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,630
When you're not filming, do you just leave this house alone?

505
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:13,060
Occasionally, he goes he comes and goes.

506
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,610
Huh? Hoo Joon's cup!

507
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:19,520
It's okay! Be calm, everyone.

508
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,740
Don't touch it. It's okay!

509
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,850
I'm sorry! I didn't do it on purpose.

510
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:24,970
Don't touch it.

511
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,430
You'll get hurt.

512
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,470
Change into this first.

513
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:31,420
Why do you have this?

514
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,520
This is Hoo Joon's.

515
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,180
Huh?

516
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,520
This?

517
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,470
Oh, yes!

518
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,140
It's mine.

519
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,390
- Oh... 
 - Yeah.

520
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,970
It's a bit short,

521
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,600
so it'll fit you perfectly.

522
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,922
Uh huh.

523
00:28:41,922 --> 00:28:44,480
Let's get you changed.

524
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,860
- Shin Hyuk opened up another bottle.  
- Just pour it.

525
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,680
We drink a lot every time we meet.

526
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,520
 It's okay. 

527
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,140
 That's okay. 

528
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:01,060
It's so pretty out here.

529
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:09,150
Being here like this,

530
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,730
makes me feel like I'm really at a friend's house.

531
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:17,120
You used to talk crap about Hoo Joon.

532
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,180
By the way,

533
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,798
why is he...

534
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:25,470
so nice to you?

535
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,000
Huh?

536
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,970
Who knows?

537
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:35,040
This house, this lifestyle...

538
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,620
It's totally different.

539
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,250
Right?

540
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,840
He lives...

541
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:44,879
in a different world from me.

542
00:29:44,879 --> 00:29:45,850
So what?

543
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,680
You're scared?

544
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,770
Hey.

545
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:49,979
I'm not scared.

546
00:29:49,979 --> 00:29:51,220
You think I don't know you?

547
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,560
- You always— 
 - I'm good at holding it back.

548
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,980
Don't hold it back.

549
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,760
Try to understand.

550
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,270
You know I know that,

551
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,320
even if no one else does.

552
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,880
You've done nothing wrong.

553
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,346
This girl.

554
00:30:16,346 --> 00:30:18,540
Come on.

555
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,930
I'm going for another shot.

556
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,020
By the way,

557
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,220
he can be a little tolerable.

558
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,180
Hey.

559
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,180
Come on.

560
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:46,400
Good job.

561
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:58,590
Take care, everyone.

562
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,556
Goodbye, everyone.

563
00:31:01,556 --> 00:31:02,928
You're staying?

564
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:04,920
Me?

565
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,060
I'm going, too.

566
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:06,790
She will.

567
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,220
It's where we shoot.

568
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,110
So we have to clean it up together.

569
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:13,970
Ah, all together.

570
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,860
Let's just get going.

571
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,860
We should go first.

572
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,850
Joon.

573
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:20,540
Until the next time,

574
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,730
please stay healthy.

575
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:24,360
Take care.

576
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,730
Don't worry about her. I'll take her home safely.

577
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,210
Please do.

578
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:28,870
Bye.

579
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,550
- Let's go. 
 - You should.

580
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,800
Goodbye, everyone.

581
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,060
- Bye, Shinhyuk. 
 - Bye.

582
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:37,200
Sober up, everyone.

583
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,510
 Goodbye! 

584
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:44,050
I drank a lot.

585
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:47,980
They're all heavy-drinkers.

586
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,080
Are you okay?

587
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,340
I'm done.

588
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,110
Great work.

589
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,610
It's me who should clean it.

590
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,570
Having guests over isn't easy.

591
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:10,470
So why did you do it?

592
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,780
It's enough for me that you had fun.

593
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:15,370
I had so much fun with them. It's really been a while.

594
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,750
Thank you.

595
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,940
You must be tired.

596
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,970
Go home and rest.

597
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:37,770
I drank so I have to stay over.

598
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:51,060
There's nowhere to sleep here. I don't know where you're going to sleep.

599
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,350
Don't worry.

600
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,390
I have so many rooms.

601
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:59,770
I can sleep on the second floor.

602
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:04,042
You still sleep in there?

603
00:33:04,042 --> 00:33:06,760
Why do you sleep in there, not on a bed?

604
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,500
It's not my house.

605
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,080
And it's comfortable there.

606
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,980
Sleep in the bedroom.

607
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,720
Okay?

608
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:22,350
Goodnight.

609
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:32,290
Goodnight.

610
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,200
Let's sleep, let's sleep, let's sleep.

611
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,310
 Sleeping? 

612
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:42,170
 I'm about to go to sleep. 

613
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:44,170
 You're not sleeping? 

614
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,990
 I should... 

615
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,750
 Good night. 

616
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,540
She's so cute.

617
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:09,979
This is Lee Geunyoung.

618
00:36:09,979 --> 00:36:12,178
She has a meeting today.

619
00:36:12,178 --> 00:36:14,120
This is the CEO.

620
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,150
Hello.

621
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,440
Ms. Lee Geunyoung.

622
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,479
Is the show going okay?

623
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:22,470
Well... yes.

624
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,690
Please take care of our Joon.

625
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:27,220
No scratches on that face or anything.

626
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,200
Yes.

627
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,400
Well then, please continue with your business and take care.

628
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,579
This way, please.

629
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,310
You're here.

630
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:45,060
Have a seat.

631
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,870
I'm sorry to have you come all the way here.

632
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,070
It's okay.

633
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:52,320
There weren't a lot of people out front.

634
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,330
I must not be so popular anymore.

635
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,454
Take responsibility.

636
00:36:55,454 --> 00:36:57,170
What the?

637
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,690
Joon's shooting a commercial.

638
00:36:58,690 --> 00:36:59,520
Again?

639
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,050
Wow. Congratulations.

640
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:01,830
Please treat me to a meal.

641
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:05,390
You and he are both going to be in that commercial.

642
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,260
Me?

643
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,440
Is the advertiser in his right mind?

644
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,620
She reads Socrates, so she knows herself well.

645
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:19,770
It's a company with which he's had an exclusive contract since his debut.

646
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,020
We thought that the reality show may put it in danger,

647
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,200
but they surprisingly liked the idea.

648
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,720
How loyal of them.

649
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,080
I understand their loyalty to Hoo Joon.

650
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,030
But why me?

651
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,360
You may have suffered from the negativity,

652
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,580
but from the standpoint of the industry, it's something positive for your career.

653
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:38,040
It's hard to build a definite image in such a short time.

654
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,180
What's more, your image compliments Joon's.

655
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,890
Your image fits the concept.

656
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:44,979
Yeah?

657
00:37:44,979 --> 00:37:48,870
We thought you might have trouble with the contract since you're alone.

658
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:53,950
If it's okay with you, Joon and I will help you along.

659
00:37:56,570 --> 00:38:02,580
Do I have to take responsibility for the resentment after the commercial goes out?

660
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,900
Why would you be?

661
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,879
I will.

662
00:38:04,879 --> 00:38:05,970
Don't worry.

663
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,680
That's not going to happen.

664
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,979
Nothing you worry about will come true.

665
00:38:09,979 --> 00:38:12,940
So... be confident, Geunyoung.

666
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,690
I've never done it before.

667
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,870
Nobody is born with acting talent.

668
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:22,970
No need to worry too much since your part isn't that big.

669
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,700
By the way, Jihyang.

670
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,290
You checked the whole thing?

671
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:28,670
They won't have her do anything weird?

672
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,879
Of course, I did. Look.

673
00:38:29,879 --> 00:38:33,400
You will look great together.

674
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:40,940
Don't get out, please. Please. Stop babying me.

675
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,920
Bye.

676
00:38:55,179 --> 00:38:57,810
You're just coming back?

677
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,040
It's just business.

678
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,940
Ah, you're so good at not mixing business with pleasure.

679
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,080
It's not that you wanted me to go crazy?

680
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,330
It's not that.

681
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:08,170
Hey.

682
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:11,460
Inhyung is with my agency.

683
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,540
And you do this without telling me?

684
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,279
What if I told you?

685
00:39:15,279 --> 00:39:17,800
Would you allow it?

686
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,640
You're blaming it on me now?

687
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,220
You, the guy who abandoned her?

688
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:28,690
I really want to stop talking about this with you.

689
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:32,880
Jaejoon, we can all help each other.

690
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,670
And I told you, I'll do whatever I want from now on.

691
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:40,750
If you wanted to release the single that much,

692
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:44,970
you should've revealed the name and admitted your connection.

693
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:47,370
But you can't.

694
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:52,640
This is why you're such a coward.

695
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,879
Just beg me to be good to her!

696
00:39:54,879 --> 00:39:56,750
Jaejoon!

697
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:59,000
Why are you doing this?

698
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,642
You weren't like this.

699
00:40:01,642 --> 00:40:06,410
You really... don't feel bad for her?

700
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:09,830
You've really changed.

701
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,500
 Joon! 

702
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,220
 You're finished now? 

703
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,650
 You have one more thing to do. 

704
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:34,779
 Let's talk on the way. 

705
00:40:34,779 --> 00:40:37,760
 It's a commercial shoot. 

706
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,190
  - It's crazy.
  - (Sorry.) 

707
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:41,360
 Get in quickly. 

708
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:00,020
 Joon. 

709
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,440
 We can't see each other today again? 

710
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,130
 Are you having trouble talking on the phone? 

711
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,670
Do I not feel bad for her?

712
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:25,390
I was the one who felt bad for her when she needed it.

713
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,380
How can I...

714
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,579
make both you and Inhyung...

715
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:50,390
happy?

716
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:14,950
 (Did you eat?) 

717
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:23,110
- Hello. 
 - You're here.

718
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:25,320
They'll do your makeup and styling over there.

719
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,860
- Follow Lara. 
 - Yes.

720
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,340
Shall we?

721
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,370
She's here.

722
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:39,320
- Are you done with Joon? 
 - Yes.

723
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:39,979
I'm done.

724
00:42:39,979 --> 00:42:42,120
You look nice, look at the mirror.

725
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:46,630
You're so pretty.

726
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:49,270
You're pretty.

727
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:50,550
- Wow. 
 - Ta-dah.

728
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,760
So pretty.

729
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,940
She's so pretty, right?

730
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,330
What is this right now?

731
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:56,770
Isn't her skirt too short?

732
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:58,580
Get a blanket or something.

733
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:01,144
Why? It's pretty.

734
00:43:01,144 --> 00:43:05,390
I meant get me a blanket. It's cold.

735
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:06,620
What is this outfit?

736
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:07,830
Get her something that suits her.

737
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:09,879
Mesh stockings. So manly...

738
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:10,870
What do you mean?

739
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:13,210
You're saying they don't suit me?

740
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,179
I didn't mean that.

741
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:16,660
The concept is—

742
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,900
We're ready to start the shoot.

743
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,220
Let's go.

744
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,879
Do this.

745
00:43:24,879 --> 00:43:27,820
You should've told them that you won't wear these.

746
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:30,679
It's the concept. I can't do anything.

747
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:31,710
Are you that embarrassed?

748
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:33,398
It's not that.

749
00:43:33,398 --> 00:43:35,079
Other people will stare.

750
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:37,070
I know. So you're embarrassed?

751
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:37,920
Joon.

752
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,610
Let's go.

753
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:41,320
Yes.

754
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,640
Her legs are so pretty.

755
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:57,390
   

756
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,070
It's just the preliminaries so be bold in your decisions.

757
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:04,879
Maybe half of them will make it on the show.

758
00:44:04,879 --> 00:44:06,140
Just do your best.

759
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,840
Yes.

760
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:13,560
   

761
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,650
Thank you.

762
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:31,770
Hello!

763
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,360
My name is Oh Inhyung.

764
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,350
Hello.

765
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:35,170
Nice to meet you.

766
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:38,300
You're not a trainee.

767
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,979
Well, no.

768
00:44:39,979 --> 00:44:44,170
I already had my debut but I'm basically a rookie.

769
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:47,470
You don't have an agency?

770
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:50,079
No.

771
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:52,890
Right now, I'm alone.

772
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,650
I'm here just like the other trainees.

773
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:56,860
Take good care of me.

774
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:57,830
Yes.

775
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:01,246
You're here now, so let's see it.

776
00:45:01,246 --> 00:45:02,870
Okay.

777
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:21,600
 ♫ Please don't leave me ♫ 

778
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:28,760
 ♫ I'm just a small kid ♫ 

779
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:36,360
 ♫ Do you want to see me heartbroken? ♫ 

780
00:45:37,166 --> 00:45:42,720
 ♫ I'm just a small kid ♫ 

781
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:57,750
 ♫ I'm left... alone... again ♫ 

782
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:10,470
 ♫ Where will my lonely heart end? ♫ 

783
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:10,370
You've gone crazy, too? Huh?

784
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:12,740
I must be crazy.

785
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:13,940
I'm not even scared anymore.

786
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,800
No agency?

787
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,110
In front of me?

788
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:20,079
I haven't been able to look you in the eyes like that in years.

789
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:23,070
So you're saying it felt good to stand there like that in front of me?

790
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:26,100
I just thought, "I used to be able to do this."

791
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,964
In the past, I could anyway.

792
00:47:27,964 --> 00:47:29,780
In the past?

793
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,420
Was it Hoo Joon?

794
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,600
You probably don't remember it well.

795
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,730
But all you ever saw of him was his back.

796
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:37,940
So you're afraid, huh?

797
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:40,579
That I might become popular?

798
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,352
Don't be too hopeful.

799
00:47:50,352 --> 00:47:53,060
You won't even be on TV.

800
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:54,979
Okay.

801
00:47:54,979 --> 00:47:58,144
I'm moving out of the house that you built.

802
00:47:58,144 --> 00:48:00,570
I just wanted you to know.

803
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,400
Where are we going?

804
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,190
Just get in.

805
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:26,320
Thank you.

806
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,408
I wanted to... do this with a girlfriend.

807
00:48:36,408 --> 00:48:38,690
Girlfriend...

808
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:39,690
What?

809
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:40,902
You're not?

810
00:48:40,902 --> 00:48:43,350
Never mind.

811
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:45,680
Do what, though? Go on a drive?

812
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,740
We've done that.

813
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:51,479
That's true.

814
00:48:51,479 --> 00:48:54,270
When did you get your license...

815
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:55,360
that you can't drive?

816
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,790
Are you teaching me how to drive right now?

817
00:48:58,790 --> 00:48:59,779
You don't know?

818
00:48:59,779 --> 00:49:04,900
You can't teach your significant other how to drive. You'll fight.

819
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:08,320
Where are we going though?

820
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:15,720
I just wanted to show you that I can drive with one hand.

821
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,050
You wanted to show off?

822
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:23,790
Yes.

823
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:24,679
Look.

824
00:49:24,679 --> 00:49:26,920
With just one hand.

825
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:37,420
Don't get out.

826
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:49,620
You want to walk?

827
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:52,170
We've also walked together many times.

828
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:54,270
We never really took a walk.

829
00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:55,460
That's true.

830
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:58,260
You should've told me then.

831
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,970
Well. Let's just walk.

832
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:08,210
I bought you some comfy shoes.

833
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:10,170
Why would you buy shoes for me?

834
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:11,710
Please stop with all that buying already.

835
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:13,730
I thought giving you shoes would help you run away.

836
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:14,779
I know.

837
00:50:14,779 --> 00:50:16,790
Why shoes again?

838
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:18,440
You were praying that I'd run.

839
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,360
No.

840
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:24,180
When you run away with the shoes from last time, come back wearing these.

841
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:33,520
If anyone were to see us, they'd think we'd just had plastic surgery.

842
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,360
We'll have to run if we bump into fans.

843
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:43,494
That's why you made me change into these.

844
00:50:43,494 --> 00:50:45,564
This makes it more obvious.

845
00:50:45,564 --> 00:50:47,440
Let's take them off.

846
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,460
You'll be okay?

847
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:50,720
Still.

848
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,320
It's okay.

849
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,290
Your shoes are untied.

850
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,580
What are you doing? I'll do it.

851
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:04,030
From now on... I'll tie your shoes.

852
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:09,410
You hold it together and follow me.

853
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:12,970
Okay. Get up.

854
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:17,200
At a time like this, can't you just say that I'm cute?

855
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:21,850
Super cute.

856
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,850
Let's go.

857
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:43,650
Oh yeah.

858
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:46,779
About... what did you save me as in your phone's contact list?

859
00:51:46,779 --> 00:51:48,110
Can you change it?

860
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:49,580
"Yama?" Are you serious?

861
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:51,920
When did you see that?

862
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,679
That's the name on your social media.

863
00:51:54,679 --> 00:51:55,640
You know that?

864
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:56,750
I know everything.

865
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:58,730
I'm your anti-fan.

866
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,100
What does it mean?

867
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:08,900
It's my father's ring.

868
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:09,540
What?

869
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:12,570
It's what it says on my father's ring.

870
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:14,879
 "Y-A-M-A" 

871
00:52:14,879 --> 00:52:17,282
Then your father, right now he's...

872
00:52:17,282 --> 00:52:21,338
Well... he must be well somewhere.

873
00:52:24,979 --> 00:52:27,020
Hey... Don't look at me like that.

874
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:29,340
You were just curious.

875
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:31,930
You also saw the ring.

876
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:33,420
- I did? 
 - Yes.

877
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,540
It's the one you found in Japan.

878
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:39,630
You found it after I had decided that it was good I had lost it.

879
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:40,680
That...

880
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,420
But then I lost it again.

881
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:46,470
When we went to pick it up, someone else had already taken it.

882
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:51,000
 You know this ring? 

883
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,170
 Yes. 

884
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,600
 It's like the one I found in Japan. 

885
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,710
 It's yours? 

886
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:00,879
 When you came to the hotel? 

887
00:53:00,879 --> 00:53:02,530
 Yes. 

888
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:07,200
Can you... stop the car right there?

889
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,170
What? Why?

890
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:08,970
Hurry.

891
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:11,210
Pull over for a second.

892
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:18,710
What's wrong?

893
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:21,520
Go home first, okay?

894
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:32,250
This is a first.

895
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,290
You asked to see me first.

896
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:36,570
I just wanted to.

897
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:38,870
Nice to see you.

898
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:40,390
Remember last time?

899
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:42,860
The ring you lost?

900
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,290
Oh. That.

901
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:46,525
I found it thanks to you.

902
00:53:46,525 --> 00:53:49,779
I meant to say thank you for helping me find it again.

903
00:53:49,779 --> 00:53:51,710
Can I see it for a second?

904
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:53,560
Sure.

905
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,550
Here.

906
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:09,350
What's the ring for?

907
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:14,150
It doesn't mean much.

908
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:16,790
Still, I felt bad for losing it.

909
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:20,890
Thanks to you, I found it.

910
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:25,130
Why?

911
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:26,890
Is something wrong?

912
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:28,690
You know...

913
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,360
I tried...

914
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:35,679
to understand you.

915
00:54:35,679 --> 00:54:39,140
I wanted to be a good friend to you.

916
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:40,250
What's wrong?

917
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:41,580
You  are scaring me.

918
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:47,670
When I hated Hoo Joon, you were there on my side.

919
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:50,290
And I was really thankful.

920
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:52,310
And now?

921
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:56,450
You don't hate him?

922
00:54:56,450 --> 00:54:57,310
Geunyoung,

923
00:54:57,310 --> 00:54:58,770
I told you.

924
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:00,210
You're being fooled by him.

925
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:02,370
And you?

926
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:08,670
How does it feel when you fool me?

927
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:10,779
Is it fun?

928
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:13,770
This ring...

929
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:17,320
You knew who this belonged to from the very beginning.

930
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:21,540
Even if I still hated him,

931
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:27,200
I can't be a friend who lets this go.

932
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,760
Where'd she go without telling me?

933
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:28,990
Hey.

934
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:30,922
Where the hell did you go?

935
00:56:30,922 --> 00:56:32,210
I'm so sorry.

936
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:34,920
What's wrong?

937
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:39,040
Here.

938
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:46,220
Why do you...

939
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:48,330
I was so stupid.

940
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:51,850
It's okay.

941
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:53,730
What's wrong?

942
00:56:57,170 --> 00:56:59,779
This ring gives everyone so much trouble.

943
00:56:59,779 --> 00:57:02,510
By the way... why go there yourself?

944
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:03,750
You could've just told me.

945
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:06,900
Of course, I should get it back, after what I'd done.

946
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,428
From now on, don't.

947
00:57:08,428 --> 00:57:12,180
Don't try to solve everything on your own.

948
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:14,410
You have me.

949
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,000
What?

950
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,979
You're just staring at me. Wearing my face out.

951
00:57:19,979 --> 00:57:23,630
You've become such a different person.

952
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:27,570
Do you want me to be mean to you again, then?

953
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:30,579
I think that might feel better.

954
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:34,270
By the way... what do you think it means?

955
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:36,460
Y-A-M-A.

956
00:58:15,279 --> 00:58:18,380
   

957
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:34,960
   

958
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:39,140
Long time no talk.

959
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,550
You called to apologize?

960
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,900
What are you saying?

961
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:47,070
I should be receiving an apology from you.

962
00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:48,540
Hey.

963
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:49,770
Let's keep it straight.

964
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:54,220
About Inhyung... did you have to say she was from "Hoo Joon's agency?"

965
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:56,936
 There's no need for us to get tangled up together. 

966
00:58:57,036 --> 00:59:00,840
And yet you let Joon and Inhyung sing a duet?

967
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,670
What?

968
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:05,250
So you didn't know.

969
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,500
You always stood up for Joon.

970
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:11,370
How fun to see you like this.

971
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:19,062
 You know what can happen to your precious Joon if I leak just one thing. 

972
00:59:19,062 --> 00:59:20,640
 So... 

973
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,770
Keep him on a short leash.

974
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:25,750
Hey.

975
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:27,770
The duet you—

976
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:30,890
He hung up.

977
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,510
He hangs up first, too?

978
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:42,340
Speak of the devil.

979
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:44,370
Hold on.

980
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:45,500
Yes, Jihyang.

981
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,670
 Youngseok is looking for you. 

982
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:47,670
 Where are you? 

983
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:50,070
 He's on his way to your house. 

984
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:52,100
I'll go to him. I'm outside.

985
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,140
Okay.

986
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,860
I have to go.

987
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:00,179
You have to work at this hour?

988
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:01,040
Sure.

989
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,210
You see now?

990
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:04,880
How hard your boyfriend works day and night?

991
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,020
Boyfriend...

992
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,170
Then what?

993
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:10,920
Do you do this...

994
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,560
with someone who's not your boyfriend?

995
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,079
You're that kind of woman?

996
01:00:15,079 --> 01:00:17,550
You're crazy.

997
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:19,225
You should go.

998
01:00:19,225 --> 01:00:20,970
Bye.

999
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:25,579
I'm using all my willpower right now. My feet don't want to move.

1000
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:31,080
See you later.

1001
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,048
Let me watch you go.

1002
01:00:33,048 --> 01:00:34,870
Then...

1003
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,740
Let me charge my battery.

1004
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:40,560
Hurry and go.

1005
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,350
You'll be late.

1006
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:46,100
I'm leaving.

1007
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,200
You'll be late.

1008
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:57,950


1009
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:01,960
♫   I'm your Pop Star  ♫

1010
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,550
♫  Oh yeah, eh  ♫

1011
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:14,070
♫  Remember, I'm always your one and only one  ♫

1012
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:17,330
♫  So that you can hear me all night long  ♫

1013
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:18,462
 What's wrong with your voice? 

1014
01:01:18,462 --> 01:01:19,337
 Lee Geunyoung... 

1015
01:01:19,337 --> 01:01:20,837
 I left it there. 

1016
01:01:20,837 --> 01:01:22,379
 What the? 

1017
01:01:22,379 --> 01:01:25,112
 I should've taken care of Jaejoon from the beginning. 

1018
01:01:25,112 --> 01:01:29,429
 How many people do you think know about Joon and Inhyung? 

1019
01:01:29,429 --> 01:01:31,454
 So many people here. What if someone sees us? 

1020
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:33,737
 I have someone I really want to protect. 

1021
01:01:33,737 --> 01:01:35,154
 You guys fooled me? 

1022
01:01:35,154 --> 01:01:37,512
 Meet someone on your level. 

1023
01:01:37,512 --> 01:01:38,462
 Cut. 

1024
01:01:38,462 --> 01:01:40,590
 That'll be it. 

1025
01:01:40,590 --> 01:01:45,960
♫  On that street you walked alone 
 In your evening night sky with no stars  ♫

1026
01:01:47,462 --> 01:01:52,329
    
 ♫  I'll be shining  ♫
