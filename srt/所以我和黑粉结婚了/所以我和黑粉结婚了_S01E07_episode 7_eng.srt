1
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,350
   

2
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,220
   

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,930
   

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,720
   

5
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,640
   

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,890
   

7
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:39,370


8
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,270
   

9
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:51,640
   
   

10
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,260
Ouch.

11
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,210
I really want to go home.

12
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:24,980
Why did I even come here?

13
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,090
Mom.

14
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,190
I found you.

15
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,690
I told you to focus on me.

16
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:50,430
♫  Baby, you... I still love you  ♫

17
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:58,790
♫  Baby, you... I'm still with you  ♫

18
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,720
Geez.

19
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,360
Where were you!

20
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,520
♫  Where do we go from now  ♫

21
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:13,370
♫  Baby, you... I'm still with you  ♫

22
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,190
Why is a grown woman crying in the street?

23
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:19,879
I thought you were there but when I looked back nobody was there...

24
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:22,050
I was so shocked...

25
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,280
I'm tired. Let's go.

26
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,700
Ouch.

27
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,500
What? You're hurt?

28
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,156
You're a handful.

29
00:02:32,156 --> 00:02:34,080
Come with me.

30
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,070
Fine, I'll give you a piggyback ride.

31
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,490
What do you mean, it's not that serious.

32
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,370
I said I'll carry you, so.

33
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,560
Your back is all sweaty, why would I want to get on?

34
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,979
And whose fault is that?

35
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:47,780
I ran all around here.

36
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,620
Stay in one place if your phone's not working.

37
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,420
And you should've told me it was your first time here.

38
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,660
Why lie?

39
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,370
Why am I even talking?

40
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,398
Fine. Just...

41
00:03:01,398 --> 00:03:03,450
Let's go.

42
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,000
- Give me your hand. 
 - I'm fine.

43
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,900
Just give me your hand.

44
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,580
You guys are here.

45
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,240
Something wrong?

46
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,446
The morning flight tomorrow might be delayed.

47
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:52,470
I hear that a typhoon's coming.

48
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,570
After all, the flowers of the overseas shooting are being isolated. 
  (T/N: being stranded is fun) 

49
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,890
Now's not the time.

50
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,730
If there's a typhoon we can just not go. Right?

51
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,120
We'll watch the first episode together with some food.

52
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,620
You're doing this even after the boss called you?

53
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,570
We have to go to the meeting with him in the morning.

54
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,390
What do we do then?

55
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,030
Of course, we need to get out of here quickly.

56
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,779
But I guess everyone's thinking the same thing as there are no seats.

57
00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:18,310
Our staff are waiting in the airport.

58
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,150
We have to go right away when we get the call.

59
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,770
Don't worry about me and Joon.

60
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,500
We can find our own way home tomorrow.

61
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,950
We'd really appreciate that.

62
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,150
- You should hurry and pack Geunyoung. 
 - Okay.

63
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,460
I can't be stuck here.

64
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,560
I miss my penthouse, even though it's not mine.

65
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,960
And I want kimchi.

66
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,520
Geunyoung.

67
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,180
- What do we do? 
 - What's wrong?

68
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,779
I got a call from the airport and there aren't enough seats.

69
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,370
Get in.

70
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,600
I'm sorry to leave you here.

71
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,590
Don't worry about it.

72
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,520
Mr. Han, don't feel too bad.

73
00:05:02,546 --> 00:05:04,450
Don't worry about him.

74
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:08,286
He doesn't want to go right now.

75
00:05:08,286 --> 00:05:09,779
Drink this.

76
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:11,120
I don't want it.

77
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,360
Don't worry.

78
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,680
We won't let the typhoon affect us.

79
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,780
I'm counting on you, Mr. Seo.

80
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,700
I feel safe leaving her with you.

81
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,000
Yes. You should go.

82
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,890
- Let's go. 
 - I don't want to go.

83
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,879
Bye.

84
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:27,120
Let's go.

85
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,350
 I really want to do this. 

86
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,500
 You don't care that I'm the costar. Right? 

87
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,140
 I don't care... 

88
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,570
 ...who plays the role. 

89
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,910
He doesn't care?

90
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,840
They're so funny.

91
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,410
If they really don't care,

92
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,110
should I put them both in the palm of my hands?

93
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,780
You must be really hungry

94
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,030
from crying and getting lost.

95
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,379
Not really.

96
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,590
Don't worry. Just rest.

97
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,560
"The hidden gem during a trip to Japan is the convenience store."

98
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,320
You don't know the saying?

99
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,918
Don't do anything dumb.

100
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:33,420
Eat this.

101
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,420
Bye.

102
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,650
I'm such a gentleman.

103
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,770
What's wrong with him?

104
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,520
Are these expired?

105
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,370
The convenience store food is so delicious.

106
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,980
Who is it again?

107
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,150
Flower delivery.

108
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,010
Jaejoon.

109
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,760
And octopus rice.

110
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,990
You came all the way here to give me this?

111
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,710
This is probably the best octopus rice in Japan.

112
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,870
You've just got to try it now that you're here.

113
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,800
Thank you so much for taking care of me.

114
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,290
 I'm meeting your dad's friend at dinner. 

115
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,620
 Get ready and come down to the lobby. 

116
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,430
 My flight is tonight. 

117
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,640
 I should go. 

118
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,770
 I'm here to give you this. 

119
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,270
Thank you so much.

120
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,850
 I'll buy you dinner sometime in Seoul. 

121
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,780
 Really? 

122
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,770
Take care.

123
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,090
Yes.

124
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,380
Geunyoung.

125
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,920
Yes?

126
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,646
You know.

127
00:08:18,646 --> 00:08:20,558
Remember last time?

128
00:08:20,558 --> 00:08:22,040
Any thoughts on the contract?

129
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,480
Come on.

130
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,830
You can stop joking around.

131
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,330
I'm not a star.

132
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:31,770
The fact that you offered me that was consolation enough.

133
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:35,880
It's not easy for the CEO of an agency to buy someone food to have them sign.

134
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,100
- Bye. 
 - Take care. Thanks again.

135
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,540
I see you are here.

136
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,779
What brings you here?

137
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,530
I'm here to meet a friend.

138
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,800
Since I'm here though, let's talk.

139
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,179
You must be uncomfortable with me.

140
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:12,030
It's not that comfortable.

141
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,820
What do you want?

142
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,870
Where's Jihyang?

143
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,540
He'll be here soon. What do you want?

144
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,730
How rude.

145
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,140
About your shoot with Inhyung?

146
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,960
Thanks for letting it slide.

147
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,070
I said I don't care who it is.

148
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,800
Right? I guess it doesn't really matter.

149
00:09:33,862 --> 00:09:36,112
It's just business.

150
00:09:36,112 --> 00:09:39,720
The past is the past.

151
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:45,879
You didn't need to come here to talk about that.

152
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:47,950
It doesn't matter now.

153
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,670
Since you don't care,

154
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,650
let me ask you directly.

155
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,954
Why don't you...

156
00:09:55,954 --> 00:09:58,236
come to my agency?

157
00:09:58,236 --> 00:09:59,310
My agency,

158
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,180
even our head company wants you.

159
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,160
Even this commercial was related to our company.

160
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,150
Well, it did get a bit noisy when Inhyung arrived because of that...

161
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:10,079
It doesn't have to be any messier than it is right now.

162
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,320
If you come over to my agency,

163
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,820
it'll all be so neat and tidy.

164
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,260
Neat?

165
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,640
And, of course, your terms...

166
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,760
will be better than Shooting Star.

167
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,879
It'll be split 8 to 2.

168
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,750
For commercials,

169
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,490
you'll get 100 percent. So neat.

170
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:37,280
You know that our head company is huge.

171
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,500
Isn't Shooting Star too small for you?

172
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,940
Didn't you want to make your debut in that small company and succeed?

173
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,270
Jaejoon.

174
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,020
I didn't move with you then,

175
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,070
do you think I will now?

176
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,100
Hey.

177
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,732
To be honest...

178
00:11:03,732 --> 00:11:07,110
haven't you been loyal long enough?

179
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,390
Now that the past doesn't matter,

180
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:13,350
you can be loyal to me and Inhyung.

181
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,870
If you come along, don't you think Inhyung could shine, too?

182
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,250
That's your job.

183
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,079
You won't let someone as good as her shine,

184
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,130
and you expect me to go to your agency?

185
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,386
That's why.

186
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,840
I'm trying my best right now.

187
00:11:29,979 --> 00:11:31,760
Bye.

188
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,379
What's this?

189
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,610
This is good.

190
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,080
 Did I tell you? 

191
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,920
 Geunyoung is also in negotiations. 

192
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,330
Don't do anything useless!

193
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:51,600
You can bring her with you.

194
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,470
You said you'd embrace your anti-fan.

195
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,320
You have to protect her till the end.

196
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,920
Joon.

197
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,150
What's the matter?

198
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,000
If he wants to pick a fight, let him.

199
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,630
Going over to his agency is nonsense.

200
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:19,020
Just a pick a route.

201
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,610
I guess the typhoon isn't the only thing that's changing its path.

202
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,090
I know.

203
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,920
Joon.

204
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,230
Your dad... he isn't Japanese.

205
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,620
His friend is also Korean.

206
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,770
You didn't mention that I'm looking for him, right?

207
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,080
Of course not.

208
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,040
Don't worry about it.

209
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,710
The car's here.

210
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,410
Let's go.

211
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,120
Where are they going?

212
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,480
I'm full.

213
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,540
Let's work off that meal.

214
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:17,000
Excuse me.

215
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,379
It's you, isn't it?

216
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:21,930
Hello.

217
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,590
Bye.

218
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,320
Excuse me.

219
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,520
Hoo Joon isn't inside.

220
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,920
Is that so?

221
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,830
I just came to say hello on my way to the airport.

222
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,579
I don't know where he is. He said he has business.

223
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:43,120
Yes. Let me call him.

224
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,020
Thank you.

225
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,079
Why is she here again?

226
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:57,870
What if Jihyang saw her?

227
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,350
 Hi, can I help you? 

228
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,710
Excuse me. My name is Seo Jihyang and I contacted you.

229
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,400
Have you seen this ring?

230
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,430
He'd gotten great help from him,

231
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,400
and he needs to find him.

232
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,170
I think it's right.

233
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,596
I know because I designed it.

234
00:14:37,596 --> 00:14:40,570
I made it with my friends in college.

235
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,370
1991.

236
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,100
That was our graduation year.

237
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,070
Something's written inside.

238
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:51,250
Everyone engraved what they wanted to.

239
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,390
By any chance,

240
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,350
do you still keep in contact with your friends?

241
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,530
Sure.

242
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:59,420
We all still wear our rings when we meet.

243
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,820
Isn't there anyone who's lost their ring and can't?

244
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,730
Everyone wears the ring since that's the point.

245
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:11,996
The '1991' here makes it certain.

246
00:15:11,996 --> 00:15:16,190
But the engraving... that I don't know about.

247
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,020
I'm sorry I can't help.

248
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,430
No problem.

249
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,140
Thank you for your time.

250
00:15:23,746 --> 00:15:26,730
We did have one more friend.

251
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,300
Huh?

252
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:34,760
   

253
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,560
 Yama? 

254
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:25,030
 It's your dad's ring. 

255
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,770
 The only thing that's his. 

256
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,370
 I thought I lost it. 

257
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,930
   

258
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:48,350
There must be a hot spring.

259
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:53,790
I know that hot springs are the highlight of any trip to Japan.

260
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,490
Shall we go?

261
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,750
Where have you been?

262
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,830
Did you have an appointment?

263
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,540
Where's Jihyang?

264
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:21,010
Did something happen?

265
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,320
Why's he like that again?

266
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,030
A ring...

267
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,520
This is definitely different from a public bathhouse.

268
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,590
Oh my god!

269
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,320
You must be crazy.

270
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,470
What are you doing here alone?

271
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:57,070
You should have said you were here.

272
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,452
You scared me.

273
00:17:59,452 --> 00:18:01,540
You're alone?

274
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,450
Don't tell me it's empty because of you.

275
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,760
Then I'll hang around for a bit.

276
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,940
This is nice.

277
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,820
So nice.

278
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:25,079
You want eggs?

279
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,660
Who am I talking to?

280
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,540
I'd rather talk to a wall.

281
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:37,100
Coming here...

282
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,530
makes me desperate for some tteokbokki and soju.

283
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,290
Right?

284
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,920
 We did have one more friend. 

285
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:55,120
 We couldn't reach him after graduation. 

286
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,570
 It's been so long since we saw him. 

287
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:02,124
 This might have been his. 

288
00:19:02,124 --> 00:19:04,180
 We tried to look for him, 

289
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,330
 but it was to no avail. 

290
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,570
Stop looking.

291
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:26,600
40 minutes.

292
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,290
How can you sit still for forty minutes without saying anything?

293
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,410
Is it scarier to be abandoned?

294
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,650
Or to be sought by the one you abandoned?

295
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,532
I think it'll be scarier to be sought by the abandoned one.

296
00:19:49,532 --> 00:19:52,620
They'll resent you.

297
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,440
So what if they do?

298
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,170
Then you'll have to hear it.

299
00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:01,590
But the abandoned person can at least resent them.

300
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,880
Have you resented anyone?

301
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,870
I resent people all the time.

302
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,210
I resent the editor-in-chief who fired me.

303
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,060
And you who made it—

304
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,140
See?

305
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,390
You resent too.

306
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,580
I didn't even have time to resent.

307
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,920
I was busy surviving.

308
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,680
Can you talk like a normal person, please?

309
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,950
What are you doing?

310
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,850
Resentment...

311
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,570
Resentment?

312
00:20:35,379 --> 00:20:37,620
Can you pick just one or the other?

313
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,679
Are you trying to have a conversation?

314
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:40,710
Or are you a brooding storm?

315
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,510
You keep switching back and forth.

316
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,960
I'm not sure what it is bugging you.

317
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:53,340
But this too... shall pass.

318
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,370
You're leaving?

319
00:21:10,379 --> 00:21:12,980
In the middle of a conversation?

320
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:31,420
 I'm not here right now.  So leave a message. 

321
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,070
 I'm not here right now. 

322
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:38,390
 Leave a message, and I'll get back to you. 

323
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:45,720
Why was she keeping the ring?

324
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:51,080
What did he mean to you?

325
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,210
Can't she just pick up when I'm having a hard time?

326
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:07,920
No sympathy at all.

327
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:26,110
I asked and they couldn't find any rings.

328
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,270
Too bad.

329
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,640
Anything wrong at checkout?

330
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,520
It's nothing.

331
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,530
Let's go to the car.

332
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:19,320
- Lee Geunyoung, right? 
 - Yes.

333
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,710
Your seat's been upgraded, so we'd like to help you move seats.

334
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,120
Upgraded?

335
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,379
Mine?

336
00:24:25,379 --> 00:24:27,520
Yes. We'll get your luggage.

337
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,700
Wait a minute.

338
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,170
Are you sure it's me?

339
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:36,350
Yes, I am. If you move to your seat, we'll get your luggage.

340
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,670
You must've gotten it wrong.

341
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,290
This is my seat.

342
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:43,730
Maybe you've got the wrong name?

343
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:46,220
You are Lee Geunyoung, right?

344
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,370
Then it's you.

345
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,470
Your seat's been upgraded with your mileage.

346
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,720
Oh. Mileage?

347
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,160
Then it's not me.

348
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:57,730
Maybe something's wrong with the system?

349
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:01,370
You're making this a bit difficult.

350
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,310
I am quite sure, Ms. Lee.

351
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,450
Let me get your luggage.

352
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:07,960
It's really not me...

353
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,420
How did you get here? I was worried about you.

354
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,600
I know.

355
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,230
They say it's because of my mileage.

356
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:36,420
But I don't have any mileage.

357
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,420
I see.

358
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,979
Today's my lucky day.

359
00:25:39,979 --> 00:25:41,640
Maybe because I did something good.

360
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,470
Why?

361
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,310
Did something happen this morning?

362
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,980
Somebody lost his ring yesterday.

363
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:50,350
So I left it at the concierge.

364
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,750
What ring?

365
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,890
It just looked kind of old.

366
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:57,580
There were Roman numerals.

367
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,536
Geunyoung.

368
00:26:00,536 --> 00:26:03,510
- You did good! 
 - Why?

369
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,750
So it's found.

370
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,780
By the way, what meal do we get up here?

371
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,640
Food?

372
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,720
You get steak.

373
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,580
- Steak? 
 - Of course.

374
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,879
You can choose what you want to eat.

375
00:26:14,879 --> 00:26:16,500
How can you get steak on a flight?

376
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,420
Amazing, right?

377
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:28,250
People are going crazy over the first episode.

378
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,622
It may be hard to get out of the airport.

379
00:26:31,622 --> 00:26:32,680
Geunyoung.

380
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,520
you'll be fine if you leave with us,

381
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,150
but still, be prepared.

382
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:39,980
Is this because of the broadcast?

383
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,930
My fans are going crazy.

384
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,100
They want to go after you.

385
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,682
You're fine?

386
00:26:49,682 --> 00:26:51,700
Of course. I'll face it.

387
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,840
They won't kill me.

388
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,750
Who Joon is coming out soon with his controversial anti-fan.

389
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,779
We're here waiting for them.

390
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,900
They're here.  Let's go.

391
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,710
Were you expecting the repercussions of all this?

392
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,210
Why did you drug his drink?

393
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:16,360
Are you really doing the show to get revenge?

394
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,970
Please say something!

395
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,320
Hey, are you really trying to kill him?

396
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,690
Stop right now!

397
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:30,450
I'm really going to kill you.

398
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:34,160
First, thank you all for the attention.

399
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,880
It's just the first episode.

400
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,680
Please keep watching.

401
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,000
And please stop misunderstanding and criticizing Lee Geunyoung.

402
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,920
Thank you.

403
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,380
Say something!

404
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,079
How do you feel right now?  Please tell us!

405
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:48,410
Please say something!

406
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,750
Are you okay?

407
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:56,600
Guys.

408
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,650
 Yes. 

409
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,640
Do you want me to feel sorry for her?

410
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,040
 No. 

411
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,979
Please be generous and understanding like you always are, okay?

412
00:28:04,979 --> 00:28:07,170
 Okay. 

413
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,090
Are you okay?

414
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,030
My carry-out...

415
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:25,000
Hoo Joon's people took care of it.

416
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,240
And it might have startled you.

417
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,120
But that's how variety shows are.

418
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:35,330
You can't even hear me, huh?

419
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,540
Right.

420
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,110
Get some rest.

421
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,880
Can I use your phone?

422
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:51,920
It's better for you not to see it.

423
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:58,820
   
   

424
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:03,920
   

425
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,570
   

426
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,630
 Geunyoung. 

427
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:13,670
To put it nicely, our show is really popular.

428
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,670
And to put it badly?

429
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,040
It's a witch hunt.

430
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:20,624
As your reputation becomes worse, Hoo Joon's reputation gets even better.

431
00:29:20,624 --> 00:29:23,620
That's how anti-fans are perceived.

432
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,710
Honestly...

433
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:32,470
It's all because of the editing.

434
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:35,990
I'll cut my hand.

435
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,170
It's...

436
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:40,890
because I had to capture a top star and his anti-fan as they are.

437
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:45,520
They don't want to see you two so close yet.

438
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,778
So...

439
00:29:46,778 --> 00:29:48,430
what I mean to say is...

440
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:51,900
that the harder a ball hits the ground, the higher it will fly.

441
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,210
Just remember that.

442
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:55,560
When I meet a ball, I'll make sure to tell him.

443
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,140
I don't want to soar higher.

444
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:01,280
Geunyoung. Geunyoung—

445
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,210
Seriously.

446
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:07,120
Don't look so mad.

447
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,670
It's a hit.

448
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,180
Aren't you glad you listened to me?

449
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,790
Is this what you wanted?

450
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:13,820
Look at the news stories.

451
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,370
It's all about Who Joon.

452
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:18,760
Stars need to stay in the public eye.

453
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,390
To have news stories like this,

454
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:23,380
you aren't having to unleash the public relations team. It must be nice not to spend money?

455
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,672
Don't be so sulky.

456
00:30:25,672 --> 00:30:27,284
Youngseok.

457
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:29,350
Joon is here.

458
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:36,790
When did you guys become so close?

459
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,830
You look nice, Youngseok.

460
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:45,830
This guy is really impossible.

461
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:51,230
He keeps asking me why only you can call me by my name.

462
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,920
That's good.

463
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,330
You like your name.

464
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:58,130
You also like impossible guys.

465
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,470
Joon.

466
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,080
The show's a hit.

467
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,350
Why do you never fail?

468
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,570
I'm so jealous.

469
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:10,920
I think you just need a little more time.

470
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,350
I'm leaving.

471
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,150
Okay.

472
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:16,270
Don't look mad.

473
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,730
Bro, bye.

474
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:22,840
 Who Joon will arrive soon with his controversial anti-fan. 

475
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,770
 We're here waiting for them. 

476
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:26,370
 Why did you drug his drink? 

477
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,520
 Are you really doing the show to get revenge? 

478
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,579
 Please say something. 

479
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:31,090
 What's she trying to do? 

480
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:35,770
 We'll cover what the staff and Who Joon are thinking. 

481
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,020
 Did you arrive? 

482
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,270
 Stay there at the airport. Wait for me. 

483
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,600
 I'll come and pick you up. 

484
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,980
 First new message. 

485
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:54,320
 What are you doing in Seoul? 

486
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,620
I can't even go to the market to buy bean sprouts because I'm so embarrassed. You bad girl!

487
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:02,340
Anyways, you'll die by my hand.

488
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:06,950
 Press pound to listen to the next message... 

489
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,979
 Why did you do this? 

490
00:32:09,979 --> 00:32:12,730
I mean if that star or whatever got you angry,

491
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:16,080
you should've just pulled his hair out, so why did you have to take pictures...

492
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,810
 Why get criticized for something you don't have to? 

493
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:25,220
Your dad was so angry that he almost went to the station to pull out their antennas.

494
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,560
I held him back barely.

495
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:33,100
 Press pound to listen to the next message... 

496
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,220
 Geunyoung. 

497
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,410
 Was it because you needed money for rent? 

498
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:42,420
You have us to help you.

499
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,830
That's when you come whining to us for help.

500
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:49,400
Why are you swearing that you don't need to eat,

501
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:53,830
and listening to words you don't need to hear?

502
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,270
 Come home. 

503
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,744
 Just quit everything and come home. 

504
00:33:01,744 --> 00:33:06,660
 You like... reading and writing. 

505
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,820
Come do that.

506
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,570
You don't have to do anything.

507
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:16,000
I won't ask you to do anything else.

508
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,979
Geunyoung, my girl.

509
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,975
 Mom. 

510
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:32,800
 I really want to go. 

511
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,510
 But I can't right now. 

512
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,040
 I've come this far. 

513
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,400
 I can't give up now. 

514
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,050
 I've got to follow it through. 

515
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:51,630
 I'm sorry for breaking your heart. 

516
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,990
   

517
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:25,979
Something is definitely up.

518
00:34:25,979 --> 00:34:27,630
Huh?

519
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:30,230
There's nothing. It didn't mean anything.

520
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,060
What?

521
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:34,880
About Japan... I'm sorry.

522
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,930
Let's hope that the commercial goes well.

523
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:42,020
Okay?

524
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,284
I realized something.

525
00:34:44,284 --> 00:34:46,930
Getting famous is most important.

526
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,220
You said it.

527
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:53,770
To succeed I'll do anything, whether it's shooting with him or not.

528
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:56,360
I won't let it bother me anymore.

529
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,270
Okay.

530
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:01,900
Thanks for understanding.

531
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,650
Did you watch his show?

532
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:08,220
He's definitely a professional.

533
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:11,330
His pretense is second nature now.

534
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:14,460
You should learn from him.

535
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,540
Eat up.

536
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,250
Yes.

537
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,596
Why were you at the airport so early?

538
00:35:26,596 --> 00:35:29,440
You left the hotel early.

539
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,410
You said you were going straight to the airport so I was shopping.

540
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:37,110
But where were you that you arrived so late?

541
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,350
To see Joon.

542
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:40,370
I was at his hotel.

543
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,320
Why are you so surprised?

544
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,400
I went to make peace.

545
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:53,510
I'll just run to the restroom.

546
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,430
"Thanks for understanding?"

547
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:04,070
She's so bad at lying.

548
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:07,040
What happened to her phone?

549
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,170
You still can't reach her?

550
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:10,279
I thought she'd come here.

551
00:36:10,279 --> 00:36:11,420
I see you often.

552
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,130
Yes, you do.

553
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,079
I heard it was crazy at the airport.

554
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:17,410
Can she even live in Korea?

555
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:20,760
Maybe we'll have to go with her overseas?

556
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,730
Let me get you some beer.

557
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,879
Why aren't you seeing your girlfriend?

558
00:36:29,879 --> 00:36:31,610
Well, just too lazy, I guess.

559
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:36,312
I like having chicken and beer better nowadays.

560
00:36:36,312 --> 00:36:37,270
You like the skin, right?

561
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,020
Have these.

562
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:42,670
You're telling me to have only the skin?

563
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:45,530
What? What are you talking about?

564
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:46,740
I mean that...

565
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,540
What? Geunyoung.

566
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:57,920
You must... watch it?

567
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,170
Right.

568
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:02,500
She shouldn't be alone watching it.

569
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,770
   

570
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:11,880
   

571
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,570
 My stomach... 

572
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:14,979
   

573
00:37:14,979 --> 00:37:16,960
   

574
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,420
  - What's happening? 
  - Are you okay? 

575
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,470
 - What's wrong? 
 - Hoo Joon? 

576
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:23,250
 Call an ambulance. 

577
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,450
 Something's wrong with the drink? 

578
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,890
 I did it. 

579
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:31,080
   

580
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:35,380
   

581
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,120
Geunyoung,

582
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:51,350
I study law and I think you shouldn't worry about this too much.

583
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:52,830
I don't think he'll sue you.

584
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:54,960
It is an attempt...

585
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,270
Should we sue?

586
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,690
The editing team is rotten.

587
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,420
It's defamation. Defamation!

588
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,650
- Should I call my friend? 
 - Yes.

589
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,140
Stop trying, guys.

590
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:11,476
We were just trying to...

591
00:38:11,476 --> 00:38:12,170
Okay.

592
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:14,430
Drink some beer and forget about it. Right?

593
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,390
Right!

594
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,770
Yes, beer!

595
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,070
Forget how?

596
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:21,100
Do you think you can?

597
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,650
I heard the show is a hit, though.

598
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,670
So more people must've watched it.

599
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,470
Are you calling that comfort now?

600
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,760
Pictures...

601
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:38,770
Geunyoung!

602
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:40,560
Geunyoung!

603
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,210
I called the hotel.

604
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:47,830
They'll keep the ring.

605
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,500
Should I try to get it back?

606
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,320
What do you mean?

607
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,380
It's the only thing of your dad's you have left.

608
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,060
That ring...

609
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:59,210
Tell them to just hold onto it until I go get it.

610
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,860
Okay.

611
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,840
Mr. Han called to check in on you.

612
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,480
Is Geunyoung okay?

613
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:10,579
I hope she's not hurt.

614
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:13,660
   

615
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:23,130
   

616
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,200
 The door is locked. 

617
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,820
This is the safest place.

618
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,870
   

619
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,000
   

620
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:02,400
   

621
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:15,070
 Hello? 

622
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:17,000
Package?

623
00:40:19,979 --> 00:40:22,520
 What if it was a dead rat? 

624
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,390
 The door is open. 

625
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:44,430
Why are you so lazy, just leaving the package outside?

626
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,162
It's yours?

627
00:40:46,162 --> 00:40:48,540
I was scared.

628
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:51,780
You told me you got a dead rat before.

629
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,120
What is this?

630
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:01,440
Looking at people's reactions,

631
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,330
you're going to have to stay inside for a while.

632
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:07,670
You bought all these for me?

633
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,940
Thanks.

634
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,670
You really are an angel.

635
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,070
And I'm the devil.

636
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:19,980
What? You saw all those?

637
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,580
You're holding up great.

638
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:26,540
I hate myself, too.

639
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,520
In the world,

640
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,379
there are more people that hate you

641
00:41:35,379 --> 00:41:38,980
than those who love you.

642
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:42,440
Was that supposed to be comforting?

643
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,330
It's not?

644
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,540
It was for me.

645
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,600
I'm drinking soju. Do you want some?

646
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,979
Do you want some?

647
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:56,970
I thought you craved tteokbokki and soju.

648
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:58,770
Tteokbokki and soju again?

649
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:00,270
You must miss someone again?

650
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:01,440
Why talk about that?

651
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,370
You wanted it, so... I bought it.

652
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:29,550
Did you watch the show?

653
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,350
Watching it wasn't the only thing.

654
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:34,226
I've never seen such swearing before.

655
00:42:34,226 --> 00:42:37,980
I've seen people swear but not like that.

656
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:40,770
So why watch it?

657
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:43,124
Don't act like you don't.

658
00:42:43,124 --> 00:42:46,206
All celebrities look at themselves up online.

659
00:42:46,206 --> 00:42:48,730
When celebs were suing people,

660
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:52,566
I thought "Why read the comments?"

661
00:42:52,566 --> 00:42:55,230
I mean seriously.

662
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:58,520
Putting bad vitamins in a drink is attempted murder?

663
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,879
So why?

664
00:42:59,879 --> 00:43:01,740
So who told you to play with someone's food?

665
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:05,580
Did you come here to shove it in my face?

666
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,770
You get calls this late?

667
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:11,960
Is it a man?

668
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,670
Are there any men that don't suit you?

669
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:16,230
You don't have to know.

670
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,830
What do you want?

671
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:26,960
 Geunyoung. 

672
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,430
You weren't like that.

673
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:29,779
What are you talking about?

674
00:43:29,779 --> 00:43:30,860
I watched the show.

675
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,420
You weren't like that before.

676
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,879
Even last time, you yelled at me.

677
00:43:34,879 --> 00:43:37,710
I just thought that you changed a bit.

678
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:39,550
But not like that.

679
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:43,720
I don't know. I just... I didn't know I would hurt you this bad.

680
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:46,310
- Sorry? 
 - I know that I hurt you.

681
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:47,320
What can I do?

682
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,110
 I told you I couldn't do anything about it. 

683
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:50,730
Couldn't you be more understanding?

684
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:52,650
 I made you this bitter? 

685
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:55,250
It's so hard because I feel responsible for this.

686
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,270
Hey!

687
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:57,750
You're doing this to me?

688
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:59,979
You used me as a litmus test.

689
00:43:59,979 --> 00:44:03,250
Are you now testing me with filter paper? Does my pride have to be filtered by you?

690
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:05,270
Why? Because everyone's talking about me,

691
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:08,070
you want attention to yourself as my ex?

692
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:09,670
Oh my god? Even now,

693
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:11,650
you're saying everything you want to say without holding back.

694
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:13,870
Why should I hold back?

695
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:14,979
By any chance,

696
00:44:14,979 --> 00:44:19,520
did you approach me... because Hoo Joon was my friend?

697
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,660
That will give me such a hard time.

698
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,260
I'll be too sorry to hear that.

699
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:28,770
I really don't care if you're his friend or his lover.

700
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:30,860
You attention whore!

701
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:34,070
I think you're seriously mistaken,

702
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:37,270
because I'm the one who's not revealing your secret.

703
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:38,180
 You know that right? 

704
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,460
Don't ever call me like this.

705
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:44,610
I'll write an article that will surely close your restaurant down!

706
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,540
Why do I even talk to him?

707
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:59,060
I guess that wasn't a pleasant call.

708
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:02,640
Being on a show with Korea's biggest star makes me Korea's biggest gossip fodder.

709
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:07,740
My ex-boyfriend worries that he's responsible for my evilness.

710
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:11,930
I'm sorry somehow.

711
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:15,180
You can say that?

712
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,580
I've lived long enough.

713
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,640
You'll live even longer now.

714
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,710
I've nothing to say. I can't blame anyone.

715
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:24,420
I'm the one who signed up for it.

716
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:27,780
I walked into the water with my own two feet.

717
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:34,360
Do you know what to do if you don't want to drown?

718
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:39,240
Hold your breath.

719
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,720
And stay still.

720
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,730
Then your body drowns and when your feet touch the bottom,

721
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:49,700
make a strong leap back to surface.

722
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:54,420
Either you drown trying to fight or you wait and make the leap.

723
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:58,790
The choice is... yours to make.

724
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:03,140
You're telling me to go down more?

725
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,620
That's not what I mean.

726
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,070
This doesn't comfort you either?

727
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:09,310
We really aren't great together.

728
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:14,390
To be honest, you have nothing to be sorry about.

729
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:18,090
Everything was real like a reality show.

730
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:21,470
You're getting all the criticism.

731
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:25,580
I'm trying to feel like a celebrity now.

732
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:29,910
When I was at work, I did all the dirty work.

733
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:34,970
And I was nobody even when they took my idea.

734
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:40,210
Now everyone knows who I am so I guess I'm successful.

735
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,670
Just Geunyoung

736
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,910
Hang in there, Lee Geunyoung.

737
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:55,210
You'll miss this someday.

738
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:58,710
Are you drunk?

739
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:02,120
You do this every time I'm trying to tell you something nice.

740
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,779
Be sure to get tested for any suspicious disease you have.

741
00:47:04,779 --> 00:47:07,270
It's better than being an attention whore.

742
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,438
Cheer up.

743
00:47:12,438 --> 00:47:15,980
This too... shall pass.

744
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:19,720
You told me that.

745
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:26,850
This too shall pass.

746
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,430
   

747
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,700
What's he doing here?

748
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,680
Oh. Yesterday.

749
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:19,420
 This is my spot. 

750
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,020
 He's fast asleep. 

751
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,390
 This is comfier than it looks. 

752
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:27,420
 It's somewhat comfortable. 

753
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,960
 This is a hard surface. 

754
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:42,500
Hey.

755
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,220
Excuse...

756
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,970
 - Joon.  
 - Jihyang.

757
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:29,560
 You're not home. Where are you? 

758
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,360
Me?

759
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:34,210
I'm working out.

760
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:35,479
Yeah.

761
00:49:35,479 --> 00:49:37,580
I'll be there.

762
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:51,560
Did you know we were shooting?

763
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,660
Oh yeah.

764
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,588
Don't be late later.

765
00:49:56,588 --> 00:49:58,540
I'm off.

766
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:08,180
Did you drink last night?

767
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,620
Me?

768
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:12,980
No. Him.

769
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:16,079
Yeah, just a little.

770
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:20,320
Everyone's ready, right?

771
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:24,110
What we shot in Japan, it was less than we thought.

772
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:27,210
I told you not to just send them on their own.

773
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:30,250
That's why I'm still reflecting on it.

774
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:34,370
I was walking here today.

775
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:36,460
And I thought "Maybe we should shoot on the street here in Seoul."

776
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:38,520
Well, that's what I thought.

777
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,620
So you can go anywhere you like.

778
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,790
You're asking us to walk the streets?

779
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,020
The streets of Seoul are interesting.

780
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:49,180
I also wonder how people will react.

781
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:53,100
You know their reactions, reading the comments online.

782
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:55,079
If I walk around now...

783
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:56,640
Geunyoung.

784
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,720
Hoo Joon's next to you.

785
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,590
They won't do anything rash.

786
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:04,070
And if they do?

787
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:07,310
I'll make sure... to protect Geunyoung.

788
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:10,030
We won't go anywhere, either. Okay?

789
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:12,660
We'll follow you, just out of sight.

790
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:13,870
Ready when you are.

791
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:16,070
You can do it! Okay?

792
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:17,990
You can do it!

793
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:30,170
Why? You're scared?

794
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,710
Then should I be excited?

795
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:33,290
I told you.

796
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:37,794
If you don't want to drown, you have to make the push off from the bottom.

797
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:42,679
Right now.... it doesn't comfort me.

798
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:54,950
 Oh my god!  What should we do?  It's really them. 

799
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:56,440
 Are we allowed to film them? 

800
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:57,220
 Amazing. 

801
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:59,870
 He's so handsome. 

802
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:02,600
 He's handsome. 

803
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,410
 I could die now. 

804
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:12,830
How's this?

805
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:18,020
This is... our first couple's necklace.

806
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:25,779
I can do this.

807
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:29,470
How much is this?

808
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:31,370
Thank you.

809
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:35,140
Can you do mine Geunyoung?

810
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,830
 Let's buy that. 

811
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,960
This won't be just our couple's necklace.

812
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:07,730
Still, we have fewer people now.

813
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:09,470
Yes.

814
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:13,430
I feel safe since you're next to me.

815
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,030
♫  A place without stars  ♫

816
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:19,810
♫  All the way in the sky  ♫

817
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,908
This is my song.

818
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:26,180
I know.

819
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:27,310
 Wait. 

820
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:32,340
 Isn't that the artist of this song? 

821
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:34,710
 Who Joon! 

822
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:37,750
 Who Joon! 

823
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:51,570
♫  A place without stars  ♫

824
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:53,330
♫  All the way in the sky  ♫

825
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:58,670
♫  This song I always sing alone   ♫

826
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:03,700
♫  In case someone will listen to you someday  ♫

827
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:08,570
♫  The song I sing all night... Listen  ♫

828
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:15,530
♫  Where the lights shine when I open my eyes  ♫

829
00:54:15,579 --> 00:54:18,820
♫  I'll be standing there  ♫

830
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:22,080
♫   I'm your Pop Star  ♫

831
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:34,290
♫  Remember, I'm always your one and only one  ♫

832
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:38,500
♫  So that you can hear me all night long  ♫

833
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,390
♫  Oh, every day, every time  ♫

834
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:43,570
♫  If you can hear me  ♫

835
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:46,170
♫  I'll sing  ♫

836
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:50,380
♫  I'm a Pop Star just for you  ♫

837
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:52,610
Thank you.

838
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:54,500
 Encore! 

839
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,200
 Encore! 

840
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,700
I'll stop here today.

841
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:00,810
Thank you.

842
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:03,790
 Pictures! 

843
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:11,730
 Where are you going? 

844
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:20,730
♫  I wonder what is love  ♫

845
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:25,250
♫  I want to know what is love  ♫

846
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:29,160
♫  Your lovely look  ♫

847
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:33,520
♫  What is this taste?  ♫

848
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:37,670
♫  I wonder what is love  ♫

849
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:42,520
♫  There is no answer, it's just a question  ♫

850
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:49,780
♫  Are you falling in love too?  ♫

851
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:50,990
 Oppa! 

852
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:54,820
♫  I wonder what is love  ♫

853
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:58,970
 Who Joon! 

854
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,746
You've never acted before.

855
00:56:15,746 --> 00:56:17,800
Yes, I haven't had the chance.

856
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:21,890
If you're willing to give me a chance I'll do my best.

857
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:25,670
By the way... your profile is so old.

858
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:28,420
Ask your boss to change it.

859
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,580
Oh, yes.

860
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:36,380
Mr. Choi is so late.

861
00:56:40,279 --> 00:56:41,080
Mr. Choi.

862
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,480
Are you not coming?

863
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,172
Yes, producer.

864
00:56:44,172 --> 00:56:45,670
I'll be a little late.

865
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:47,760
What should I do?

866
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,179
I have to head back in today.

867
00:56:50,179 --> 00:56:52,740
I'll call you some other time then.

868
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:53,670
Okay.

869
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:54,979
Maybe next time.

870
00:56:54,979 --> 00:56:56,850
Please take good care of Inhyung.

871
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:58,730
 Okay. 

872
00:57:00,179 --> 00:57:04,360
Your boss seems to becoming but I have to go.

873
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,610
Okay.

874
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:07,370
I'll call him.

875
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:09,540
Yes.

876
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:10,930
Goodbye.

877
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:12,770
Bye.

878
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:21,930
My feet.

879
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:23,750
Why did we have to run?

880
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:25,179
You can just stay still.

881
00:57:25,179 --> 00:57:27,560
Is that a celebrity disease?

882
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:34,579
I don't know what the producers are thinking.

883
00:57:34,579 --> 00:57:36,650
We're lucky it wasn't the weekend.

884
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:38,720
We wouldn't be able to move.

885
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:42,690
You acted all cool and said okay.

886
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:48,830
No, well... At this point, I had to do a popularity check once.

887
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:54,360
Wow.  The people also need to do Who Joon check to know what kind of person you are.

888
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:07,400
Ms. Noh, your hair today.

889
00:58:09,979 --> 00:58:11,830
You washed it?

890
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,420
Nice.

891
00:58:17,850 --> 00:58:20,270
People were in the way.

892
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:22,720
And so you didn't get them on film?

893
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,100
The mic is off, too.

894
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:30,870
We should call it a day.

895
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:33,290
We're on standby until they come back.

896
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:35,379
Wrap it up.

897
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,200
Is this a shower?

898
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,420
It's out of nowhere.

899
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:49,170
I used to like it when it rained all of sudden.

900
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:57,220
I wonder where the car is.

901
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:04,800
We've got no choice.

902
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:11,730


903
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:14,140
Come on.

904
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:19,830
♫  All my dreams come true  ♫

905
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:21,290
Here we go.

906
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:27,440
♫  I want to draw everything I imagined with you  ♫

907
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:33,090
♫  If I just look at it, I turn around and regret  ♫

908
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:36,920
♫  What would it have been like?  ♫

909
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:46,450
♫  Will you be in a different world from someone other than you?  ♫

910
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:50,420
♫  I can't even imagine  ♫

911
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:54,750
♫  Someone else by my side  ♫

912
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:59,450
♫  When it rains  ♫

913
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:03,770
♫  It becomes your umbrella and the shade on a hot day  ♫

914
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:09,600
♫  Footsteps walking side by side with you  ♫

915
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:14,160
♫  There's nothing better than this  ♫

916
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:18,630
♫  My heart that I couldn't tell you  ♫

917
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:22,750
♫  Now everybody knows  ♫

918
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:25,290
♫  I love you  ♫

919
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:34,430
♫  I hope you reach the end of the world that my love is only for you  ♫

920
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:40,220
♫  I hold your hand casually  ♫

921
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:44,110
♫  And making eye contact like a habit  ♫

922
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:46,650
♫  All of my dreams come true  ♫

923
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:54,200
♫  I want to draw everything I imagined with you  ♫

924
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:59,220
♫  You've been so different...  ♫

925
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:00,820
 We've got a special guest. 

926
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:01,820
 Surprise! 

927
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:05,010
 So you know about Joon and Inhyung. 

928
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:08,070
 Do you have to watch Inhyung get ruined? 

929
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:09,110
 Please stop it! 

930
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:10,420
 When will you stop? 

931
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:15,220
 My decision to protect everyone ended up hurting everyone. 

932
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:16,680
 You know Geunyoung. 

933
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:19,670
 There's a rumor she was hired to sell information on you. 

934
01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:21,770
 Say that today's the last shoot. 

935
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:24,730
 I don't know why I'm so confused. 

936
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:27,920
 Let's check why today. 

937
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,130
♫  There's nothing better than this  ♫

938
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:34,350
