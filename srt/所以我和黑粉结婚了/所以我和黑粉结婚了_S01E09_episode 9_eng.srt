1
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,350
   

2
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,220
   

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,930
   

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,720
   

5
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,640
   

6
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,990
   

7
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:40,030


8
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,270
   

9
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:51,640
   

10
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,170
Did you invite someone over?

11
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,830
Me?

12
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,780
Stay still for a second.

13
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,850
Are you just toying with me?

14
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,800
What are you talking about?

15
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,560
What's wrong with me?

16
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,620
He would've said he was just playing around.

17
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,860
Tomorrow, he'll say it was a joke.

18
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,970
He just toys with people's feelings to the end.

19
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,879
That insensitive jerk.

20
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,690
What's wrong with me?

21
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,760
 Are you just toying with me? 

22
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,180
But...

23
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,270
why did she think I was toying with her?

24
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:15,130
She always makes me into a weird person.

25
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,520
 Our group is making an audition program. 

26
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,330
 We've finished discussions with the studio. 

27
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,479
 Find some rookies. 

28
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,020
 This is probably... 

29
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,870
 the last chance you'll get. 

30
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,220
Be ready to test our current trainees by next week.

31
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,279
Oh. And this time,

32
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:42,520
only trainees who haven't appeared on TV before are eligible.

33
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,000
Got that?

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,546
Okay.

35
00:03:45,546 --> 00:03:48,060
Guess that means I'm not eligible?

36
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,200
I have something to tell you.

37
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,850
This is too much.

38
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,460
 They have a meeting with Hoo Joon. 

39
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,210
 Aren't you curious to see them? 

40
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,370
Maybe you're curious.

41
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,970
Show business people are cruel, aren't they?

42
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,970
It's already surprising enough for Hoo Joon to shoot this again.

43
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,930
But for this to be the place...

44
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,470
I thought you might think this is cruel.

45
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,210
By the way, why is Hoo Joon doing this again?

46
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,290
Do you know?

47
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,580
How would I?

48
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,530
Ms. Noh, you're really...

49
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,200
Yeah, I suppose not.

50
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,490
It must be surprising for people working at the magazine to see you again.

51
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,170
Aren't you more closer to Hoo Joon than they are?

52
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,366
What do you mean we're involved?

53
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:50,879
I didn't say you guys are involved.

54
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,520
Did you do your homework?

55
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,450
You said in the beginning that Joon was unsettling like unfinished homework.

56
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,370
He is... He's still unsettling.

57
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,460
Not only that,

58
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:05,779
I just can't ever get close to him.

59
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,710
Think of this magazine as part of your homework.

60
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,350
Let's go inside.

61
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,540
Is something going on?

62
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,879
Why are there so many people?

63
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:22,830
I heard Meanhee got the pictorial with Hoo Joon.

64
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,179
That's not what's important right now.

65
00:05:25,179 --> 00:05:28,430
Hoo Joon himself will be coming in today.

66
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,179
- In person? 
 - Yes.

67
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:33,580
So we have to toss out the old furniture and everything.

68
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,500
All this fuss for a top star like him!

69
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,080
It it were up to me,

70
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,640
I'd toss you guys out, too.

71
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,780
You're just going to stand here and complain?

72
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,640
- Hurry up and get busy. 
 - Yes.

73
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,030
Are you going to ever stop complaining?

74
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,579
What about my debut then?

75
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:54,370
Let's think about it after the rookies' debut.

76
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,140
Let me go on the audition too then.

77
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,270
It's only for real first-timers.

78
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,979
That's the condition.

79
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:03,830
You shouldn't have shot the commercial if that's what you wanted.

80
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:09,690
I'm not even saying anything about what happened in Japan.

81
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,168
Someone in your situation should be a little more meek.

82
00:06:12,168 --> 00:06:13,220
Don't you think?

83
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,880
Do you know how many years...

84
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,850
I've been quietly waiting?

85
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,179
You're telling me to wait again?

86
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,120
Wait.

87
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,310
Stop making demands and just wait.

88
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:26,330
I'm also still waiting for you, too!

89
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,480
Why do you even keep me around?

90
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,070
Jeez.

91
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,850
After I bailed you out of Shooting Star,

92
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:41,200
you must think it's easy to sign and break any contract?

93
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,310
Did you sleep well?

94
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,140
It's so not like you to greet me in the morning.  Jeez.

95
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:14,240
You said you'd stop playing with people and now you're doing it like it's nothing...

96
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,430
Isn't this too much makeup?

97
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,250
I want to look more like a journalist.

98
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,310
I look too much like a celeb.

99
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,420
Even the earrings are too big.

100
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,272
Guys.

101
00:07:26,272 --> 00:07:28,110
All right then, you can come up when we give you the cue.

102
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,979
Mr. Han, you're kind of ridiculous, you know that?

103
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:31,470
I shouldn't be here.

104
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,560
It may be uncomfortable for you,

105
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,179
but let's be confident about it.

106
00:07:35,179 --> 00:07:37,470
What's there to be confident about on this week's show?

107
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,570
Isn't it about time I look a bit nicer on the show now?

108
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,270
Who says you're not nice?

109
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,040
Huh? Who is it?

110
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,730
Geunyoung is so super nice.

111
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,760
No?

112
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:53,120
Geunyoung, who is very nice, is a bit sensitive today... Eh?

113
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,690
What's on this week's show?

114
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,060
You're ignoring me.

115
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,640
Calm down.

116
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,070
Geunyoung, my baby.

117
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,560
You won't make it as a celeb.

118
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,290
No matter how much makeup, you just can't hide it.

119
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,770
Should I put on some more?

120
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,879
It's already a lot.

121
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,670
- That's not what I mean... 
 - And what's with this tiny bag!

122
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,550
Lee Geunyoung.

123
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,480
Come here for a second.

124
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,780
What?

125
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:30,120
- What's wrong? 
 - What do you mean?

126
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:34,286
You're snapping at people and you're not usually like that.

127
00:08:34,286 --> 00:08:36,310
What's wrong?

128
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,306
Can I not speak my mind?

129
00:08:38,306 --> 00:08:41,720
You're not the only one allowed to complain.

130
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,560
Stop being so obvious.

131
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,250
What?

132
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,770
About yesterday...

133
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:59,220
Just as you are confused, I'm just as confused as you are.

134
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,540
 What? 

135
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,560
 Confused? 

136
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,710
If you want to call it a mistake, then so be it.

137
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,270
The end.

138
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,900
Okay?

139
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,920
Why is she overreacting?

140
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:17,780
Welcome.

141
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,879
You are here in person.

142
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:23,080
That's very kind of you.

143
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,790
Nice to meet you.

144
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,390
Wait, who's this?

145
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,150
It's you.

146
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,070
Sorry. I forgot your name.

147
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,370
This is Lee Geunyoung, Sir.

148
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,079
Not long ago,

149
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:37,620
she quit her job here.

150
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,570
Oh.

151
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,370
Ms. Geunyoung, you can sit here.

152
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,710
You look nice.

153
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,000
Maybe it's because of all the lighting?

154
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,620
The lighting here mustn't have suited me.

155
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,479
You never were pretty anyway.

156
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:02,510
I was just being polite.

157
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,279
You still can't quite catch people's drift, I see.

158
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,370
So then...

159
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,060
- Let's begin. 
 - Yes.

160
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,430
Okay.

161
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:21,620
How's the reality show going?

162
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,970
I didn't know you'd come together.

163
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:24,979
Oh.

164
00:10:24,979 --> 00:10:27,600
I didn't think it'd be awkward.

165
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,179
No, it's not awkward at all.

166
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,250
Let's take a look at the proposal first.

167
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,070
   

168
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,410
 That's my... 

169
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,880
- This is my... 
 - Time slips are the concept here, the transcending of time and space.

170
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,060
The fancy look when you're on stage

171
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:02,520
will be contrasted appealingly with the slim look of daily life.

172
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:06,070
What do you think Geunyoung?

173
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,960
You used to be an editor.

174
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,390
I want to know how you think.

175
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,030
Your opinion matters here, too.

176
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:17,120
The main character's opinion is key. If you're okay with it, let's proceed.

177
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,780
It's fine by me.

178
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,210
But what Geunyoung thinks is also important to me.

179
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,560
Geunyoung, how is it?

180
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:33,250
Geunyoung, please tell me comfortably.

181
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,080
I...

182
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,860
don't really like it.

183
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,470
Let's cut here.

184
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,600
You can shoot my insert shot later.

185
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,370
Oh. Okay. Just a moment.

186
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,550
- Excuse me. 
 - It'll just be a bit.

187
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:06,800
We'll do it as you said.

188
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,090
We can pick up the rest when you're actually filming.

189
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,640
Can all staff step out for a second?

190
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,500
Are you crazy?

191
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,310
How can you do this?

192
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,680
You want to use my proposal here?

193
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,960
Don't flatter yourself.

194
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,579
Who was it that quit like that and hurt our reputation?

195
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:27,390
You should be grateful

196
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:31,080
that we're being this polite while you're shooting here.

197
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,670
How dare you?

198
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,806
Did you not see how much I was holding back in front of the cameras as well?

199
00:12:35,806 --> 00:12:37,306
Just...

200
00:12:37,306 --> 00:12:39,080
Just say that you're sorry.

201
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,079
Shut your mouth.

202
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,890
Now you even talk back to me.

203
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,220
Look how you've grown.

204
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,160
You who used to stoop so low.

205
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,750
So what is it? You think you're something because you're with a celeb?

206
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,100
Maybe.

207
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,170
You got all edgy as soon as you saw me,

208
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,340
maybe I am not really all that insignificant.

209
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,800
What?

210
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,028
Because I'm not your boss anymore,

211
00:13:02,028 --> 00:13:03,520
you think I'm nothing?

212
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,970
After hitting rock bottom, did you become this poisoned?

213
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,964
Was that rock bottom?

214
00:13:07,964 --> 00:13:11,020
Well, then we'll see how amazing I am when I bounce back?

215
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:16,844
Do you know?

216
00:13:16,844 --> 00:13:18,970
How funny you sound?

217
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:24,320
It seems that there is nothing to be scared of because Hoo Joon lets you talk and hang around with him.

218
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,180
That's why you're still "Just Geunyoung."

219
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,100
Hoo Joon embraces his anti-fan?

220
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,370
And so you're on a TV show?

221
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,740
Don't tell me you naively believe that.

222
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,290
You can't be that stupid.

223
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:44,180
Since your junior is so stupid and on a show with someone who got her fired,

224
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:48,240
couldn't you have just felt sorry for her and wished her well?

225
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,330
Do you just have to attack me and be so sarcastic?

226
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:02,710
So, shall we continue discussing the proposal?

227
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,230
I've been thinking.

228
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,640
The concept isn't very good.

229
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,960
Let's call the pictorial off.

230
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,200
- Let's go. 
  - (What?)

231
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,120
What? I said let's go.

232
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,379
What's wrong with you?

233
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:27,030
You've seen the articles, right?

234
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,150
I've decided to...

235
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,558
embrace my anti-fan.

236
00:14:32,558 --> 00:14:34,330
Do you know why?

237
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:37,310
No matter how much she hates me,

238
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,950
she doesn't steal things from me.

239
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,168
And if she does something wrong,

240
00:14:42,168 --> 00:14:45,240
she knows how to say sorry.

241
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,770
I think you're her anti-fan.

242
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:51,600
If you apologize sincerely, I'll reconsider it.

243
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,190
Let's go.

244
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,310
Everyone gather up.

245
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:22,810
Hoo Joon's pictorial proposal...

246
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,830
Redo it, from the beginning.

247
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,108
Why did you do that?

248
00:15:37,108 --> 00:15:40,079
That'll make the staff crazy with more work.

249
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,870
You didn't have to do that for me.

250
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,480
It wasn't for you.

251
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:53,280
I don't know whose proposal that was, but it was cliche.

252
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,568
Why?

253
00:15:54,568 --> 00:15:56,140
I liked the proposal.

254
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,420
So you just sat back and let them take it from you?

255
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,310
You even let them drive you out

256
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,108
and you just came to our company and protested.

257
00:16:04,108 --> 00:16:06,520
Because you always do weird things which led you here.

258
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,470
And whose fault is that?

259
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:11,600
- What? 
 -  Because of whom was it that got me fired?

260
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,179
Even when I did nothing wrong, it was you who got me fired!

261
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:18,920
If I hadn't gotten involved with you, I'd still work here.

262
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,670
Don't take it out on me.

263
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,140
Hey, okay.

264
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,500
Let's say it's my fault.

265
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,534
But I don't think that's the whole story.

266
00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:31,250
You don't react even if they say mean things to you.

267
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,500
So the company knew you'd take your firing lying down.

268
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,650
Because you're a pushover.

269
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,460
So, have you never thought about why you were fired?

270
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,930
 I don't understand. 

271
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,950
 I thought you'd say okay. 

272
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,210
Don't talk like that.

273
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,680
I'm not the only one who talks like this.

274
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,120
I helped you because she was bullying you.

275
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,460
Instead of thanks, you take it out on me.

276
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,430
Look at you.

277
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,770
You're being emotional and impulsive, and only thinking from your perspective.

278
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:00,282
You just say what you want.

279
00:17:00,282 --> 00:17:02,230
Maybe you're not fit to be a journalist.

280
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,270
Do you also think I so pathetic because I'm always getting hit here and there?

281
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:09,290
I may have been "Just Geunyoung" when I used to work here,

282
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:13,410
but I was much happier writing here than on TV  wearing things I don't like.

283
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:16,670
How can you come out like this after you ruined my life?

284
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,870
You're the one I'm not fit to be with.

285
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,000
Did you meet him?

286
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,350
 He's a Korean living in Japan. 

287
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,590
He's in his 50s now.

288
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,830
 He immigrated to Japan when he was in his 30s. 

289
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,550
And the picture?

290
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,979
It's his ring.

291
00:17:44,979 --> 00:17:47,970
 That day, two men came to him with the same ring 

292
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:50,770
 asking about the people who own those rings. 

293
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,210
What did he tell them?

294
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,680
He said they're the rings he made for his friends.

295
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,070
It was 27 years ago.

296
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:01,430
He didn't say why the men were looking for the rings?

297
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,670
 They just said they needed to find him. 

298
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:09,460
We have to find him first, the person those two men are looking for.

299
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:12,520
Call me if you find anything new.

300
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,920
 Yes, Sir. 

301
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,460
Rings, 27 years ago...

302
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,679
Who's he looking for?

303
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,780
   

304
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,500
 Hoo Joon embraces his anti-fan? 

305
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,710
 And so you're on a TV show? 

306
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,080
 Don't tell me you naively believe that. 

307
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,580
 You can't be that stupid. 

308
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,506
- Hello.
-  Geunyoung. 

309
00:19:02,506 --> 00:19:04,230
 It's me, JJ. 

310
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,272
Oh, yes.

311
00:19:06,272 --> 00:19:08,920
You called the pictorial off?

312
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:13,820
They said they'd even cooperate with the reality show. Why call it off?

313
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:17,010
To be honest,

314
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,560
I just don't want to do it.

315
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,850
Do you think you can just...

316
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,620
Is it because of that woman?

317
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,880
Because she was fired from there?

318
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,779
Did she beg you not to do it?

319
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:37,020
I wish.

320
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,079
You're really out of your mind if this is all for her.

321
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:43,170
And even if it's just you breaking your deal with the magazine,

322
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,670
you're still out of your mind.

323
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,920
Come on!

324
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,464
I just said I just don't want to do it!

325
00:19:49,464 --> 00:19:52,030
Let Jihyuk do it instead.

326
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,460
What?

327
00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:56,970
Hey. You're jealous?

328
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:57,930
Huh?

329
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,879
Jealous? You're being creepy.

330
00:19:59,879 --> 00:20:02,320
You told me to let other rookies be famous, too.

331
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,540
So I listened to you. Why?

332
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,170
I'm saying that's good.

333
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,670
And I'm helping you.

334
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,650
Let him do it in my place.

335
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:12,250
It wasn't even a contract.

336
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,370
This isn't the first pictorial we've called off.

337
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,200
You're good at handling those.

338
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,870
I just won't do it!

339
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,270
I said no.

340
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,110
Good luck, Sir!

341
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,224
Hey. Hey!

342
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:25,470
Come here!

343
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,770
Hey!

344
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,800
Was it really about Geunyoung?

345
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,060
No.

346
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,600
Just because.

347
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,430
Hey, Bro.

348
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:42,590
Go in. I left you a gift.

349
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,090
A gift?

350
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,820
Yeah, go in.

351
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,310
Youngseok.

352
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,520
He said he left me a gift?

353
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,000
What gift!

354
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,779
The shoot today must've been tiring.

355
00:20:55,779 --> 00:20:58,490
Yes, it was a bit.

356
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:03,630
The shoot was at the company I used to work for.

357
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,240
That's must have been awkward.

358
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,220
Well...

359
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,810
People might wonder why I care for the company I already quit...

360
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,070
How could you not?

361
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,810
People are so cold when they talk about others' affairs.

362
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:16,640
Right?

363
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,190
Right.

364
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,970
Hey, it's me. Open up.

365
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,910
I said it's me. Open the door.

366
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,360
Did she go somewhere?

367
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,579
I'm coming in.

368
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,390
After what I've done for her, she just goes out?

369
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:01,850
Isn't filming there going too far?

370
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,450
Why? Answer it.

371
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,210
I don't have to.

372
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,162
What?

373
00:22:11,162 --> 00:22:13,470
Not answering her phone, either?

374
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,646
 I work at Wonder Woman. 

375
00:22:18,646 --> 00:22:20,679
 You were a journalist? 

376
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,150
It's me.

377
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:29,880
You remember that journalist from the Benny Club that gave you the business card that time?

378
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,770
So what happened?

379
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:34,762
I lost my cool.

380
00:22:34,762 --> 00:22:36,390
I talked back to her.

381
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:39,979
And I thought that'd make me feel better.

382
00:22:39,979 --> 00:22:42,860
But it didn't.

383
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,970
I don't feel good.

384
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:47,410
People are just giving you a hard time.

385
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:50,179
From now on, I'll stop all that.

386
00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:55,320
Who's giving my rookie a hard time?

387
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,770
Rookie...

388
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,020
What do you mean?

389
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,179
Stop joking about that.

390
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:01,520
Joking?

391
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,030
It's not my style to say what I don't mean.

392
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,020
I have the contract.

393
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,060
Let me get it.

394
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:11,100
Please stop.

395
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,316
You're strong...

396
00:23:24,316 --> 00:23:26,500
I'm sorry.

397
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,020
It's really there.

398
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:41,830
Why?

399
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,330
Do you know that ring?

400
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,779
Yes.

401
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:49,730
It looks like the one I found in Japan.

402
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,810
You found a ring?

403
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:54,520
Yeah, someone dropped it.

404
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,960
Oh.

405
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,175
It was yours?

406
00:23:58,175 --> 00:24:00,579
When you came to the hotel?

407
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:03,250
Yes.

408
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,430
I left it at the reception.

409
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,930
Oh, you did?

410
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:06,640
Yes.

411
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,360
Thank you.

412
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,390
Do you think I'll answer your call?

413
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,430
You jerk.

414
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:25,079
I've got a little pride, too.

415
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:38,970
Yes, Soohwan.

416
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:42,340
 Lee Geunyoung, where and what are you doing? 

417
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,000
You guys are already drunk without me?

418
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,960
I'm right here.

419
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,020
Lee Geunyoung!

420
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,150
You're late.

421
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,279
Why are you here?

422
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:22,570
Don't talk like that!

423
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:25,660
You should've told me you invited our Hoo Joon.

424
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,668
Why aren't you answering your phone?

425
00:25:28,668 --> 00:25:30,310
Our Hoo Joon?

426
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,070
Remember that day?

427
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,350
When you threw up.

428
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,500
I gave him my card.

429
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,700
He remembered it.

430
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,600
He's a really smart guy.

431
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,390
I'm not smart.

432
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:46,490
It's a day I'll never forget.

433
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,520
You're really crazy.

434
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,290
How can you throw...

435
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,979
throw up on him?

436
00:25:54,979 --> 00:25:55,930
So,

437
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,170
did you have to throw your shoes away?

438
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:59,430
They must've been expensive.

439
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:02,600
Mijeong, you weren't there.

440
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,450
It wasn't like you could wash it off.

441
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,220
Come on, Geunyoung.

442
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,350
How could you have done that?

443
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,060
Stop it, Mijeong.

444
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,520
Geunyoung must be embarrassed.

445
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,170
To be honest,

446
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:18,770
I'm the type that can get over things quickly.

447
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:22,060
Hoo Joon is definitely a big man.

448
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:25,279
He is so generous with things that he can't be considered a world star.

449
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,000
He's the universe's top star.

450
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,060
Let's have a drink.

451
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,900
What are you guys doing?

452
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,450
Geez.

453
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,864
Come on, Geunyoung. Join us.

454
00:26:42,864 --> 00:26:44,446
Soju, right?

455
00:26:44,446 --> 00:26:45,270
Yes.

456
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,370
But I'll drink by myself.

457
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,000
Let me pour you some.

458
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,030
♫  I wonder what is love  ♫

459
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:01,710
♫  There is no answer, it's just a question  ♫

460
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:06,000
♫  But I'm falling  ♫

461
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,290
♫  Again I'm falling  ♫

462
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:13,930
♫  Are you falling   ♫

463
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:16,830
♫  in love too?  ♫

464
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,720
How is it?

465
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,810
Does it suit me?

466
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:23,630
 But can you do this without telling them? 

467
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,570
They won't know I'm singing it.

468
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,310
If the song goes viral,

469
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,990
everything will be fine.

470
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,410
I don't know.

471
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:33,500
There are no secrets in this business.

472
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,878
 One more time? 

473
00:27:36,878 --> 00:27:38,550
Yes.

474
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:41,430
So where have I been today?

475
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,030
So,

476
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,779
you've been to Wonder Woman.

477
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:48,060
Joon saved your butt.

478
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,310
Saved my butt?

479
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,970
He's not Superman.

480
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,720
He just tried to look cool.

481
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,640
It's all about his image.

482
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,270
Please understand, Joon.

483
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:00,079
Geunyoung has a right to be angry.

484
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:01,470
Honestly,

485
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:04,290
that proposal was hers.

486
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,000
Don't even talk about that.

487
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,100
He said it was bad.

488
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,779
Cliche.

489
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,350
That whole company is rotten.

490
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,470
Who's that woman?

491
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,680
The one with weird eye makeup?

492
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,100
I don't like her.

493
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,060
Huh.

494
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,479
You're at 50 meters again...

495
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:30,300
I should have caught a seed hen on a day like this.

496
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,990
Aren't seed hens what mothers-in-law give to their sons-in-law?

497
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:37,010
She works at a chicken house.

498
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,120
Chicken house?

499
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,998
A chicken restaurant.

500
00:28:39,998 --> 00:28:43,140
You can't even go to those places because of people, right?

501
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,310
Still, I'd love to visit your place.

502
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,170
I love chicken.

503
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:50,020
So do I.

504
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,640
We have lots of things in common.

505
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,906
What Koreans don't love chicken?

506
00:28:53,906 --> 00:28:55,470
So, what's your favorite?

507
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,600
Fried or seasoned?

508
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,600
One, two, three!

509
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,770
- Fried! 
 - Fried!

510
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,520
I knew it.

511
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,000
Seasoned is the best.

512
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,020
 Mrs. Jang, you're not sleeping? 

513
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:11,930
 You brat... you must be back to normal if you're calling me drunk. 

514
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:16,600
You must be back to normal if you're calling me brat.

515
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,640
How's dad?

516
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,560
Your dad listens to people too easily.

517
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:25,436
He once said he was going to go to the broadcasting station to break some antennas,

518
00:29:25,436 --> 00:29:29,310
then somebody must've said he's lucky to have a famous daughter.

519
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:34,310
He's drunk and bought another set of biographies.

520
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:36,370
Gosh.

521
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,810
The storage room must be fit to burst by now.

522
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:44,460
 I am, too. I'm so stressed out. 

523
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,636
Right.

524
00:29:45,636 --> 00:29:48,400
I'll go cut up a Korean melon.

525
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,310
Joon,

526
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,108
do you like Korean melon?

527
00:29:53,108 --> 00:29:56,220
Yeah, well, I'll eat them.

528
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,680
I'm a Korean guy if I'm good at peeling.

529
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,879
I'll be right back.

530
00:30:00,879 --> 00:30:02,370
Wait for me.

531
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,580
Hey, Jihyang.

532
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,770
I'll go soon.

533
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,740
Mom.

534
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:21,220
You really don't have to worry about me now.

535
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,570
I'm really, really, really, really okay.

536
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:26,940
 I don't worry anymore. 

537
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,030
Honestly,

538
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:31,420
it's your dad who worries me.

539
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:34,278
Much more than you do.

540
00:30:34,278 --> 00:30:35,970
And Geunyoung.

541
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:39,390
 You always woke up on time in the morning when you were young. 

542
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:42,650
 I never had to. 

543
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:43,770
Mom.

544
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:46,930
All kids wake up early when they're young.

545
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,670
Geunyoung,

546
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:49,979
I'm...

547
00:30:49,979 --> 00:30:53,690
You're going to say you're sorry again.

548
00:30:55,579 --> 00:30:59,870
Seriously, stop saying that you're sorry.

549
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:02,850
Just listen.

550
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,790
I...

551
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:11,610
I need to get to bed, what time is it?

552
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:14,560
Okay.

553
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,850
 Stop drinking so much, you brat. 

554
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,520
You're alive and well, Mom.

555
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,082
Go to bed.

556
00:31:21,082 --> 00:31:23,470
I'll call you tomorrow.

557
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,670
Your phone works fine. Why didn't you pick up?

558
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,810
After everything you said to me, do you have the memory of a goldfish?

559
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:41,810
What kind of fish are you?

560
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:44,060
Don't get so emotional again.

561
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:47,680
It must be great for you to hide your emotions so well.

562
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,680
Why come here and put on a show?

563
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,970
When did I put on a show?

564
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:56,470
You didn't pick up so I came to...

565
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,479
It's not that I was worried.

566
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:04,600
No matter what happens to me,

567
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,480
why do you even care?

568
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,950
What's wrong with you lately?

569
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,350
If it's because of what happened the other day,

570
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:19,240
I can call it a mistake if you want me to.

571
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,596
It's okay, you probably didn't even know who you were kissing.

572
00:32:21,596 --> 00:32:24,270
If it was a mistake I'd say it was.

573
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:27,520
Do you really think I'd make the excuse that I thought you were someone else?

574
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,379
And would that really make you feel better?

575
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:41,150
Never mind. Just leave. You really don't belong here.

576
00:32:54,979 --> 00:32:56,310
I'm sorry, but...

577
00:32:56,310 --> 00:33:00,150
My manager is out front, as I have something scheduled for tomorrow.

578
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,120
At least eat this first.

579
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,392
You guys are amazing.

580
00:33:06,392 --> 00:33:08,180
Next time, I'll invite you guys.

581
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,600
Really? When?

582
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,814
- We should fix the date... 
 - Hey!

583
00:33:11,814 --> 00:33:14,600
How can Hoo Joon know his schedule off the top of his head?

584
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,350
Call me again after you check it.

585
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,560
Yes, I will.

586
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,450
Have fun guys.

587
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:22,520
Geunyoung.

588
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,680
Get home safe.

589
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,980
Yes. Bye.

590
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:30,630
No need to see me out.

591
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,400
Goodbye.

592
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:39,790
Hoo Joon, Hoo Joon!  Hoo Joon was here!

593
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,060
He's nice.

594
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:41,850
Geunyoung,

595
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,470
you totally misunderstood his character.

596
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,056
I know.

597
00:33:46,056 --> 00:33:48,810
You can tell who a man is when he drinks.

598
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,579
He's...

599
00:33:50,579 --> 00:33:51,310
straight-forward.

600
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,446
And gentle.

601
00:33:52,446 --> 00:33:54,220
Are you guys really my friends?

602
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,770
You saw everything at the club.

603
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:57,680
And I told you everything.

604
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,350
You still like Hoo Joon that much?

605
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,770
I didn't say I like him.

606
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,020
I know.

607
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:06,610
We just don't think he's such a bad person. That's all.

608
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:09,440
Stop.

609
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,610
I know he's not a bad person.

610
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:14,650
And it's more annoying.

611
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,350
You're here.

612
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,860
Was that Hoo Joon just now?

613
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,979
Since when was he here?

614
00:34:19,979 --> 00:34:20,930
Why didn't you call me?

615
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:24,490
With your bar exam so close, I didn't want to bother you.

616
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:28,300
Who is Hoo Joon to interrupt your studying?

617
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,690
Am I not a human being during exams?

618
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:33,620
You should have called me!

619
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,670
Where are we right now?

620
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:45,279
Nowhere.

621
00:34:45,279 --> 00:34:47,220
Jihyang.

622
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,220
I'm getting tipsy.

623
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:56,830
You say that a lot.

624
00:35:24,979 --> 00:35:27,880
Did she get home safe?

625
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,450
What the?

626
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,970
What are you doing?

627
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,150
Why are you awake?

628
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,530
Huh?

629
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,880
Right, why am I awake?

630
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,180
But anyway, can't you ring the bell?

631
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,020
You think this is your place?

632
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,110
Jeez.

633
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,170
He's acting strange these days.

634
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,140
Geunyoung,

635
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,179
how have you been?

636
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:23,600
Senior we just saw each other a few days ago.

637
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,550
Oh, you're right.

638
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,060
How have the last few days been, then?

639
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,270
I'm really out of it nowadays.

640
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:34,310
You used to help me a lot back when we worked together.

641
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,890
Wasn't I "Just Geunyoung?"

642
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:39,020
No one can really replace you.

643
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,772
Too late.

644
00:36:40,772 --> 00:36:42,470
Remember that day?

645
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:45,970
I was reading articles about Hoo Joon's concert on New Year's Eve.

646
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,350
We talked about him then.

647
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:49,100
Wow.

648
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:52,850
It's so cool to see you in the articles with him.

649
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:54,600
I remember it.

650
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,640
That day, only I worked late.

651
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,260
You did?

652
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,810
That Meanhee or Moonhee.

653
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:05,200
She made you work late on New Year's Eve?

654
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,370
Senior.

655
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,772
Geunyoung.

656
00:37:07,772 --> 00:37:10,480
Please persuade Hoo Joon.

657
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,664
Hey.

658
00:37:11,664 --> 00:37:13,640
If he calls it off now,

659
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,020
what do we do?

660
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:19,310
Shouldn't Moonhee have come here herself?

661
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:21,020
You know how she is.

662
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,970
My lips are all chapped from biting them.

663
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:25,379
We're the ones dying at the office.

664
00:37:25,379 --> 00:37:28,720
I was the only one who was dying when I worked there. Don't you remember?

665
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,579
Geunyoung.

666
00:37:30,579 --> 00:37:32,230
I'm going to church now.

667
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,060
What?

668
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,560
To repent.

669
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,806
Or is a temple better? Should I shave my head and live on a mountain?

670
00:37:37,806 --> 00:37:39,100
I'll...

671
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,920
do anything you ask.

672
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,480
Huh?

673
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:05,580
What?

674
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,570
Waiting for someone?

675
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,050
No.

676
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,440
What will you sing first?

677
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:15,279
Bro,

678
00:38:15,279 --> 00:38:16,770
can we take a quick break?

679
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,220
Sure.

680
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:28,660
Now they're coming to me for favors.

681
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,560
Hello?

682
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,570
What are you doing?

683
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:38,310
What?

684
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,930
I mean. Where are you?

685
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:43,480
I have something to tell you.

686
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,480
Now?

687
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,930
I'm at the company.

688
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:48,680
Then I'll be there.

689
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,720
Is that okay?

690
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,720
You'll come here?

691
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,060
It's not like they won't let me enter.

692
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,370
I'll be there. Bye.

693
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:12,870
Humans are animals that are oblivious.

694
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:16,130
I completely forgot about those girls.

695
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,300
What should I do?

696
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,390
Jihyang.

697
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,270
He said this is what would happen.

698
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:25,560
I'll bring you inside.

699
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,388
A separate entrance for VIPs.

700
00:39:27,388 --> 00:39:28,520
There's such a thing?

701
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,279
- That's awesome. 
 - Let's go.

702
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,140
Can I come in?

703
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,706
You're here.

704
00:39:39,706 --> 00:39:41,674
Aren't you working?

705
00:39:41,674 --> 00:39:44,650
I do have a recording session later.

706
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:46,470
I'm fine. Come sit.

707
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:52,502
So this is what a recording studio looks like.

708
00:39:52,502 --> 00:39:55,479
Wow. It's so nice.

709
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:00,680
Didn't you say you had something to talk about?

710
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,280
Oh.

711
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,762
My coworker from Wonder Woman came to me.

712
00:40:07,762 --> 00:40:10,810
Can you say you'll do the pictorial again?

713
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:13,230
He's in trouble.

714
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,850
What will you do for me?

715
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,610
It's not for me.

716
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:20,179
You'll be someone who keeps his promise.

717
00:40:20,179 --> 00:40:22,880
It's not like I have anything to do with it.

718
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,900
You hate it that much, doing something for me?

719
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:32,280
Then stay for my recording session.

720
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,079
I need your non-show-biz ears. Tell me if it's okay.

721
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:37,196
Then I'll think about it.

722
00:40:37,196 --> 00:40:39,264
That's not hard.

723
00:40:39,264 --> 00:40:40,370
Okay.

724
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:41,790
Sing.

725
00:40:49,979 --> 00:40:54,170
♫  I wonder what is love  ♫

726
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:58,720
♫  I want to know what is love  ♫

727
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,770
♫  Your lovely look  ♫

728
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:07,180
♫  What is this taste?  ♫

729
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:10,390
♫  I wonder what is love  ♫

730
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:15,770
♫  There is no answer, it's just a question  ♫

731
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:19,390
♫  Still, I'm falling  ♫

732
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,680
 That face... 

733
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,256
 That voice... 

734
00:41:24,256 --> 00:41:29,330
 I kissed that man. 

735
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:30,579
 How was it? 

736
00:41:30,579 --> 00:41:31,970
I like it.

737
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:33,770
 The problem is the female vocal. 

738
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:35,310
Just the featured part is left.

739
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:37,770
The composer did send me a guide.

740
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:39,260
Do you want to listen?

741
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:46,170
♫  I wonder what is love  ♫

742
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:50,390
♫  I want to know what is love  ♫

743
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:54,560
♫  Your lovely look  ♫

744
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,970
♫  What is this taste?  ♫

745
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:03,060
♫  I wonder what is love  ♫

746
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:07,720
♫  There is no answer, it's just a question  ♫

747
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:11,090
♫  Still, I'm falling—  ♫

748
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,394
Hey.

749
00:42:14,394 --> 00:42:16,560
Do you know who sang this?

750
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,140
Yes.

751
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,390
Who?

752
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:19,700
Oh Inhyung?

753
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,820
I think she's a rookie.

754
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:24,770
I was looking for someone more famous.

755
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:25,470
Why?

756
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:27,700
Never mind. Let's talk later.

757
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:32,116
What did you think?

758
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:35,079
I liked the song.

759
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:36,910
Not sure about the singer though.

760
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:37,600
What?

761
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,879
I've given my opinion. Can I go?

762
00:42:40,879 --> 00:42:43,420
Let's go together. I have a schedule.

763
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:46,120
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

764
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,990
- Goodbye. 
 - Bye.

765
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:49,790
Take care.

766
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,850
I said...

767
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:06,270
I'll drop you off on the way.

768
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:07,220
Yeah, it's no problem, Geunyoung.

769
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,680
No. You have a long way to go.

770
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,720
I'm fine on my own.

771
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,390
You never listen. So stubborn.

772
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:15,890
I'll be going then.

773
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:17,590
See you tomorrow.

774
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:22,920
Bye.

775
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,580
Bye.

776
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:46,460
 Going down to the 10th floor 

777
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,660
It's you. Lee Geunyoung.

778
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:09,320
Who are you?

779
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:17,250
Are you a student?

780
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,180
Are you?

781
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,520
It's not like it's our first time meeting.

782
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,720
Oh, have...

783
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:22,930
we met?

784
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:25,479
Your memory isn't good.

785
00:45:25,479 --> 00:45:28,540
We've fought each other.  The eggs!

786
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:33,220
 How old are you guys? 

787
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,662
 18. 

788
00:45:34,662 --> 00:45:36,950
 We're eighteen. 

789
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:40,680
That wasn't fighting.

790
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,230
I was being bullied.

791
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:43,750
Don't worry.

792
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:45,804
That day when I got home...

793
00:45:45,804 --> 00:45:47,100
I felt kinda bad.

794
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:47,930
Kinda?

795
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:48,680
Where is he?

796
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:49,520
Who Joon?

797
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,560
Who Joon isn't here.

798
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,180
Then, why are you here?

799
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:58,250
I left something here so I've come to get it.

800
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:00,390
You suck at lying.

801
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,962
I know you live here.

802
00:46:02,962 --> 00:46:06,780
You think I didn't do my homework?

803
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,350
Well, that's...

804
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:10,430
my business, not yours.

805
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:11,680
Go home.

806
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,970
I'm calling the security.

807
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:15,960
You're threatening a high schooler?

808
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:22,680
Let's make a deal.

809
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:26,020
If you let me meet him, I won't tell anyone that you live here.

810
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:29,940
What if I tell all the fans that you do?

811
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:35,350
You know what will happen, right?

812
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:40,850
You don't scare me, kid.

813
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:43,480
Just let me see him. Then I'll leave.

814
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,676
Or else...

815
00:46:45,676 --> 00:46:48,000
I'll just stay here.

816
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:51,520
I'm hungry.

817
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,200
You don't have food?

818
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,279
I was undercover all day.

819
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:58,320
Why does a grown woman come home so late?

820
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:06,770
What is happening right now?

821
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:09,770
I love you, Who Joon.

822
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:13,300
I just like him so much!

823
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:18,770
T.Y.

824
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:21,860
Let me call him.

825
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:33,350
Who Joon, my angel.

826
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,430
Is it okay to be with a kid who likes Hoo Joon that much?

827
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:40,170
At first glance, she's not even normal.

828
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,700
This is insane.

829
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,070
Oh, right.

830
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:50,379
He's busy today.

831
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,890
That's too bad.

832
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:58,430
I can't reach him.

833
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:01,310
So you go home and I'll call you when he's available.

834
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:02,930
I'll just stay here till tomorrow.

835
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:04,979
I live in Gimje anyways.

836
00:48:04,979 --> 00:48:06,560
It's too late for me to leave.

837
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,610
You live in Gimje?

838
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:10,010
Yes.

839
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:12,520
Then...

840
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,979
you came from Gimje this morning?

841
00:48:14,979 --> 00:48:17,270
You do this every day to see him?

842
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:20,179
That's a lot of time and money...

843
00:48:20,179 --> 00:48:22,350
It's been a week since I ran away from home.

844
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:23,356
What?

845
00:48:23,356 --> 00:48:24,979
You're a runaway?

846
00:48:24,979 --> 00:48:28,810
Your parents must be so worried. Have you not called them?

847
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:30,570
They're not.

848
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:32,660
I'm like a lost object.

849
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,580
A lost object?

850
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:37,720
I mean.

851
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,770
My dad is a Gimje stationmaster.

852
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:45,570
When I ran away, he had me registered like a lost object in the Lost &amp; Found.

853
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:47,100
He was joking.

854
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:50,270
His daughter ran away!

855
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:54,770
And...

856
00:48:54,770 --> 00:49:00,820
you want to kick this poor thing out on the street?

857
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:04,020
Doesn't...

858
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:07,240
the second episode air tonight?

859
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:10,840
 And I'm rather hands-on for an entertainer... 

860
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,440
 That's not what I meant... 

861
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,900
 I can't let Geunyoung do somthing this hard. 

862
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:22,820
       

863
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,560
 He's so cool. 

864
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,900
Gosh.

865
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:28,930
 That's crazy. 

866
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:31,270
If she wasn't already crazy, she'd be crazy.

867
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:34,780
 I'm so nervous. 

868
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:39,692
All this episode is showin are Hoo Joon's good sides.

869
00:49:39,692 --> 00:49:41,140
Right.

870
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:45,579
This might be better watching these scenes.

871
00:49:45,579 --> 00:49:48,220
   

872
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:50,600
   

873
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,970
 Do you know what brand that is? 

874
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,890
When did they shoot this?

875
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:01,270
 Does she know how much that is? 

876
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:10,179
 Damn it. She made a cleaning rag out of his clothes? 

877
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:12,810
 She must want to be a rag herself. 

878
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:14,770
 She does everything wrong. 

879
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:17,600
Maybe she's had her reasons?

880
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:23,210
Isn't it wrong of Who Joon's fans to criticize her like that without knowing the whole story?

881
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:26,560
 Lee Geunyoung is in my hands. 

882
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:31,520
 I'm watching you 24/7. 

883
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,920
Are you Pure Yuri?

884
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:39,520
 Ms. Pure Yuri, you can't do this here. 

885
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,970
She's impossible.

886
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:45,970
 It's you who can't be doing this. 

887
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:51,070
You're the enemy of the fans around the world.

888
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:00,640
   

889
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,400
This is infuriating.

890
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:08,510
You're so dead.

891
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:34,350
It seems she found her own place to sleep.

892
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:37,210
It must be nice.

893
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:39,860
It's a truce till tomorrow.

894
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:50,810
You're going home?

895
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:52,560
Good thinking.

896
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,979
He's going to be on a talk show today.

897
00:51:54,979 --> 00:51:56,850
I have to get there and get in line.

898
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:58,770
Oh right. You'll be there.

899
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:00,560
You'll be there since you're his fan.

900
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:01,100
Oh.

901
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,850
Don't forget to let me see him after.

902
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:05,652
Or else...

903
00:52:05,652 --> 00:52:06,970
another night here.

904
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:08,860
No.

905
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:11,630
You sure have become brave in a day.

906
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:16,750
Then I'll take these hostage.

907
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:20,540
 Here. 

908
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,960
 A real birthday gift. 

909
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,680
 Try them on. 

910
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,660
No way!

911
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:28,560
Where did you find them?

912
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,850
I have to wear them today.

913
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:33,170
They're a sponsored item.

914
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:35,640
Then you'd better not stab me in the back.

915
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:36,390
Okay?

916
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:38,190
Did you live only being deceived?

917
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:43,810
There's a rumor he's releasing a single.

918
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:45,479
You looked into it?

919
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:49,979
He's going with this song.

920
00:52:49,979 --> 00:52:51,640
I heard it's a duet.

921
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,470
A duet?

922
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:53,560
That's...

923
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,270
Just play it.

924
00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:00,679
What kind of song will it be?

925
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:10,390
ANR team, are there any songs that I can release before he does?

926
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:13,190
Yes, we have several songs already prepared.

927
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:18,990
But who's singing the female vocal?

928
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:23,100
♫  What is this taste?  ♫

929
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,470
That is...

930
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:29,750
Inhyung recorded this without telling us.

931
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,370
I'm sorry.

932
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:35,910
♫  Still, I'm falling—  ♫

933
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,150
Ms. Noh!

934
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:05,570
You're here, Geunyoung.

935
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:11,420
We'll make it look like you bought everyone a beverage today.

936
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:13,270
We do have his fans at the rehearsal.

937
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:15,179
But you can handle this much, right?

938
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:16,270
Here.

939
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:17,930
Do your best!

940
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:20,290
You can do this! Fighting!

941
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:25,820
Is she slow or just dumb?

942
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:30,582
Geunyoung, you're here?

943
00:54:30,582 --> 00:54:32,370
Hello.

944
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:40,179
Where are we going?

945
00:54:40,179 --> 00:54:43,220
Be quiet. Let's listen to some music.

946
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,470
- This... 
 - Yes.

947
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:54,610
Why did you have to stab me in the back again?

948
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,640
How can this song...

949
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,720
It's not what you think, JJ.

950
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,930
I really didn't know it was his song.

951
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:08,810
♫  I wonder what is love  ♫

952
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:11,430
We'll see about that.

953
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:29,670
What are you doing here, Joon?

954
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:34,979
Is Lee Geunyoung here yet?

955
00:55:34,979 --> 00:55:36,850
- Yeah. I said hello. 
 - You did?

956
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:37,810
Yes.

957
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:39,979
How come she doesn't say hello to me?

958
00:55:39,979 --> 00:55:41,770
I don't know.

959
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:45,679
The size of the stage here...

960
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:54,370
 Thank you. 

961
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,820
 Thank you. 

962
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:00,560
She has to do that in front of my fans?

963
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,600
You know she is scared of my fans, right?

964
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:03,810
I didn't ask her to...

965
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:06,428
I just don't understand.

966
00:56:06,428 --> 00:56:09,220
Can't they ever ask the right people to do it?

967
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:11,320
She wore them!

968
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:18,890
What do I say to her?

969
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,330
I see you wore them.

970
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:26,940
They look nice on you.

971
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:45,479
 They look nice on you. 

972
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:48,430
Geunyoung.

973
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:49,979
Give them to me.

974
00:56:49,979 --> 00:56:53,200
Come on. There are more staff inside.  Let's go.

975
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:58,930
How have you been?

976
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,979
What brings you here?

977
00:57:04,979 --> 00:57:06,520
I heard you're appearing on a talk show.

978
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,770
I'm here to cheer for you and have a little talk.

979
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:10,680
Make it quick. I have to go.

980
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:11,930
I mean...

981
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:16,870
I heard Inhyung is featured on your new single?

982
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:20,270
Why are you so shocked?

983
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,470
There are no secrets in this business.

984
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:24,520
But if there was going to be anything like this,

985
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,310
you should've told me in advance.

986
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:28,825
I think there was a misunderstanding.

987
00:57:28,825 --> 00:57:31,100
I did get her guide,

988
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:33,420
but nothing's been decided.

989
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,279
Oh, Geunyoung is here, too.

990
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,730
And Jihyang.

991
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:47,050
Anyways, may we watch the shoot?

992
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:49,310
We're doing a new variety show

993
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:52,640
and it's been so long since I've seen one.  I've forgotten how it feels.

994
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,120
Sure, go ahead.

995
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,930
Geunyoung, aren't you coming?

996
00:57:56,930 --> 00:58:00,090
We'll be late. Come on.

997
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:02,860
Let's go

998
00:58:07,290 --> 00:58:12,180
What words should we use to describe you now, Who Joon?

999
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:16,446
I think "global star" isn't enough.

1000
00:58:16,446 --> 00:58:22,340
When you were young, did you ever expect this to happen?

1001
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,600
I don't know.

1002
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,890
I always imagined myself on stage.

1003
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:31,680
But it was always just a dream for me.

1004
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:37,192
I never expected people to show me so much love like this.

1005
00:58:37,192 --> 00:58:40,170
You're too humble.

1006
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:43,970
I wonder what kind of kid you were.

1007
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:47,520
I can only imagine you were popular even when you were young.

1008
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,630
Then...

1009
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:52,750
did you also have first love?

1010
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:57,290
First love?

1011
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:04,200
Well...

1012
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,770
like everyone,

1013
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:09,320
my first love was the one that got away.

1014
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:13,030
So you did have a first love.

1015
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:17,650
How much regret would she have if she were to see you now?

1016
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,179
Someone said this.

1017
00:59:20,179 --> 00:59:22,880
Second or third love...

1018
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,179
can be spoken of in the past tense.

1019
00:59:25,179 --> 00:59:27,370
But first love...

1020
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:29,730
is always with you.

1021
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:35,520
So if by some chance,

1022
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,890
your first love popped back into your life?

1023
00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:43,470
 No! No! 

1024
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:07,730
♫  I just laugh but you don't even notice  ♫

1025
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:15,210
♫  Is this the person you broke up with yesterday?  ♫

1026
01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:22,410
♫  I just thought if I spent all that time  ♫

1027
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:29,000
♫  Everything would be forgotten  ♫

1028
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:37,020
♫  When I close my eyes and think of you  ♫

1029
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:47,260
♫  I feel like I'm coming back to you any minute  ♫

1030
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:54,360
♫  It blows like the wind in my heart  ♫

1031
01:00:54,360 --> 01:01:01,670
♫  It flows and comes to me like a river  ♫

1032
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:04,180
♫  A love that I can't go back and forget  ♫

1033
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:06,970
 So you don't care what I do with Geunyoung? 

1034
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:07,520
 What? 

1035
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,720
 Why do I want to take away everything you have? 

1036
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,720
 You can't come here. 

1037
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:13,680
 You ran away? 

1038
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:17,600
 Was I ever important in your life? 

1039
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,640
 Where are we? 

1040
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:19,680
 Your parents' house. 

1041
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,430
 You can't handle them. 

1042
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:23,700
 What the? 

1043
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:26,521
 Dad! 

1044
01:01:26,521 --> 01:01:29,100
 I don't know since when... 

1045
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:31,790
 but I like you. 

1046
01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:36,180
♫  A love that I can't go back and forget  ♫

1047
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:39,420
