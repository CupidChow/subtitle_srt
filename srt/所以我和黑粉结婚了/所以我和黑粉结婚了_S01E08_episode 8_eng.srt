1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,770


2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,350
   

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,220
   

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,930
   

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,720
   

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,620
   

7
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:29,890
   

8
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:51,640
   
   

9
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,330
We've got no choice.

10
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,730
Come on.

11
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,670
Here we go.

12
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:25,560
♫  If I just look at it, I turn around and regret  ♫

13
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,120
♫  What would it have been like?  ♫

14
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:38,790
♫  Will you be in a different world from someone other than you?  ♫

15
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:47,000
♫  I can't even imagine someone else by my side  ♫

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,920
♫  When it rains  ♫

17
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,830
♫  It becomes your umbrella and the shade on a hot day  ♫

18
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:01,850
♫  Footsteps walking side by side with you  ♫

19
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:07,660
♫  That my love is only you  ♫

20
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:13,510
♫  I hold your hand casually  ♫

21
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:19,200
♫  It can't be better than this  ♫

22
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:41,400
♫  I just laugh but you don't even notice  ♫

23
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:49,850
♫  Is this the person you broke up with yesterday?  ♫

24
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:56,150
♫  I just thought if I spent all that time  ♫

25
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:03,750
♫  Everything would be forgotten  ♫

26
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:10,870
♫  When I close my eyes and think of you  ♫

27
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:20,800
♫  I feel like I'm coming back to you any minute  ♫

28
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:28,090
♫  It blows like the wind in my heart  ♫

29
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:35,480
♫  It flows and comes to me like a river  ♫

30
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:43,550
♫  A love that I can't go back and forget  ♫

31
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:50,930
♫  It's blowing, blowing in my chest  ♫

32
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,400
Wait.

33
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,720
When did it come off?

34
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,990
Are you just throwing away the gift I gave you?

35
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,100
Gift, whatever...

36
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,520
It was for the show.

37
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,060
You're dumb.

38
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,810
You couldn't buy this even if you wanted to.

39
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,890
It has the Who Joon trademark.  It's premium Who Joon.

40
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,310
Oh yes. I should hurry up and sell it then.

41
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,670
You would sell my gift?

42
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,890
Why so sensitive? It didn't even mean anything.

43
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:29,810
Hey.

44
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,210
Maybe it means something now.

45
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,460
Think of it as an early birthday gift.

46
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,480
How did he know it was my birthday.

47
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,080
What?

48
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,040
Nothing.

49
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,310
Goodbye.

50
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,140
Thank you.

51
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,650
Who Joon's trademark?

52
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,680
 I told you to wait. 

53
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,130
Why were you outside?

54
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,820
I thought you'd be late.

55
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,290
What?

56
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,580
You wanted to get soaked without an umbrella?

57
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,920
Goodness.

58
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,470
You can't believe the weather forecast these days.

59
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,500
The sky is suddenly clearing up like this.

60
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,270
That's why you should always carry an umbrella.

61
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,310
Don't trust what they say about the weather.

62
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,630
So what if I get caught in the rain?

63
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,050
Right.

64
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,880
You really...

65
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,230
make people to always want to put an umbrella over your head.

66
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,780
Since the old days.

67
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,520
Jaejoon.

68
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,930
Can I get a new profile?

69
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,750
The current one is too old.

70
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,840
Isn't that what your manager is supposed to do?

71
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,120
They always make me do everything when I'm the CEO.

72
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,020
    
    

73
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,270
   

74
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:31,480
It's been almost a week already.

75
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,900
Still, no one's on my side.

76
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,498
That's right.

77
00:06:41,498 --> 00:06:44,770
I forgot that I have my friends.

78
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,390
   

79
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,970
   

80
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,930
    
   I'm cheering for you!  I support you! 

81
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:56,240
This is somehow very addicting.

82
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,270
How is it?

83
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,810
Good?

84
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,260
Geunyoung will continue to have a hard time.

85
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,344
Well...

86
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:08,600
So it's bad?

87
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,640
Well, I'm not saying that.

88
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,608
Hoo Joon's good side gets more attention.

89
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:15,720
Okay.

90
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,600
This should be good for the second episode.

91
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,390
By the way, are you going to show Joon behind-the-scene cuts?

92
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,470
Forget that.

93
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,850
His agency won't let us.

94
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,440
Well, if that's the case...

95
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,062
...then we'll fake it.

96
00:07:28,062 --> 00:07:29,430
Bad boy.

97
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,720
People in this industry are known for being bad people.

98
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,720
They probably didn't listen to their parents.

99
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,810
Goodness.

100
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:38,600
Hey.

101
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,680
Hoo Joon and his agency are in this industry, too.

102
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,220
Did they listen to them?

103
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,600
That's true.

104
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,020
That's right.

105
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,970
Only Geunyoung is not from the show business world.

106
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,560
Somehow, I'm always worried about her.

107
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,520
Why don't you worry about me?

108
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,410
You're just as bad.

109
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,180
You're of this world.

110
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:07,930
You too!

111
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,490
I know!

112
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,300
He must be worried, too.

113
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,840
Yes, Joon.

114
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,690
Really?

115
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,660
And?

116
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,180
 Good work. 

117
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,060
The article will be up in two days.

118
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,890
Okay.

119
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,192
Thank you.

120
00:08:33,192 --> 00:08:35,556
How's the show going?

121
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,220
Well, it's going.

122
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,020
Maybe because it's too harsh.

123
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,420
Lee Geunyoung,

124
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,360
she's interviewing around, hoping to be a journalist again.

125
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,430
Oh yeah?

126
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:50,180
Well, she's got to think about her future after the show is over.

127
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,684
Great work.

128
00:08:51,684 --> 00:08:53,810
- I'll call you. 
 - Bye.

129
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,390
About the upcoming reality show shoot...

130
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,270
They rented "Club Benny."

131
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,520
Why there?

132
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,890
We should change it, right?

133
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:04,760
But we can't give specific reasons.

134
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,374
Well, okay.

135
00:09:08,374 --> 00:09:10,200
Okay.

136
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,970
By the way, Hoo Joon isn't coming?

137
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,390
He left already.

138
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,310
You want him to be gone,

139
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,430
but it bothers you that he isn't here?

140
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,270
What?

141
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,390
Not at all.

142
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,680
Baby,

143
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,140
be careful.

144
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,220
If you fall for guys that wear makeup, cleansing cream is useless.

145
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,560
You'll never wipe them out of your head.

146
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,060
What do you mean "fall for"? Fall for him?

147
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,040
Come on.

148
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,270
Geunyoung.

149
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,720
Hello.

150
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,810
I guess the shoot isn't here today?

151
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,020
Well, we'll be moving.

152
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,810
The place isn't good for getting ready, so.

153
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,200
Excuse me.

154
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,250
Yes, Mr. Han.

155
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,810
I really didn't by the way.

156
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,600
It's okay.

157
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,430
What do you mean it's okay?

158
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,060
Come on...

159
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,140
You guys are weird.

160
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,920
I didn't...

161
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,560
   

162
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,480
I'm back here again for the shoot?

163
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:34,100
 You have to apologize. 

164
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,980
 I can't hold it back anymore! 

165
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,840
Maybe it's fate.

166
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,806
What do we do?

167
00:10:48,806 --> 00:10:50,370
Geunyoung.

168
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,390
What do we do?

169
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:55,250
Hoo Joon got in an accident on the way.

170
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,046
An accident?

171
00:10:57,046 --> 00:10:58,250
You heard?

172
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,016
Wait a minute.

173
00:11:00,016 --> 00:11:01,600
So tell me.

174
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,900
What happened to the car?

175
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,850
- How can this... 
- How bad is it?

176
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,180
Where's the hospital?

177
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,430
We're looking into it.

178
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,720
Wait just a minute.

179
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,060
I'll find out and tell you right away.

180
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,100
- Where are you? 
 - Sit tight here.

181
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,090
Where's the hospital?

182
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,860
Oh no...

183
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,220
What do I do?

184
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:31,150
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

185
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,620
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

186
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,280
Surprised?

187
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,810
But you got in an accident...

188
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,450
In a manner of speaking.

189
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,220
With the jam-packed traffic, a filming schedule accident, I guess.

190
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,810
What? You can't joke around like that.

191
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,430
I'm here to surprise you.

192
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:53,620
Blow your candles.

193
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,650
Happy birthday.

194
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,620
How did you guys know?

195
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:12,930
Here.

196
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,730
Your birthday gift.

197
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,810
I didn't know your size.

198
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:22,930
Try them on.

199
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,900
It's okay. They'll fit.

200
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,150
It's okay.

201
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,900
Congratulations!

202
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,240
Happy birthday.

203
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,350
Thank you.

204
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,700
Happy birthday, Geunyoung.

205
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,810
The shoot for my profile is here?

206
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:57,108
That and a surprise.

207
00:12:57,108 --> 00:12:58,800
A surprise?

208
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,640
Yeah.

209
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,260
It's nothing.

210
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,482
I think the camera crew is here.

211
00:13:04,482 --> 00:13:06,040
Let's go.

212
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,220
I'm mad.

213
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,540
I was in shock. I believed it.

214
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,270
Just like the prank from last time,

215
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,350
why are you so gullible?

216
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:20,730
The writer and producer here are both good actors.

217
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,760
Geunyoung. Joon.

218
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,410
Today's second surprise.

219
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:28,560
We've got a special guest for you.

220
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,740
Shall we?

221
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,278
Come!

222
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:33,110
A surprise!

223
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,240
Happy birthday.

224
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,700
Hello.

225
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,890
What are you doing?

226
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,020
A surprise!

227
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,470
Let's talk, Mr. Han.

228
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,110
Why?

229
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:52,010
You're really surprised, huh?

230
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,220
What brings you here?

231
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,180
Oh.

232
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,770
It was for Inhyung's profile.

233
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,392
But I heard there was a shoot.

234
00:13:59,392 --> 00:14:01,400
And it was her birthday.

235
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,740
This is a reality show, right?

236
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,180
What a coincidence.

237
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,100
I know.

238
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,960
Well, us three know each other well.

239
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,200
And I know Geunyoung, too.

240
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,638
Geunyoung,

241
00:14:13,638 --> 00:14:16,150
you know Inhyung. Right? She's a singer.

242
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,470
Hello.

243
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,550
What's wrong?

244
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,270
The shoes are a bit small on me.

245
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,060
Are you okay?

246
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,020
I'm okay.

247
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,070
You sure?

248
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,700
I'm sorry.

249
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,800
Geunyoung.

250
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,570
Happy birthday.

251
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,610
Cheers.

252
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,890
Why didn't you tell me?

253
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,520
I didn't know about it either.

254
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,720
Because it was your birthday,

255
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,970
I got you a few things. Are they okay?

256
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,520
Yes, I really like them.

257
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,190
Thank you.

258
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,520
Hey, Joon.

259
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,970
Remember Inhyung's birthday?

260
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:10,770
We didn't know about much about what to do for birthdays

261
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,488
Oh.

262
00:15:12,488 --> 00:15:14,510
Maybe I just didn't know?

263
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,350
Why?

264
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,520
You got me a cake and sang for me.

265
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,640
It was a proper party.

266
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,220
I was very young then.

267
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,390
So Joon and Jaejoon took care of me a lot.

268
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,850
I see.

269
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,310
You both remember, right?

270
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,640
We ate so much tteokbokki that we got tired of it.

271
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,560
Because Inhyung loves it.

272
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,470
So you like tteokbokki, Inhyung.

273
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,850
I love tteokbokki, too.

274
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,640
Oh.

275
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,100
You too?

276
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,040
We should go eat together sometime.

277
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,370
Sure.

278
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,810
I'm sorry to Joon,

279
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:01,680
but I've become such a fan of Geunyoung.

280
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,100
Isn't she more human?

281
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,600
The last time we met, she also loved hangover soup.

282
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,840
So I thought about it.

283
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,850
I thought Geunyoung could actually make her broadcasting debut.

284
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:13,930
Come on.

285
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,570
What are you saying?

286
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,950
We're looking for rookies right now.

287
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,360
Restroom.

288
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,470
There it is.

289
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:35,400
Why is the restroom always hard to find?

290
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,430
I'm grateful but...

291
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:42,250
he should've asked for my size.

292
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,940
Is Joon nice to you?

293
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:16,060
It's just for the show.

294
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,410
You also know...

295
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,680
my boss well?

296
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,670
Oh. Jaejoon?

297
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,150
You know his real name.

298
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,526
You must be close.

299
00:17:28,526 --> 00:17:29,760
Are we?

300
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,480
We just ran into each other a lot.

301
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,142
He doesn't talk about me?

302
00:17:37,142 --> 00:17:39,096
Which he?

303
00:17:39,096 --> 00:17:41,130
He must not...

304
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,570
Let's go.

305
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:59,150
It was you that day as well, right?

306
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,810
Oh.

307
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:08,920
Yes.

308
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,930
We've met quite a lot.

309
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,560
In Japan, too.

310
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,430
I forgot to tell Joon that you were at the hotel.

311
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,050
That's okay.

312
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,680
I left my phone.

313
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,540
Go first.

314
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,310
This is where you ran into them.

315
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:34,930
Huh?

316
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,350
It's where all the bad luck began.

317
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,940
The shoes.

318
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,020
Oh.

319
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,390
It brings back memories.

320
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,980
That day, Joon and Inhyung were together?

321
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,560
Huh?

322
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,640
I don't know.

323
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,910
You're flustered.

324
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,020
Oh.

325
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,720
You know about Joon and Inhyung, too.

326
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,020
Okay.

327
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,390
That's why you know she was at the hotel?

328
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,100
Well, I guess everyone knows.

329
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,330
I...

330
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,850
Don't get the wrong idea.

331
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,100
It's not like that.

332
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,520
You want me to believe that?

333
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,310
You said it's not always what it seems.

334
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,680
This is it.

335
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,640
What you saw isn't what you think.

336
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,140
If you're bothered by it, go confront it.

337
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,430
Why run away like a coward?

338
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,420
A coward?

339
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,470
You don't even know anything yet you talk.

340
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,875
You were at...

341
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,090
his hotel?

342
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,190
You went there because you don't care about him?

343
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,772
The things that you can't own up to,

344
00:20:25,772 --> 00:20:28,400
are not things that you don't care about.

345
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,820
You can't even own up to me, either.

346
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,680
What?

347
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,430
Even you...

348
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:37,420
can't tell anyone about me.

349
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,840
I always have to hide.

350
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,180
And you don't know how it feels.

351
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,820
You're both the same.

352
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,490
Geunyoung, your foot!

353
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,220
The shoes were too small for you?

354
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,050
They looked big on you last time.

355
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:11,120
You bought these?

356
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,546
This is how I get caught.

357
00:21:14,546 --> 00:21:16,960
They don't really suit me.

358
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,200
The shoes...

359
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,930
or this place.

360
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,180
By the way,

361
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,320
why was Hoo Joon so down today?

362
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,950
The surprise party was his idea.

363
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,470
I don't understand.

364
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:30,220
He was excited about it.

365
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,940
I'll be going.

366
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,600
Bye.

367
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,490
He doesn't even know...

368
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:00,850
Mister.

369
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,560
I'll get off here.

370
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,210
Okay.

371
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,020
I'll ask them to not use what they shot today.

372
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,110
Don't worry about it.

373
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,170
Good night.

374
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,380
 Let's meet up. 

375
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,470
   

376
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,120
 Hello. 

377
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,130
Welcome.

378
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,150
Do you have...

379
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:51,020
ointment and band-aids?

380
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,390
What else do I need?

381
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,640
Where are you applying it?

382
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,680
On my wound.

383
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,390
Where?

384
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,970
My heel.

385
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:59,468
Wrong size, huh?

386
00:22:59,468 --> 00:23:02,660
What doesn't fit you always becomes a problem.

387
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,640
"What doesn't fit me...

388
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,620
always becomes a problem."

389
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:19,300
I think I bought too many things.

390
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:44,970
   
 I really didn't. 

391
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,940
 I'm not that cowardly. 

392
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,022
If I don't want to deal with this,

393
00:23:56,022 --> 00:23:58,460
I should get out of this house first.

394
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,600
What are you doing?

395
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,720
You think I wouldn't know about you two meeting?

396
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:43,130
I don't know what Lee Geunyoung told you,

397
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,640
but it's not what you think.

398
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,170
Lee Geunyoung.

399
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,010
Lee Geunyoung is so innocent.

400
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:53,620
She was so flustered.

401
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,220
But...

402
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,570
you know what's funnier?

403
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,750
It's you two.

404
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,430
I've known you both since we were young.

405
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:10,240
If you pretend like you know nothing,

406
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,030
did you think I couldn't tell by your faces?

407
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:13,810
Huh?

408
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:16,770
If you just keep doing this,

409
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:20,930
will you wake up after I have ruined Inhyung?

410
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,070
Please stop it!

411
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,910
What are you scared of?

412
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,810
You have all you asked for.

413
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,910
When will you stop?

414
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,464
Scared?

415
00:25:36,464 --> 00:25:38,172
Scared of what?

416
00:25:38,172 --> 00:25:40,780
You're the one who's scared.

417
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,156
You couldn't protect your girl,

418
00:25:43,156 --> 00:25:45,770
now you want to be the man who worries about her,

419
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,450
but I'll just ruin her anyways.

420
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:48,820
Right?

421
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,920
If that's the case,

422
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:59,100
stay still when I beat you.

423
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,470
That way, Inhyung can do something.

424
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,820
Right?

425
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,310
This prick.

426
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,670
 The door is unlocked. 

427
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,300
 The door is locked. 

428
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,180
Ouch.

429
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,990
Can you be a little more gentle?

430
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,730
Be patient.

431
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,220
Did you fall down like a kid?

432
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,730
I'm not a kid. I didn't fall down.

433
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:34,640
Then what?

434
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,560
You got into a fight?

435
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,824
I'm not a kid that fights.

436
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:40,272
It looks like you got the hell beat out of you.

437
00:27:40,272 --> 00:27:42,240
Like this...

438
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,056
What's that?

439
00:27:50,056 --> 00:27:50,850
What?

440
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:51,720
Finally moving out?

441
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,890
Before you kick me out.

442
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,100
Just stay...

443
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,970
here.

444
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,520
Looking at you now...

445
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:35,020
you're really dirty.

446
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,260
You got soju?

447
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,650
Ouch.

448
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:03,190
You see?

449
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:06,100
The girl in the rain in Okinawa...

450
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,380
Is the girl I couldn't protect.

451
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,580
I knew it.

452
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,640
But I really didn't tell him.

453
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,410
I know.

454
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,110
Please forget...

455
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,820
what I said earlier.

456
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:27,020
I can't just forget things.

457
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,920
You know I hold grudges.

458
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,660
What I did to protect everyone...

459
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,340
ended up protecting no one.

460
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:48,340
It hurt everyone.

461
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,300
And it's my fault.

462
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,630
So...

463
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:58,090
Even if you get to know me,

464
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,650
pretend like you don't.

465
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,930
No matter how much I hate you,

466
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:12,170
I don't stoop so low to mess with anyone's past.

467
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:15,420
You know I can't do much.

468
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,450
You're awake?

469
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,330
You're here.

470
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,900
It's macchiato today.

471
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:52,830
What's wrong with your face?

472
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:55,790
It's nothing.

473
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:58,860
We take so much care with your face to keep it flawless

474
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,170
and you think it's nothing?

475
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,600
Is it Jaejoon?

476
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,240
It is.

477
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,680
- This son of a... 
 - Jihyang.

478
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,330
Pretend like you don't know.

479
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,750
Let me see.

480
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:21,760
Is your wound okay? Did you apply ointment?

481
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,110
I'm okay.

482
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,460
I'm not a kid.

483
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,900
I'm canceling everything on your schedule.

484
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,260
Don't go outside for a while.

485
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,420
I'm so mad.

486
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,370
You heard from our head company?

487
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:43,150
Mr. Attorney, you'll be handling our stuff as well.

488
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,060
Yes.

489
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:48,850
I heard your president asked my law firm's boss himself.

490
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,500
Are the documents ready?

491
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,260
This is the revised version of the contract you asked for.

492
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,040
And about the penalty?

493
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,210
It's in there?

494
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:00,690
It's ten times the signing bonus if he does damage to the company's image.

495
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,480
The contract money itself is exceptional.

496
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,490
But Hoo Joon is also exceptional at keeping his image.

497
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:11,060
If he's good...

498
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,620
I can ruin it for him.

499
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,140
Sorry?

500
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,078
Never mind.

501
00:32:17,078 --> 00:32:20,770
Please take good care of my agency.

502
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:21,600
Yes.

503
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,980
- I'll take my leave. 
 - Bye.

504
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,950
And now...

505
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,770
let's take care of my image.

506
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:41,220
Geunyoung.

507
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,332
Yes, Jaejoon.

508
00:32:43,332 --> 00:32:46,620
About yesterday... can we talk in person?

509
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,700
Where should we meet?

510
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:53,250
I thought it'd be better here than outside.

511
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,290
CEO.

512
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:00,570
I am a bit powerful, right?

513
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,640
Yes.

514
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,050
It's a bit more awkward than it was yesterday.

515
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:07,250
I know.

516
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:10,220
I'm sorry to have troubled you yesterday.

517
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,722
I only did it because I thought you knew about them.

518
00:33:14,722 --> 00:33:17,946
I didn't think Joon would get that mad.

519
00:33:17,946 --> 00:33:19,218
Well.

520
00:33:19,218 --> 00:33:23,800
He might not like that I know about his past.

521
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,970
You guys made up?

522
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,640
Not really.

523
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,580
There's nothing to make up.

524
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:37,500
You're on his side as well, right?

525
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,560
I'm a bit sad.

526
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,120
Huh?

527
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,870
It's not like that.

528
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:50,650
But as for me... I don't really know.

529
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:53,750
About you three.

530
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,590
As I said, we were really close before his debut.

531
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:05,700
And only I knew about Inhyung and Joon at the time.

532
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,784
But everything changed after his debut.

533
00:34:09,784 --> 00:34:14,270
Inhyung and I thought we were abandoned by Joon.

534
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,930
Is that why you still hate him?

535
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,230
The problem is...

536
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:25,710
that Inhyung came to me after Joon left her all alone.

537
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:29,264
That's why Joon and I can't be friends anymore.

538
00:34:29,264 --> 00:34:35,260
I just don't want Inhyung to be hurt by Joon again.

539
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,620
I know.

540
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:40,080
What I've done could be out of my own inferiority.

541
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:45,420
Everything that Joon does is somehow a premium brand.

542
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:48,458
Hoo Joon's value.

543
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:51,430
You don't really get me, right?

544
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:52,602
Huh?

545
00:34:52,602 --> 00:34:54,250
Don't think that.

546
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:56,790
It's not like that.

547
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:02,110
Then can we still be friends?

548
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,440
Sure.

549
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,310
Really?

550
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,140
I was little worried.

551
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,620
About yesterday...

552
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,170
Wait.

553
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:18,680
He's with a guest right now.

554
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,400
Who's the guest?

555
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,000
Lee Geunyoung.

556
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,710
 Do you want something to eat? 

557
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,850
 There's a lot to eat. 

558
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,920
- Hel... 
 -  Why aren't you home? 

559
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,350
I'm on my way. Why?

560
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,690
- Hurry! 
 - Why...

561
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:12,360
He always hangs up like that.

562
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,760
 The door is locked. 

563
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:27,970
Where are you?

564
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:30,020
What the?

565
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,140
Yes.

566
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,270
You're here?

567
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:33,770
- You're here? 
  - Yes. 

568
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:36,180
I thought you were here.

569
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,580
Come straight to the parking lot.

570
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,100
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

571
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,020
Hurry up!

572
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,810
What's the matter?

573
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,220
Hurry.

574
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,980
Hurry!

575
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,850
Why, why, why?

576
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:54,100
We're late.

577
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,420
Where are we going?

578
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:59,170
I won't bite. Get on quickly.

579
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:08,050
♫  My heart that I couldn't tell you  ♫

580
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:12,250
♫  Now everybody knows  ♫

581
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,720
♫  I love you  ♫

582
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:24,800
♫  I hope you reach the end of the world that my love is only for you  ♫

583
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:35,940
What is this place?

584
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,990
Why is everyone lined up?

585
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:44,180
A very important game's being released today.

586
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,140
Oh. A game.

587
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,790
Is that why we're here?

588
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:48,720
No.

589
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,190
I pre-ordered it already.

590
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:53,440
But they're handing out soundtracks only when you get in line in person.

591
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,596
And that's really rare.

592
00:37:55,596 --> 00:37:58,180
It's only a few hours from now.

593
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,460
You want me to get in line by myself?

594
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,390
With me.

595
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:03,430
Why me? Ask Jihyang.

596
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:05,270
No. He can't know about it.

597
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:08,380
I thought you and Jihyang shared everything.

598
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,250
He thinks I don't play games anymore.

599
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:13,940
I missed a schedule once because of it.

600
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,420
Wait by yourself then.

601
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:19,980
The game company would be happy to hear that you play it.  It'll sell well.

602
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,040
It's dangerous alone.

603
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,560
I'm in more danger. You saw the comments?

604
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:28,370
They'll never know now. Let's go!

605
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:31,150
I can't keep wearing this. It's stuffy.

606
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:33,990
   

607
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,830
Hi.

608
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:20,770
So we just keep waiting like this?

609
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:24,320
What the hell is this game that people would wait all night for?

610
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,260
Can't you wait a bit reverently?

611
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,850
I don't know how to be reverent?

612
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:40,470
Can we not be hungry about it, too?

613
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:43,670
You're a bit of work... seriously.

614
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:47,380
I'm so hungry and this hurts.

615
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,500
Wait a minute.

616
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,350
Brother.

617
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,860
Yes.

618
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,000
I'm sorry but can you hold our place?

619
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,300
Yeah, no problem.

620
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,690
Do I take this?

621
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:14,870
 Welcome. 

622
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:28,700
Oh thank you god.

623
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,620
I can finally breathe now.

624
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,836
Your fans don't know you like games?

625
00:40:37,836 --> 00:40:40,410
They can't know about it.

626
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:41,470
Right.

627
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,390
You always need to be cool.

628
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:45,410
Playing games is also cool.

629
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:48,020
If I do something, everything becomes a trend.

630
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,720
The line would be even longer.

631
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:54,520
They should see you eating ramen like this.

632
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,970
How can I still feel your gaze through the helmet's visor?

633
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:08,680
That was good.

634
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,930
Let me throw it away.

635
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:13,090
Wait, do mine. I'm done, too.

636
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,370
Oh no!

637
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,210
I'm sorry.

638
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,930
Why did you suddenly get u

639
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:38,430
I almost got burned.

640
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:43,350
What do you mean? It was all cold.

641
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,720
I'd sue you if it was on my face.

642
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,270
Now I know why people wear helmets.

643
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:56,600
They're definitely essential, aren't they?

644
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,360
I can still smell the ramen no matter how much I try to get it off.

645
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,140
I have to go home.

646
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,220
What about me?

647
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,100
I have to go to the recording studio.

648
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,640
It's almost time.

649
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,810
- I'll pick you up soon. 
 - You want me to wait by myself?

650
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:10,220
Whose fault was it to spill ramen on me?

651
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,850
Remember that soundtrack CD is the most important.

652
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:15,800
Take a picture and send it to me.

653
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:21,980
It was less embarrassing because it was the two of us.

654
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,390
   

655
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,750
Did the helmet guy go somewhere?

656
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:43,310
Excuse me.

657
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:46,690
When will it open?

658
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:48,600
In just five hours.

659
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,140
Five hours?

660
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,850
He said it would open soon.

661
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:53,860
I did?

662
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:56,920
The helmet guy.

663
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:17,530
♫  I wonder what is love, I want to know what is love  ♫

664
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:25,900
♫  Your lovely look, what is this taste?  ♫

665
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:34,750
♫  I wonder what is love. There is no answer, it's just a question  ♫

666
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:42,660
♫  Are you falling in love too?  ♫

667
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:47,480
♫  Love, I've been looking the whole time  ♫

668
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,180
Let me take this call.

669
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:51,138
Okay.

670
00:43:51,138 --> 00:43:52,560
Bro, what's up?

671
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,810
You know Lee Geunyoung?

672
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:57,030
She interviewed for Super Patch.

673
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:59,970
You know they just stalk celebrities.

674
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,810
So what? She's got the job?

675
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:03,220
 The rumor has it that 

676
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:07,108
She got the job on the condition that she sells info on you.

677
00:44:07,108 --> 00:44:08,850
 Let me look into it more. 

678
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:11,600
Until then, be careful when you're around her.

679
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,500
 You never know. 

680
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,858
Okay.

681
00:44:14,858 --> 00:44:16,420
Thanks.

682
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,460
I'm sorry. Let's go.

683
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,770
Okay. Let's go.

684
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:32,470
♫  I wonder what is love, I want to know what is love  ♫

685
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:34,570
♫  Your lovely look  ♫

686
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:38,930
Starting now, we're giving out the soundtrack on a first-come basis.

687
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:41,580
Please line up.

688
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:47,770
 No cutting! 

689
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:06,090
   

690
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:07,930
 The rumor has it that... 

691
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:12,250
 She got the job on the condition that she sells your info. 

692
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:16,600
   

693
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:08,770
Why isn't he here? I left my wallet at home...

694
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,870
Maybe this is another prank.

695
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:18,140
Come out, everyone!

696
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:20,100
I'm not falling for it again.

697
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,860
It's my third time.

698
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:25,680
If you're drunk, just go home.

699
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,810
How dumb...

700
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:38,120
Even my battery is out.

701
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,650
He said he'd come.

702
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:01,040
Let's go.

703
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,810
What happened?

704
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:05,470
You should've just taken a cab home if I didn't show up.

705
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:07,850
I was in a hurry and left my wallet at home.

706
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:09,930
Even my phone's battery is out. How could I get home

707
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:11,850
You were supposed to come back!

708
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:15,810
Do you know how hard it was to get this poster and CD in this helmet?

709
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:17,380
Okay, just come.

710
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:21,222
What?

711
00:47:21,222 --> 00:47:23,120
What's wrong with him?

712
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,870
Do I...

713
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:36,380
take the stuff with me?

714
00:47:44,370 --> 00:47:46,120
What's up with him?

715
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,720
Jihyang.

716
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:03,076
Tell Mr. Han to come and shoot at the venue.

717
00:48:03,076 --> 00:48:05,260
And also tell him...

718
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,410
that it's the last shoot.

719
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,220
What are you saying?

720
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,220
Make it happen.

721
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,630
I'll tell Youngseok.

722
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:26,310
 What do you mean quit? 

723
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:28,060
 What the hell are you saying? 

724
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:28,770
 Hey! 

725
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:32,390
 The show is doing so great right now. 

726
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:34,770
 Do you expect the agency to take responsibility? 

727
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:38,140
 Do you think it's all about you? 

728
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:39,890
 Are you thinking straight? 

729
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:41,140
 What does Jihyang say? 

730
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:45,970
 He's always busy cleaning crap... 

731
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:54,994
Geunyoung!

732
00:48:54,994 --> 00:48:55,890
Oh.

733
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:57,390
You're here.

734
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:58,680
Where are we?

735
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,520
It's a venue for a clothing brand. Joon's here.

736
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,640
He wants to take photos with you at the photo wall.

737
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,520
With me?

738
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,550
- Take photos at the photo wall? 
 - Yes.

739
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:11,680
You know I can't.

740
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,890
At the airport...

741
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:17,380
I can't be in front of many people.

742
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:19,930
I understand how you feel.

743
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:22,020
But we do have to shoot for the show.

744
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:24,680
Geunyoung, I'm sorry. I'm asking you for a favor.

745
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:25,550
Please?

746
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:27,540
By the way...

747
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,810
Never mind. Let's do this first.

748
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:32,800
Let's quickly get you ready.

749
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,030
Don't worry too much.

750
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,150
Soohwan!

751
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:40,220
I heard Geunyoung's coming today, too?

752
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,770
Don't run into her.

753
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:42,600
Why?

754
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,430
I have to make up with her.

755
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:45,350
Please don't.

756
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:47,100
She won't be happy to see you.

757
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:51,140
I heard Geunyoung got an offer from somewhere?

758
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:52,220
What do you mean?

759
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:53,890
Rumor's around.

760
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:56,180
She got in for Hoo Joon's info.

761
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:58,920
Did you tell Hoo Joon that, too?

762
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:04,240
It's you again?

763
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,390
You scared me.

764
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:06,910
Geunyoung.

765
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:09,320
Nice to see you again.

766
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:13,500
It's true. You interviewed for Super Patch.

767
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:17,040
I'm Hoo Joon's dedicated journalist.

768
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,170
Mr. Choi?

769
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:21,490
Journalism isn't for those who can't even get their facts straight.

770
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:24,800
Does Hoo Joon know that you're that kind of journalist?

771
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:28,520
Heegeon!

772
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,930
Does she always just go off like that?

773
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:33,600
Were you always the kind who would take the star's side?

774
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,810
And did you verify the facts?

775
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:36,600
That she actually sold him out?

776
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,810
The rumor is already out there.

777
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:40,560
So did you verify it?

778
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,600
You said it's true and everyone knows.

779
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,370
Then why, as her friend, have I not heard about it?

780
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,080
It's not too much?

781
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,290
It really suits you.

782
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:02,475
No, no, baby.

783
00:51:02,475 --> 00:51:03,830
As an editor, you should know your stuff.

784
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:05,620
There is Best or Worst.

785
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:09,520
I can never see my styling being the worst. Not mine.

786
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:12,640
Oh, baby.

787
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,010
The shoes must've been small.

788
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:16,950
That must've hurt.

789
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:19,380
I can do this.

790
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,870
You're perfect.

791
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:27,970
I'll tell them you're both ready.

792
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,270
You got home safely yesterday?

793
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:42,730
Your stuff is...

794
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:47,600
 When he's not saying anything, he's saying "shut up." 

795
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,820
Is it because...

796
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:51,210
Let's go in now.

797
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:53,150
Come.

798
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:56,730
 Look here, please. 

799
00:51:56,730 --> 00:51:57,850
 Look here, please. 

800
00:51:57,850 --> 00:51:59,960
 Over here! 

801
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:09,980
 Raise your hand, please. 

802
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:12,200
 Look in the middle too. 

803
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,670
 - Over here too! 
 - Please look here. 

804
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:16,810
 Here! 

805
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:27,570
What is this?

806
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:29,040
You may make it worse.

807
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,140
That's too much.

808
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:35,320
Let me do this.

809
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,700
They are too much!

810
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,020
Where's all the security?

811
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:55,860
Sorry. I should've been more careful.

812
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:57,120
Are you okay?

813
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,920
There's no way you're okay.

814
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,870
Geunyoung, you okay?

815
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:01,950
Soohwan.

816
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:05,628
Let's just stop here.

817
00:53:05,628 --> 00:53:06,980
Can you call a cab?

818
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,870
I'll do it.

819
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:16,610
Lee Geunyoung.

820
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,320
Get some rest. I'll call you.

821
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:23,050
Don't worry about what Choi said earlier.

822
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:24,820
By the way, Geunyoung.

823
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:27,310
Today was the last shoot.

824
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:30,220
Hoo Joon said he can't do it anymore.

825
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:31,640
Why not?

826
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,620
We'll never know what a top star feels.

827
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:37,720
Anyways, we have a lot more work to do since the show has been canceled abruptly.

828
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:43,570
Here are the clothes and wine from the venue.

829
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:45,790
I meant to drink it with you after.

830
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:46,980
Let's have a drink sometime.

831
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:49,020
Go home safely.

832
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:29,770
Joon.

833
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:31,890
See you later.

834
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:32,710
Joon.

835
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:35,350
She really got me this time.

836
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:36,870
You know Lee Geunyoung.

837
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:40,434
She totally declined the Super Patch after being offered a big exclusive.

838
00:54:40,434 --> 00:54:43,670
She has some good sides, I guess.

839
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:47,130
She turned down the editor-in-chief himself.

840
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:50,130
You told me without verifying it then?

841
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:51,170
She was here for the shoot.

842
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:54,870
I feel bad, making her feel like shit.

843
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:11,740
♫  When the dark night comes  ♫

844
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:15,070
 For Lee Geunyoung who has hit rock bottom. 

845
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:17,720
Cheers.

846
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,020
Cheers.

847
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:22,830
Cheers.

848
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:27,600
Cheers.

849
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,290
Goodbye.

850
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:36,950
♫  That light will fade  ♫

851
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:44,610
 The door is locked. 

852
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:53,370
What are you doing alone?

853
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:58,920
You don't call or ring the bell anymore.

854
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,650
Well, I guess the shoot is all over.

855
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:04,350
You can do whatever you want as the owner of the house.

856
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:09,390
You're celebrating?

857
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:11,040
I'm saying goodbye to the house.

858
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,100
Goodbye?

859
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:16,100
I told you to stay here.

860
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:18,460
Are those only your opinions?

861
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:20,530
They aren't mine.

862
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:23,400
It's whatever you wish.

863
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:25,770
That wine.

864
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:27,120
You got it from the venue.

865
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:30,170
You got it because of me. Share it.

866
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:33,340
And let's throw you another birthday party.

867
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:36,770
Here.

868
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:39,100
A real birthday gift.

869
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,600
See if they fit.

870
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,620
My birthday.

871
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:49,810
My birthday.

872
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:52,090
Right.

873
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:57,210
I won't ever celebrate my birthday again.

874
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:59,142
Let's forget everything.

875
00:56:59,142 --> 00:57:01,020
Why forget your birthday?

876
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:02,310
Life is hard.

877
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:05,770
It's to compliment yourself for hanging in there.

878
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:07,240
What are you looking at?

879
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,810
See if they fit you well.

880
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,000
Give me your feet.

881
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,270
Why are you doing this to me?

882
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:21,080
You're so prickly right now.

883
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:25,020
Good job holding it back.

884
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:28,970
It could've been your worst moment.

885
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,930
Worst moment?

886
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:33,870
Is that a compliment?

887
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:35,220
Should I like it?

888
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:37,690
Why do you always take things the wrong way?

889
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:39,670
How should I take it?

890
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:42,340
You're always like this.

891
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,846
How can people be like this?

892
00:57:46,846 --> 00:57:50,140
How can nobody put themselves in my shoes?

893
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:51,920
Right now...

894
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:56,220
Have you ever given any thought to how I'm holding back right now?

895
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:58,520
I'm not everyone's toy.

896
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:01,630
They just toy with me, point their fingers at me and swear.

897
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:04,370
But I can't do anything about it.

898
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:08,350
You don't know how it feels to be like chewed gum that has been spat out?

899
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:10,000
Still, I tried to hang on.

900
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,370
I tried to hold on to it till the end.

901
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:16,450
Even when the writer and the producer stab me in the back like that,

902
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:18,420
I tried to understand.

903
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:19,720
And you...

904
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,332
You...

905
00:58:21,332 --> 00:58:23,620
You would be so nice to me at some times,

906
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:25,890
then all of sudden, just like that,

907
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:27,270
you'd ignore me.

908
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:30,100
I still tried to understand.

909
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:34,570
I'm holding it back.

910
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:35,460
How can you?

911
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:39,470
Listen to me before you decide how it all is and get mad!

912
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:41,950
Acting like this, it bothers me.

913
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:45,420
So I said I'd get out so I don't bother you anymore.

914
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:47,730
That will do.

915
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:51,360
I regretted it.

916
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,960
I regretted it, too.

917
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:56,080
Taking you there and being so selfish until now.

918
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:59,970
Even when I couldn't say sorry to you when I knew how much you suffered.

919
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:02,500
So stop doing things your regret and just live your life.

920
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,270
I just need to be gone.

921
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:07,320
I'm moving out because I don't want to regret it either.

922
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,310
Why do you confuse me?

923
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:11,290
Why do you confuse me like this?

924
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:14,060
Just stay where I can see you.

925
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:21,220
I don't know why I care or why you confuse me so much.

926
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:23,560
So let's find out why.

927
00:59:33,171 --> 00:59:34,921
 Do you know? 

928
00:59:35,812 --> 00:59:40,621
 How much I worry about you and how much work you are? 

929
00:59:40,621 --> 00:59:42,471
 Do you know? 

930
00:59:42,471 --> 00:59:46,662
 When you look at me, I'm afraid that I'll fall for you. 

931
00:59:54,390 --> 01:00:00,210
♫  It blows like the wind in my heart  ♫

932
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:07,570
♫  It flows and comes to me like a river  ♫

933
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:17,050
♫  A love that I can't go back and forget  ♫

934
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:23,190
♫  It's blowing, blowing in my chest  ♫

935
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:36,390
♫  It blows... in my heart  ♫

936
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:49,960


937
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:55,090
♫   Where the light shines when I open my eyes   ♫

938
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:59,810
♫   I'll be standing right there   ♫

939
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:03,020
♫   I'm your Pop Star  ♫

940
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:07,720
♫  Oh yeah, eh  ♫

941
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:13,750
♫  Remember, I'm always your one and only one  ♫

942
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:15,696
 You can tell him that we kissed. 

943
01:01:15,696 --> 01:01:17,712
 This happens to be the location. 

944
01:01:17,712 --> 01:01:20,171
 That's why you're "Just Geunyoung." 

945
01:01:20,171 --> 01:01:22,921
 Do you think I'm pathetic, too, just like they do? 

946
01:01:22,921 --> 01:01:24,179
 You found a ring? 

947
01:01:24,179 --> 01:01:25,321
 It's yours? 

948
01:01:25,321 --> 01:01:27,179
 We have to find it first. 

949
01:01:27,179 --> 01:01:30,429
 I thought something's up when you didn't answer. 

950
01:01:30,429 --> 01:01:32,090
 I wasn't worried though. 

951
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:34,220
♫  I want to light up the dark night  ♫

952
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:35,129
 Who are you? 

953
01:01:35,129 --> 01:01:40,210
 Did you also have a first love? 

954
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:41,790
♫  A smile shines on that face again  ♫

955
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:44,570
♫  In the alley, you used to walk alone  ♫

956
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:48,729
