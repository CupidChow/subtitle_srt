00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,680
   

10
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:52,820
   
   

11
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:30,100
 Your call has been forwarded... 

12
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,170
I...

13
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,040
am doing fine.

14
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,960
As always.

15
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,570
Why do I keep crying?

16
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,830
Freaking Lee Geunyoung.

17
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,830
If you're going to be crying like that,

18
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,370
why did you say you could wait for me?

19
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:44,410
â™«  It blows like the wind in my heart  â™«

20
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,750
â™«  It flows and comes to me like a river  â™«

21
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,740
How?

22
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:57,180
â™«  A love that I can't go back and forget  â™«

23
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,070
I thought you were gone. You scared me.

24
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:05,750
â™«  It's blowing, blowing in my chest  â™«

25
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:17,370
â™«  It blows... in my heart  â™«

26
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,630
This is embarrassing.

27
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,976
It's been so long since we saw each other and there I was crying.

28
00:04:23,976 --> 00:04:25,670
I really was doing well.

29
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,170
I didn't cry every day.

30
00:04:36,572 --> 00:04:38,772
Are you okay?

31
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,980
There are so many things that aren't okay.

32
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,710
You didn't miss me?

33
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,479
I really missed you so much.

34
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,460
Every time I missed you, I looked at the stars.

35
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,790
I'd be like, "They're shining fine."

36
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,000
The shining star...

37
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,230
It fell. So now what?

38
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:33,490
Isn't a falling star... a meteor?

39
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,388
You can see regular stars every day.

40
00:05:37,388 --> 00:05:40,170
But lots of people live without ever seeing a meteor.

41
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,250
How long do people wait for the opportunity?

42
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:55,130
Later... people will definitely say...

43
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,120
Hoo Joon, who went through all that,

44
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,900
was more special than just some twinkling star.

45
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,416
You've grown up, Lee Geunyoung.

46
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,767
You know how to console others.

47
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,079
You can stop being a journalist and become a writer.

48
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,970
It's me...

49
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,750
who missed you so much.

50
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,430
While we couldn't see each other, a lot of things happened.

51
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,350
Remember this?

52
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,960
Your father...

53
00:06:49,954 --> 00:06:54,050
The question that burned inside me... I finally found out the meaning of "YAMA,"

54
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,470
â™«  ...when I laid my eyes on you  â™«

55
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,820
Y. A. M. A.

56
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,992
"You are my all."

57
00:07:02,992 --> 00:07:06,240
Then... you found your father?

58
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,800
You met him?

59
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,300
â™«  I promised I'd treat you right, but I didn't know how  â™«

60
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,360
He's somewhere I can't see him ever again.

61
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,570
â™«  Girl, I remember  â™«

62
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,250
Then...

63
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,900
â™«  ...the times that you said you were mine  â™«

64
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,480
I'm okay.

65
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,870
Now I know where he is.

66
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:40,230
â™«  Baby, you~ I'm still with you  â™«

67
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,560
Geunyoung...

68
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,500
â™«  I'm in the cold, girl, I hold you close  â™«

69
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,340
I know it's hard for you but...

70
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,370
â™«  Oh where do we go from now  â™«

71
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,660
â™«  Baby, you~   â™«

72
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,060
right now...

73
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,340
â™«  I'm still with you  â™«

74
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,560
I'll have more hard work to do...

75
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,670
â™«  Tell me when you are on the road, can you stop on the way?  â™«

76
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:09,280
It would be nice if you could wait a little for me.

77
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,380
Then I...

78
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:17,000
will be a thousand times better.

79
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,350
I am sincerely thankful,

80
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,650
sorry and...

81
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,370
I love you so much.

82
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,680
â™«  Baby, you~  â™«

83
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,190
Take out the sorry part.

84
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,380
â™«  I'm in the cold, girl, I hold you close  â™«

85
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,360
â™«  Oh, where do we go from now  â™«

86
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:54,030
â™«  Baby, you~  I'm still with you  â™«

87
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:02,460
â™«  Baby, you~  I still love you  â™«

88
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,340
â™«  With you  â™«

89
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,950
You're awake?

90
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,800
What great weather.

91
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,094
Jaejoon,

92
00:09:44,094 --> 00:09:47,144
shall we go for a walk before breakfast?

93
00:09:47,144 --> 00:09:49,779
Going outside will be much better than staying in here.

94
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:51,470
Huh?

95
00:10:12,522 --> 00:10:15,780
   

96
00:10:34,979 --> 00:10:39,070
   

97
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:42,920
   

98
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,060
   
    

99
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,070
Joon.

100
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,740
You're here?

101
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,790
How about you not go to the preview today?

102
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,970
Appearing in public right now isâ€”

103
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,020
Never mind. Avoiding it won't solve the problem.

104
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,120
Don't worry too much.

105
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,810
Let's go.

106
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:14,200
   
   

107
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,350
 Right now, Who Joon's car has arrived... 

108
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,290
 Who Joon, hey! 

109
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,820
 Who Joon! 

110
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,650
Have you seen the old photos of you circulating all over the internet?  Can you tell us what happened?

111
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:31,020
    
 - Did you really mess with an elderly woman? 
 - There is a photo of you riding the subway for free.  Did you really do it?

112
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,179
He didn't jump over the ticket gate to get a free ride. It was to catch a pickpocket.

113
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:36,770
We've never seen an article like that!

114
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:37,870
Please address them. Just one word.

115
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,310
You can go to the Gangnam police station if you're that curious.

116
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,060
And what seems like he's about to crush an old woman

117
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,460
is Joon stopping his bodyguard from crushing her.

118
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,370
- Let us through. Sorryâ€” 
 - Still. Who Joon!

119
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,150
Please comment.

120
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,100
Who Joon!  Who Joon!  Please answer!

121
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,840
   

122
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,540
 Who Joon!  Who Joon!  Please answer! 

123
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,075
Why get emotional? It's not like you.

124
00:12:01,075 --> 00:12:04,960
Don't try to explain. They don't listen anyways.

125
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,950
It's because they say that stuff without properly investigating.

126
00:12:09,923 --> 00:12:11,940
Still, thank you.

127
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,050
Joon.

128
00:12:20,926 --> 00:12:23,400
How are things now that you've quit?

129
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,470
Joon.

130
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,370
Why did you quit? I still have a lot to learn from you.

131
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,500
It just happened.

132
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,079
Go first with Jihyuk.

133
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,110
Why, bro?

134
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,980
I still have a lot to say.

135
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,979
Joon.

136
00:12:34,979 --> 00:12:36,540
Let's meet up later.

137
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,870
- All right? 
 - Okay.

138
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:41,810
Talk with him.

139
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,470
Yes.

140
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:50,102
Still... it's good that you have Jihyuk.

141
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,090
What?

142
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,979
Is it because I bothered you a little sometimes?

143
00:12:54,979 --> 00:12:58,720
The big star needs a proper goodbye party.

144
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,644
I don't have any complaints.

145
00:13:01,644 --> 00:13:04,480
I knew you were persistent,

146
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,000
but I didn't know you'd struggle so much.

147
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,582
Listen. Becuase I'm okay with everything,

148
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:15,328
just don't be the same with Jihyuk.

149
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,730
You rude little...

150
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,480
   

151
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,580
 There is a photo of you riding the subway for free.  Did you really do it? 

152
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:39,570
 He didn't jump over the ticket gate to get a free ride. It was to catch a pickpocket. 

153
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:43,640
 We've never seen an article like that! Please address them... 

154
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,079
That guy...

155
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:46,330
 She really likes you. 

156
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:51,240
 Going to your concerts with her made me your fan as well. 

157
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,100
   

158
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,820
 Yes, I understand. 

159
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,360
Yes.

160
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:14,520
As soon as talk of postponing the release date came out, the advertisers sued as well.

161
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,570
They're quick.

162
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,580
Let's pay them.

163
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,968
Then what?

164
00:14:21,968 --> 00:14:25,220
You don't know how much you'll have to pay.

165
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,540
I'm looking for a competent lawyer.

166
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,479
Don't worry too much.

167
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,070
Joon,

168
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,420
it must be crazy out in front of the hospital, too.

169
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,540
Let's stay home today.

170
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:18,540
â™«  I see the starlight  â™«

171
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,970
â™«  Beautiful starlight  â™«

172
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,310
Ms. Lee Geunyoung.

173
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:04,470
In this industry, there are a lot of stories about you.

174
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,620
I guess I am famous.

175
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:13,750
And I don't want that anymore. I want to become famous for my writing.

176
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:21,820
Would your friendship with Who Joon be an advantage or disadvantage to your work?

177
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,290
Sorry?

178
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:33,822
If it becomes a disadvantage, that's just something I'll have to bear.

179
00:16:33,822 --> 00:16:38,679
But... it won't be an advantage.

180
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:44,779
As a journalist, I won't let my friendship with Who Joon benefit me.

181
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:46,832
I'd also like you to...

182
00:16:46,832 --> 00:16:52,420
evaluate me only based on my writing and experience.

183
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,120
I told you, let's wait longer.

184
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,370
Jihyang.

185
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,120
This is most important to me.

186
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,140
Drop me off here.

187
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,210
I'm back.

188
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,210
Have you eaten?

189
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,330
I'm having such a long day.

190
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,010
You haven't had water, right?

191
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,060
I think you need a new dressing.

192
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,579
Let me tell the nurse.

193
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,340
Yes.

194
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,160
You're doing well?

195
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,079
You're being sued.

196
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:33,235
You should've told me about it.

197
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,460
It's okay.

198
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,790
I can resolve it.

199
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:41,886
Your father and I were too close for me to do nothing.

200
00:18:41,886 --> 00:18:43,710
 It doesn't matter when. 

201
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,350
 Come by. 

202
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,070
Yes.

203
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,060
Thank you.

204
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,040
Honestly, we don't really know anything about lawsuits.

205
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,170
And this is a first.

206
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,250
Well, it's a breach of contract.

207
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,320
So you'll have to pay the penalty.

208
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,670
I'll try to minimize the amount.

209
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:13,792
Rather than reducing the amount... help me to repay those who were hurt by my actions.

210
00:19:15,867 --> 00:19:19,547
This guy here is unyielding, isn't he?

211
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,618
Okay.

212
00:19:22,618 --> 00:19:25,979
I'll try to do what you're asking.

213
00:19:25,979 --> 00:19:28,030
Thank you.

214
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,779
I don't know how you'll take this,

215
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:36,170
but your father and you are very similar.

216
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,820
Sir.

217
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:49,765
The investors are saying they're canceling...

218
00:19:49,765 --> 00:19:51,720
their contributions to the brand launch budget.

219
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,060
All of sudden? Why?

220
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,220
That's because...

221
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,270
it was for Hoo Joon and the conditions have changed.

222
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:04,970
At this pace, we can't avoid bankruptcy, sir.

223
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,320
You can go.

224
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:07,360
â™«  I see the starlight  â™«

225
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,820
â™«  Beautiful starlight  â™«

226
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,990
â™«  Starlight  â™«

227
00:21:24,962 --> 00:21:26,370
Congratulations on getting hired!

228
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,120
Cheers.

229
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,420
But I mean, a congratulations party?

230
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,420
You really closed the restaurant for me?

231
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,750
You're so naive.

232
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,179
I'm not the boss.

233
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:37,750
The restaurant is closed today.

234
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:41,000
Wow, so the part-time worker opened the restaurant just for me?

235
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,970
Because you never show up.

236
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:44,979
I mean...

237
00:21:44,979 --> 00:21:47,690
Lately, your boyfriend isâ€”

238
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,260
What the...

239
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:57,200
You knew?

240
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,240
What?

241
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,770
You think I don't know you?

242
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm sorry for not telling you.

243
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,320
Why be sorry?

244
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,040
Hoo Joon's not just some normal guy.

245
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:19,580
Speaking of which, quit now if it's hard for you.

246
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,530
Let's be honest, he's not the only guy in the world.

247
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:24,770
Shin Mijeong, you still can't get over him?

248
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,920
You're here.

249
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,020
Hey.

250
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,250
Like you said, there are lots of guys in the world.

251
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,250
- Get over that broken heart of yours. 
 - Be quiet.

252
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,140
Let's just drink.

253
00:22:40,712 --> 00:22:42,750
Everything's gone crazy after that press conference.

254
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,170
Is Big Brother Joon okay?

255
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,870
Is "big brother" the right word?

256
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:50,200
He faked his age...

257
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,250
Well, yeah...

258
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:57,100
Still... wouldn't it change things if your piece gets published?

259
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,500
Geunyoung's piece?

260
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:04,230
Geunyoung contributed a beautiful piece defending Hoo Joon.

261
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:07,200
Love sure isâ€”

262
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,790
Loyalty is important.

263
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,520
Right.

264
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,330
Loyalty is important!

265
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:13,120
Geunyoung is loyal.

266
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,920
Hey.

267
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,763
Just now... did I just hear you say "love?"

268
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:26,800
By any chance, Geunyoung and... Hoo Joon?

269
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,140
Are you serious?

270
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,610
He really is my big brother now.

271
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,370
Soohwan, I'm sorry for not telling you either.

272
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:49,970
About that piece though... do you think it would really help?

273
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,680
 If you don't pay within the payment period, you'll be arrested. 

274
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,520
 Okay? 

275
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,360
Jaejoon.

276
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:26,530
These are your things.

277
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:30,779
And Jaejoon...

278
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:34,180
I'll be going somewhere for a little while.

279
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:40,730
I'll try to do things right again.

280
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:46,130
By the time I come back, you'll be okay, too.

281
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:50,796
Then let's drink soju.

282
00:24:59,979 --> 00:25:01,460
You'll be okay.

283
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,070
Okay?

284
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:15,620
Yes.

285
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,460
 Hey. 

286
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,310
Consultations with the victims went well.

287
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,470
Thank you.

288
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:23,060
You've worked hard.

289
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,430
By the way...

290
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:28,588
Will you really... sell your house as well?

291
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,570
Yes.

292
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:35,560
I'll get rid of everything and start over.

293
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,710
 And by the way, 

294
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:49,630
 Did you say that your previous company was a Shooting Star? 

295
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:52,660
 I heard that the company is on the verge of being sold. 

296
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:57,830
 I was just wondering if you still were involved somehow. 

297
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,600
   
   

298
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,779
 Wow. 5,000 won? (5 pieces for 5,000 won) 

299
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,670
 Oh, hello, sir. 

300
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:20,430
 - Practice go well? 
 - Yes. 

301
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:24,567
 Ah, I've got some fried chicken here. Go to the practice room and have some. 

302
00:26:24,567 --> 00:26:26,570
 - Thank you. 
 - Sure. 

303
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:28,520
 Yes. 

304
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,000
 - Daddy. Chicken! 
 - What about our chicken? 

305
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,130
 Daddy completely forgot.  What should I do? 

306
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:34,979
 I'm sorry. 

307
00:26:34,979 --> 00:26:37,560
 - Chicken, daddy? 
 - Hurry and come... 

308
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,080
 - I'm really okay. 
 - Never mind. 

309
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,290
 Daddy will be there soon! 

310
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,350
 Joon. 

311
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:58,880
 Now... this is our company. 

312
00:27:00,816 --> 00:27:02,330
 The whole first floor? 

313
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:04,100
 The whole building. 

314
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,820
 What? 

315
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,180
 You're lying. 

316
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,320
 For real! 

317
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,020
 Really? 

318
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,670
 Wow. Awesome. 

319
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:16,740
 This isn't mine. It's ours. 

320
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,000
 We did this all together. 

321
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,000
 Wow. It's so big. 

322
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,400
 - Then will you build me something here, too? 
 - Of course, I will! 

323
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,960
 There's even an elevator. 

324
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,830
 â™« Where there are no stars â™« 

325
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,580
 â™« All the way in the sky â™« 

326
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:03,846
 â™« This song I've always sang alone â™« 

327
00:28:03,846 --> 00:28:08,430
 â™« I hope that someday someone will listen â™« 

328
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,040
 â™« A song I sang all night â™« 

329
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,860
 â™« Listen â™« 

330
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:20,490
 â™« When I open my eyes, where the light shines there â™« 

331
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:24,510
 â™« That's where I'll be standing â™« 

332
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,000
To get here...

333
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,579
I gave up so many things.

334
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:41,420
I didn't think I'd have to give this up one day...

335
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,570
What's wrong now?

336
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:53,758
 Sir, 

337
00:28:53,758 --> 00:28:58,030
 all the debt has been paid off. 

338
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,980
What?

339
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,410
Geunyoung.

340
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,900
There's somewhere I have to go.

341
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,820
 I wanted to see you before, 

342
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,300
but if I do I'm worried I won't be able to go.

343
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,390
 To you... 

344
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,460
and everyone else...

345
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,310
I'll come back when I'm an honorable man.

346
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,670
I won't make you wait for long.

347
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:57,770
I'll always text you, too.

348
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,560
 Okay? 

349
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,830
I'm okay.

350
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:09,450
Take... care.

351
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,080
Okay.

352
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,720
Why did you pay it off?

353
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,080
It wasn't just a penny or two.

354
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:45,970
That company... like you said, "It's not yours, it's ours."

355
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:51,280
All my life's memories are there.

356
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,720
I have to protect it.

357
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,900
So get it together.

358
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,230
And make a comeback.

359
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,270
I'll pay you back.

360
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,920
I didn't say you didn't have to.

361
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,000
Make sure you pay it back.

362
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:44,680
â™«  I just laugh but you don't even notice  â™«

363
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:52,120
â™«  Is this the person you broke up with yesterday?  â™«

364
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:59,500
â™«  I just thought if I spent all that time  â™«

365
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:05,070
â™«  Everything would be forgotten  â™«

366
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:14,108
â™«  When I close my eyes and think of you  â™«

367
00:32:14,108 --> 00:32:22,750
â™«  I feel like I'm coming back to you any minute  â™«

368
00:32:24,096 --> 00:32:30,140
â™«  It blows like the wind in my heart  â™«

369
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,660
 Now... 

370
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,410
 I know a little. 

371
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,290
 It's time now that I... 

372
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:46,920
 go back to where I came from. 

373
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,360
 So that I can come back honorably 

374
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,690
 to the world... 

375
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,920
 and to the people I cherish. 

376
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:12,640
 I didn't ask him where he'd go, 

377
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,890
 but I could tell. 

378
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,060
 Just like that, 

379
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,602
 Hoo Joon left. 

380
00:33:19,602 --> 00:33:21,320
Geunyoung, the chief is looking for you.

381
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,180
Okay.

382
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,820
   

383
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,720
Jaejoon.

384
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,160
How are you feeling?

385
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,900
You're here.

386
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,779
Inhyung.

387
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,270
He...

388
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:22,020
must not know what he wants to say yet.

389
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:39,620
It's aphasia.

390
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:46,040
I thought I'd leave this world...

391
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:50,040
and he'd regret what he'd done.

392
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,160
I'm the one regretting...

393
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:57,090
and it's as if he's left the world.

394
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:02,352
You suffered a lot because of Jaejoon, as well.

395
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:05,779
Are you okay now?

396
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:12,240
I thought I was determined...

397
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,200
I don't know why I feel sorry.

398
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:22,250
I wanted to be a celebrity.

399
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,600
Someone whom everyone loves.

400
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,990
But now that I think about it,

401
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:32,045
I didn't know how...

402
00:35:32,045 --> 00:35:34,300
to love or be loved.

403
00:35:34,877 --> 00:35:38,890
I think I just dreamed of people's love.

404
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,670
I don't know about other people.

405
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,375
But people you know,

406
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:48,850
the people around you...

407
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:52,470
they really loved and cherished you.

408
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:55,579
Jaejoon... and Hoo Joon.

409
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:02,420
But I was always anxious.

410
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:08,710
Maybe the fact that Joon felt sorry for me, never threw me out...

411
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:12,050
was consoling.

412
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:20,680
It's a good thing that at least Joon found where he belongs now.

413
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:24,420
Then you're not anxious anymore?

414
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:35,700
Now I feel fortunate to be able to help him and be by his side,

415
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,440
Because if I had left...

416
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:43,640
Jaejoon really would've been alone.

417
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:49,010
I know too well how it feels to be alone in the world.

418
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,580
I can't leave him.

419
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:06,670
You know I'm really happy to see you again?

420
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,470
Me too.

421
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,850
        
 - As Hoo Joon said at the press conference,

422
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:42,960
it's an irrefutable fact that he lied.

423
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:47,410
Geunyoung, this will be enough.

424
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:49,540
Oh, really?

425
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,730
Take good care of it, please.

426
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:55,830
But, Geunyoung, you must've had a lot of people ask you for an interview.

427
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:58,910
Thank you for choosing me.

428
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,810
You're Hoo Joon's dedicated journalist.

429
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,790
It's to clear the air about Hoo Joon.

430
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:07,180
I thought I had left a bad impression. I guess not?

431
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:11,980
I mean, you're acknowledging that I'm a journalist kind to Hoo Joon.

432
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,879
It'd be so nice if you didn't talk like that in that tone.

433
00:38:14,879 --> 00:38:17,040
Huh? What?

434
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,128
Mr. Heo.

435
00:38:19,128 --> 00:38:20,614
There's...

436
00:38:20,614 --> 00:38:23,420
someone else who could help.

437
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:27,138
Those old pictures of Hoo Joon going around...

438
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,220
they're definitely not true.

439
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,360
Hoo Joon's not that kind of person.

440
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,906
Even when I kidnapped him,

441
00:38:34,906 --> 00:38:37,630
he helped me with my proposal...

442
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:40,679
and cheered me on.

443
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,720
Beer is the best way to end the day.

444
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,930
What are you going to now Ms. Noh?

445
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:01,845
What do you mean? I should find work.

446
00:39:01,845 --> 00:39:05,279
We've met after 10 years. Where are you going off to now?

447
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:07,330
That's the industry we work in.

448
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:08,310
You didn't know?

449
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:09,979
So you'll still be in my hands, then.

450
00:39:09,979 --> 00:39:12,320
I don't know, they're not very big.

451
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:21,670
Hey...

452
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:30,310
What?

453
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:39,070
I have an amazing program pitch.

454
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,890
Do you wanna work on it with me?

455
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:44,164
I thought you were going to...

456
00:39:44,164 --> 00:39:46,650
Sure, sure.

457
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:50,310
You work surprisingly hard all of a sudden.

458
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:52,970
Since when...?

459
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:55,300
Give it to me.

460
00:39:58,238 --> 00:40:01,060
Um... Read it with an open mind.

461
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,100
Okay?

462
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,600
Read slowly and thoroughly.

463
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,150
Okay?

464
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:08,560
I won't do it if it's crap.

465
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,370
It's not crap.

466
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,440
Again...

467
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,080
"So I Got Married?"

468
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,940
Right.

469
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,960
   
   

470
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:25,920
   

471
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:32,770
   

472
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:39,420
   
   

473
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:44,710
   

474
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,630
How is it?

475
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:52,350
It'll be a hit, no?

476
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,310
You have amazing instincts.

477
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:57,900
Noh Doyoon,

478
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,470
will you...

479
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:04,560
work on this with me forever?

480
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,070
Childish! It's so childish!

481
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,110
It's so childish.

482
00:41:16,278 --> 00:41:19,620
Oh. You laughed!

483
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,540
So you're doing it.

484
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,000
I don't know.

485
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:41,700
   

486
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,030
â™«  I wonder what is love  â™«

487
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:05,530
â™«  I want to know what is love  â™«

488
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:09,470
â™«  Your lovely look  â™«

489
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:13,770
â™«  What is this taste?  â™«

490
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:17,890
â™«  I wonder what is love  â™«

491
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:22,700
â™«  There is no answer, it's just a question  â™«

492
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:30,530
â™«  Are you falling in love too?  â™«

493
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:34,979
â™«  Love, I've been looking the whole time  â™«

494
00:42:34,979 --> 00:42:39,100
â™«  Then you appear out of nowhere  â™«

495
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:43,370
â™«  Love, keeps getting bigger and bigger  â™«

496
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:47,840
 â™« I can't hide it anymore â™« 

497
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,630
â™«  When I think of you once in a while  â™«

498
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:56,470
â™«  I wonder if this is what love is  â™«

499
00:42:56,470 --> 00:43:00,430
â™«  I think I like you  â™«

500
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:02,330
â™«  I do  â™«

501
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,870
â™«  Yeah, I do  â™«

502
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,320
   

503
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,630
   

504
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:33,030
   

505
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:36,100
Yes.

506
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:44,600
You think you're the only guy... in the world?

507
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:49,360
So annoying.

508
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,380
We're not open today.

509
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:13,479
Honey... I've been doing a lot of self-reflection.

510
00:44:13,479 --> 00:44:15,779
About what?

511
00:44:15,779 --> 00:44:18,470
You leaving without saying anything?

512
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:21,080
With just a text?

513
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:24,650
It's not just one or two things to reflect on.

514
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,200
Never mind.

515
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,320
Just go back.

516
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,810
Let go.

517
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,079
I wanted to come back after I made it big.

518
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,130
I really did.

519
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,679
But I just couldn't do it without you.

520
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:51,464
If you tell me to study law again,

521
00:44:51,464 --> 00:44:53,420
I will.

522
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:59,120
Really?

523
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,679
I mean...

524
00:45:00,679 --> 00:45:02,140
Looking at the situation now,

525
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:06,790
Hoo Joon does need a competent lawyer like me.

526
00:45:08,381 --> 00:45:09,740
Don't!

527
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,560
Just don't do it.

528
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,980
Okay! Okay!

529
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:15,320
- Come here, you jerk! 
 - Okay!

530
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:21,550
I enjoyed reading your piece.

531
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:23,650
The Who Joon User Manual?

532
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:24,979
Oh.

533
00:45:24,979 --> 00:45:25,690
Yes.

534
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:29,420
You worked harder on that than on your work here.

535
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:31,770
No, I didn't.

536
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,382
Geunyoung,

537
00:45:33,382 --> 00:45:38,930
what do you think about becoming a writer, instead of a journalist?

538
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:45,779
 You can stop being a journalist and become a writer. 

539
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:55,040
   

540
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,960
   

541
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:07,700
Eat a lot.

542
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:14,290
Soohwan.

543
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:14,979
You're here.

544
00:46:14,979 --> 00:46:16,980
Hey. It's so nice.

545
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,170
Must've been expensive.

546
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:20,560
That's why older folks always say to learn technical skills.

547
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,430
I'm jealous.

548
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:22,970
Congratulations.

549
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:24,320
You wanted your studio so bad.

550
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,480
It's a good thing you got fired.

551
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,670
After having been with so many women...

552
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:30,940
now he's taking wedding photos.

553
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:35,960
Hey. I've been in many relationships so I know how people in relationships feel.

554
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,779
So it was for the big picture that he dated all those women.

555
00:46:39,779 --> 00:46:41,100
Be careful.

556
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:44,080
You might have to take wedding photos for your exes.

557
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,020
So when are you guys getting married?

558
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,810
Sorry, Mijeong.

559
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:52,080
You don't have to be.

560
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:55,560
What?

561
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,900
Have you been well?

562
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,370
Um...

563
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:02,210
She was too embarrassed to tell you after you got fired and all... It was frustrating.

564
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:04,690
Sorry.

565
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:06,570
So you guys are dating again?

566
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:08,290
You're back to studying law?

567
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:10,779
What? Study law?

568
00:47:10,779 --> 00:47:14,420
My Shinhyuk here is the Who Joon of live streaming.

569
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:15,960
I'm going to do it with him.

570
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,670
This gift is for you.

571
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:18,790
Should I put it there?

572
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:20,270
- Yes. 
 - Okay.

573
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,940
We'll take a look around.

574
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:25,670
What the heck?

575
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:29,100
She acted as if she was going to kill him when he came back.

576
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:32,270
All those times she called us when drunk.

577
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:33,974
Gosh, that girl.

578
00:47:33,974 --> 00:47:36,220
So when are you going to get married?

579
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,310
What are you saying?

580
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:08,000
Jihyang isn't here yet?

581
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,400
I don't think he is, no.

582
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:16,890
Today is the time of celebration for this beautiful couple who is starting anew today.

583
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:20,790
We have a special event prepared for our bride...

584
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:22,190
You guys are all curious right?

585
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:24,020
Applause!

586
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,500
This is Joon's song.

587
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:40,700
â™«  If I just look at you, I turn around and regret  â™«

588
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:44,420
â™«  What would it have been like?  â™«

589
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:53,700
â™«  Will I be in a different world from someone other than you?  â™«

590
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:57,820
â™«  I can't even imagine  â™«

591
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:02,060
â™«  Someone else by my side  â™«

592
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:06,870
â™«  When it rains, it becomes your umbrella  â™«

593
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:11,040
â™«  And the shade on a hot day  â™«

594
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:16,950
â™«  Footsteps walking side by side with you  â™«

595
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:21,340
â™«  There's nothing better than this  â™«

596
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:24,420
â™«  My heart that I couldn't tell you  â™«

597
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:28,770
Everyone, please look at me with jealousy.

598
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:30,310
Kiss.

599
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:31,930
Kiss!

600
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:34,820
Kiss!

601
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:37,060
Kiss!

602
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:44,620
Who's catching the bouquet?

603
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,884
Geunyoung!

604
00:49:48,884 --> 00:49:51,170
Me? I cant!

605
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:53,200
No, no, no!

606
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,580
Have you been waiting for me?

607
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:31,600
How'd you come here?

608
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,820
A surprise.

609
00:50:39,979 --> 00:50:42,770
I caught the bouquet.

610
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:04,000
 This next song has become a hot issue online recently. 

611
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,360
 It's the first song that Who Joon, the big K-Pop star, produced. 

612
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,979
 It's getting a lot of attention. 

613
00:51:09,979 --> 00:51:11,620
 Take a listen. 

614
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:15,360
â™«  The lights are turning off, the streets are falling asleep  â™«

615
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:20,930
â™«  On this quiet night, what am I dreaming of?  â™«

616
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:26,460
â™«  Sometimes I get afraid but I laugh it off  â™«

617
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:29,780
â™«  Even if this is the end...  â™«

618
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:35,380
â™«  Even in a place without any stars  â™«

619
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,480
 Fish cake! 

620
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,879
 Thank you! 

621
00:51:40,879 --> 00:51:42,810
 Fish cake! 

622
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:44,700
â™«  It'll be dangerous  â™«

623
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,720
 You eat it. 

624
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,470
 No. 

625
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:51,730
 You eat it. 

626
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:54,160
 I like the soup. 

627
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,530
â™«  I see the starlight  â™«

628
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:59,750
 You don't know the true taste of soju yet. 

629
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:04,110
 Then you should teach me. 

630
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:04,830
 Oh yeah? 

631
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:09,120
â™«  You're the one who shines on me in this darkness  â™«

632
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,479
 What the heck? 

633
00:52:15,479 --> 00:52:17,428
 There are three people here. 

634
00:52:17,428 --> 00:52:19,220
 And you only ordered enough for two. 

635
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,050
 Whoa! 

636
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,200
 Boss! 

637
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,490
 You should eat well. 

638
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:30,500
â™«  I will sing it so it will pass over everyone else 
 so no one else can see  â™«

639
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:35,930
â™«  So you can only hear, Starlight  â™«

640
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,110
â™«  Even in a place without any stars  â™«

641
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:40,820
Joon?

642
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,579
Jaejoon...

643
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,660
â™«  It will be dangerous...  â™«

644
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:54,470
This song...

645
00:52:54,500 --> 00:53:00,700
â™«  But I'm following the star that will make it rise up again  â™«

646
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,820
Joon made it.

647
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:05,700
â™«  I see the starlight  â™«

648
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:10,800
â™«  Beautiful starlight  â™«

649
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:15,500
â™«  You're the one who shines on me in this darkness  â™«

650
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,490
Thank God.

651
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:21,660
â™«  Oh, that I know  â™«

652
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:24,840
Thank you, Jaejoon.

653
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:27,970
â™«  Beautiful starlight  â™«

654
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:54,220
 - Who Joon show us some love! 
  - Thank you! 

655
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:57,160
 Who Joon, please look this way! 

656
00:54:16,396 --> 00:54:17,515
I don't have any makeup on.

657
00:54:17,515 --> 00:54:18,620
You're prettier like this.

658
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:20,772
Just kidding.

659
00:54:20,772 --> 00:54:22,028
Where are we going?

660
00:54:22,028 --> 00:54:26,280
- Should we just stay home? 
 - No way, the house is a mess.

661
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,890
 How about going to the Han River? 

662
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:29,680
 Sure. 

663
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:37,430
 â™« What star are you from? â™« 

664
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:40,330
 â™« Did you open my heart? â™« 

665
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:44,620
 â™« How did you get into my heart? â™« 

666
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:48,510
 â™« Shall I take a step closer? â™« 

667
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:51,140
 â™« Shall I be brave? â™« 

668
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:55,479
 â™« I around you again today â™« 

669
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:02,690
 â™« The face that looks like you don't care â™« 

670
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:06,730
 â™« I'm excited as if I'm going to take care of it â™« 

671
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:12,970
 â™« At some point, you are strangely attracted to my heart â™« 

672
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:17,540
 â™« Now I'm falling more and more â™« 

673
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:30,010
Yes.

674
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:32,460
How can you not even call when your boyfriend is going away for work?

675
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:35,540
 I'm sorry. I didn't realize what time it was. 

676
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,670
 Are you at the airport? 

677
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:38,770
Excuse me, Ms. Journalist.

678
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:40,694
I mean, Ms. Writer.

679
00:55:40,694 --> 00:55:44,390
Are you not caring about me now that you're not a journalist?

680
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:46,488
You got me.

681
00:55:46,488 --> 00:55:48,210
You're coming back tomorrow, right?

682
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:50,370
You know it's my birthday tomorrow, right?

683
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:51,830
 0. 2. 2. 7. 

684
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:55,742
 How can I forget? It was the passcode for the penthouse. 

685
00:55:55,742 --> 00:55:58,560
I don't want to spend it all lonely like last year.

686
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,870
 Everything is different this year. 

687
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:03,430
 Have a safe trip. 

688
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:38,940
Yes.

689
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:43,460
 Ms. Lee, I'm sorry but your piece has some similarities with last month's. 

690
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:45,210
 I'm sorry we didn't check it sooner. 

691
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:48,980
 Can you have it revised sometime today? 

692
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,930
Right now?

693
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:12,960
 My flight's been delayed. 

694
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,400
 I can't go today. 

695
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,070
 What should I do? 

696
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:18,390
I guess it's for the best.

697
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,820
Yes.

698
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:31,980
I just emailed the final draft.

699
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:35,946
 We also want to talk about next year's plan. 

700
00:57:35,946 --> 00:57:37,400
 Do you have time today? 

701
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,540
Today?

702
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:39,620
 We're sorry. 

703
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:42,780
 We want to get started on it right away. 

704
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:45,460
Yes. It's fine.

705
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:47,960
Where should I go?

706
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:53,800
   

707
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:57,620
   

708
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:24,970
Yes.

709
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:26,570
 Is this Oh Inhyung? 

710
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:27,840
Yes.

711
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,858
 This is Garden Record. 

712
00:58:29,858 --> 00:58:32,930
 We'd like to offer you an album deal. 

713
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:43,060
Thanks for your proposal, but I have no intention to sing yet.

714
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:46,390
Thank you for reaching out to me.

715
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:49,120
Yes.

716
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:59,030
You okay?

717
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:08,490
You always wanted to sing.

718
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:19,020
My song...

719
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:25,320
should be written by you.

720
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,010
Ah, yes.

721
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:41,650
I just got here. Where are you?

722
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:46,040
Oh. Okay.

723
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:49,330
Can you take a picture for us?

724
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:50,279
Yes.

725
00:59:50,279 --> 00:59:51,330
Thank you.

726
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:52,970
Everyone, together!

727
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:56,940
I'm taking the picture!

728
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,190
One, two, three!

729
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:04,610
   

730
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,114
Hurry up and take it.

731
01:00:11,114 --> 01:00:13,810
One, two, three!

732
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:21,650
â™«  When it rains, it becomes your umbrella  â™«

733
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:25,830
â™«  And the shade on a hot day  â™«

734
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:31,710
â™«  Footsteps walking side by side with you  â™«

735

â™«  There's nothing better than this  â™«

â™«  My heart that I couldn't tell you  â™«

 â™« Now everyone knows â™« 

738
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:47,260
 â™« I love you â™« 

739
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:53,300
â™«  I hope when you reach the end of the world, 
 that my love is only you  â™«

740
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:56,660
What is this?

741
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:59,780
 â™« I hold your hand casually â™« 

742
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:02,420
You're not going to answer me?

743
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:06,310
â™«  ...and making eye contact like a habit  â™«

744
01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:12,290
â™«  All of my dreams come true, I want to draw everything  â™«

745
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:16,620
â™«  I imagine with you  â™«

746
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:19,560
You're crazy. There are so many people.

747
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:23,990
I'm very serious right now.

748
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:27,840
â™«  You who became another me  â™«

749
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:34,060
â™«  I can't even imagine, no one other than you  â™«

750
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:36,622
It's not "YAMA."

751
01:01:36,622 --> 01:01:38,270
It's "you are my all."

752
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:40,790
You know that, right?

753
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:44,740
 â™« And the shade on a hot day â™« 

754

 â™« Footsteps walking side by side with you â™« 

755
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:51,000
This isn't one of those hidden cameras, right?

756
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,670
â™«  There's nothing better than this  â™«

757
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:55,380
You want me to prove it to you?

758
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:59,920
â™«  My heart that I couldn't tell you  â™«

759
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:04,150
â™«  Now everybody knows  â™«

760

â™«  I hope you reach the end of the world   â™«

761

â™«  My love, you are the only one for me  â™«

762
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:21,650
â™«  I hold your hand casually  â™«
