00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,720

â™«  I wonder what is love  â™«

00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,370
â™«  I want to know what is love  â™«

10
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,570
Cheers to the first night in the house.

11
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,970
It's good.

12
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,420
What? What? What?

13
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,530
 Door's open. 

14
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,100
 Door's closed.

 Timing and Subtitles by the ðŸ¥€Hatefully Yours ðŸ™ƒ @Viki.com 

16
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,270
What are you doing here?

17
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,880
And you?

18
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,690
I was just... stopping by.

19
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,080
I just... stopped by, too.

20
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,040
How did you get in?

21
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,930
I got the password earlier.

22
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,580
Oh, the password.

23
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,960
You could've just passed by. Why come in?

24
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,140
I was passing by and...

25
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,570
passing by...

26
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,750
and they had this.

27
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,100
I wanted to eat it.

28
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,640
Have you had dinner?

29
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,570
Aren't you hungry?

30
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,890
You just stopped by as well.

31
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,600
How about some soju?

32
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,060
Do you want a shot?

33
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,870
Do you want some snacks?

34
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,840
Nope.

35
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,100
Have some soju at least.

36
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:41,630
What brings you here at this hour?

37
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,500
Do I have to tell you?

38
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,710
No.

39
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:49,540
This is so unfair.

40
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,040
I have to tell you, but you don't?

41
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,250
By the way...

42
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,590
What's up with the luggage?

43
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,130
What?

44
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,750
You traveled to get tteokbokki?

45
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,570
Excuse me.

46
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:12,520
Get out if you're not going to talk.

47
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,110
All right.

48
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,040
I happened to have been here for a while.

49
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,890
And it's been less than an hour.

50
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,270
I wasn't planning on this.

51
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,680
It just happened.

52
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,370
No one lives here anyways.

53
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,710
It should stay like that.

54
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,540
I have my reasons.

55
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,170
I know you don't know how to listen.

56
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,440
You're saying you're staying here or something?

57
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,070
I never said that.

58
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,120
I'm only staying here for a bit.

59
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,870
And you played a part in me having no place to stay...

60
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,210
Not a part.

61
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,600
You are the whole reason.

62
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,780
- So? 
 - So.

63
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,010
So... you can't stop me.

64
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,490
This is the least you can do.

65
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,040
Excuse me.

66
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,670
This isn't how you ask for favors.

67
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,470
It's not your house. Don't be so picky about it.

68
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,470
Anyways, it's a no.

69
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,670
I said no!

70
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,330
And this is my house.

71
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,970
I know it isn't.

72
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,980
What happened last night?

73
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,350
What the heck!

74
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,570
Calm down.

75
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,390
Hey.

76
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,720
Hey, wake up!

77
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,120
What?

78
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,500
You scared me.

79
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,260
You slept here?

80
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,620
Why would you sleep here?

81
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,170
Huh?

82
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,760
You told me to.

83
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,230
When did I tell you that?

84
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,680
You don't remember?

85
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,530
 Okay, I'm leaving. 

86
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:50,560
 You think I don't have a place to go? 

87
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,130
 So many people want me. 

88
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,900
 Just... 

89
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,120
 Just stay. 

90
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,230
You told me to just stay.

91
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,420
Wait a second.

92
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,000
How much did you make me drink?

93
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,760
Who does that nowadays?

94
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,020
Are you pretending that you don't remember?

95
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,270
You told me to stay.

96
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:34,020
I happen to have no place to go.

97
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,800
I'm staying here for a while.

98
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:41,810
So please don't just stop by.

99
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,330
You can leave now.

100
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,570
Let me sleep more.

101
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,390
Hey.

102
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,820
Hey, wake up.

103
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,470
What now?

104
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,370
Okay now. I get everything.

105
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:15,770
Don't let anyone know you're staying here.

106
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:20,110
Do you think I want to?

107
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,070
You really... messed up the place.

108
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,470
Why did this happen to me?

109
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,160
My star. How was the workout?

110
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,000
You look too comfortable.

111
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,080
Should I wear a suit?

112
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,140
Looks like something's happening.

113
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,430
Hold on.

114
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,620
Hello.

115
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:35,577
The first solution of "Get It Diet" is boxing.

116
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,860
It's an informative show.

117
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,370
She introduces boxing as a way to lose weight.

118
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:47,850
 Take some rest before we resume. 

119
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,870
Okay.

120
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,100
Joon,

121
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,670
let's not run into her.

122
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,400
Let's go.

123
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,860
Joon.

124
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,680
Excuse me.

125
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,480
Yes?

126
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,840
Where's Oh Inhyung?

127
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,000
We're on break. I think she's in the restroom.

128
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,070
What are you doing here?

129
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,210
I'm waiting for the shoot to restart.

130
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:15,120
You're here alone?

131
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,810
It's important for the company.

132
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:18,531
The staffâ€”

133
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:22,110
But you didn't split the staff?

134
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,870
Into who's important and who's not?

135
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,630
It's none of your business.

136
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,730
We don't need to care about each other.

137
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:42,070
Just because no one's here, doesn't mean you're no one.

138
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,210
Hello.

139
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,440
These are solutions recommended by "Get It Diet." We strive to keep you healthy.

140
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,570
Our first solution is boxing.

141
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:08,590
Boxing is a workout that burns the most calories in a short amount of time.

142
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:15,290
Shall we meet the professional who will teach us simple boxing moves you can do at home?

143
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,970
 Let's stop here. 

144
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:20,970
Good job, everyone!

145
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,070
JJ, when did you come?

146
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,580
You're here alone?

147
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,700
Without any staff?

148
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,770
Yes.

149
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,860
This was scheduled last minute.

150
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,770
My manager's coming to pick me up later.

151
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,480
Is an unexpected shoot not a shoot?

152
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,560
Huh?

153
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,970
Who made the decision without me?

154
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,250
See you in the next meeting.

155
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,070
You're doing that on purpose.

156
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,430
I'm fine. Let's go.

157
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,400
Get dressed.

158
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,800
Let's go.

159
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,250
What are they saying?

160
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:33,490
Can you guys handle his true self?

161
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,460
   

162
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,770
A crazy cat?

163
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,270
   

164
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,830
An evil duck?

165
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,470
Me? That's me?

166
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,290
That's so mean.

167
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:52,600
I never thought people would call me a crazy cat and an evil duck.

168
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,480
Yes, Mr. Han.

169
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,580
 Geunyoung. 

170
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,070
We're drinking before the shoot begins.

171
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,470
 How about dinner tomorrow? 

172
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,340
Who's buying?

173
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,710
I thought you were parking.

174
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,150
Where have you been?

175
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,520
I bought this.

176
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,190
Is it for me?

177
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,460
Today's not even our anniversary. What the heck!

178
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,920
The hoodie was too big on you earlier.

179
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:28,840
Artists in my company should wear clothes that suit them.

180
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,420
When did you buy it?

181
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,590
I don't even remember.

182
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:37,470
You don't even remember?

183
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,370
No.

184
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,370
It's been so long.

185
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:46,110
 Just because no one's here, doesn't mean you're no one. 

186
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,890
Let's throw it away then.

187
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,010
Where is it?

188
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:06,120
I'll throw it away on the way out.

189
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,040
What is it?

190
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,570
Why?

191
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,190
My father told me this.

192
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:20,940
You have to know what to get rid of if you want to be successful.

193
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,970
I thought you wanted success.

194
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,823
Then you have to get rid of...

195
00:16:27,823 --> 00:16:28,890
clothes that don't suit you.

196
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,080
Okay?

197
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,620
Don't be sarcastic.

198
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,340
What's bothering you now?

199
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:43,180
If you didn't lie to me in the first place, I'd never do this.

200
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,090
Okay?

201
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,870
Got it?

202
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,650
Joon.

203
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,270
Joon.

204
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,150
Get some rest.

205
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,650
I'm fine.

206
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,320
Bye.

207
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:28,220
I meant to throw it away.

208
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,070
You don't have a trash can?

209
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,880
You came all the way here?

210
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,210
You know.

211
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:38,220
Some rude bastard threw this cheap thing away at someone else's house.

212
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,310
And it was yours?

213
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:42,020
I didn't need it.

214
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,070
Why don't you take it if you need it?

215
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,450
No, thanks.

216
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,460
You take care of it.

217
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:57,280
You would feel bad if your old clothes can't be recycled and become trash.

218
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,020
You know I get over those things quickly.

219
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:08,690
And you're quite good at picking up after my trash.

220
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:15,250
You've grown a lot.

221
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:20,220
You shouldn't care about what I picked up.

222
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,650
Don't act like you still own it.

223
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,470
I also picked up a doll on the street.

224
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:41,320
I wanted to give it back if the owner came around.

225
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,570
But he didn't. So what do I do?

226
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,070
I just have to play with it.

227
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,520
Hit me.

228
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,770
Take care of your trash.

229
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:30,770
After you left, Jaejoon came.

230
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,110
I never should've shown myself yesterday.

231
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,080
Why?

232
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,320
Did he see something?

233
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,960
And he went crazy over it?

234
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,270
I'm not too sure.

235
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:49,010
I think Inhyung... is in trouble.

236
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:51,500
Just keep walking next time.

237
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,420
Joon,

238
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,270
it can never be undone.

239
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,830
Okay?

240
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,420
Geunyoung.

241
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,170
I'll have a beer.

242
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,390
Okay, a beer.

243
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,940
Look around.

244
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,620
The place is called Dowon.

245
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,800
Like the place where Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei swore their brotherhood.  (T/N: Romance of the Three Kingdomes, the three friends took an oath to become sworn brothers) 

246
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,230
Let's do something similar.

247
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,020
Say "one" when I say "we are."

248
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,360
We are.

249
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,360
Do it for him.

250
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,410
- One! 
 - One.

251
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,100
One.

252
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:37,050
We're in the same boat now.

253
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,970
Let's drink.

254
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,820
Again?

255
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,570
Let's drink.

256
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,460
Sure.

257
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,870
Cheers.

258
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,720
My goodness.  Here it comes.

259
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,990
Cheers.

260
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:01,870
Take a shot?

261
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,440
Of course.

262
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,150
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers.

263
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:18,100
â™«  Which star are you from? Did you open my heart?  â™«

264
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,390
â™«  How did you get in my heart?  â™«

265
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:28,700
â™«  Shall I take a step closer? Shall I be brave?  â™«

266
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:33,370
â™«  I'm around you again today  â™«

267
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:40,340
â™«  Which star are you from? Did you open my heart?  â™«

268
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,220
Should we open one more bottle?

269
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,520
Okay!

270
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,390
You don't have ask.

271
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:54,230
Let's go to another spot.

272
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:57,330
â™ª Say that you suck â™ª

273
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,660
â™ª You're rude! â™ª

274
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,810
â™ª  Lee Geunyoung is... â™ª

275
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,590
â™ª  ...very confident! â™ª

276
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,980
â™ª  Keep looking at me â™ª

277
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,270
â™ª  I'm shy â™ª

278
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:11,020
â™ª Shut up baby, Shut up baby  â™ª

279
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,730
â™ª Cheer up a bit more â™ª

280
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,970
We're done!

281
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,960
It's finally over.

282
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,420
I told you earlier. I'm not good at variety shows.

283
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,150
So I'm worried a bit.

284
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,570
There's no such thing nowadays.

285
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:32,370
You just have to be yourself.

286
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,850
Of course.

287
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:39,020
I like you when you're drunk.

288
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,210
You're just saying that, huh?

289
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,210
No.

290
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:46,820
What about you? You can't lie.

291
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,220
Me?

292
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:54,590
I... hate sucking up to people.

293
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,790
And I really mean what I said.

294
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:58,690
Come on.

295
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:02,340
I know you guys will be great.

296
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:09,300
You can show me the show before it airs, right?

297
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,200
Sure.

298
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,100
Let's take another.

299
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:13,980
Cheers!

300
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:19,470
 Nobody would notice if I walked out right now. 

301
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:24,500
 I'm not a big star like Hoo Joon. 

302
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:29,530
 And I don't have a huge role. 

303
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:33,630
 I'm just his anti-fan. 

304
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,410
Can I sing another?

305
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:41,250
The mic is yours today.

306
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:44,770
â™ª  Fill me up with love â™ª

307
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:48,620
â™ª  I think my battery is out â™ª

308
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,540
â™ª  I can't live without you â™ª

309
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,120
â™ª  I really can't â™ª

310
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,610
â™ª  You're my battery â™ª

311
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:58,890
â™ª  I think I'm running low on love dosage â™ª

312
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:02,040
â™ª  I'm low â™ª

313
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:17,520
â™ª  How lonely was I in those days â™ª

314
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,970
â™ª One day, two days... â™ª

315
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:22,580
â™ª  When I faced the truth â™ª

316
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,770
â™ª  With all my love... â™ª

317
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:27,880
â™ª  I only take... â™ª

318
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,290
â™ª  You're not the sun... â™ª

319
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,490
â™ª  Don't think you're the center... â™ª

320
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:35,600
- â™ª  You can't do whatever you like â™ª 
 - Don't do it.

321
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,120
Sing it together!

322
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,260
â™ª  I-I-I-I-I always do â™ª

323
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:45,090
â™ª Damn... â™ª

324
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:47,450
â™ª Damn... â™ª

325
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,990
I'm sorry.

326
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:19,230
Geunyoung.

327
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,170
You're here.

328
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:26,750
Here.

329
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,680
I heard Hoo Joon's here.

330
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,270
You're with him?

331
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,510
Yes.

332
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,320
Together.

333
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,120
You're doing the show.

334
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,270
I read the news.

335
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,000
Yes.

336
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:48,000
I wanted to fight him head on but...

337
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,470
He must've done something.

338
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,310
You're wearing heels.

339
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:57,850
Hit him again with them.

340
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,520
Maybe I should.

341
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,460
I told you.

342
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,880
Some people in this world cheer for you.

343
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,360
And I'm probably the most famous out of them.

344
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,300
By the way...

345
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:17,360
that really cheers me up.

346
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:23,420
I guess fans do help celebs when they're sad.

347
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,070
You can't be like this.

348
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:27,860
You already understand how celebs feel?

349
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,670
No way.

350
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:34,080
I told you not to worry.

351
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,740
I did drink a lot but I'm fine.

352
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,860
I'm not a kid.

353
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,010
Yes.

354
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:41,860
 This is my number. 

355
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,170
 I got a celeb's number. 

356
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:44,970
 Save it. 

357
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,750
All right.

358
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,800
Go home if you're drunk.

359
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,580
What are you doing here?

360
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,170
Who told you I'm drunk?

361
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:06,370
You're not in a real relationship to worry about her.

362
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:10,880
Only we decide... what relationship we have.

363
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,860
Geunyoung,

364
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:18,220
the top star is being mean again.

365
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,700
That's because he's an attention seeker.

366
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:23,940
He thinks he's the main character of everyone's life.

367
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,650
A total jerk.

368
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,510
What?

369
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,150
Want to join?

370
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:37,740
Or... are you worried about her or something?

371
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,770
That I might pick up what you throw away again?

372
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,080
Watch your mouth, Jaejoon.

373
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:50,090
Then don't look at me like that.

374
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,070
Geunyoung.

375
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,240
See you later.

376
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,420
Thanks for this.

377
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,110
You need to pay me back.

378
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:02,310
Take care.

379
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,420
Bye.

380
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:11,260
He's such a nice person.

381
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,420
How do you know him?

382
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:15,390
I won't tell you.

383
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:26,720
I should see you off but our taxi's here so we're leaving.

384
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,090
Goodbye.

385
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,710
So.

386
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:37,930
Goodbye, top star of the universe.

387
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:38,970
Where do you think you're going?

388
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,440
You're drunk. Let me get a cab.

389
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,880
I'm not drunk.

390
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,330
I don't want any more news about us.

391
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:48,760
I can just take the subway.

392
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,870
Don't joke with me.

393
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:52,270
I'm not even drunk!

394
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:56,330
Please just listen to me.

395
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:58,100
I got it.

396
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,570
Stay still, please.

397
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:04,320
I'm sorry. Just a second.

398
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:18,310
I've worked out so hard at the gym.

399
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:21,380
Is she heavy or am I weak?

400
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,220
Ouch.

401
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,220
Come on.

402
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,560
Okay, we're here.

403
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,560
We're here.

404
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,570
Please don't throw up.

405
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:34,770
Please don't throw up, okay?

406
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:36,520
She's for real.

407
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,400
Come on.

408
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,930
Wow, she's walking.

409
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,640
She wasn't sleeping.

410
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,970
Wow.

411
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,930
My back.

412
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,650
Lee Geunyoung.

413
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,710
Wow.

414
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:01,040
I'd better not have problems when I dance.

415
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,470
Let me ask you a question.

416
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,140
How...

417
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,480
do you know Jaejoon?

418
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,500
Huh?

419
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:16,660
You keep ignoring me.

420
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:22,250
Come on.

421
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,770
Don't take this the wrong way.

422
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:41,830
I'm trying to make it hot for you.

423
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,860
So that you sweat while you sleep.

424
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,100
 â™ª Fill me up with your love â™ª  

425
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,470
 â™ª My battery is out â™ª  

426
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,420
 Thank you. 

427
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:08,270
She's fast asleep.

428
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:12,000
It's so messy.

429
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:43,610
Then don't...

430
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:47,980
look at me like that.

431
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,720
 Come on. 

432
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,100
 Please just don't throw up. 

433
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,500
I hope I didn't throw up.

434
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,180
Did I?

435
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:39,140
Hello?

436
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,860
 Geunyoung. 

437
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,270
Who's this?

438
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,470
It's me, JJ.

439
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,970
Did you get home all right?

440
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:49,050
Oh.

441
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,430
The coffee?

442
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:54,080
 Thanks for the coffee. 

443
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,600
Do you want to pay me back for the coffee?

444
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,830
Sure. I will.

445
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,530
But...

446
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,900
does it have to be coffee?

447
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,770
Hello.

448
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:27,770
Did you wait long?

449
00:34:27,771 --> 00:34:29,197
Not at all.

450
00:34:29,197 --> 00:34:31,810
Can a celeb walk around like this?

451
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:32,930
Oh.

452
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:35,170
I run a company now.

453
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:38,970
You like hangover soup?

454
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:40,560
Of course, I do.

455
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,060
I wouldn't be here today if it weren't for this place.

456
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:48,070
I came here all the time when I was a journalist.

457
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:50,920
The soup here does it all.

458
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,180
It's not that you don't eat it, right?

459
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,510
No, I like it.

460
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,220
I also have a hangover.

461
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,310
Why? Something wrong?

462
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:01,680
Someone is giving me a hard time.

463
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,640
I want to hit him with a heel.

464
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,290
You should've told me.

465
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:07,110
I should have.

466
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,020
Enjoy.

467
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:13,770
Thank you.

468
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:14,970
Do this.

469
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:23,640
Your recipe?

470
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,000
Yes.

471
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,180
Enjoy!

472
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,430
Did you save my number?

473
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,600
Of course.

474
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,430
I'm not saved as "nobody," right?

475
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,970
Of course not.

476
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,170
It's Jaejoon.

477
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,100
Choi Jaejoon.

478
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,970
Just call me by my name.

479
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,270
Don't call me JJ.

480
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,100
That's funny.

481
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,970
Right.

482
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:57,020
I'll just call you by your name then.

483
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,740
Mr. Jaejoon.

484
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,670
Much better.

485
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,620
Hey!

486
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,970
You got yourself mixed up with Jaejoon?

487
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,640
What are you talking about?

488
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,680
He called me.

489
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,310
And told me to take good care of you.

490
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:38,930
Your career is over if you're caught drooling over someone else's girl.

491
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:42,140
And he said I'd lose money if that happens to you.

492
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,150
So?

493
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,180
You've really changed. 
  (Literally says: he's lost a lot of teeth.) 

494
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,100
You're overly excited over what he said.

495
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,970
Why didn't you put effort into other stars?

496
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:52,100
So that you'll be well off without me.

497
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:55,850
I can't sleep because I worry about what the company will do without me.

498
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,520
You're not the only one who cares.

499
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:03,070
I can't even sit on the toilet because I constantly worry about your image, you brat!

500
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,970
Sir, he has a schedule.

501
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:07,020
Let's go.

502
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:09,970
Hey.

503
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:12,130
You...

504
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,070
Bye, bro.

505
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,890
Sir.

506
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,490
Are you constipated?

507
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:22,840
You just said you can't sit on...

508
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,820
No, I'm fine.

509
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:53,520
Yes.

510
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,470
The shoot is tomorrow and I don't know a thing.

511
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:58,890
 Let's party after your shoot. 

512
00:37:58,890 --> 00:37:59,970
Okay.

513
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,970
I'll call you after I'm done.

514
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:28,660
Ma'am? Geunyoung is here.

515
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,600
You're here early.

516
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,120
As if you were waiting nearby.

517
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:39,100
   

518
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,970
   

519
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:44,060
I was nearby.

520
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,390
But...

521
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,120
you really dressed comfortably, huh?

522
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:51,430
Come in.

523
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:56,300
The staff will be here soon so we have to get you ready.

524
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:02,170
What the...

525
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:04,770
Wow, baby.

526
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:07,780
You look so pretty with makeup.

527
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,370
As if!

528
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,470
Who's this?

529
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:02,020
Isn't she too pretty?

530
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,950
Amazing.

531
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,020
You two look good together now.

532
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,560
It's a virtual marriage.

533
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,220
So we'll go with the wedding shoot.

534
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,060
Okay.

535
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,870
Let's do something more with the set, Geunyoung.

536
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,370
More than this?

537
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:24,820
Let's go. Geunyoung's set.

538
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,670
What are you doing?

539
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:30,230
Any problems?

540
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,600
You have to...

541
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,280
   

542
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,650
Bride.

543
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:36,180
- Bridegroom. You ready? 
 - Yes.

544
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:36,930
Yes.

545
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:38,430
- You too? 
 - Yes.

546
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,220
Yeah, camera!

547
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,880
I'm going.

548
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,600
Okay, good.

549
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,500
It hurts so little this way.

550
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,410
Okay.

551
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,170
Oh, yeah!  I like that.

552
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:53,070
That's what I'm talking about.

553
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,400
Bullets with love. Let's go.

554
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,160
Bullet of love fired!

555
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,000
That's good. Don't hold it.

556
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,930
Hold your hands.

557
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,350
Okay.

558
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:15,330
Let's do this.

559
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:17,920
Ah, it's okay.

560
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,180
Good! Now the other way.

561
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,250
Ouch.

562
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,590
Okay, good.

563
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,980
Okay.

564
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,550
You thought it was easy, huh?

565
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:33,050
Like this?

566
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:35,370
- Perfect. 
- I like it so much.

567
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:36,380
You're so good at it.

568
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,420
As if you're killing each other.

569
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,930
That hurts.

570
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:44,900
That's it.

571
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:56,300
Look. You're going for a drive this time.

572
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,590
But...

573
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:58,770
Geunyoung is driving.

574
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:00,070
Huh?

575
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:02,140
She'll be okay with it?

576
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,960
You have a license, right?

577
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,700
I do have one.

578
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,330
Okay!

579
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:12,560
Then let's go right away.

580
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,880
Let's go with the next action scene.

581
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:37,080
It's only 100 meters so don't worry.

582
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:40,490
Geunyoung... Geunyoung?

583
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,700
- Huh? 
 - Are you okay?

584
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,970
Tell him you can't do it.

585
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:46,640
I'm fine.

586
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,140
It's just a little bit, right?

587
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:51,240
Everyone will have to work more if I don't.

588
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,110
I can do it.

589
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:54,290
You're a professional already.

590
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:56,530
Way to go.

591
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:00,310
A famous racer said,

592
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:02,600
"Driving is about pure instincts."

593
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,250
Are you done? Get in.

594
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:12,190
You can do it!

595
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:21,960
I guess you don't want to get hurt.

596
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,930
Of course, that's how you would be.

597
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:27,010
That's the most human thing you've done so far.

598
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:31,290
Shut your mouth.

599
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,640
What about the seatbelt?

600
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:42,200
Let's take it off since it's a simple shoot.

601
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,670
Okay?

602
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,270
 Cameras are rolling. 

603
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,140
Shall we?

604
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,490
Shoot.

605
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:05,090
Let's go!

606
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:10,290
One, two, three.

607
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,110
Shall we...

608
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:31,380
start the car, Geunyoung?

609
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,230
 He's trying to put on a show. 

610
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:39,500
I'll drive safely.

611
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,770
Okay. Let's go.

612
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:05,070
That was more dynamic than we thought.

613
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:07,890
We like it like that.

614
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:10,070
Geunyoung, hold on.  You're going a bit fast.

615
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:12,020
Stop!

616
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:14,350
Wait a minute.

617
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:17,430
Slower!

618
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:18,560
Wait!

619
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,270
Stop it!

620
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:21,270
Hurry up and stop!

621
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:22,890
Stop! Brake!

622
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:24,350
That's the gas!

623
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:25,770
Stop now!

624
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:27,310
We're going to crash!

625
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:28,390
Wait!

626
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:30,000
- What do I do? 
 - Hit the brake!

627
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,270
Stop now!

628
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,230
Stop!

629
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,180
Wait!

630
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,980
BRAKE!

631
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:49,810
â™«  Which star are you from?   â™«

632
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:52,540
â™«  Did you open my heart?  â™«

633
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:57,970
â™«  How did you get in my heart?  â™«

634
00:45:57,970 --> 00:46:00,640
â™«  Shall I take a step closer?  â™«

635
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,230
â™«  Shall I be brave?  â™«

636
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:07,970
â™«  I'm around you again today  â™«

637
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:18,120
Cut!

638
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:35,190
Are you guys okay? You're not hurt?

639
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:38,070
I got confused between the brake and gas.

640
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:39,100
Shut up.

641
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,170
I'm...

642
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:41,490
sorry but I...

643
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:43,780
I said shut up.

644
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,960
Are you okay?

645
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,220
Geunyoung, are you okay?

646
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:48,870
Are you okay?

647
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:52,870
At least she put on the brake.

648
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:03,840
You must be startled.

649
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:07,600
Don't let her drive ever again.

650
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:11,180
I said I'll put on the seatbelt.

651
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:14,460
It's my lifeline. Don't you know that?

652
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:20,350
To be honest,

653
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:22,430
I never driven a car before.

654
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:24,450
I tried to tell you earlier...

655
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:28,280
You did a good job!

656
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,470
Right.

657
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:33,810
After 13 years of not cooking a pigeon, I almost cooked two people.

658
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:35,880
They're fine.

659
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:41,420
Geunyoung, get out.

660
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:44,060
We'll take a break.

661
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:46,520
Let's clean this up.

662
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:54,580
Oh my god!

663
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,960
She has a thing for shocking people.

664
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,530
Make sure his face is okay.

665
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:10,920
What?

666
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:13,980
You're not hurt.

667
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:18,140
Joon, have some water.

668
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:25,470
I'm sorry, could you give us some time?

669
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,900
Let's go.

670
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:32,570
You must be startled.

671
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:35,270
You didn't see, right?

672
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:37,440
What?

673
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,800
Never mind.

674
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:45,470
There were three.

675
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,070
Joon.

676
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:51,070
What?

677
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:51,996
You okay?

678
00:48:51,996 --> 00:48:53,396
No.

679
00:48:53,396 --> 00:48:55,270
I'm not okay.

680
00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:00,480
Number one and three.

681
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,250
It's 100 percent.

682
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:04,920
He must be really startled.

683
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:10,170
It was an accident.

684
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:12,080
A car accident.

685
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:25,970
A minor collision.

686
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,480
Why him?

687
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,670
Geunyoung, are you okay?

688
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:45,570
Yes.

689
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:47,440
Is something on your lips?

690
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,760
Are you just washing your face?

691
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:55,670
Man, that feels good.

692
00:49:57,770 --> 00:50:00,670
Weird way of washing her face.

693
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:13,550
Here, Geunyoung.

694
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:15,800
Come sit over here for a second.

695
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,300
Um...

696
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,880
There was...

697
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,340
a small accident.

698
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:31,750
I think we got good footage.

699
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:35,170
Let's call it a day.

700
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:37,860
Just one interview for you, Geunyoung.

701
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,070
Okay.

702
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:41,170
Good job, everyone.

703
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:44,500
Thank you.

704
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,130
Good job.

705
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:50,330
Sorry about earlier.

706
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:51,770
Why did you hide your closet license?

707
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:54,080
Were you trying to kill me?

708
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:57,600
I would have died, too. You saw how scared I was. I was surprised, too.

709
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,870
You're one to talk.

710
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:03,320
You think I wasn't surprised? I didn't think they'd touch.

711
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:08,130
Shut up.

712
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:09,970
Don't act all selfless in front of me.

713
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:11,580
Huh?

714
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:13,910
Anyway, you've been revealed.

715
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,480
What will I do about him?

716
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:35,770
Are you nervous?

717
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:36,400
Huh?

718
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,610
Don't be nervous.

719
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:40,170
Be yourself in interviews.

720
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:41,210
Okay.

721
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:44,020
How did you feel when you first got the offer?

722
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:46,140
You didn't like it, right?

723
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:48,110
Of course, I didn't.

724
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:50,770
To be honest,

725
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:53,720
Hoo Joon and I...

726
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:57,120
did have issues.

727
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:00,670
So why did you decide to do it?

728
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:02,990
How should I put it...

729
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:10,170
It was like homework that I never finished.

730
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:12,460
It didn't sit right.

731
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:13,930
That's why.

732
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:17,720
Then how was the first shoot today?

733
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,990
Uncomfortable.

734
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:28,330
Will the accident air, too?

735
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:32,110
I don't think it should.

736
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:33,860
Will it?

737
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,420
What is this?

738
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:09,970
They said only the smell of feet remains.

739
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:12,430
What's happening?

740
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:27,480
It's surely nice to be

741
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:30,200
in a sauna.

742
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,520
I love it.

743
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:14,940
It's so cold.

744
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:21,670
I love it.

745
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:29,710
Let's see.

746
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:32,570
Nobody texted me.

747
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:40,170
I know I made a mistake but...

748
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:42,460
how can he say that?

749
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:43,250
Other motives?

750
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:45,240
Revealed?

751
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,970
I wouldn't want a truck full of you.

752
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:49,500
You look like a wildcat.

753
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,580
Why do people say he's nice?

754
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:56,670
Right.

755
00:54:57,870 --> 00:55:01,960
I'll get down to your duplicity.

756
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,720
You'll be amazed.

757
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,920
Hoo Joon's duplicity.

758
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:09,610
There's a lot.

759
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:11,290
Number one.

760
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:17,930
He says "Shut up" when he's angry.

761
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:22,000
You don't know how it feels unless he does it to you.

762
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,470
Hey!

763
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:29,210
You're hurt. What happened?

764
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:30,480
Who's the producer?

765
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,320
We rented a house to shoot.

766
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,600
Why go somewhere and get hurt?

767
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,540
Why do this in the first place?

768
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:39,770
It'll all benefit us in the end.

769
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:41,080
Of course, it will.

770
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,090
Not sure about who though.

771
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:44,870
Joon, by the way...

772
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:46,420
I bought the house.

773
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:48,920
It's your house after the shoot.

774
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,890
Why are you doing this?

775
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:53,700
Are you worried I might get in trouble?

776
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:56,750
It's for real this time.

777
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:58,710
I should change the producer.

778
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:00,230
That's fine.

779
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:01,870
It was just a small collision.

780
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:02,680
Oh yeah?

781
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:06,540
Then let's sign the paper after the meeting.

782
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:09,090
Okay? Okay?

783
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:16,630
He's so rude. 
  (Lit: I'm dirty, not sure if I should be a singer or not) 

784
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:18,430
You're here.

785
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:20,450
- Hello. 
 - Hello, Hoo Joon.

786
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:23,860
This is Choi Hwajin, the director.

787
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:25,170
Nice to meet you.

788
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:26,420
Nice to meet you.

789
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:28,370
Have a seat.

790
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:34,620
Director, you look so nice.

791
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:39,870
It's only for the show.

792
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:43,960
He never smiles.

793
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:48,080
Number three.

794
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:53,290
What?

795
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:55,390
 Don't you know the password? 

796
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,320
What the?

797
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:01,070
 It's for security. 

798
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:04,130
I told you to check it.

799
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,600
Let's go in.

800
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,640
Let's see.

801
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,040
We can set the camera...

802
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:30,370
in the living room and the kitchen.

803
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:31,680
 I'm sorry. 

804
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,750
It's nice to work more.

805
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:35,210
I'll get to it.

806
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:38,420
Mr. Choi?

807
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:42,360
How about one on the veranda?

808
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,670
That's nice.

809
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:44,420
Okay.

810
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:46,670
On the veranda...

811
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:52,690
I told them to keep the doors closed.

812
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:53,910
Mr. Jong!

813
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:54,770
 Yes. 

814
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:58,390
 You didn't lock up. 

815
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:00,490
We'll get in trouble for this.

816
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:01,336
You locked it?

817
00:58:01,337 --> 00:58:02,750
 Yes. 

818
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:04,970
There you go.

819
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:06,570
Let's go now.

820
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:09,720
How about you treat us.

821
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,360
 - Me? 
 - How about... 

822
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,490
 ...beef? 

823
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:14,520
 Thank you for the food. 

824
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:32,870
Did they really lock it?

825
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:34,330
It's locked?

826
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:38,180
Who'd come here to the 15th floor?

827
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:49,270
There's no neighbor.

828
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:56,920
Who should I call?

829
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:58,980
911?

830
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:05,070
 Don't let anyone know you live here. 

831
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:11,330
How about Mijeong?

832
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:18,140
 You sure you're at a friend's place? 

833
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:26,480
He's not stopping by today?

834
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,810
I need to use the bathroom.

835
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:44,980
 Timing and Subtitles by the ðŸ¥€Hatefully Yours ðŸ™ƒ @Viki.com 

836
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:47,670
Okay.

837
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:50,760
The manager said to call if I need something.

838
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:54,570
I need something more than ever.

839
00:59:57,390 --> 01:00:02,010
Don't think about me and just do what you...

840
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,730
He's been gone a while.

841
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:08,910
   

842
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:12,610
It must be important.

843
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:14,400
Excuse me,

844
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,380
can I take this?

845
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:17,470
Of course.

846
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:19,450
Thank you.

847
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:27,820
 Please, save me. 

848
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:31,350
â™«   I'm your Pop Star  â™«

849
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:35,410
â™«  Oh yeah, eh  â™«

850
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:43,210
â™«  Remember, I'm always your one and only one  â™«

851
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:47,490

852
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:52,500
â™«  Oh, every day, every time, if you can hear me  â™«

853
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:55,540
â™«  I'll sing  â™«

854
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:59,680
 You'd better not do anything weird to our Joon. 

855
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,400
 Everyone's on Hoo Joon's side. 

856
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:04,330
 You trust his staff? 

857
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:06,190
 Call emergency... 

858
01:01:06,190 --> 01:01:07,920
 I made you lonely. 

859
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:08,860
 I know. 

860
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:13,940
 Did Hoo Joon always keep so many secrets? 

861
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,370
 Nice to meet you. 

862
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:16,420
 I'm Roy. 

863
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:19,990
 It's my first time sitting in for someone. 

864
01:01:19,990 --> 01:01:22,380
 Do you two knew each other? 

865
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:24,970
â™«   Where the light shines when I open my eyes   â™«

866
01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:28,150
â™«   I'll be standing right there   â™«

867
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:31,070
