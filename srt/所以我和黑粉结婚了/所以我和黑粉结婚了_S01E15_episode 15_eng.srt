1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,770


2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,350
   

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,220
   

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,930
   

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,720
   

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,620
   

7
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:30,090
   

8
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:49,640
   

9
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,846
And about my relationship with Oh Inhyung, which everyone's curious about...

10
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,710
it is true we had a special relationship.

11
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:04,530
 And she is... 

12
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,299
suffering from the many misunderstandings and rumors that she used me for success.

13
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:11,527
I hope that Oh Inhyung will not be harmed by me

14
00:01:11,552 --> 00:01:14,457
through any further false assumptions and rumors.

15
00:01:14,457 --> 00:01:16,965
This is how I can end it.

16
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,670
Inhyung.

17
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,980
I've come a long way...

18
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,930
with the wings that lies have given me.

19
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,640
 But at some point, 

20
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,920
 I realized I can't go back with those wings. 

21
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,020
As of today, I acknowledge everything.

22
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,920
And I'll wait...

23
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,930
to humbly accept all punishment.

24
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,670
Again...

25
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,040
I sincerely apologize.

26
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,720
- He's here! 
 - Here he is.

27
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,350
Can this be considered a retirement announcement today?

28
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,430
Is there anything else you'd like to add?

29
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,060
A scoop just came out! Breaking news!

30
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,860
JJ's been in an accident!

31
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,270
Have you heard about JJ and Oh Inhyung's accident?

32
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,440
It's been reported that Oh Inhyung tried to kill herself.

33
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:31,850
Jihyang,

34
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,450
can you check what's happened first?

35
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,220
Soohwan.

36
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,870
 - Lee Geunyoung, you saw the news?  
 - I saw the press conference.

37
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,890
 Not that. 

38
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,840
 Oh Inhyung tried to kill herself. 

39
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,770
 If I... 

40
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,600
 followed Jaejoon then. 

41
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,370
 If I didn't give up... 

42
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,520
 on Inhyung then. 

43
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,070
 If I told these truths earlier... 

44
00:03:37,945 --> 00:03:39,730
 how would it have... 

45
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,800
 turned out for us three now? 

46
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:55,000
♫  Where my lonely heart end?  ♫

47
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,180
   
   

48
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:06,140
   

49
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:10,520
   

50
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,010
 Everyone's has fallen. 

51
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,080
 It's all because of me. 

52
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,220
Fortunately, the operation was successful.

53
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,140
But they're both still unconscious.

54
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,780
Choi Jaejoon is in a more serious condition than Oh Inhyung.

55
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,250
They've been moved to the ICU now, so let's see how they progress.

56
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,230
Please...

57
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,900
 Are Jaejoon and Inhyung okay? 

58
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,210
   

59
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,970
 Jaejoon, 

60
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,700
 you're not that much of a jerk to me. 

61
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,770
 You should've told me that earlier. 

62
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,800
 What you're saying right now... 

63
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,570
 only sounds like you're consoling me, someone rebelling against the world. 

64
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,140
Are you okay?

65
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,420
What about Inhyung and Jaejoon?

66
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,370
In the ICU.

67
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,770
I'm so sorry.

68
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,730
- It's all because of me. 
 - Geunyoung.

69
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,170
I'm not in my right mind right now.

70
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,110
I'm so sorry.

71
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,530
Can you wait for me?

72
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:51,380
♫  This trembling and the warmth of your embrace  ♫

73
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:58,690
♫  will become the star of the night  ♫

74
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:06,150
♫  The night that will be the last will come,  ♫

75
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:13,180
♫  Even with a short goodbye is a  goodbye  ♫

76
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,820
Joon.

77
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,850
How long are you going to be like this?

78
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,140
We still have to wait a bit on their progress.

79
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,720
- Let's go home first— 
 - They'll wake up.

80
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,840
Yes, they will.

81
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,420
I don't want to say this right now,

82
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,970
but there's going to be problems with the commercials and the movie.

83
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:46,870
I'll go and meet up with the commercial people first.

84
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,940
I'll go myself.

85
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,210
Will you be okay?

86
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,370
I won't avoid it anymore.

87
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,220
Let's go.

88
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,080
All right.

89
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,100
   

90
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,890
   

91
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:09,120
   

92
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,470
These guys really...

93
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,920
Let's just go.

94
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,690
They're going too far.

95
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,850
I'm sorry.

96
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,820
The legal team is making a fuss about litigation now.

97
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,670
Public sentiment will die down if you just wait a little bit.

98
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:46,620
It's more about his image than public sentiment.

99
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,600
We can't stop them anymore.

100
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,200
I think you'd better prepare for breach of contract.

101
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,900
I'm sorry.

102
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,230
Don't worry too much.

103
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,940
They won't take it to court.

104
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,590
I'm sorry, Jihyang.

105
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:24,630
For making you pay a penalty as soon as you've become CEO.

106
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,230
Don't talk like that super star.

107
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,520
I've got you a meeting with a film company.

108
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,730
Let's face them one by one.

109
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,360
Okay.

110
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,060
Joon.

111
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,980
Inhyung's conscious.

112
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,180
Joon.

113
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,420
What a relief.

114
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,020
What happened?

115
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,750
Where's Jaejoon?

116
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,470
He'll wake up soon, too.

117
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,520
Since you did.

118
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,060
Because of me...

119
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,500
It's not your fault.

120
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,900
Okay?

121
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,430
It's just that...

122
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,070
we forgot what's important.

123
00:11:53,062 --> 00:11:54,594
   
 (In reference to the boy who cried wolf) 

124
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,640
 What about Joon? 

125
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,560
 The public, they turn away in an instant. 

126
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,570
 And Joon has to bear all that. 

127
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:07,970
 Can you bear... 

128
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,370
 a guy who has to deal with all that? 

129
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,270
   

130
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,580
 Can I really bear it? 

131
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:26,070
 He's having such a hard time. 

132
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,470
 What am I doing? 

133
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,910
 Geunyoung. 

134
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,270
 Happy birthday. 

135
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,390
Right there.

136
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,970
I knew something was weird then, too.

137
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,100
Come on. Of course.

138
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,520
You're instincts are out of this world.

139
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,120
Come on.

140
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,620
Why, Ms. Angel?

141
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,310
What do you mean?

142
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,440
Come on...

143
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,730
   

144
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,180
What is it?

145
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,320
Wow.

146
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,670
The aftermath of the press conference.

147
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,340
He's telling us to stop airing the show.

148
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,210
We can't even air it?

149
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:26,130
I guess it comes from the top.

150
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,020
This week will be the last episode.

151
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,770
This show is putting me through way too much.

152
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,890
First, Who Joon, the big star, crashes.

153
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,920
Now they're telling us to stop the show...

154
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,900
Why do these things keep happening?

155
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,970
Stop editing as well.

156
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:47,570
It won't make it to air anyway.

157
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,650
 He's through the crisis stage. 

158
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:16,480
 But I'm not sure when he'll wake up. 

159
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,570
Inhyung is awake and doing well.

160
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,670
So...

161
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:41,020
I hope you'll wake up, too.

162
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:13,720
Yes.

163
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,570
We have to... clean up his office.

164
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:20,450
I took care of most of the office supplies,

165
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,580
but these looked important so I boxed them up.

166
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,150
Thank you.

167
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:39,080
♫  Girl, I remember... when I laid my eyes on you  ♫

168
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:48,600
♫  Made me surrender, you kept me up all night long  ♫

169
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:56,050
♫  Promised I'll treat you right, but I didn't know how  ♫

170
00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:05,790
♫  Girl, I remember, the times that you said you were mine  ♫

171
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:15,400
♫  Baby, you~  I still love you  ♫

172
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:22,410
♫  Baby, you~ I'm still with you  ♫

173
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:32,310
♫  I'm in the cold, girl, I hold you close... 
Oh, where do we go from now  ♫

174
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:39,440
♫  Baby, you~  I'm still with you  ♫

175
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,200
♫  With you  ♫

176
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,760
 Did you... 

177
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,010
 miss it, too? 

178
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:06,700
It's me who tried to leave this world.

179
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,760
Why is it you lying here?

180
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,920
You should've just let me.

181
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,860
Why did you do it?

182
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,470
   

183
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,760
That's a relief.

184
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:01,050
 I miss you. See you at the park at 7:00 p.m. 

185
00:19:23,858 --> 00:19:25,978
Again, we're sorry.

186
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,920
Can we postpone the release date?

187
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,470
You think it's that easy?

188
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,570
It's right around the corner.

189
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,230
I guess releasing it now is like waiting for it to fail.

190
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:44,320
I'm so sorry.

191
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,020
I'll try to take care of the breach of contract penalty.

192
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,570
It won't just end there.

193
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,520
Let's wait for the director. He's coming.

194
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,950
 Your call has been forwarded... 

195
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,170
 I'm sorry. 

196
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,850
 Something came up and I can't see you today because of some circumstances. 

197
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:18,160
 I'll text you again. 

198
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,870
What's taking him so long?

199
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,820
I must be out of my mind.

200
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,970
It's snowing.

201
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,430
I'm sorry, Joon.

202
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,490
I'm a little late.

203
00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:01,980
Shall we... discuss the incident?

204
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:06,700
I really... have no excuse to give.

205
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:28,270
 ♫ Can you hear my heart? ♫ 

206
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:35,140
 ♫ Can you see my words? ♫ 

207
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:48,720

 ♫ I know see that heart ♫ 

209
00:23:55,550 --> 00:24:02,220
 ♫ I remember those words ♫ 

210
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,810
 I'm sorry. Something came up and I can't see you today because of some circumstances. 

211
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,600
 I'll text you again. 

212
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,970
 It's okay. 

213
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:21,870
 Don't worry and do what you have to do. 

214
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:29,310
 ♫ Love is more common than words ♫

219
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:55,730
 I'll hurry and take care of everything and run to you. 

220
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,270
Joon.

221
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,960
There's no avoiding litigation.

222
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,320
I can't be helped.

223
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,590
I need to look for a lawyer.

224
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,990
Get some rest.

225
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:26,020
It'll all be okay.

226

231
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,360
 It's him. 

232
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,270
 Your father. 

233
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,680
   

234
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:42,080
   

235
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,720
   

236
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,000
   

237
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,989
So, what can I do for you?

238
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:10,750
I have some things to discuss.

239
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,460
I don't know if you read about me in the news...

240
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:17,480
Oh, yes. I heard there's been some commotion.

241
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,920
What is the nature of the problem?

242
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,350
I'm being sued.

243
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:25,640
I'll have to pay breach of contract penalties.

244
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,570
Ah, I see.

245
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,070
Is something wrong?

246
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,300
Oh.

247
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,100
Nothing.

248
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:46,680
You keep looking at my ring.

249
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,270
Oh.

250
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:52,030
It looks similar to the one I once had.

251
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:01,520
Take a closer look.

252
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:22,960
Where... did you happen to get this?

253
00:28:27,321 --> 00:28:30,591
I don't know if it's a ring you're looking to find.

254
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,540
About this ring, why... ?

255
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,320
It's no big deal.

256
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,480
Just something I lost.

257
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,770
Why did you lose it?

258
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,340
Huh?

259
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,040
This ring...

260
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,460
No. Your son.

261
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:00,970
It's no big deal?

262
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:04,970
To abandon him like that... and that's it?

263
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:07,090
Me and my mother?

264
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:10,570
So, you...

265
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:14,020
I think I made a mistake coming here.

266
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,040
I didn't abandon you.

267
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,670
The ring is mine,

268
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:35,590
but the one who gave it to your mother... was him.

269
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:38,930
Then...

270
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,420
Yes.

271
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,520
Your father.

272
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:46,590
He was my best friend.

273
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:50,300
And along with your mom, we spent a lot of time together.

274
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,320
They loved each other deeply.

275
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,460
But the problem was your father's family.

276
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,620
The family name was quite prestigious.

277
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,880
Eventually, your dad ran away from home and came to my house.

278
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:05,710
Around then... he engraved those letters to my ring.

279
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:08,060
And he proposed to her with it.

280
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,650
So the letters on the ring mean...

281
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:18,370
"You. Are. My. All."

282
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,970
The first letter of each word.

283
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:34,260
Why did they... separate?

284
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,500
The disapproval was intense.

285
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,370
Your prideful mother took it personally.

286
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,740
The two eventually broke up.

287
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:47,540
And his family rushed him into marriage.

288
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:53,340
Your mother found out she was pregnant... only after the marriage was near.

289
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,460
Your father didn't know about it at the time.

290
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:01,730
Your mom's pride wouldn't let the pregnancy shackle his ankles to their relationship.

291
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,470
And...

292
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,520
Yes.

293
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,000
She just disappeared like that.

294
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,430
My mom must've had it tough.

295
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:18,070
So, my father?

296
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,330
Where is he?

297
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,230
Oh my goodness, this mess.

298
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:08,820
You don't even pick up the phone when your home.

299
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,920
How did you guys get here?

300
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,630
You didn't pick up your phone—

301
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:19,460
My goodness.

302
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,810
What's wrong with your face?

303
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:25,310
I told you she'd be like this.

304
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,640
Does it hurt a lot?

305
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,930
I heard he's on TV and it's crazy.

306
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,140
Is it because of him?

307
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,720
No, I just caught a cold.

308
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,850
I'm fine.

309
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,020
You're fine?

310
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,220
You being sick and lying down like this.

311
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:41,310
It's the first time since our dog died when you were in elementary school. And you're okay?

312
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:44,020
Are the people from the station bothering you?

313
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,680
Those pieces of crap.

314
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,390
No, they're not.

315
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,890
I told you no.

316
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:51,140
You stop it, too.

317
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,390
She'll faint.

318
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:54,430
Go and lie down.

319
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,390
Yes.

320
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,880
Get a good rest.

321
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,680
We brought all of the food you like.

322
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,560
Just keep eating and sleeping,

323
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,140
sleeping and eating.

324
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,740
Okay?

325
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,220
 He wasn't that strong of a friend. 

326
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:19,580
 I wondered if it was right listening to his family and getting married. 

327
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,650
 His heart must've ached. 

328
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:25,370
 It's been 10 years already 

329
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,570
 since he left us. 

330
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,400
   

331
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:00,420
 His funeral was the last place I saw your mother. 

332
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,620
 That's when I first found out... 

333
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:05,090
 that you existed. 

334
00:34:05,091 --> 00:34:08,181
 Cutting all her ties... 

335
00:34:08,181 --> 00:34:10,910
 she left with you. 

336
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,230
 How are you? 

337
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:22,010
 Your son came to me. 

338
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,980
 I thought it was time to tell him. 

339
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,000
 Joon. 

340
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,940
It's mom.

341
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,700
I'm...

342
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,070
...sorry, Joon.

343
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,670
It's lucky that I'm tall.

344
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,430
Geunyoung, wake up.

345
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,380
Eat some porridge.

346
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:44,520
You didn't know it was broken?

347
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,100
Yeah.

348
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,140
I didn't.

349
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,800
I should fix it.

350
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,670
I noticed the water pressure was weak when I was washing my hands. I should fix that, too.

351
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:58,150
Don't worry. Your dad will fix everything.

352
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,640
Where are you going in the middle of the night?

353
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,170
I have to buy a new one.

354
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,950
I'll have to fix this door, too.

355
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,700
Just tell me.

356
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,810
What the heck happened?

357
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:26,130
It's because of him, right?

358
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,970
It's not.

359
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:30,220
Then what's...

360
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,180
going on with that guy?

361
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:35,580
I don't really know.

362
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:39,130
But I heard it was all lie.

363
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:41,020
Is it true?

364
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:46,000
He's not that kind of person, Mom.

365
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,650
I don't really know either.

366
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,785
I just...

367
00:36:54,785 --> 00:36:56,405
You...

368
00:36:56,405 --> 00:36:59,720
guys came home together.

369
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:04,830
You two... seemed really close, so...

370
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,070
Jaejoon.

371
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,670
Today...

372
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,070
I found my father.

373
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,120
He was far away.

374
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,950
Come on. Wake up.

375
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,730
Jaejoon.

376
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:42,940
You have to wake up.

377
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:57,370
You've only just recovered. Where are you going?

378
00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:00,400
It feels so stuffy just staying at home.

379
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,970
I'll be out just for a while.

380
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:03,950
Jeez.

381
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:06,580
Come here.

382
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,370
It's cold outside.

383
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:12,170
Come home early, okay?

384
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,460
Okay.

385
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,900
- I'll be home early. 
 - Okay.

386
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:26,020
 Why did you keep buying things? 

387
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,330
 I heard gifting shoes makes a lover run away. 

388
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:30,080
 You want me to run away so bad. 

389
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,850
 No. 

390
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,470
 When you run away with the heels I bought you last time, 

391
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,370
 come back to me with these. 

392
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:41,220
♫  I just laugh but you don't even notice  ♫

393
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:48,320
♫  Is this the person you broke up with yesterday?  ♫

394
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:55,720
♫  I just thought if I spent all that time  ♫

395
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:01,730
♫  Everything would be forgotten  ♫

396
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:10,580
♫  When I close my eyes and think of you  ♫

397
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:20,530
♫  I feel like I'm coming back to you any minute  ♫

398
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:27,720
♫  It blows like the wind in my heart  ♫

399
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:35,100
♫  It flows and comes to me like a river  ♫

400
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:43,230
♫  A love that I can't go back and forget  ♫

401
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:49,070
♫  It's blowing, blowing in my chest  ♫

402
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,140
Yes, Jihyang.

403
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,590
 Joon. 

404
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,730
 Jaejoon is awake. 

405
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:23,960
Geunyoung.

406
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:32,000
How have you been?

407
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,930
Pretty so-so.

408
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:37,490
How have you been?

409
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:38,730
Oh, you know.

410
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,170
How is... Joon?

411
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,000
Is he doing well?

412
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:50,570
Well... he must not be.

413
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:57,550
He's... holding it together, I think.

414
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,330
You and Joon are doing okay?

415
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,930
Remember those limited edition heels?

416
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:07,080
One you threw away in front of my restaurant.

417
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:10,010
The limited edition I gifted.

418
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,350
How can I forget about them?

419
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:14,120
It's how I got here.

420
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,740
Joon got mad at me, asking me...

421
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,350
why I bought such a big size.

422
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:22,520
Joon knew about us?

423
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:26,100
Joon gifted you heels before, right?

424
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:30,350
When he did, he asked me your shoe size.

425
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:32,430
Do they fit you well?

426
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,110
Is he awake?

427
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,220
I think his frontal lobe was damaged in the accident.

428
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:49,585
The aphasia may be temporary.

429
00:41:49,585 --> 00:41:51,340
You mean he can't talk?

430
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,730
Yes.

431
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:55,960
Let's take our time and wait.

432
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:00,000
Aphasia...

433
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,970
 Why? 

434
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:13,820
 Why! 

435
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,970
 Why did you come into my life? 

436
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,510
 If it weren't for you... 

437
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:28,750
 I lived every moment for you. 

438
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,640
 And now... 

439
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,120
 there's nothing I can do for you. 

440
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,570
 This is how I can end it. 

441
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,320
 Inhyung. 

442
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:03,940
You're playing with hwatu cards by yourself?

443
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,910
Just sorting them out.

444
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:09,150
Let's see.

445
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:11,150
These two go together.

446
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:16,510
 I think Joon said... 

447
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:20,570
 you're like... the December cards in hwatu. 

448
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:22,750
Mom.

449
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:27,790
What are the December cards in hwatu?

450
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,550
December?

451
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,210
Let's see.

452
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,170
Oh.

453
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:34,040
It's here.

454
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,170
These guys.

455
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:36,810
What do they mean?

456
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:38,270
Tears.

457
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:40,770
There's no light in them.

458
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:43,920
The other guys are more popular.

459
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,450
Why do you ask?

460
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:47,670
Someone just...

461
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:50,610
said I'm like December in hwatu.

462
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:53,470
- An ambush. 
 - What?

463
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:55,210
An ambush?

464
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:57,320
Yes.

465
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,420
These guys, they stay hidden

466
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:02,540
and stick with lights to score.

467
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,670
What is it then, if not an ambush?

468
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:07,970
You can never look down on them.

469
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:11,020
You only realize their value when you don't have them.

470
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:14,270
If they're in play, you just kind of want to take it.

471
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:18,570
If you don't, it feels very unsafe.

472
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:19,560
What?

473
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,960
Reluctant to throw it out?

474
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,550
Don't want to keep it though, either.

475
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:24,700
Wait.

476
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,330
Who's the guy?

477
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,460
- That son of a... 
 - What a...

478
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,430
Who is it?

479
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:31,980
I asked who it was.

480
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:34,030
I don't know.

481
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:37,040
It's not cold.

482
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,970
I'm telling you to stay one more night.

483
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:39,850
I can't.

484
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:41,210
The house can't be empty for too long.

485
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:42,670
I can't ever stop you.

486
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:44,330
I hear that the show is over?

487
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:46,170
When will you come home?

488
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:48,000
When I have the things sorted out.

489
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,220
I'll look for jobs and study English.

490
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,070
I'm always on your team.

491
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:56,140
So do whatever you want.

492
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,540
Well, yeah.

493
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:01,310
If it really doesn't work out, just quit everything and come home.

494
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:03,070
Write.

495
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:04,420
Should I?

496
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:07,970
Gosh, you guys are so reliable.

497
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,920
About him.

498
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,710
A parent's heart breaks when people blame their kid.

499
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:20,900
When it happened to you, I tried to burn down the station.

500
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:23,210
You should be good to him.

501
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,690
I will.

502
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:27,000
Hurry up and come.

503
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,260
- I'm tired. 
 - Okay.

504
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,420
Take care.

505
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:32,120
Bye.

506
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:35,870
You always have the answers, Geunyoung.

507
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,940
Take care!

508
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:13,330
Reluctant to throw me out?

509
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:16,890
So mean...

510
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:29,060
 Geunyoung, today is the last episode. 

511
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:31,390
 It's just how things have turned out. 

512
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,170
 Everyone makes mistakes, 

513
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:43,250
 because no one is perfect. 

514
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:45,850
 So now, I won't do it. 

515
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:49,050
 Someone once told me not to be afraid. 

516
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:51,370
 That it'll all pass. 

517
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:56,070
 So... don't be afraid. 

518
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:59,120
   

519
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:04,500
 You made me... come back to who I really was. 

520
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,740
 Today is... our last day. 

521
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,080
 It feels weird. 

522
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,020
 Right? 

523
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:11,900
 I know. 

524
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,400
 Don't forget. 

525
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,040
 The time we spent together. 

526
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:21,820
 How can I? I had such a hard time. 

527
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:23,570
 You're right. 

528
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:31,290
God, I miss her so much.

529
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:35,390
 I want to run to you, 

530
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,570
 but wait for me just a little longer. 

531
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,400
   

532
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,970
 I'll be... living my life. 

533
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,850
 There's a really good tteokbokki place in Dangjin. 

534
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:18,370
Just Geunyoung?

535
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:26,060
I still didn't feel so good when...

536
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:28,370
they gossiped about you.

537
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:30,770
I even felt a sense of guilt.

538
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:34,970
You saying that actually consoles me a little.

539
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:39,150
I thought maybe you were feeling vengeful because of me.

540
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:42,250
I felt bad.

541
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:46,170
Honestly...

542
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:51,030
firing you... wasn't because of Hoo Joon.

543
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:53,650
What?

544
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:57,600
Our company was preparing for layoffs.

545
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:00,090
We needed to avoid bankruptcy at all cost.

546
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:02,520
By downsizing.

547
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:03,790
Then why me?

548
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:06,930
I copied many of your proposals.

549
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:10,350
Honestly, looking you in the eye every day was uncomfortable.

550
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:12,620
That's why you were number one on the list.

551
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,940
I'm sorry.

552
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:18,330
Then you should've told me what was going on.

553
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:21,550
How could I say that with my own mouth?

554
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:24,140
You still got severance pay.

555
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:28,680
Right now, we can't even get that much.

556
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:32,170
Isn't that a little consoling?

557
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:36,440
I need to get to my class.

558
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,770
I'll get going first.

559
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:47,070
If we find a chance, let's see each other again comfortably,

560
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:48,771
Lee Geunyoung.

561
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,350
See you again, then.

562
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:35,180
 My debut? 

563
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:39,070
 You said it's Jaejoon's turn. 

564
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:40,270
 Joon. 

565
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:44,100
 This song... fits you better. 

566
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:47,560
 And someone needs to make it first for the next to succeed. 

567
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:51,440
 Still... how can I? 

568
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,790
 You know how hard Jaejoon worked. 

569
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:56,210
 I can't do it, sir. 

570
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:57,220
 I'm sorry. 

571
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,570
 I've made up my mind. 

572
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:09,670
 Jaejoon. 

573
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:15,550
 No need to make that face. 

574
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:20,220
 It's okay if you did well first. 

575
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:21,970
 It's okay. 

576
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,850
 Get ready for it. 

577
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:31,920
 You said you'd let me have my debut this time. 

578
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,600
 Let's do it in order. 

579
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,500
 I was the first one who joined. 

580
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,250
 So what? 

581
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:40,570
 Do you want to block your junior brother? 

582
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,980
 I've made up my mind. 

583
00:51:49,014 --> 00:51:52,194
 It's not even your last chance. 

584
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,420
Yes, not yet.

585
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:23,210
Maybe he has nothing he wants to say.

586
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:29,830
When he's out, have a quiet, scenic place ready, please.

587
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,770
Yes, I understand.

588
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:45,630
Did you say you have a brother, too?

589
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:47,760
Yes, sir.

590
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:52,350
What kind of older brother are you?

591
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:54,180
Me?

592
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:56,600
Just an older brother.

593
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:59,290
Like any other older brother.

594
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:08,340
An older brother...

595
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:16,140
Does he not want to say anything, maybe?

596
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:21,320
Maybe he has a lot to say, but he can't.

597
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:26,430
They say it might be temporary.

598
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:28,170
Let's wait a bit longer.

599
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:31,710
I wish time would pass more quickly.

600
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,590
Inhyung...

601
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:39,420
Stop feeling guilty.

602
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:42,170
Go back to your place.

603
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:44,720
That's what he'd want.

604
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,810
I should.

605
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:55,300
Back to my place.

606
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:09,580
We may not have aired everything we filmed.

607
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,600
But I'm still satisfied.

608
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,870
Mr. Han, you...

609
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:18,370
are too quick to be satisfied.

610
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:19,870
That's your problem.

611
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:22,550
I'm quick, huh?

612
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:30,460
I'll be right back.

613
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:32,140
Yes.

614
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:39,850
You're not satisfied either?

615
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:41,640
Still...

616
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:47,290
hasn't Hoo Joon changed from the guy he used to be?

617
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,500
Mr. Han,

618
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:56,220
did you know... this would happen from the beginning?

619
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,600
I told you to read "Pride and Prejudice."

620
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,290
We all...

621
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:09,930
live wrapped up in prideful covers.

622
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:15,620
The moment... I saw Hoo Joon get hit with your shoe...

623
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:17,800
Hoo Joon and you.

624
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:21,020
I saw it in you guys, too.

625
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:50,770
 "Pride and Prejudice," what Mr. Han wanted me to read. 

626
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:54,820
 Maybe to his eyes our beginning was 

627
00:55:54,820 --> 00:56:01,650
 Hoo Joon's pride and my prejudice against him. 

628
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:31,330
   
   

629
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:07,290
   

630
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:09,500
Wow, Lee Geunyoung.

631
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,780
When did you write this?

632
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:14,090
You're so loyal.

633
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:16,940
Have Wonder Woman publish this.

634
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:21,070
Right now, this is all I can do.

635
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:24,600
By the way, Hoo Joon didn't fire you?

636
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:29,310
I ran into Meanhee at the English academy.

637
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:31,310
And she told me.

638
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:32,970
I was going to get fired anyways.

639
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:34,110
Wait.

640
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:36,610
Meanhee goes to an English academy?

641
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:40,970
She said your company will have layoffs based on English fluency.

642
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:44,860
Meanhee is trying to survive on her own.

643
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:48,720
Soohwan...

644
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:52,020
I'm counting on you.

645
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:53,250
Don't worry.

646
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:56,754
Not only will I publish it, but also give it to the journalists.

647
00:57:56,754 --> 00:57:58,760
I'll call you.

648
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:04,750
 Your pride... 

649
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:07,570
 and my prejudice, and the end they brought us. 

650
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:11,970
 I wish that the world would for once... 

651
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:16,500
 believe what I have to say. 

652
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:22,330
♫  We must say goodbye  ♫

653
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:28,250
♫  The light that always brightened me up  ♫

654
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:32,320
♫  will fade  ♫

655
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,810
 Here. 

656
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:36,310
 What is this? 

657
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:40,350
 My gift to you. 

658
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:43,740
♫  This trembling and the warmth of your embrace  ♫

659
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:45,620
 One of our staff... 

660
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:48,390
 doesn't know how to turn off the camera. 

661
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:50,120
 I retrieved it. 

662
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:52,160
 I'm the only one who saw it so don't worry. 

663
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:58,910
♫  The night that will be the last will come,  ♫

664
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,810
 How could this... 

665
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:05,760
♫  Even with a short goodbye is a  goodbye  ♫

666
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:13,570
♫  Will you run away,   ♫

667
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:21,920
♫  like a dream that has been erased from a long night?  ♫

668
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:25,090
I miss him.

669
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:28,390
♫  Like the heart, I can't  ♫

670
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:38,750
♫  I hope you don't wake up and cry sadly  ♫

671
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:49,720
 Wow. So many stars. 

672
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,830
 You're right. 

673
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:54,710
 So how? 

674
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:57,470
 You want me to get that star for you? 

675
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,520
I...

676
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:11,370
am doing fine.

677
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:19,150
As always.

678
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:32,370
Why do I keep crying?

679
01:00:32,370 --> 01:00:34,820
Lee Geunyoung, seriously.

680
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:37,590
♫  Girl, I remember...   ♫

681
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:43,270
♫  When I laid my eyes on you  ♫

682
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:46,590
♫  Made me surrender  ♫

683
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:49,620
If you're going to be crying like that...

684
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:51,670
♫  You kept me up all night long  ♫

685
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:56,690
...why did you say you could wait for me?

686
01:00:56,690 --> 01:01:00,190
♫  But I didn't know how  ♫

687
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:03,380
♫  Girl, I remember  ♫

688
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:09,070
♫  The times that you said you were mine  ♫

689
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:13,230
How?

690
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:17,760
♫  Baby, you~  I still love you  ♫

691
01:01:19,530 --> 01:01:22,370
I thought you were gone. You scared me.

692
01:01:22,370 --> 01:01:26,380
♫  Baby, you~ I'm still with you  ♫

693
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:36,390
♫  I'm in the cold, girl, I hold you close... 
Oh, where do we go from now  ♫

694
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:43,170
♫  Baby, you~ I'm still with you  ♫

695
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,860
♫  With you  ♫

696
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:52,740


697
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:56,000
♫  Girl, I remember  ♫

698
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:01,220
♫  GWhen I laid my eyes on you  ♫

699
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:04,400
♫  Made me surrender  ♫

700
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:07,490
 I love you so much. 

701
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:09,730
 I knew you were persistent. 

702
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:12,400
 But I didn't know you would struggle so hard. 

703
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,610
 Maybe your writing will change something? 

704
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:17,270
 Your father and you are very similar. 

705
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:19,360
 There's someone else who could help. 

706
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,500
 Geunyoung, I wanted to see you. 

707
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:23,120
 But I thought I couldn't leave if I did. 

708
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:26,780
♫  The times that you said you were mine  ♫

709
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,350
 - Who's catching it? 
 - Geunyoung. 

710
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:30,020
 Me? 

711
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:36,330
♫  Baby, you~  I still love you  ♫

712
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:41,180
