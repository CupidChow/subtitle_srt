1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,770


2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,350
   

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,220
   

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,930
   

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,720
   

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,620
   

7
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:29,890
   

8
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,270
   

9
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:51,640
   

10
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,880
You worked hard till the end.

11
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,130
This isn't the end.

12
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,600
It's only the beginning now.

13
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:12,100
♫  Baby, you~  I still love you  ♫

14
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:20,520
♫  Baby, you~ I'm still with you  ♫

15
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,100
♫  I'm in the cold, girl, I hold you close  ♫

16
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,000
♫  Oh, where do we go from now  ♫

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,650
♫  Baby, you~  I'm still with you  ♫

18
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,850
We're already home.

19
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,079
Geunyoung,

20
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,640
you did great throughout filming.

21
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,720
You must have suffered.

22
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,970
Thank you for bringing me back.

23
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,900
Jihyang.

24
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,640
Can I cancel everything left on my schedule today?

25
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,400
Nope.

26
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,390
Take care, Geunyoung.

27
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,056
Yes, goodbye.

28
00:02:04,056 --> 00:02:05,680
Oh.

29
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,060
Never mind.

30
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,179
Bye.

31
00:02:11,179 --> 00:02:13,020
Bye.

32
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,980
Let's go.

33
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,379
I just can't tell him that I'm moving out.

34
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,950
I'll tell you later.

35
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,379
   

36
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:38,580
Mr. Bae sure does his job.

37
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,900
Getting rid of Lee Geunyoung first to shut me up?

38
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,310
It's really goodbye to this house now.

39
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,100
Hello?

40
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,979
 Lee Geunyoung, do you remember me? 

41
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:18,220
 This is Kang Gyeongsoo, editor-in-chief at Super Patch. 

42
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,980
Oh, yes.

43
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,690
   

44
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,979
 Your call has been forwarded... 

45
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,480
 You'd better stop by. 

46
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,220
You're hiring interns, right?

47
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:07,810
 Yes. 

48
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,700
Don't worry about what happened last time.

49
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:17,770
You're saying you won't associate me with Hoo Joon like last time, right?

50
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:22,640
You were clear about refusing that offer already.

51
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,470
I'm calling you because I heard your show is over.

52
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,060
So please think it over.

53
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,840
All right.

54
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,100
I will.

55
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,650
If I do work, when would I start?

56
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,420
You're here?

57
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,310
You came here at this hour.

58
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,230
Come have a drink.

59
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,030
My goodness...

60
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,196
We once used to...

61
00:04:58,196 --> 00:05:01,520
drink soju together and stuff.

62
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,170
Right?

63
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:08,340
What did you call me over here to talk about?

64
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,000
If it's about Inhyung, let's not.

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,310
I watched everything on TV.

66
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,890
So you know Inhyung went on an audition with your name behind her.

67
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,640
Well, that's that.

68
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,020
Then, do you also know that the journalists are suspicious about your relationship with her?

69
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,430
Actually, it's nothing.

70
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,810
Although it may bother you.

71
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,874
But...

72
00:05:28,874 --> 00:05:32,130
how are you going to explain that?

73
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,430
You won't tell them everything.

74
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,520
You can...

75
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,560
only explain that when all three of us are together.

76
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,220
Right?

77
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,330
What are you talking about?

78
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,450
It's all in the past

79
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:49,100
but it bothered you that I knew about it.

80
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,310
So...

81
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,180
let's all go back

82
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,180
to Shooting Star.

83
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,060
I don't know what you're up to but it won't happen.

84
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,930
So don't do it.

85
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,730
Don't do it?

86
00:06:12,432 --> 00:06:14,952
It's so weird.

87
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,450
I don't know why...

88
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:25,170
I can always sniff out your weaknesses.

89
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,180
That's right.

90
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,320
I like talking to you when you look at me like that.

91
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,960
You think I can never beat you, right?

92
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,660
Okay.

93
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,600
You may think so.

94
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,979
But...

95
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:42,580
I can dirty your name.

96
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,190
Maybe even your whole life.

97
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,576
No.

98
00:06:46,576 --> 00:06:48,400
It's not yours.

99
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,340
Is it the life of someone you love?

100
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,479
I'm just thinking that it's Lee Geunyoung who will have a tough time.

101
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:56,310
What?

102
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,520
You're getting it now?

103
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,979
Which one hurts more?

104
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:04,470
When I was ruining Inhyung or thinking about Lee Geunyoung now?

105
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,390
Are you going to run like before without taking responsibility?

106
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:31,070
Talk it over with Bae.

107
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,970
It's late, what's going on?

108
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,979
Was it because of Lee Geunyoung that you stopped the show?

109
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,720
What are you talking about?

110
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,430
Now that you got some info.

111
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,890
You're trying to side with Jaejoon now?

112
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,520
Who's siding with who?

113
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,079
Did that bastard come to you?

114
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:12,680
It's...

115
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,810
that he was trying to make you and Geunyoung an issue,

116
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,310
so we had to put the fire out first.

117
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,979
Then you should've...!

118
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:21,430
talked with me first.

119
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:25,380
Have you been working on your communication skills or something? What is there to discuss?

120
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,180
- Youngseok— 
 -  And you too. 

121
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,930
 I'm not telling you that you can't date. 

122
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,770
Think about how you came this far.

123
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,246
A scandal now won't be good.

124
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,350
 You don't want to sing? 

125
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,640
You don't want to be on stage?

126
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,770
All those fans that look up to just you,

127
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,380
 are you willing to throw them away? 

128
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,879
Just hold out for awhile.

129
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:47,220
I'll take care of Jaejoon.

130
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,770
Who do you think will have a harder time when Jaejoon exposes you and Geunyoung?

131
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:57,000
Staying put and letting it pass is probably how you can protect her right now.

132
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,310
This is the application for your pass.

133
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,390
Just your address and phone number, please.

134
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,320
Oh, yes.

135
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,020
My house address...

136
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,270
This is the person who's moving in today.

137
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,600
Yes, hello.

138
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,379
Can I get the exact address?

139
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:05,240
You look... cute today.

140
00:10:12,562 --> 00:10:15,271
   

141
00:10:15,271 --> 00:10:16,890
   

142
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:21,890
   

143
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:32,008
The reason for the show's cancellation is his busy schedule?

144
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:35,379
They're giving him lots of work to try and prove that.

145
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,970
The show is over. Why is there no talk of a merger?

146
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,220
Freaking autobiographies...

147
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,520
God, it's annoying.

148
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,772
 Your delivery is here. 

149
00:10:48,772 --> 00:10:49,979
Delivery?

150
00:10:49,979 --> 00:10:52,370
 Yes, I think it's a TV. You're Lee Geunyoung, right? 

151
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,200
Yes.

152
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,110
 It's from Kim Yama. 

153
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,740
Just a moment!

154
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,530
Where do you want me to put this?

155
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:11,280
Right here.

156
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,270
Here.

157
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,690
- Yes. 
 - Just leave it there.

158
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,410
By the way, is the real thing better looking?

159
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,670
What the heck?

160
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,790
You said you couldn't come because of an early morning schedule!

161
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,390
I should come. You're moving in today.

162
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,110
Is it here?

163
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,060
How is it?

164
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,330
I like it.

165
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:37,080
Why did you buy a TV for me?

166
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,124
I'm always on TV.

167
00:11:40,124 --> 00:11:42,230
You should have a TV.

168
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,280
It's expensive.

169
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,790
By the way, do you have to live alone?

170
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,300
I tried to stop you but you wanted to move out.

171
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,030
The show is over.

172
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,560
I don't think I should keep living there.

173
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,670
Why not? No one lives in that big house.

174
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,170
Of course, living in that big house

175
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,980
made me realize how comfortable it is to live off someone else.

176
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,080
Still, I'm not that shameless.

177
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,614
But still,

178
00:12:06,614 --> 00:12:10,140
I feel worried thinking that you're a woman living alone.

179
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,760
I may be an intern, but I still got a job now.

180
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,180
I should live my life.

181
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,510
You're awesome, Geunyoung.

182
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,020
Hello, Hoo Joon.

183
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:26,060
You've finished shooting "So I Married the Anti-Fan" recently.

184
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,218
 How was your first variety show? 

185
00:12:29,218 --> 00:12:33,790
First of all, I'm sad that the show kind of came to an abrupt stop.

186
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,640
I couldn't continue it due to the world tour I have planned,

187
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,750
but doing it was an amazing experience for me.

188
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:46,370
 The concept of the show was bold and new 

189
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:50,579
 or even dangerous, considering it was your first variety show. 

190
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:53,140
My fans might think so.

191
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,620
But it wasn't dangerous at all.

192
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,450
I made many memories filming it.

193
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,379
It was a good experience.

194
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,680
 You're back to your original self now. 

195
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,310
 When can we hear your new song? 

196
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,460
I'm continuing to work on my album.

197
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,430
And the movie I shot is being released soon.

198
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,920
Please look forward to it.

199
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,360
Gyeongmi, how do I print?

200
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,130
Oh, you have to get the company ID.

201
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,620
If you give me your laptop, I'll get it done in the tech department.

202
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,210
Oh, okay.

203
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,590
- You can take it. I unlocked it for you. 
 - Yes.

204
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:06,360
It's this file. Thank you.

205
00:14:32,842 --> 00:14:33,710
Pretty tiring, right?

206
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,879
No, sir.

207
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:36,800
I'll keep doing my best.

208
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,370
Okay.

209
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,462
It's the semi-final already.

210
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,460
Starting this week, it's a live broadcast.

211
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,570
- So you have to be perfect. 
 - Okay.

212
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:45,875
Do your best.

213
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:47,890
Oh.

214
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,310
About Hoo Joon.

215
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:53,120
Can you ask him to come backstage at least during the live broadcast?

216
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,180
Maybe to cheer for you?

217
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,324
Yes.

218
00:14:57,324 --> 00:14:59,020
Let me ask him.

219
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,730
- Please do. 
 - Okay.

220
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,979
   

221
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:17,230
Is the premier over?

222
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,750
 I'll go right away after the premier. 

223
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,160
   

224
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,730
   

225
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,300
 In the notebook of top star Who Joon's anti-fan, Lee Geun-young, 

226
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:43,350
 revelations of his duplicity were revealed, including dates and events. 

227
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:47,050
 And the relationship between him and a woman was revealed, 

228
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,770
 creating a significant stir. 

229
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:54,090
 Evidence of Who Joon's violence against the woman is becoming an issue. 

230
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:58,600
 According to the file, Who Joon was violent with the woman. 

231
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,740
 It is assumed that he met the woman several times even after the violence. 

232
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,540
Was there a lot of tension between you and Lee Geunyoung while shooting?

233
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,920
Was the discord between you the reason for its cancellation?

234
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,430
You must've not seen the news yet.

235
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,790
Lee Geunyoung revealed a document that exposes your duplicity.

236
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,600
Please answer.

237
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,420
What are they talking about?

238
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,390
Who Joon.

239
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,960
I'm sorry.

240
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,930
Lee Geunyoung!

241
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,250
How long have you been preparing the file?

242
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,110
Is there more to reveal?

243
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,750
Was the show related to these revelations?

244
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,220
Was it to get a job at Super Patch?

245
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:44,979
Super Patch?

246
00:16:44,979 --> 00:16:48,460
- Was it not your laptop? 
 - Say something, please.

247
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,770
Excuse me.

248
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:55,450
 Lee Geunyoung!  Lee Geunyoung! 

249
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,335
We'll respond publicly soon.

250
00:16:57,335 --> 00:16:59,265
We ask for privacy for the rest of the day.

251
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,480
It's crazy out there.

252
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,060
 Who Joon! 

253
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:21,470
Jihyang,

254
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,280
I think I should go to Geunyoung.

255
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,179
Journalists are there, too.

256
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,668
As well as at our company and your place.

257
00:17:27,668 --> 00:17:29,470
Let's go to the penthouse first.

258
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,590
Why didn't you pick up?

259
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:36,070
My battery died.

260
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,750
How could you let it...

261
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,180
Are you okay, Geunyoung?

262
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,330
Of course not.

263
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,040
What are they all saying?

264
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,900
You didn't see the article?

265
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:48,860
I think Super Patch got into your laptop.

266
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:54,270
How do they all know about it?

267
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,270
 You can take it. I unlocked it for you. 

268
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,660
 This file. 

269
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,620
 Thank you. 

270
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,090
Can we sue them for defamation?

271
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,679
Where's my guy with legal knowledge right now?

272
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:21,520
You should call Hoo Joon.

273
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,220
I mean.

274
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:31,320
Tell him you didn't do it and it's all a misunderstanding.

275
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,766
But...

276
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:38,680
it's true that I wrote it.

277
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,210
Why did you save it there?

278
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:43,370
Go Soohwan! Who are you blaming right now?

279
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:46,240
I'm frustrated, too!

280
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,700
   

281
00:19:04,979 --> 00:19:06,574
Mr. Bae.

282
00:19:06,574 --> 00:19:08,390
What about the merger?

283
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,770
Why do you ignore—

284
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:12,720
 Hey! Joon and Lee Geunyoung are what? 

285
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,720
In a relationship?

286
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,320
But Lee Geunyoung exposes him like this?

287
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,270
What?

288
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:21,030
 I was crazy to believe someone like you. 

289
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,640
 [Who Joon, What is contained in the duplicity file? 

290
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,458
A bastard like you...

291
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,890
If you wanted to make an offer,

292
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,650
 you should've checked the facts! 

293
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:41,597
 I need to recharge my battery. 

294
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,318
 Hurry and go. 

295
00:19:44,318 --> 00:19:45,870
 Bye. 

296
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,479
Those eyes...

297
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,930
It can't be...

298
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,079
Good job. You did well.

299
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:10,970
Huh?

300
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,560
Didn't I tell you to be wary of her?

301
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,620
Huh?

302
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,180
What did you say Jihyang?

303
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,820
She's earned our trust?

304
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,079
I'll check again.

305
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:22,020
Check what?

306
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,120
It's all on her laptop.

307
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,420
Maybe I'm old and don't have it anymore.

308
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,290
I should've crushed that anti-fan from the beginning.

309
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,220
There's no way she revealed it.

310
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,020
Somebody must've seen her laptop.

311
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,470
You know we had a rough start.

312
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,720
Why do you think they tell top stars to be careful all the time?

313
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,970
Did I or did I not tell you everyone around you is trying to stab you in the back?

314
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,770
Whether it's true or not,

315
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,720
an article that has exploded has created the image of that star.

316
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,946
Stay out of it. It's better for you to not meet the journalists.

317
00:20:51,946 --> 00:20:53,710
The article is out already.

318
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:57,470
If you lay low, it'll die down.

319
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:01,870
What are you doing?

320
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:04,080
We don't even know what kind of situation we're in.

321
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,040
What if the call gets recorded? What will you do?

322
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,550
What are you doing right now?

323
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,730
Give it.

324
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,684
You can take care of it?

325
00:21:11,684 --> 00:21:12,960
I will.

326
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,550
Trust me.

327
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,440
   

328
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,220
 Your call has been forwarded... 

329
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:22,100
You think he'll see you, even if you go?

330
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:27,120
I knew it wasn't you.

331
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,100
Sounds like you're disappointed?

332
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,890
The file though...

333
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,570
I did write it.

334
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,210
As you know,

335
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:39,446
I hated Hoo Joon at one point.

336
00:22:39,446 --> 00:22:41,225
Sounds like...

337
00:22:41,225 --> 00:22:44,720
you completely forgot about that time.

338
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:49,440
He was the one who gave Geunyoung water while pretending not to be in the media.

339
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,910
Yes. I once...

340
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,935
thought that he was two-faced.

341
00:22:55,935 --> 00:22:57,395
Now...

342
00:22:58,957 --> 00:23:04,157
I think I have some idea of what kind of person he is.

343
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,608
What kind of powers does he have...?

344
00:23:08,608 --> 00:23:10,494
After all that happened to you,

345
00:23:10,494 --> 00:23:12,730
you trust him?

346
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:18,700
Let's just say that trust has been built between us.

347
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,320
I see.

348
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:26,390
Do you think he thinks so, too?

349
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,225
I don't care what he thinks about me right now.

350
00:23:32,225 --> 00:23:34,540
If there's a misunderstanding...

351
00:23:35,379 --> 00:23:38,540
He's probably hurt because he feels betrayed.

352
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:42,320
I should be explaining and apologizing.

353
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,030
Geunyoung.

354
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,460
Geunyoung.

355
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,420
You must like him a lot.

356
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,970
That's love, right?

357
00:24:02,087 --> 00:24:03,120
I saw.

358
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,360
You two together.

359
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,610
Let's go.

360
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,070
That guy must be here.

361
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,320
The reporters have already laid themselves out in front of his house.

362
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,110
Jaejoon.

363
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:42,670
I'm not trying to help you.

364
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:47,120
This time...

365
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,860
I will watch how he...

366
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,650
protects you.

367
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,490
But...

368
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,180
do you know Inhyung did this, too?

369
00:25:04,225 --> 00:25:08,425
He was irresponsible and couldn't protect her.

370
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:15,979
I'm saying this because I don't want you to end up like her.

371
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:22,790
But Jaejoon.

372
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,580
It isn't love...

373
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:33,720
if you want to protect the person just because you feel responsible.

374
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:39,800
I hope you will realize that Jaejoon.

375
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,750
 Inhyung and Geunyoung... 

376
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,910
 Both of you... 

377
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,190
 can't see my sincerity? 

378
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:41,190
- He left? 
 - Yeah.

379
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:43,042
My phone, please.

380
00:26:43,042 --> 00:26:44,950
He took it with him.

381
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,180
I'm not a kid. Is he crazy?

382
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,730
It's not like you don't know his temper.

383
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,930
I can't help it.

384
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:55,630
- Let me go see her. 
 - Joon.

385
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,140
Not today.

386
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,350
The article with all that groundless stuff will be out tomorrow.

387
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,080
Let's go after it dies down.

388
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,300
Okay?

389
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,179
I know it's tough for you.

390
00:27:05,179 --> 00:27:07,710
Please do it for me.

391
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:19,430
I didn't release it.

392
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,102
Lee Geunyoung,

393
00:27:22,102 --> 00:27:24,430
but it's true that you wrote it yourself.

394
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:28,170
- A long time ago, I— 
 - Yes.

395
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,879
A long time ago,

396
00:27:29,879 --> 00:27:31,520
you wrote it.

397
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,206
But...

398
00:27:33,206 --> 00:27:36,520
you didn't think how it would affect Joon?

399
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,540
That's why I wanted to apologize in person.

400
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,320
Writing it and not erasing it are both my fault—

401
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,110
You? Meeting Joon?

402
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,096
You're selfish.

403
00:27:49,096 --> 00:27:50,568
That sounds like...

404
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:53,750
you're asking to be excused

405
00:27:53,750 --> 00:28:00,180
while we're going crazy trying to shut the press up.

406
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:04,350
Let me just call him and apologize then.

407
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,720
I'll do it in front of you.

408
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,690
   

409
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:27,710
"Just Geunyoung?"

410
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:36,070
If there's really... some trust between you two,

411
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:40,220
give us time to handle it for Joon.

412
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,880
 Just a little... 

413
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:23,070
 Wait for me just a little. 

414
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,950
   

415
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,650
 Again... 

416
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:41,520
 no on wants to listen to me. 

417
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:56,380
Why come here when I told you to lay low for a while?

418
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:05,470
If you send out an article like this, then what will happen to Geunyoung?

419
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,860
Then what?

420
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,400
How else will we handle it?

421
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,360
Is it because you don't know that just one article can make someone into a fool?

422
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,979
You should've at least told me first.

423
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:18,070
It was urgent. Handling it was the priority.

424
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:22,270
To handle our situation, you want to make someone into a fool?

425
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:28,300
How long do I have to live with the lies by pretending to be a good person and pretending to be someone special?

426
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,960
Do you think it's only you that hates it?

427
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,470
Who am I doing this for?

428
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:36,390
Once the fans turn their back on you...

429
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,650
Well... that's that.

430
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,820
What about your dream as a singer?

431
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,290
Can you give it up?

432
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:49,180
You're going to give up everything just for a girl?

433
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,570
Starting with that woman...

434
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:57,050
I'll live honorably, putting it all down.

435
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,350
Look at this guy.

436
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,520
What?

437
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,679
Did she ask you to?

438
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:11,620
I knew she wasn't a pushover when she talked back to me.

439
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,638
Did you meet her?

440
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:16,390
What did you threaten her with?

441
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,000
Yes.

442
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,220
I told her to stay quiet for you.

443
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,360
So all this time...

444
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:29,770
you took care of everything by threatening people?

445
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:36,274
Listening to you, people may think I'm a con man.

446
00:31:36,274 --> 00:31:40,000
You're attacking me after I made you this famous?

447
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,600
And...

448
00:31:44,979 --> 00:31:49,510
I'm the one who knows everything about you, from top to bottom.

449
00:31:50,462 --> 00:31:52,912
Who do you think you are threatening?

450
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:54,670
Do what you want.

451
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:57,080
I'm not scared of anything.

452
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,790
Youngseok...

453
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:09,530
Since when did you work by exploiting people's weaknesses?

454
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:13,520
To save ourselves, you don't care about hurting others?

455
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,550
Do you think I'm doing this... for myself?

456
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:20,079
I'm doing it all for you.

457
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:22,490
Nothing's wrong.

458
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,220
Okay.

459
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,490
It's all because of me.

460
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:33,380
This girl doesn't say a single word because she's worried I have it tougher.

461
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,460
Yet you're not even sorry to me.

462
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,830
You just lie again to get us through it.

463
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:45,320
At least the Youngseok I used to know...

464
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,335
 You saw the people's reaction earlier. 

465
00:32:48,335 --> 00:32:49,420
 Mr. Song. 

466
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:52,860
 Please have another look at Joon. 

467
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,264
 Bae. 

468
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,250
 There's a truck full of these guys. 

469
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:59,500
 Stop following me around. 

470
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,350
 This is nothing important. Don't worry. 

471
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,270
 Sir. 

472
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,879
 Oh, hey. 

473
00:33:15,879 --> 00:33:16,960
 Great job. 

474
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,320
 The CEO of the station wants you so bad. 

475
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,400
 Hungry? 

476
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,430
 Let's see. 

477
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,870
 I don't have much cash. I only have 10,000 won. 

478
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,420
 Go eat something. 

479
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,570
 What about you? 

480
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:34,779
 I have someone to meet. 

481
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:38,210
 I'm so busy because of you right now that I could die. 

482
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:42,510
 And I get full just by watching you get big. 

483
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:46,016
 - I'll call you after the meeting. 
 - Okay. 

484
00:33:46,016 --> 00:33:48,306
 See you later. 

485
00:33:48,306 --> 00:33:50,279
 Producer. 

486
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,690
 Oh goodness!  Producer! 

487
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:03,560
You were innocent and a good man.

488
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,000
I told myself you were lying for me.

489
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,862
That you wouldn't do it next time...

490
00:34:07,862 --> 00:34:12,340
That it must be hard on you, too... I felt so sorry inside.

491
00:34:13,597 --> 00:34:17,479
But looking at it now, it wasn't for me.

492
00:34:17,479 --> 00:34:18,890
It was for you.

493
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,900
For me?

494
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,620
It was for us.

495
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,732
Yes.

496
00:34:23,732 --> 00:34:26,580
For our trust in one another.

497
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,770
Youngseok,

498
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:35,679
you talked about re-signing last time?

499
00:34:39,979 --> 00:34:41,770
Okay.

500
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,538
What do you want?

501
00:34:44,538 --> 00:34:47,500
Tell me your conditions.

502
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,480
I... won't re-sign with you.

503
00:34:53,181 --> 00:34:55,591
Bye.

504
00:34:55,591 --> 00:34:57,420
Joon.

505
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,400
It's not the contract that's over between you and me...

506
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,430
It's our relationship as people that's over.

507
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,330
Joon.

508
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,179
You sure won't regret it?

509
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,800
Jihyang,

510
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,020
I'm exhausted.

511
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:49,732
I wish that at least you... could be by my side.

512
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:55,000
Yes.

513
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,970
I ended it with him, too.

514
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,455
A correction will be put out.

515
00:36:25,455 --> 00:36:27,190
Let's meet with Reporter Choi to talk details.

516
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,470
And...

517
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,560
you should call her.

518
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:35,050
You got this, too?

519
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:35,870
Thank you.

520
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,710
I will leave it up to you!

521
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:00,290
Why didn't you pick up yesterday?

522
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,340
I'm...

523
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,500
I'm so sorry.

524
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,750
Sorry for what? I'm more sorry.

525
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,040
Don't worry.

526
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,140
I'll handle it.

527
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,990
Okay, get some rest.

528
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:33,970
   

529
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:46,560
How is Bae handling things?

530
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,710
- You're here. 
 - Yes.

531
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,790
I looked into it.

532
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:59,640
They also got the photo.

533
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,246
It's a photo of the ring's owner.

534
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:04,770
Who on earth is he trying to find?

535
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:11,672
You know the lawyer you told me to look into?

536
00:38:11,672 --> 00:38:14,110
I got a photo of him when he was young.

537
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,970
I think they're the same person.

538
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,560
What?

539
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,770
A correction is published!

540
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:28,110
I told you Geunyoung would never do that.

541
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,520
That's a relief.

542
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,640
Then is Geunyoung why he left the agency?

543
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,120
That's what I'm saying.

544
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,279
What's happening?

545
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,220
What is this now?

546
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,120
Then should I write that there was no truth to the story

547
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,960
after WhoJoon's side checked with Lee Geunyoung directly?

548
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,360
- Thank you. 
 - Don't mention it.

549
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,840
Joon, wait.

550
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:01,970
I think something... is wrong.

551
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:03,172
A call...

552
00:39:03,172 --> 00:39:04,430
Yes, Mr. Kim.

553
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:06,220
Yes.

554
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:15,640
"Public outrage that Who Joon fooled people?"

555
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:19,040
"Recently, Oh Inhyung, who used to be at the same agency,

556
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,500
was found to be Who Joon's first love.

557
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:25,840
The unscrupulous past of Who Joon who abandoned his first love for success has been revealed."

558
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,520
Let me see.

559
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:32,900
"Not only that, for Hoojun to succeed, his age, hometown, academic background, and all his past were revealed to be lies,

560
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:37,420
and public opinion is outraged as it became known that he had lived with a fabricated image."

561
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,880
What's happening now?

562
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:45,540
   

563
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:50,570
He was more two-faced than I thought.

564
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,940
You think you can still be honorable?

565
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,750
What more are you hiding?

566
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:03,610
Is there more to be revealed?

567
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:12,020
It's done now.

568
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,310
The owner of the ring—

569
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:16,000
 About the person looking for the ring, 

570
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,479
they say it seems as if he was looking for his father.

571
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:22,070
Father?

572
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,468
 Yes. 

573
00:40:23,468 --> 00:40:26,510
 Then the ring.... 

574
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:33,520
I still have... something for you.

575
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:38,777
Please look for info on... his family.

576
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,810
You too...

577
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,590
Thanks, Reporter Choi.

578
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:51,056
Good job.

579
00:40:51,056 --> 00:40:52,588
Yes.

580
00:40:52,588 --> 00:40:54,640
Okay. Bye.

581
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,020
According to Reporter Choi, it was anonymous.

582
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,230
It's obvious.

583
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,830
Can it be none other than Jaejoon?

584
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:04,797
No.

585
00:41:04,797 --> 00:41:06,520
It's probably not him.

586
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,375
You still don't know after being treated like this all this time?

587
00:41:09,375 --> 00:41:10,560
Let me make a call.

588
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,380
Wait a minute.

589
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,270
 I'm on your side. 

590
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:38,560
 You're okay, right? 

591
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:55,860
 Wait for me just a little bit more... 

592
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,779
What are you trying to do?

593
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:19,770
This is heavy, man.

594
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,706
You should know that... it was your last chance.

595
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,060
...it was your last chance.

596
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:27,680
It may be Father's mistake to have given you a chance at all,

597
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,730
Anyway, our agency is finished as of today.

598
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:33,470
I told you I'll handle it.

599
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,379
How?

600
00:42:35,379 --> 00:42:37,680
You're always so shameless.

601
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,678
I thought he gave up on me already?

602
00:42:39,678 --> 00:42:43,210
For someone already he gave up on, does he have to do this to the son he's not proud of?

603
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:45,332
You know Father is like that.

604
00:42:45,332 --> 00:42:50,790
"Business men should know when to abandon what must be."

605
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:54,420
Do you think he doesn't know now's the time to abandon you?

606
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,960
Clear out.

607
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:01,160
Brother!

608
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:09,600
I told you not to call me "brother."

609
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,830
It's not now.

610
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:27,800
Did you and Father both...

611
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,494
abandon me a long time ago?

612
00:43:30,494 --> 00:43:33,220
But...

613
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:36,620
why does it have to be me?

614
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:40,479
Why am I the only abandoned child in the family?

615
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:49,590
   

616
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:53,360
   

617
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,979
   

618
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,330
 What a gold digger. 

619
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:01,330
 This bi*ch must've exposed him. 

620
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:03,000
   

621
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,779
   
   

622
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:09,190
 - Hello!  
 - Keep practicing.

623
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:09,870
Yes.

624
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:11,060
Producer...

625
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,100
You read it?

626
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,934
The public right now... they...

627
00:44:13,934 --> 00:44:17,020
I think this is where you stop and get off.

628
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:17,980
Huh?

629
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,970
It's crazy outside the station, too.

630
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:22,040
Who Joon's fans are out there.

631
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:26,540
At this rate... broadcasting live isn't possible.

632
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:27,832
Sir.

633
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:30,730
Please give me one more chance.

634
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,070
You'll have chances elsewhere.

635
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,940
We appreciate your hard work till now.

636
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:37,312
Keep practicing!

637
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:39,700
 Goodbye. 

638
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:52,370
 ♫ Please don't leave me ♫ 

639

 ♫ I'm just a small kid ♫

650
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:21,580
Not gonna ask why I did it?

651
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:26,090
Everyone... thinks it's me.

652
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:31,250
I'm not here to ask you that.

653
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:37,960
But looking at you... I don't think it was you.

654
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,370
Good thing at least you know.

655
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:53,530
I... didn't know everything about Joon.

656
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:56,140
I didn't know him at all.

657
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,070
Jaejoon,

658
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:05,679
even now... are you trying to say that he's always been like that?

659
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:16,990
I know I've disappointed you.

660
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:20,914
I won't make excuses.

661
00:47:20,914 --> 00:47:26,301
About Inhyung... or about things with Joon.

662
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:30,522
I didn't want Inhyung to get hurt.

663
00:47:30,522 --> 00:47:32,048
Or rather...

664
00:47:32,048 --> 00:47:38,538
I hated Inhyung because... she trusted Joon when she knew he'd hurt her.

665
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,710
I was so jealous of him.

666
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:45,095
Everyone I knew first,

667
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:48,170
and the opportunities that would've come to me,

668
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:51,270
but he took them all.

669
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:54,180
So I hated him like crazy.

670
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,250
You didn't actually mean it though.

671
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,030
No.

672
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:02,220
I hate him even now.

673
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,620
He's like that.

674
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:07,590
Even now, Inhyung's getting hurt.

675
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:12,350
There's nothing I can do.

676
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,580
It's all over now.

677
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:20,779
What do you mean...?

678
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:25,214
You and I... had a great start.

679
00:48:25,214 --> 00:48:26,854
We hit it off.

680
00:48:26,854 --> 00:48:31,370
You were the only person to whom I could freely say Joon's a jerk.

681
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:34,170
For a short time.

682
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:41,580
But now, it'll be difficult to be together with them.

683
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,590
Like Inhyung.

684
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,080
Now that I say it,

685
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:54,420
I've become a jerk to everyone I like.

686
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,370
Jaejoon.

687
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:59,920
You're not that much of a jerk to me.

688
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:12,540
You should've told me sooner.

689
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:16,960
What you're saying right now...

690
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:21,960
only sounds like you're consoling me, someone rebelling against the world.

691
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,570
Thanks for coming.

692
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:55,579
Aren't you in a situation that you can't even go anywhere anyway?

693
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:04,370
We finally drink soju together.

694
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:09,410
I thought you'd throw a punch.

695
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:11,410
I'm surprised.

696
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:13,746
You didn't think it was me?

697
00:50:13,746 --> 00:50:16,370
I knew it wasn't you.

698
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:18,310
I wasn't...

699
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:22,120
all that honest to you.

700
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:27,878
This is why I don't like you.

701
00:50:27,878 --> 00:50:31,920
Just like you're the only one holding back and the only one worrying.

702
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,460
Well...

703
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:36,670
I was so surprised, too.

704
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:40,940
Fooling everyone with that look on your face.

705
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,702
I hated myself for it, too.

706
00:50:49,702 --> 00:50:54,640
I also regret not being honest with you.

707
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,290
There's no need now.

708
00:50:57,290 --> 00:51:02,008
I don't want to... make up for what's happened in the past.

709
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,310
Do you hate me that much?

710
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:07,990
There's a saying.

711
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:10,379
"Sometimes you just hate a person for no reason."

712
00:51:10,379 --> 00:51:13,130
It wasn't like this at first.

713
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:18,730
Look here.

714
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:20,970
You started all this.

715
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:25,179
If you chose me then,

716
00:51:25,179 --> 00:51:28,700
if you didn't abandon Inhyung, if you didn't live a fake life—

717
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,430
So what?

718
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:35,244
Does hating my guts make you... feel better?

719
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:54,560
I didn't tell you one thing yet.

720
00:51:57,537 --> 00:52:00,330
That ring...

721
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:03,840
I found the owner.

722
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:07,956
What else are you hiding? Huh?

723
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,960
It's my father's.

724
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:30,730
Your father abandoned you, too?

725
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:33,778
Where do your lies end?

726
00:52:33,778 --> 00:52:35,379
Jaejoon.

727
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:43,479
 The fact that he has everything... made me feel less guilty. 

728
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:49,000
Let's...

729
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:53,270
put it all behind us.

730
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,670
It's him.

731
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:20,320
Your father.

732
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:35,290
   

733
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:02,130
 How is it? 

734
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:05,380
-  You can handle it?  
 - It was you?

735
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:08,140
 It's my talent. 

736
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:09,780
 Come back to me. 

737
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:13,730
 I guess you can hold out still. 

738
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:15,779
So it was you.

739
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,360
I felt so sorry because...

740
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:22,860
I felt like I abandoned you.

741
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:32,879
Now I... know what to do.

742
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:17,480
Joon.

743
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,680
Are you going to be okay?

744
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,960
It's how I can protect the ones I love.

745
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,420
Inhyung, Jaejoon,

746
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,560
and most of all,

747
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:34,040
Geunyoung, who's suffering just because she loves me.

748
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:37,220
All right. Let's go.

749
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:01,690
Did you have to do it?

750
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,730
Why do you think it's me?

751
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,390
Because you're that type of person.

752
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:33,370
Why act so righteous in front of me?

753
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:37,292
At least Joon and I...

754
00:56:37,292 --> 00:56:41,070
are not cowards like you.

755
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:43,370
Coward?

756
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:46,750
Joon isn't a coward? He left you behind.

757
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,779
What about you who came to me even when you like Joon?

758
00:56:49,779 --> 00:56:53,520
So why did you come into my life?

759
00:56:54,830 --> 00:56:57,060
Why? Why!

760
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:00,379
Why did you come into my life!

761
00:57:10,850 --> 00:57:14,460
   

762
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:19,370
 I came here today... 

763
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:23,670
 because I wanted to sincerely apologize to everyone from the bottom of my heart. 

764
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:29,779
 I was always received love and I didn't deserve it. 

765
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:33,724
I'm not the special someone you thought I was.

766
00:57:33,724 --> 00:57:37,390
I didn't attend an elite music school in the States,

767
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:41,060
nor am I from a wealthy family that did charitable work frequently.

768
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:44,170
All those beautifully packaged words about me,

769
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:49,310
were all lies to fabricate a special Who Joon image.

770
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:58,490
 The fact that I lied to everyone who has always loved me sincerely, 

771
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:02,730
I sincerely apologize for it.

772
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:10,579
If it wasn't for you...

773
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:21,520
It's all over now.

774
00:58:26,627 --> 00:58:30,020
You know better than anyone...

775
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:34,080
how desperate I was.

776
00:58:36,853 --> 00:58:42,540
Now that I have failed, are you happy?

777
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,620
Let's stop this.

778
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:55,679
I'll disappear out of your life.

779
00:58:58,270 --> 00:59:00,060
No.

780
00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:05,379
I won't trust a word you say now.

781
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:08,140
How about this?

782
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:16,810
Inhyung.

783
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:23,180
And about my relationship with Oh Inhyung, which everyone's curious about...

784
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:26,120
It's true we had a special relationship.

785
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:30,079
 And she is... 

786
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:34,700
suffering from the many misunderstandings and rumors that she used me for success.

787
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:40,579
I hope that Oh Inhyung will not be harmed by me through any further false assumptions and rumors.

788
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:45,800
I've come a long way with the wings that lies have given me.

789
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,560
But at some point,

790
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:51,916
I realized I can't go back with those wings.

791
00:59:51,916 --> 00:59:53,980
As of today, I acknowledge everything.

792
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:59,350
And I'll wait... to humbly accept all punishment.

793
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:09,050


794
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:14,340
♫   I'm your Pop Star  ♫

795
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:18,930
♫  Oh yeah, eh  ♫

796
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:26,000
♫  Remember, I'm always your one and only one  ♫

797
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,212
 Have you heard about JJ and Oh Inhyung's accident? 

798
01:00:28,212 --> 01:00:29,404
 She tried to kill herself. 

799
01:00:29,404 --> 01:00:30,654
 They're both unconscious. 

800
01:00:30,654 --> 01:00:31,829
 His condition is serious. 

801
01:00:31,829 --> 01:00:34,071
 I'm sorry but can you wait for me? 

802
01:00:34,071 --> 01:00:37,362
 It's not a problem of public opinion, it's about your image. 

803
01:00:37,362 --> 01:00:39,521
 He's having such a hard time. 

804
01:00:39,521 --> 01:00:41,379
 What am I doing? 

805
01:00:41,379 --> 01:00:42,212
 I'm sorry. 

806
01:00:42,212 --> 01:00:43,587
 I can't see you today. 

807
01:00:43,587 --> 01:00:45,962
 I found my father today. 

808
01:00:45,962 --> 01:00:48,004
 I don't know if it's the ring you're looking for. 

809
01:00:48,004 --> 01:00:49,379
 What is this? 

810
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:51,612
 My gift for you, Geunyoung. 

811
01:00:51,612 --> 01:00:53,170
 I miss you. 

812
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:56,260
♫  On that street you walked alone, in your evening sky with no stars   ♫

813
01:00:56,260 --> 01:01:01,187
