3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,220
   

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,930
   

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,720
   

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,720
   

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,890
   

8
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:51,640
   
   

9
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,890
So if by chance,

10
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,680
your first love popped back into your life?

11
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,190
 No! No! 

12
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,470
   

13
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,940
If that was the case...

14
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:41,890
What would I do?

15
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,979
I'm not one to think about things that haven't happened yet.

16
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,810
So I haven't been able to prepare for this question either.

17
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,100
- So. 
 - Wow.

18
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,700
Sounds like you're deflecting?

19
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:55,360
But done with class.

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,970
So then, let's go back to your debut.

21
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:03,270
It could be said that you appeared suddenly like a comet.

22
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,940
Do you remember your first show?

23
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:16,520
Why are you running?

24
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,880
Why do you run away when he's up there smiling as if nothing happened?

25
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,900
You think I'm crazy, too?

26
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,090
Should I have raised my hand and told him his first love was here?

27
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,264
Or...

28
00:02:33,264 --> 00:02:36,470
just tell me it's me you want to run away from.

29
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,864
What?

30
00:02:37,864 --> 00:02:41,930
So now that Hoo Joon has someone else,

31
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,720
you want to get rid of me?

32
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,620
- What? 
 - I've had enough,

33
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,720
so just let me go.

34
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,970
I got it, so stop looking at me.

35
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,079
Are you talking to me?

36
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,790
Good job up there.

37
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,390
He's really good on talk shows.

38
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,490
He really got away with that first love question.

39
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,110
But still,

40
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,780
I wonder who it was.

41
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,020
You must be curious as well.

42
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,220
No.

43
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,430
Why are people so interested in others' pasts?

44
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,720
I don't understand.

45
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,250
It's a prejudice.

46
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,440
Hoo Joon's first love somehow seems more special.

47
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,182
Geunyoung,

48
00:03:46,182 --> 00:03:48,350
- have you read "Pride and Prejudice?"
 - Why?

49
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,770
You want me to write a book report?

50
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,440
Come on...

51
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,810
You're the one with prejudice.

52
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,970
I've read it before, actually.

53
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,040
But I gave it another read.

54
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,780
You should, too.

55
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,100
No book report this time.

56
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,320
Anyhow, good job today.

57
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,290
Great work.

58
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,070
   

59
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,560
   

60
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,870
What now?

61
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,170
Let me talk to him. Go wait for me.

62
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,870
I'll be right out front.

63
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,700
Nice work.

64
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,170
It wasn't your usual.

65
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,970
If it were,

66
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,870
you wouldn't have spent so much time caring about me.

67
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,850
What's between you two?

68
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,250
Stop it.

69
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,480
I just said everything there is.

70
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,130
I meant Geunyoung.

71
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,520
What?

72
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,320
We're on a show together and that's it.

73
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,330
A show?

74
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:01,020
So you don't care what I do to her?

75
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,670
Why do I want to take away everything you have?

76
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,330
Good job.

77
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,710
Geunyoung.

78
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,290
I guess I came and watched it in vain.

79
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,360
I made it difficult...

80
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,198
But really...

81
00:05:34,198 --> 00:05:38,240
was the question about first love that uncomfortable?

82
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,379
The way he was speaking, it sounded like it.

83
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:45,379
Because it's our first love, we have to forgive everything that happened.

84
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,174
Should we, though?

85
00:05:48,174 --> 00:05:50,279
 Not because they should be forgiven, 

86
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:53,030
 but because they were our first love... 

87
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,250
The first time is never perfect.

88
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,240
What?

89
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,180
You forgot something?

90
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,250
No, just...

91
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,660
 Why do I want to take away everything you have? 

92
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,140
You surprised me!

93
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,270
Why are you alone?

94
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,140
Oh.

95
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,810
Right!

96
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,930
You didn't even tell him about me?

97
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,970
You never keep your promise yet you want me to trust adults?

98
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:46,420
I never should've trusted you.

99
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:50,040
Joon would never listen to his anti-fan anyways.

100
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,020
Hey.

101
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,640
What do I have to do with him?

102
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,430
Huh?

103
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,430
What do people around him take me for?

104
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,960
I wish I was a lost and found item that nobody tried to find.

105
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,640
Move.

106
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,970
Hey...

107
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,480
Is something wrong?

108
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,020
 Why? 

109
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,060
 So now that Hoo Joon has someone else, 

110
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,790
 you want to get rid of me? 

111
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,520
 What are you looking at? 

112
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,270
 Jaejoon. 

113
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,880
 He looks like a new trainee. 

114
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,590
 You show great aptitude for dancing and have a sense of performing... 

115
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:59,020
â™«  Please don't leave me  â™«

116
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,110
 He's handsome. 

117
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:06,770
â™«  I'm just a little kid  â™«

118
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:13,610
â™«  Do you want to see me heartbroken?  â™«

119
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,270
â™«  I'm just a little kid  â™«

120
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,970
 It was me who was there first. 

121
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,390
 And it was me who liked you first. 

122
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,340
You were...

123
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,570
my first love, too.

124
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,840
â™«  Ah, I'm left alone again  â™«

125
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:47,640
â™«  Where will my lonely heart end?  â™«

126
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,520
Okay.

127
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,600
She's done nothing wrong.

128
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,940
It's tough but annoying...

129
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,640
 Your call has been forwarded to an automated... 

130
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,679
He must be busy.

131
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,346
I should've told him.

132
00:09:20,346 --> 00:09:22,875
But because of that freaking first love question.

133
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,470
 So if by chance, 

134
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:28,820
 your first love popped back into your life? 

135
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,740
But still...

136
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,320
so what if she did come back?

137
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,970
Why couldn't he just answer...

138
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,230
You shouldn't care about that either.

139
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,250
Seriously...

140
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,600
You can't be here.

141
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,770
What do you mean?

142
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,060
I can't even come to my own house?

143
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,720
I should've told you earlier.

144
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,100
A fan of yours is staying with me since yesterday.

145
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,810
She found out that I living and hiding out here.

146
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,770
I was going to send her home yesterday.

147
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,600
But she happens to live in Gimje...

148
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,970
Stop talking.

149
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,340
Take a deep breath.

150
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,520
What do you want to do?

151
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,970
Go home and wait...

152
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,150
Scared me!

153
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,679
So you did tell him.

154
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,520
This is a dream.

155
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,560
Red sun. Red sun

156
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,470
Let's go back to sleep.

157
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,000
What the heck?

158
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:05,090
You're telling me... you found this place after watching the show?

159
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,980
Yes.

160
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,390
It's nothing.

161
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,440
It seems I'll have to dig a tunnel or find a cave to live in now...

162
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,440
No.

163
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,150
I didn't tell anyone about it.

164
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,056
And I won't.

165
00:11:17,056 --> 00:11:19,440
I'm your biggest fan.

166
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,000
A gigantic, authentic, fanatic fan.

167
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,470
What is a "gigantic, authentic, fanatic fan"?

168
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,120
You told me once...

169
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,779
You wanted to marry me when I grew up.

170
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:36,120
What?

171
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,920
Wow. I hate it when celebrities make these crazy promises to fans they'll never keep.

172
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,730
I've never said that.

173
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,956
You did tell me that.

174
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:48,920
I went to one of your performances with my mom,

175
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,530
and after the show you gave me your autograph.

176
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:59,310
I never...

177
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,360
- What? 
 - Wow.

178
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,630
   

179
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:08,210
You did tell her. That's like a promise. Uh oh.

180
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:12,710
Ever since then, I kept it sacred, never washing it.

181
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:16,270
After your debut, I started your Gimje fan club.

182
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,610
I'm now... the regional fan club manager for Jeonbuk province.

183
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,890
So you're a regional manager...

184
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:24,912
Then you must understand...

185
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:29,360
that it's really uncomfortable to be put in this embarrassing situation.

186
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,660
Well, that's...

187
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,300
I'm a huge fan.

188
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,440
I don't go around and spread rumors about you.

189
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,480
Yes. But this will really make him look bad.

190
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,670
So you should go home now.

191
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:47,770
The lost and found thing was just a joke of your dad's.

192
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,230
What are you talking about?

193
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,570
Her dad is stationmaster of Gimje.

194
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:55,779
And he registered her in the lost and found because she ran away.

195
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:57,480
You're a runaway?

196
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,170
Why would you tell him...

197
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:04,520
You're a regional fan club manager. I thought he should know about it.

198
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,720
If you're a runaway you've got to go home, not come here.

199
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,780
I don't know if this is okay.

200
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:23,040
To find this place, she must really be something.

201
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,460
You're worried about me?

202
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,520
No.

203
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,710
I'm worried about my regional manager.

204
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:31,920
If my real fan and my anti-fan stay together, you might taint her.

205
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,500
Don't worry.

206
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,500
I would never taint her.

207
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,730
You just told me not to worry.

208
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,930
That means you're not mad anymore.

209
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,930
I was never mad.

210
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,250
Are you serious? This early?

211
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,520
Get ready to go out.

212
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,710
- Yuri? 
 - Yes.

213
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,140
Good morning.

214
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,210
Yeah, good morning.

215
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,370
Get ready.

216
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,740
Where are we going?

217
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,600
We're all going on a drive.

218
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,020
It's 8:00 in the morning.

219
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,150
Time matters when you're going on a drive with me?

220
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,340
Yuri, get your backpack.

221
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,610
Why? We're just going on a drive.

222
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,940
As a student, you must look really cute with your backpack. I'd love to see it.

223
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,970
- Hurry and come out. 
 - Okay.

224
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,970
Why aren't you getting ready quickly?

225
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,220
8:00...

226
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,210
We'll be there around 11:30.

227
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,170
You drive.

228
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,420
Haven't you seen me drive?

229
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,420
That's why.

230
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,750
You'll only get better by practicing.

231
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,320
You're just too lazy to do it, aren't you?

232
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,570
We're going to be in the backseat together then?

233
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,310
Do your best.

234
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:31,780
By the way, we're really not stopping for any food?

235
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,320
We didn't even have breakfast.

236
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,779
Please be quiet.

237
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:36,060
I have to focus.

238
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:40,379
She was acting so weird last night, I couldn't even ask for dinner.

239
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:42,330
Really?

240
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,370
Yes.

241
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,879
Let's eat something.

242
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:45,890
I'm hungry.

243
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,580
Should we stop at a rest area? A rest area?

244
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,210
I want baked potatoes with a lot of sugar.

245
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,710
I want a corndog with a lot of ketchup.

246
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,620
So I'm buying?

247
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,040
The sugar's there.

248
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,479
Ketchup's fine.

249
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:07,370
Oppa,

250
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:10,120
did you do something wrong to her?

251
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,396
Why? Is that how it seems?

252
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:17,880
She doesn't seem like an actual anti-fan.

253
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,612
She doesn't look like she'd hate someone that much.

254
00:17:21,612 --> 00:17:22,862
Why?

255
00:17:22,862 --> 00:17:26,930
After spending a few days together, has your mind changed?

256
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:29,210
No way.

257
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:31,600
It's just... How do I put it?

258
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,925
She acts like a lost and found object waiting for someone to find her.

259
00:17:36,925 --> 00:17:42,680
But yesterday, she wished she was the lost and found object that no one was looking for?

260
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,770
She said that?

261
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:44,520
Yes.

262
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,520
But it doesn't make sense. All lost items want to be found.

263
00:17:55,179 --> 00:17:55,960
Here.

264
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,650
Help yourself.

265
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,110
Never mind.

266
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,580
Let me drive now.

267
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,560
Why now?

268
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,360
Everyone recognized me in those few seconds.

269
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,020
- This is trouble... 
 - No one's looking. No one!

270
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,420
- No one's looking. 
 - Look at all those faces.

271
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,650
All of them, right, Yuri?

272
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,490
 It's just the dashcams in those cars! 

273
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,979
 They're all going to see me! 

274
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,380
 I don't think it'll be that big of deal. 

275
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,940
She fell asleep as soon as the food was in her body.

276
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,580
Spending a few days with her and now you guys are like sisters.

277
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,470
What?

278
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,979
Sisters?

279
00:18:40,979 --> 00:18:41,920
Big fan.

280
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,810
Anti-fan.

281
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:45,190
Different trajectories in life.

282
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:50,270
   

283
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,760
Is that where we're going?

284
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,370
Yes.

285
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,820
This is...

286
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,680
Oppa!

287
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,370
- Are we going to my house? 
 - What?

288
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,540
Oh, look at that!

289
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,770
While we're here, we can drop you off.

290
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,920
I'm not going home.

291
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,000
Then what?

292
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,610
You'll be in the lost and found forever?

293
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,818
I've been abandoned anyways.

294
00:19:17,818 --> 00:19:23,360
You said earlier that all lost items want to be found.

295
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,870
It might feel like your parents don't care,

296
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,100
but it's because they trust you.

297
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,850
You think she'll listen to you?

298
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,570
I know.

299
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,960
You know me well, Oppa.

300
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,520
Give me your phone.

301
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,620
Why?

302
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,620
Calling my parents?

303
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,540
Hand it over.

304
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,020
After you get home today, never run away again.

305
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,520
This is my number.

306
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,530
When you go to college later, find me.

307
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,770
Don't tell me you don't like me then.

308
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:09,020
And by the way, if you leak my number, our relationship ends immediately.

309
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,279
Okay?

310
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:12,960
I'll never let that happen.

311
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,870
Thank you, too, Geunyoung.

312
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,610
Goodbye.

313
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:28,290
Make sure your dad gets un-register's you out of the lost and found.

314
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:35,210
I'll kill you if you flirt with Oppa.

315
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,190
Hey!

316
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,690
That'll never happen.

317
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,770
What is it?

318
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:43,750
- What did she say? 
 - Nothing.

319
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:50,870
   

320
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,220
By the way, where do your parents live?

321
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,930
Why?

322
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,720
You don't really have that Seoul-style look about you.

323
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,550
So, where?

324
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,852
Are you looking down on the countryside right now?

325
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,330
It's a place called Dangjin.

326
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,170
Know it?

327
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,640
Nope.

328
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,060
You're from America. No wonder.

329
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,379
Anyway, it's called Dangjin.

330
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,870
I'm so tired from driving all day.

331
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,580
Wake me up in Seoul.

332
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,880
You drove for less than an hour.

333
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,430
You've got no manners.

334
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,060
Dangjin...

335
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,580
I think we're here.

336
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,040
My arm hurts.

337
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,440
Hey. Lee Geunyoung!

338
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,520
Wake up.

339
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,390
Lee Geunyoung!

340
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,679
We're in Seoul already?

341
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:12,930
Where's your house?

342
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,500
You already know.

343
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,250
Drop me off at the door.

344
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,090
I mean your house in Dangjin.

345
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,030
Dangjin?

346
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:25,510
   

347
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,040
Where are we?

348
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,150
Dangjin, of course.

349
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,610
Why are we in Dangjin?

350
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,720
You're going to my house?

351
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,770
Stop the car here.

352
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:36,610
I'll drive.

353
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:38,150
Take the exit!

354
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,879
We're already here.

355
00:22:39,879 --> 00:22:42,120
I drove for more than an hour.

356
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,679
You're doing your parents wrong if you don't go now.

357
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:47,310
Your mom must be worried, so go see her.

358
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,230
Tell her you're having fun being a star.

359
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:52,170
Why go there all of sudden?

360
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:55,790
If we go now, my parents will be furious. 
  (Literally: my parents will grab the back of their necks) 

361
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,040
You can't handle them.

362
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,879
I was thinking of something I could do for you...

363
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,210
Why is it always no?

364
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,040
Let's go to Seoul now.

365
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,270
I'm really sad.

366
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,830
Let's see...

367
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,170
Moonlight.

368
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:18,070
A guest in the moonlight...

369
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,960
Someone's coming to see us?

370
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,420
Is this it?

371
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,580
- Why are you being so sensitive? 
 - No, wait!

372
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,050
Can't you be quiet? Why are you being...

373
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,932
What is this?

374
00:23:46,932 --> 00:23:49,370
Geunyoung, you little...

375
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,780
- Mom. 
 - Come here.

376
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,520
Mom, I'm sorry.

377
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,620
You!

378
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:57,350
You worry us so much.

379
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,820
Mrs. Jang!  Why, why?

380
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,820
What is this?

381
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:03,920
Who are you to hug my daughter? 
 - Ouch!-

382
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,170
Mom!

383
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:06,920
Hello, Ma'am.

384
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,690
Perhaps you already know me? My name is Hoo Joon.

385
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,179
What the?

386
00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:13,480
You're the one who put her through all the trouble?

387
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:21,500
So this is the famous big shot?

388
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,770
I'm sorry to trouble you.

389
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:34,210
We were in hurry, so although this isn't much...

390
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:37,520
I'll mail you something nicer from Seoul.

391
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:47,300
 (Is there something on my face?) 

392
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,660
You'll melt his face if you keep staring at him.

393
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:55,579
Looking at him in person, I don't know why he's so famous.

394
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,490
She's a tough one.

395
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,840
Does it hurt a lot?

396
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,579
She must've really hated me.

397
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:12,620
Did you see her take a full swing at me?

398
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:16,230
Is she... on a baseball team?

399
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:19,350
Your mom really doesn't know me?

400
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:23,110
Just because you are a Korean star, you think everyone in Korea knows you.

401
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,380
It doesn't make sense.

402
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,820
I polled at the top among people in their 50s, too.

403
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:32,370
It's not easy being you.

404
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,900
You cooked way too much food.

405
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,820
Trying to kill your enemy with kindness?

406
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,450
I don't know what he likes.

407
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:54,680
Nobody hates tteokbokki.

408
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,830
 My mom... 

409
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,020
 used to run a tteokbokki place. 

410
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:04,850
 She said "tteokbokki can never go wrong" and then went bankrupt. 

411
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,870
So this is the famous...

412
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:10,870
Yes. Famous in downtown Dangjin...

413
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,600
Right.

414
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,550
Everyone loves tteokbokki, right?

415
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,170
Sure. Yes.

416
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:21,260
But Geunyoung doesn't like tteokbokki. It's weird.

417
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,190
Don't worry.

418
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,170
He loves tteokbokki. He'll finish it all.

419
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:27,270
Oh. That's good.

420
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:32,100
It color looks so delicious already, right?

421
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:36,640
But I have no idea why my restaurant failed.

422
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,250
So, taste it and give me an objective assessment.

423
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,730
Yes.

424
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,040
Yes.

425
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,170
It's so good.

426
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,390
Come on.

427
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,830
You're really honest.

428
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,640
Yes.

429
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,100
Geunyoung, finish eating and go get your dad

430
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,602
before he buys something and brings it home.

431
00:27:19,602 --> 00:27:22,430
He'll try to buy the moon and the stars at this pace.

432
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,980
He already bought the moon and the stars.

433
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,320
What?

434
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,540
To put it nicely,

435
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:33,640
when you go to the moon, you'll have your own piece of land.

436
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,330
Man, this...

437
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,080
It's so nice and spicy.

438
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,879
Cook some more. He needs more.

439
00:27:44,879 --> 00:27:45,870
Should I?

440
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,440
He loves tteokbokki.

441
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:54,540
I don't know when I last walked so comfortably.

442
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:56,640
I know.

443
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,812
After meeting you, I was always running.

444
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:03,738
That's because you get yourself in trouble.

445
00:28:03,738 --> 00:28:05,540
No, I don't.

446
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:08,480
You're the one always thinking weird things.

447
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,820
Weird?

448
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,040
If it's...

449
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,090
because of that day, it was a misunderstanding.

450
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:15,170
Never mind.

451
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,550
I forgot about it.

452
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,900
What are you doing? We're running again?

453
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,520
No. Nobody's around so let's just walk.

454
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,880
You're crazy.

455
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,050
There are watchful eyes. Haven't you lived in the countryside?

456
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,920
Wait for me.

457
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,110
Is this okay?

458
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,280
 It doesn't mean farming for a year was in vain. 

459
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,560
 That's what I'm saying. 

460
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,990
 How frustrating it will be.  And you? 

461
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:56,260
 Me, too. 

462
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:00,310
 You should run in the election next year. 

463
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,440
Me?

464
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,875
Dad.

465
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,750
Hello, guys.

466
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,830
It's Geunyoung!

467
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:10,079
Is that your boyfriend?

468
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,370
No.

469
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:12,250
Hello.

470
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,540
Wait.

471
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:17,000
Isn't that the bastard on the TV?

472
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,740
Yes, I am.

473
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,579
Hello.

474
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:22,140
Today's the day you die.

475
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,630
No, Dad!

476
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:26,370
Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!

477
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,160
No!

478
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,520
- Dad! 
 -There's been a misunderstanding! Calm down!

479
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,290
Calm down? I have such high blood pressure because of you now.

480
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,960
I can't calm down.

481
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,650
- Mr. Lee, please stop! 
 - Let him go.

482
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,090
Let him go!

483
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,280
What are you two doing?

484
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,770
Get away from each other!

485
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:40,870
Fine.

486
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:41,920
Lee Geunyoung...

487
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,210
Lee Geunyoung, wait.

488
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,830
I won't let you go, you punk!

489
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,230
Calm down, Mr. Lee!  Why are you like this?

490
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,190
Hold on...

491
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,670
It's him right?

492
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:55,610
He's the one from the TV.

493
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:57,350
Yes, I am.

494
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,310
It's him!

495
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:02,060
You look so much more handsome in person.

496
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,220
Hello.

497
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:08,830
What brings you all the way here?

498
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:09,879
You okay?

499
00:30:09,879 --> 00:30:12,230
I'm all right.

500
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:14,960
Mr. Lee, my goodness!  Please stop!

501
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,220
Are you okay?

502
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,620
Sure. It's out of love.

503
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,790
- Take a drink. 
 - Yes.

504
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:23,120
I heard you were so famous.

505
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,290
He's a top star.

506
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:28,510
He's a singer.

507
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,610
Let me pour you a drink, sir.

508
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:36,920
Come on, Dad.

509
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,170
You may never get another chance.

510
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,920
He's famous singer.

511
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:54,320
If you make Geunyoung cry, I'll pluck your eyes out.

512
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,520
I'll keep that in mind.

513
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,680
By the way,

514
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:03,710
I don't know why they keep showing you as a bad person on TV.

515
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,210
She's so polite.

516
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:07,420
And she's good at running errands.

517
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:12,440
Before she was 25, she was the most wanted daughter-in-law in our village.

518
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,730
That's right.

519
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:16,474
Before she was twenty-five.

520
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:18,370
Then I'm not anymore?

521
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:20,370
Never mind.

522
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:26,660
People may be criticizing you now, but they'll acknowledge you one day.

523
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,080
We'll be waiting.

524
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,490
Geunyoung is not the type to disappoint.

525
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,580
That really cheers me up.

526
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,740
Let me pour you a drink.

527
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,750
Sure.

528
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,520
That's good.

529
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,320
I'll pour one for you too.

530
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,390
You can still see so many stars here.

531
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:51,820
You know that one of them is mine.

532
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,500
One of them is yours.

533
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,050
Really? Mine too?

534
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,170
Yes.

535
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:59,979
It's small yet so bright.

536
00:31:59,979 --> 00:32:02,530
That one's yours.

537
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:07,170
You may be gullible, but you're so romantic.

538
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,980
Stop buying stuff.

539
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,540
You're stressing Mom out.

540
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,230
I know.

541
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:15,720
Your mom will go crazy if she finds out I bought a star.

542
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,060
It's a secret.

543
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:22,560
I told her by accident earlier.

544
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,460
What?

545
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,320
I should sell it again.

546
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,690
You.

547
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:30,390
Yes.

548
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,790
Give me a piggyback ride.

549
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,720
Sorry?

550
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,320
Give me a piggyback ride.

551
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,100
Here.

552
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,979
Tell your mom that I'm dead drunk.

553
00:32:39,979 --> 00:32:42,478
- Go. 
 - Okay.

554
00:32:42,478 --> 00:32:44,500
So stars have backs just like everyone else.

555
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,024
Yes.

556
00:32:46,024 --> 00:32:48,650
How far can you carry me like this?

557
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:52,180
Don't tell me you can't even go 100 meters.

558
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,250
No way.

559
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:56,430
I can go really far, Mr. Lee.

560
00:32:56,430 --> 00:33:00,370
Then, why are you shaking?

561
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:03,790
Well.

562
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:06,690
It's similar to my room in Seoul.

563
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:10,020
You're the one who wanted to stay, don't regret it.

564
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:16,330
You've had guests over before, right?

565
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:19,820
I can hear the wind coming in
through the drain.

566
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,220
You have a mask, right?

567
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,920
You can wear it when you sleep.

568
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:28,528
I'm so grateful that you're worried about my bronchial tubes, it brings me to tears.

569
00:33:28,528 --> 00:33:29,679
Good night.

570
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,040
I hope you survive.

571
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:35,930
I hope my mom got that rat she was talking about before that was in the drain.

572
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,230
Or was it a snake?

573
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:38,960
What?

574
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:39,979
Hey, Lee Geunyoung. Lee Geunyoung!

575
00:33:39,979 --> 00:33:40,820
Hey!

576
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,580
A rat...

577
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:39,190
It's uncomfortable, right?

578
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:41,560
Sleeping on the floor.

579
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,150
You're not asleep?

580
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,610
I see that Korea has a place like this.

581
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,970
You're so sensible.

582
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:58,910
By the way, have you been to Alaska?

583
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:02,470
I haven't even been to Japan. Do you think I've been to Alaska?

584
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,370
Oh yeah.

585
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:08,470
You heard the name "Benny" before, right?

586
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:11,580
You've done so much research on me.

587
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,470
My real name is Ben.

588
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:16,170
I'm from Alaska.

589
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:18,580
Alaska?

590
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,370
I never knew.

591
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:26,180
People think... that I'm a university student from the US.

592
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:31,530
After graduating from high school, I left for Korea leaving my mom behind.

593
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:36,760
To see this nice night sky. It reminds me of Alaska.

594
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,810
Do you miss it?

595
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:47,120
So you should visit your parents more often.

596
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,290
They must be so bored without you.

597
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:53,340
You sound like an elder all of a sudden.

598
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,079
I'm one year older than you.

599
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:58,020
We're the same age.

600
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,179
Really?

601
00:36:00,179 --> 00:36:01,580
You faked your age?

602
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,250
So many secrets.

603
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:06,279
What's real about you?

604
00:36:06,279 --> 00:36:09,340
I didn't want to lie either.

605
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:15,000
That's why sometimes... I'm confused about who I am.

606
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,720
 It's his memory and love. 

607
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,730
 Why does it make my heart ache? 

608
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,980
 I'm nothing to him. 

609
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:30,390
You scared me.

610
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,730
It must be a snake!

611
00:36:34,979 --> 00:36:36,290
Where?

612
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:38,820
- Where is it? 
 - There...

613
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,620
I knew there'd be a snake.

614
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,400
Come here.

615
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,250
Why get so close to me?

616
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,866
You're joking with me again.

617
00:36:49,866 --> 00:36:53,180
Am I always some guy who is joking with you?

618
00:36:54,700 --> 00:37:00,210
If you're not... why do you keep doing this with me?

619
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,038
Just because...

620
00:37:03,038 --> 00:37:08,000
I don't know since when... but I like you.

621
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:15,280
â™«  Baby, you... I still love you  â™«

622
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:23,100
â™«  Baby, you... I'm still with you  â™«

623
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:33,150
â™«  And in the cold, girl, I hold you close. I will wake up from now  â™«

624
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:39,970
â™«  Baby, you~  I'm still with you  â™«

625
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:04,779
Geunyoung, still sleeping?

626
00:38:04,779 --> 00:38:07,370
She must've been tired.

627
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,300
It feels nice to sleep at home.

628
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,810
So you slept early yesterday?

629
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,684
Yes.

630
00:38:23,684 --> 00:38:25,579
I fell sleep right away.

631
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,540
Where is he?

632
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,190
He's sweeping.

633
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,330
It suits him.

634
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:33,170
What? He's sweeping?

635
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:37,270
Why did you make him?

636
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,770
You guys are so weird.

637
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:41,970
Nothing better than Plato in the morning.

638
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,970
You just woke up?

639
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:59,110
That's my dad's.

640
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:03,630
Your mom gave it to me to wear because it was cold.

641
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:06,420
Don't you think your mom is biased?

642
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,080
She wakes me up early.

643
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,520
And lets you sleep in.

644
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,390
She's consistent, though, I'll give her that.

645
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,690
You didn't have to do this.

646
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:15,750
You never do what you don't want to do.

647
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:18,910
She said she won't feed me if I don't.

648
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,550
It's cold. Get inside.

649
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,528
What's this?

650
00:39:30,528 --> 00:39:32,430
Is it a holiday or something?

651
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:34,930
You never make these for me.

652
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:37,290
Men have to eat a lot to work.

653
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:38,080
Here.

654
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,540
Nobody eats this much anymore.

655
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,910
You want less?

656
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:41,810
It's okay.

657
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,710
Thank you.

658
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:53,830
You first, Father.

659
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,970
Why am I your father?

660
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:00,800
How would you like me to address you?

661
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,940
I didn't want to disrespect you.

662
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,500
He's right.

663
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,080
'Father' is polite compared to "mister'.

664
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,960
Eat.

665
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,580
Just don't speak to me.

666
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,520
Here you go.

667
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:19,979
Thank you.

668
00:40:19,979 --> 00:40:21,970
Let's see.

669
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,040
Eat some green onion.

670
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,820
Want some crab shell?

671
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,760
Yes.

672
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,870
Father gave me some green onions.  Right, green onions for the chicken.

673
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:34,650
So generous of you.

674
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:36,000
Father knows to think ahead.

675
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,870
I keep calling her.

676
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:44,730
But Inhyung's not picking up.

677
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:47,218
I heard she's not home.

678
00:40:47,218 --> 00:40:48,706
I'm sorry.

679
00:40:48,706 --> 00:40:52,050
You call yourself a manager, but don't know where she is?

680
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:55,279
Go search everywhere she could have gone.

681
00:40:55,279 --> 00:40:56,480
Got it?

682
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,960
I got it.

683
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,579
How was I?

684
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:07,250
Good.

685
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,060
   

686
00:41:14,979 --> 00:41:17,678
They must've liked it.

687
00:41:17,678 --> 00:41:19,470
Can I listen to it once more?

688
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,970
Sure.

689
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,070
Let me take this.

690
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,730
â™«  I wonder what is love  â™«

691
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:37,250
â™«  I want to know what is love  â™«

692
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,980
   

693
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,150
   

694
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:46,560
â™«  What is this taste?  â™«

695
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,740
â™«  I wonder what is love  â™«

696
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,350
â™«  There is no answerâ€”  â™«

697
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:54,760
Don't skip your meals.

698
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,910
There's sesame oil, so be careful not to spill any.

699
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,190
You shouldn't have.

700
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,750
Take some of hers if you need it.

701
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,712
I packed enough for two.

702
00:42:02,712 --> 00:42:03,560
Wait.

703
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:07,270
Or maybe people on TV are too picky to eat my cooking?

704
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:09,979
No way. I love it.

705
00:42:09,979 --> 00:42:12,600
Especially your tteokbokki.

706
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,079
I'm only letting you off this time.

707
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:18,420
Don't make her do anything that is unfair.

708
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,640
I'll treat her well.

709
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,166
Okay.

710
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:24,820
Maybe I'll cook you some more if you behave.

711
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:29,700
If you make her cry, I'll tear down the TV station's antennae.

712
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,890
And break both of your legs.

713
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:35,270
I'll keep that in mind.

714
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:46,890
Thank you, Father.

715
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:48,460
I'll come back for more tteokbokki.

716
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,310
Says who?

717
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:51,370
Says me.

718
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:03,320
I still trying to digest all your mom's food and love.

719
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:05,870
That wasn't out of love.

720
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:11,079
It was to get revenge on you since you bullied me so much.

721
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:15,079
She deboned the fish and put it on a plate for someone you hate.

722
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:18,230
Your mom also fell for me.

723
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:20,250
I'm so jealous.

724
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:23,120
How can you be so full of yourself?

725
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,179
You should have confidence in yourself.

726
00:43:25,179 --> 00:43:26,460
You really should.

727
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:29,920
People in the village seem to have faith in you a lot.

728
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,440
I was worried that nobody liked you here either.

729
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,879
I was the jerk here.

730
00:43:34,879 --> 00:43:37,460
The village was full of my anti-fans.

731
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,040
Why is it slowing down?

732
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,290
Are you out of gas?

733
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:44,879
No way. Hold on a sec.

734
00:43:44,879 --> 00:43:47,160
I should call someone.

735
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,570
I can't, can I?

736
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,270
Move your feet.

737
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:04,370
There's a button here somewhere.

738
00:44:10,179 --> 00:44:11,150
Is it there?

739
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:12,150
Should I get out?

740
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:14,020
No, you can stay.

741
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,930
It was back here somewhere.

742
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:17,890
That one?

743
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:19,000
Is it?

744
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,380
Move your hand.

745
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:25,510
It's here somewhere.

746
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:27,780
I know it's here...

747
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:32,020
What?

748
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:33,250
You did it on purpose.

749
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:34,460
There was a button here.

750
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,530
Let me look again.

751
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:37,950
What's wrong with you.

752
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,070
Yes.

753
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:46,920
I'm on the highway but where exactly are you?

754
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,456
We're out of gas.

755
00:44:49,456 --> 00:44:51,900
What did you check?

756
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:55,179
We could've had other problems.

757
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:59,800
The situation we're in now, it's the same as Jihyang's mistake before.

758
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:03,770
He told you about that?

759
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:05,928
He shouldn't have.

760
00:45:05,928 --> 00:45:06,960
Why not?

761
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,620
Hearing that story...

762
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:16,350
made me think you were better than I took you for.

763
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:22,570
So?

764
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:25,479
You dropped that fan off?

765
00:45:25,479 --> 00:45:27,850
You should've told me.

766
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:30,470
Well, it was in service to my fans.

767
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:31,596
Right.

768
00:45:31,596 --> 00:45:34,370
You have to repay some of their love.

769
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:41,720
You've come so far.

770
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:52,830
I don't really cook at home.

771
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:54,210
I'll leave it all here.

772
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,180
It's not because I hate it.

773
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:57,350
Okay.

774
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:59,390
Take care.

775
00:46:04,979 --> 00:46:06,370
Let's go.

776
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:08,720
Take it easy.

777
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,920
- Thank you. 
 - Yes.

778
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:13,750
Why so curious?

779
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:15,110
Where have you been?

780
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:17,570
What was with all those rice and apples?

781
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:18,806
Nothing.

782
00:46:18,806 --> 00:46:21,420
Don't make me catch you out.

783
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,844
There's nothing to catch me out over.

784
00:46:23,844 --> 00:46:25,388
By the way,

785
00:46:25,388 --> 00:46:26,930
about that ring...

786
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:28,750
Please, find it for me again.

787
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:31,210
I want to find my father.

788
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:33,500
It can be a reunion or whatever.

789
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,979
Let's do everything we can.

790
00:46:34,979 --> 00:46:35,750
Okay.

791
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:36,920
Let's find him.

792
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,070
Let's try our best.

793
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:42,520
So where have you been? You've changed so much.

794
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,390
Nowhere.

795
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,510
Let's go.

796
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,180
 Did you put all of Mother's food in the refrigerator? 

797
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:05,820
â™«  If I just look at it  â™«

798
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:08,530
 Don't worry. Go to sleep. 

799
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:10,690
â™«  What would it have been like?  â™«

800
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:12,320
Mother?

801
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:16,790
Although it's for the show, we're still technically married.

802
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:21,020
So isn't she my mother-in-law...?

803
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:25,040
â™«  I can't even imagine  â™«

804
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:29,350
â™«  Someone else by my side  â™«

805
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:33,090
â™«  When it rains  â™«

806
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:36,430
 I still haven't digested all the food. 

807
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:40,810
 Are you cooking next time? 

808
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:44,290
â™«  Footsteps walking side by side with you  â™«

809
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:49,350
â™«  There's nothing better than this  â™«

810
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:07,220
What now?

811
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,330
 It's me. 

812
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:24,150
 I have to tell you something. 

813
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:27,200
 Please call me when you get this. 

814
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,330
 I'll be waiting. 

815
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:31,320
 You think I don't know that you two still meet? 

816
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:37,360
 IIf you just keep doing this,
will you wake up after I have ruined Inhyung? 

817
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:04,430
Yes, Ms. Noh.

818
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:05,290
Today?

819
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:07,790
It's just an interview, don't worry.

820
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:09,330
Come over to the penthouse.

821
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:12,250
Oh... all right.

822
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,080
We'll get the interview for Hoo Joon going.  Let's pick up the pace!

823
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,250
This one is really amazing.

824
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,570
This is too funny.

825
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,860
How's this possible?

826
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,470
It's so funny.

827
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,790
 (Look at your cell phone.) 

828
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:06,510
No way!

829
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:08,080
 What is it? Tell me. 

830
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,732
 Is it that fun keeping me in the dark? 

831
00:50:10,732 --> 00:50:13,320
Let's begin the interview.

832
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:17,720
Sir.

833
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,260
What's this?

834
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:24,620
It arrived this morning.

835
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:27,110
   

836
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:30,470
   

837
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:37,000
Call the manager in charge of Oh Inhyung right now.

838
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,670
Yes, sir.

839
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:49,740
Sir.

840
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:53,380
Hoo Joon's single, the one you heard before...

841
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:56,570
   

842
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:58,150
   

843
00:50:58,150 --> 00:50:59,979
Please wrap everything up.

844
00:50:59,979 --> 00:51:01,200
Great work!

845
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,970
- Hoo Joon's single must have been leaked. 
 - What?

846
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:08,330
"His first love and now the featured vocal?"

847
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:11,560
The articles are all about Hoo Joon's girls.

848
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,420
What's this?

849
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:17,710
They think his anti-fan is a criminal?

850
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:19,540
This is too much.

851
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:20,250
For real.

852
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:22,720
- Great work. 
 - Geunyoung.

853
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:27,479
Geunyoung, stay home for awhile.

854
00:51:27,479 --> 00:51:28,950
Why?

855
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:29,780
Um...

856
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:31,720
Did something happen?

857
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,479
What's wrong?

858
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:41,690
   

859
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:47,490
So you're saying she was there?

860
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:50,379
 She just said she wanted to listen to it. 

861
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,579
   

862
00:52:05,579 --> 00:52:07,520
   

863
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,150
   

864
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,130
- Excuse me! 
 - Just answer one question!

865
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:43,738
What's with that look?

866
00:52:43,738 --> 00:52:44,879
Was it really you?

867
00:52:44,879 --> 00:52:47,128
Don't you know?

868
00:52:47,128 --> 00:52:49,720
Are you really crazy?

869
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:53,020
You leak the song you sang with him yourself?

870
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:55,930
Why? Everyone's curious about who the girl is.

871
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:58,490
Should I expose your past relationship, too?

872
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:00,910
Wasn't that what you were planning all along?

873
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:03,520
Now it's Lee Geunyoung you care about.

874
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,500
It's her.

875
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:09,290
You're afraid she'll take your place?

876
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:12,070
You're the one who's afraid.

877
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:17,170
From the beginning, I knew that you needed me to get Joon to sign.

878
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:18,660
You think I didn't know?

879
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,800
But now you think you won't need me anymore.

880
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:28,290
You... Have you always been suspicious of me?

881
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:30,100
What about me?

882
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:34,420
I'm the one who suffered under all your suspicion!  Didn't you know!

883
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,430
You think you're the victim here?

884
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:42,020
Pretending like nothing's wrong, saying it's all in the past.

885
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:44,390
Do you know how disgusting it is to see that?

886
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:47,030
Stop it now!

887
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:52,360
Before, I thought it'd be okay if I just do what you wanted.

888
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,920
But...

889
00:53:54,650 --> 00:54:01,370
I realized that the person you need... It doesn't have to be me.

890
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:08,100
In your life, was I ever important to you?

891
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:11,690
You're...

892
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:16,110
saying you regret it?

893
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:17,210
Yes.

894
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:18,610
I regret it.

895
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:21,790
I regret it with all my heart. Happy?

896
00:54:29,979 --> 00:54:35,810
I'm so sorry but every decision you make from here on

897
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,250
will be a mistake.

898
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,490
So go feel like the victim.

899
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:06,200
Still... you shouldn't have said you regret it.

900
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:15,770
   

901
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:18,500
Stay home till the press quiets down.

902
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:22,390
We're trying to stifle it.

903
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:34,520
Joon.

904
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:34,620
Why are you here not home?

905
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:39,540
I can't even hang out at my friend's?

906
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:49,650
Let's go. Together.

907
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:51,580
Where?

908
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:09,320
Excuse me.

909
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:21,810
You regret being my anti-fan, huh?

910
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:29,540
A little?

911
00:57:34,979 --> 00:57:37,370
I should've held back.

912
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:41,710
It's just...

913
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:46,110
even though I knew it was unfair, I should have just let things slide.

914
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,210
Why did I do it?

915
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:55,942
If I held back...

916
00:57:55,942 --> 00:58:04,170
If I did... people wouldn't have hated me like this... even when things like this have happened.

917
00:58:09,879 --> 00:58:11,710
I'm sorry.

918
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:17,170
Because of me... people hate you.

919
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:22,250
I'm sorry that you always have to just hold back even when it's unfair for you.

920
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:32,800
You can cry... in front of me.

921
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:37,940
I'm so mad.

922
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:40,379
They don't even know anything.

923
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,320
You idiots!

924
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,000
It's not Lee Geunyoung!

925
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,120
It's not her!

926
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:50,080
Stop. Are you nuts? Everyone will look.

927
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,330
You do it, too. Shout.

928
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:53,770
Let it out.  "It's not me!"

929
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:55,190
Shout that it isn't you.

930
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:57,120
It's not me!

931
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,480
What if people recognize you?

932
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:02,400
Don't hold it back. It'll hurt more.

933
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,270
Hurry.

934
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:06,770
You idiots!

935
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:10,882
What do you take me for?

936
00:59:10,882 --> 00:59:13,512
You think that I'm a pushover?

937
00:59:13,512 --> 00:59:15,920
Why is it always me?

938
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,210
Why!

939
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:18,750
It's not me!

940
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:20,530
It's not her!

941
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:24,270
See? It works.

942
00:59:26,770 --> 00:59:30,390
Do you also feel like this when you feel down and frustrated?

943
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:33,860
It's not fun doing it alone, though.

944
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:36,474
You have to do it with someone else.

945
00:59:36,474 --> 00:59:38,390
Now...

946
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:43,330
Lee Geunyoung can do it with me.

947
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:50,970
 Timing and Subtitles by the ðŸ¥€Hatefully Yours ðŸ™ƒ @Viki.com 

948
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:54,350
I'm hungry now that I've shouted it out.

949
00:59:55,279 --> 00:59:57,040
Let's go eat something.

950
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,120
Let's do that.

951
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:00,330
I didn't eat anything all day either.

952
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:03,550
Let's go.

953
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:05,910
â™«  Is this the person...  â™«

954
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:07,590
Thank you.

955
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:11,350
â™«  ...who broke up yesterday?  â™«

956
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:12,570
Don't cry.

957
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:18,390
You crybaby.

958
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:23,660
â™«  I thought it would all be forgotten  â™«

959
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:28,420
â™«  When I close my eyes and think of you  â™«

960
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:30,879
You got a call.

961
01:00:30,879 --> 01:00:34,300
- I'm not picking up. 
 - Answer the phone.

962
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,690
What is up?

963
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:42,230
â™«  I feel like I'm coming back to you any minute  â™«

964
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:44,190
   

965
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:46,850
Pick up.

966
01:00:46,850 --> 01:00:48,440
Okay.

967
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:51,790
Just a second.

968
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,770
- What's... 
  - You know Oh Inhyung, right? 

969
01:00:58,770 --> 01:01:01,680
 This is the hospital. 

970
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:08,410
â™«  Baby, you... I still love you  â™«

971
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:16,580
â™«  Baby, you... I'm still with you  â™«

972
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:22,920
â™«  I'm in the cold, girl, I hold you close  â™«

973
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:26,980
â™«  Oh where do we go from now  â™«

974
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:30,390
â™«  Baby, you...  â™«

975
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:33,204
 If you go in like this, everyone will recognize you. 

976
01:01:33,204 --> 01:01:34,921
 Jaejoon's giving you a hard time? 

977
01:01:34,921 --> 01:01:35,629
 What if he does? 

978
01:01:35,629 --> 01:01:38,237
 If I go back to you, will you take me back? 

979
01:01:38,237 --> 01:01:39,737
 Who are worried about? 

980
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:42,362
 Is it Joon or Jaejoon? 

981
01:01:42,362 --> 01:01:44,354
 You're scared, too, right? 

982
01:01:44,354 --> 01:01:46,179
 That's how celebs are. 

983
01:01:46,179 --> 01:01:47,904
 I think Joon was kidnapped. 

984
01:01:47,904 --> 01:01:48,946
 Kidnapped? 

985
01:01:48,946 --> 01:01:50,696
 Is this sponsored? 

986
01:01:50,696 --> 01:01:53,504
 Maybe he was trying to tell us about the hat. 

987
01:01:53,504 --> 01:01:55,904
 I shouldn't have sent him home like that. 

988
01:01:55,904 --> 01:01:56,950
 This wouldn't have happened. 

989
01:01:56,950 --> 01:02:00,612
â™«  You kept me up all night long  â™«

990
01:02:00,612 --> 01:02:05,271
