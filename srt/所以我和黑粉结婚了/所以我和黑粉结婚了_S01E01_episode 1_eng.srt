1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:07,200


2
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,350
   

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,900
   

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,400
   

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,500
   

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,200
   

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,300
   

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:53,100
   

9
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,600
   

10
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,360
   

11
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,000
   

12
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,900
   

13
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,200
   

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
   

15
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,410
   

16
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,780
   

17
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,480
   

18
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,700
   

19
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,800
Let's go, everyone.

20
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,510
 Hello. 

21
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,008
Is everything going fine?

22
00:02:26,008 --> 00:02:27,410
Joon, look at this.

23
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,352
Amazing.

24
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,940
Crazy.

25
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,750
It's amazing.

26
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,350
Thank you.

27
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,600
So many flowers.

28
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,600
Here.

29
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,440
Okay.

30
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,600
 Happy birthday! 

31
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,820
 What a party! 

32
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,640
What does it say?

33
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,700
Ten copies for this, too.

34
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,475
Okay.

35
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:16,730
If you want a happy new year, bring me next year's plans by today.

36
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,200
Do you think I can't work you late?

37
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,400
I can and I will.

38
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,320
I guess she's not going to church for New Year's Eve.

39
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,370
"I can make you work late."

40
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,750
How can she be so mean about it?

41
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,800
No wonder she's "Meanhee."

42
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:39,960
Is that her nickname?

43
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,020
Geunyoung,

44
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,220
can you research the emerging and disappearing jobs in 20 years?

45
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,770
Okay.

46
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,580
Who's organizing "today's hot topics" in 1987?

47
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,610
Everyone's busy.

48
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,038
I'm cleaning the storage room.

49
00:03:53,038 --> 00:03:55,170
Why don't you just ask Lee Geunyoung?

50
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,670
I'm also very...

51
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,420
Please Geunyoung.

52
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,000
Okay.

53
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,700
There is no separate colorful flower road.

54
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,870
Right?

55
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,570
Right... I'm just trying to let everyone walk on the flower road.

56
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,530
   

57
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,600
The flowers should've arrived by now.

58
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,479
I should've seen his face in person.

59
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:37,850
I'm sad.

60
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,620
His new song is crazy.

61
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,260
He's perfect.

62
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,820
   

63
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,260
♫  So that you can hear me all night long  ♫

64
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,093
Perfect?

65
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:55,503
Yes.

66
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,360
I'm asking about the traffic.

67
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,170
There must be traffic.

68
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,692
Go home.

69
00:05:02,692 --> 00:05:04,350
Goodbye, sir.

70
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:12,120
Answer.

71
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,532
You're answering?

72
00:05:14,532 --> 00:05:18,580
I'll definitely remember your name.

73
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,550
Is today Who Joon Day?

74
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,020
Come here.

75
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,879
Smile.

76
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:32,780
One, two, three.

77
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,330
So busy.

78
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,480
It must be hectic for you.

79
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,520
I'm fine.

80
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,070
See you after the concert.

81
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,590
Walk her out.

82
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,670
Goodbye.

83
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,920
Mr. President is giving you an ad for your birthday.

84
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,690
Does he know it's fake?

85
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,080
Be quiet. Someone might hear.

86
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,970
Why are you being so mean?

87
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,180
I'll see you later.

88
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,960
Way to go.

89
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,960
 I'm not here right now. 

90
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,860
 Sorry, please leave a message 

91
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,480
 I'm not home right now. 

92
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,520
 Please leave a message. 

93
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,879
 Today's my birthday. 

94
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,252
 You know? 

95
00:07:07,252 --> 00:07:09,360
 It's his idea. 

96
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,470
He said I'd be a star if today was my birthday.

97
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,482
Did you see?

98
00:07:16,482 --> 00:07:19,250
There's news about me in America, right?

99
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,550
It's really too much.

100
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,320
Can't she just pick up for once?

101
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,070
   

102
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,670
   

103
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,940
   

104
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,730
   

105
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:53,120
 - Done! 
 - Wow! 

106
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,779
 There's one more step. 

107
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:55,600
 What? 

108
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,700
 Give me your hand. 

109
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,680
 What are you doing? I was going to taste it. 

110
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,520
 But that felt good. 

111
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,510
 What brings you here? 

112
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,860
 It's a couples' party. 

113
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,790
 Go with me? 

114
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,110
 Ta-da! 

115
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,710
 They're so pretty. 

116
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,770
 Can I try them on? 

117
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,190
   

118
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:57,782
Sort these by topics by the end of the day.

119
00:08:57,782 --> 00:08:59,508
The end of the day?

120
00:08:59,508 --> 00:09:02,730
Yes. Why not?

121
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,502
Are you saying you can't?

122
00:09:05,502 --> 00:09:07,290
No, it's not that.

123
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:12,310
You want to lose your job for New Years?

124
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,150
No.

125
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,330
   

126
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,810
That's my...

127
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,660
Okay...

128
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,330
Let's just finish it and go home.

129
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,590
♫   I'm your Pop Star  ♫

130
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,820
♫  Oh yeah, eh  ♫

131
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:21,710
♫  Remember, I'm always your one and only one  ♫

132
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:25,940
♫  So that you can hear me all night long  ♫

133
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,879
♫  Oh, every day, every time  ♫

134
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,940
♫  If you can hear me  ♫

135
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,630
♫   I'll sing   ♫

136
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,740
♫  I'm a Pop Star just for you  ♫

137
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,860
What are you doing?

138
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:51,250
Am I real friend of that psycho?

139
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,770
It's a pleasure.

140
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,920
Thank you. I won't forget it.

141
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,560
So the one that'll make your dream come true...

142
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,470
was a bunny?

143
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:07,020
But right now, you look like an actual rabbit.

144
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:12,170
In America, this is supposed to be a sexy event.

145
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,644
It's in all the Hollywood rom-coms.

146
00:11:15,644 --> 00:11:17,120
I think...

147
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:24,879
Roy is also expecting something special.

148
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:28,890
Why else would he tell me to come to his house?

149
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,050
His house!

150
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,310
That's because you always work late.

151
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:36,270
That's true.

152
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,720
Meanhee.

153
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,210
She's so annoying.

154
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,400
Just quit.

155
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,190
Thanks, Mijeong.

156
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,710
Okay. Bye.

157
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,970
Go get him.

158
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm sorry.

159
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,310
That's mine.

160
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,060
Wrong flowers though.

161
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,260
Pink isn't bad.

162
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,850
 My flowers... 

163
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,080
 Why should I hide? 

164
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,779
Hey!

165
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:08,000
Geunyoung!

166
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,750
You crazy bastard!

167
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:17,070
Come here!

168
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,810
Get lost!

169
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:19,979
Son of a b***h!

170
00:13:19,979 --> 00:13:21,320
F***er!

171
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,320
You motherf***er...

172
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,720
You're just as bad.

173
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,910
You pink bastard!

174
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:37,020
 Why is my heart beating so hard? 

175
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,250
 Lee Geunyoung, you thought about it a lot. 

176
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:46,690
 You're supposed to walk over there and confront them. 

177
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,779
 But... 

178
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,110
 this is different. 

179
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,430
 How is it different if I confront them? 

180
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,960
 Why am I so nervous? 

181
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,090
 I didn't do anything wrong. 

182
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,020
Geunyoung.

183
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,470
 Do something. 

184
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,540
This one's mine.

185
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:47,370
Ten minutes. Please hurry!

186
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,850
That looks good on you.

187
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,490
Ready for the speech?

188
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,660
Is it the grand prize?

189
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,770
They will call you if you win.

190
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,040
Joon! Let's change.

191
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,270
Everyone's wearing a black suit.

192
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,310
They could've told me sooner.

193
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,770
Look who's talking.

194
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,760
We have less than 5 minutes.

195
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,210
Geunyoung, it's not like that.

196
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,779
Then what?

197
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:25,020
I really... wanted to love you.

198
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,180
I also thought it was possible for me to love women.

199
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:30,920
I wanted to check if I could love women or not.

200
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,860
Why did it have to be me though?

201
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,920
Huh?

202
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,430
Why me?

203
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,110
Do you think I'm a litmus paper?

204
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,350
I'm not here to tell you that.

205
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,900
Please be quiet.

206
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,320
Are you... worried that people might hear?

207
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:50,470
...worried that people may listen?

208
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,066
Let's stop.

209
00:15:52,266 --> 00:15:55,570
So far, why have you always been pretending to be a nice person to me?

210
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,400
Were you always this kind of person?

211
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,670
Still...

212
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:09,090
Still the least you can say...

213
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,260
is that you're sorry.

214
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:15,900
Does it make you... feel better?

215
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,160
You're good at holding back.

216
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,730
Why didn't you hold back till the end?

217
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,330
You're...

218
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,980
You are...

219
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,830
 I'm not holding back. 

220
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:45,140
 I'm trying to understand him. 

221
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,870
Has it been 5 years or 6 since we've met?

222
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,470
Time flies.

223
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,460
What did we do last year?

224
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,060
Did we watch a show?

225
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:06,180
You're so romantic this year.

226
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:14,180
 So many artists were loved around the world this year. 

227
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:18,560
 The grand prize goes to the most loved. 

228
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,130
 I'm curious who it is. 

229
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:25,379
 Let me announce it. 

230
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:28,720
 The grand prize for the year goes to... 

231
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,170
Who Joon!

232
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:35,579
Who Joon. Congratulations!

233
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:40,790
 He's at a concert right now so we called him. 

234
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,460
 Thank you. 

235
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:00,379
 First, I thank my fans, 

236
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,040
who are here now.

237
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,570
I love you guys.

238
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,640
 I love you guys! 

239
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:11,310
I don't like how his birthday is on the 31st.

240
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,370
It's like he wins every year for his birthday.

241
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:17,470
Maybe next year, I can win.

242
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,070
When is my song coming out?

243
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,522
Did you congratulate him?

244
00:18:22,522 --> 00:18:25,040
What?

245
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,790
Don't play dumb.

246
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,980
It's Joon's birthday.

247
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,550
I didn't send him that.

248
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,520
Did you hear about my meeting with a production company?

249
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,379
It'll be nice starring in a movie along while my album's out.

250
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,970
Aren't you mad?

251
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,340
That he's the famous one?

252
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:56,440
Stop it.

253
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,330
Is that all you want to talk about?

254
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,390
Hey.

255
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:04,779
You pretending like nothing happened is weirder.

256
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:06,820
Can't you just talk crap with me?

257
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,290
Is that why you're here?

258
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,779
To be jealous?

259
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:12,180
Jealous? Who?

260
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,540
Hey.

261
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,970
You're mine.

262
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,210
Your company is mine.

263
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,110
Everything is mine.

264
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,979
I'm not jealous.

265
00:19:20,979 --> 00:19:24,520
But you... are mine?

266
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:40,580
I was so happy about the couples' party.

267
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,250
I didn't know.

268
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:49,500
I was wearing the shoes he bought...

269
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:54,120
And you bought a designer bag and a dress.

270
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,970
You still came back with flowers?

271
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,420
I didn't hold back!

272
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,570
Okay.

273
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:07,720
I wanted to wear this so badly.

274
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,020
I don't need it anymore.

275
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,500
Think clearly.

276
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,240
You'll still have to pay your credit card bill.

277
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,440
For 11 months.

278
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,400
You're going to pay for it without ever wearing it?

279
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,580
The wind.

280
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,620
My life is over as of today.

281
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:39,460
When it's the new year, I'll be reborn.

282
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,320
Watch me.

283
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,380
I'll be a totally different person.

284
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,400
It's not time yet?

285
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,700
It's past midnight.

286
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,060
It is?

287
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,450
How?

288
00:20:54,450 --> 00:21:00,240
How can I always be so unlucky?

289
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,080
My life is a disaster.

290
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:11,770
Eat.

291
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,520
Say, "ah."

292
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,800
Is it good?

293
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,330
Kimchi, please.

294
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,620
Kimchi? Here.

295
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,870
Kimchi.

296
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,240
 Long journey, huh? 

297
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,910
 Let's go. 

298
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,520
 Come in. 

299
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,500
 You've got everything. 

300
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:36,940
♫  Baby, you~  I still love you  ♫

301
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:45,410
♫  Baby, you~ I'm still with you  ♫

302
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:51,620
♫  And in the cold, girl, I hold you close  ♫

303
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,530
♫  I will wake up from now  ♫

304
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:59,670
♫  Baby, you~  I'm still with you  ♫

305
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:04,879
   

306
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:08,620
   

307
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,080
How was your trip?

308
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,220
It was fun.

309
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,940
Are you okay?

310
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,700
Why couldn't you sleep during the flight?

311
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,190
People watch me.

312
00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:44,575
I'm only... comfortable here.

313
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,320
Just be comfortable.

314
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,400
You're a huge star!

315
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,870
That's dumb.

316
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,079
It must be hard to find.

317
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:02,510
Should I have shown my ring?

318
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:07,080
So you'll say "The ring belongs to my father. Please show up"?

319
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,620
Will people show up then?

320
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,530
"He's my son."

321
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:14,970
Should I hold an audition?

322
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:17,080
That's dumb.

323
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,850
No volunteers? You're like children.

324
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:35,640
Do we have to follow around a chaebol?

325
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,730
Right.

326
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:39,580
JJ is famous.

327
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,460
He opened an entertainment company

328
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:45,279
and a club with his parents' money.

329
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,500
He's got no business.

330
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,240
You're such impressive journalists.

331
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,250
That rich guy sent us an invitation.

332
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,450
We can't be the only ones to not show up.

333
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:03,520
He's trying to do art.

334
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,620
Hoo Joon will be there, too.

335
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,110
Get a picture of him at least.

336
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:10,410
Celebrities' parties get good coverage.

337
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:13,550
Why don't we send Geunyoung then?

338
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:18,340
It's about time Geunyoung goes alone.

339
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:30,179
Lee Geunyoung it is then.

340
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,290
You're taking pictures.

341
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:47,720
   

342
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,180
 Welcome to the party. 

343
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:05,179
 - Cheers! 
 - Cheers! 

344
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,658
 His showmanship. 

345
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:19,210
 Everyone knows they're together anyway. 

346
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,380
 You didn't know? 

347
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,590
   

348
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:50,070
Is that too much?

349
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,560
No.

350
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,950
I've been paying for it for 7 months.

351
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,260
Now's the time for it.

352
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:03,020
Why do you walk like that?

353
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,800
He doesn't even know my size.

354
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,580
Is this men's or women's?

355
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,440
Maybe it was his boyfriend's.

356
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,859
If his boyfriend was...

357
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:14,758
No.

358
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,960
No, he was too tall.

359
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,950
Like this tall.

360
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,020
Benny?

361
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,020
Isn't Hoo Joon's English name Benny?

362
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,879
Maybe they are gay, too.

363
00:27:30,879 --> 00:27:32,820
The battery is out.

364
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,570
I checked.

365
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,360
Let me go to the car.

366
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,010
He's not so careful either.

367
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,370
Is that Hoo Joon?

368
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:10,680
   

369
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:41,720
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were there.

370
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,330
Are you okay?

371
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,720
I'm okay.

372
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,790
I'm sorry I didn't know you were in there.

373
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,240
What's your business here?

374
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,440
The car was...

375
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,970
was pretty.

376
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:55,909
Did you take—

377
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:57,049
No.

378
00:28:57,049 --> 00:28:59,020
I didn't take any photos. Want to see?

379
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,770
I'm sorry. I just needed to make sure.

380
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:06,770
I'm fine.

381
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,340
She's probably a fan of mine.

382
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,250
I think we're here early. Should we stay in the car?

383
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,330
Yes. Let's just wait.

384
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,390
Look here, please!

385
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,520
Here. Please.

386
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,790
I saw Hoo Joon earlier.

387
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,930
When? Did you take a picture?

388
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,660
There was no battery.

389
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,870
I think he's a nice person though.

390
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:38,430
I think he'll say "yes" to an interview later.

391
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,879
Why? What happened?

392
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:41,570
Did you take it?

393
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,310
Didn't this album flop?

394
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,470
All his albums were...

395
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:55,780
 Hello, everyone. 

396
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,550
Thank you for coming.

397
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:00,450
Were you tired of waiting?

398
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:02,860
When is Hoo Joon coming?

399
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:08,300
It's not time for questions yet.

400
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:14,290
Anyway, everyone please have fun tonight.

401
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,750
Drinks are free.

402
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,820
It's on me!

403
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,570
He's here!

404
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:22,920
Hoo Joon!

405
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,460
It's Hoo Joon.

406
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,880
Here! Hoo Joon!

407
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,079
Hoo Joon is here!

408
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:38,660
Can you come this way, Hoo Joon?

409
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:43,510
He's here even though he's busy.

410
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,479
Thanks for coming.

411
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:48,770
 - Here. 
 - Over here please. 

412
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:51,406
Heart symbol, please.

413
00:30:51,406 --> 00:30:55,490
Enjoy, everyone.

414
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,370
I thought you just came in today.

415
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:10,250
You must be tired.

416
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,280
I thought you needed me.

417
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,420
You told everyone I was coming.

418
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:17,330
The reporters will look for me, no?

419
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:19,430
That's why I'm here.

420
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:22,880
The way you talk.

421
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,180
I just can't hate you.

422
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,690
Does he need to be here?

423
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,738
I'm in the jungle.

424
00:31:38,738 --> 00:31:41,500
Of course, he won't leave me.

425
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,800
Let's go.

426
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,680
We're from Wonder Woman magazine.

427
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,200
Can you just say a few words?

428
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,679
Thank you.

429
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,090
I think we got enough.

430
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,370
Let's drink, too.

431
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:06,940
There are seats for us.

432
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,479
I can't find Hoo Joon.

433
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:13,830
We have to get an exclusive interview.

434
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,360
VIPs must have their own area.

435
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,884
He'll show up at least once.

436
00:32:18,884 --> 00:32:20,240
Let's go.

437
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,040
- Here. 
 - Okay.

438
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,570
Thanks.

439
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,230
You okay?

440
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:33,700
You're still like a little kid.

441
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,870
Is he older than me?

442
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:41,579
For some reason, you don't feel like it.

443
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:44,924
He's definitely older than you.

444
00:32:44,924 --> 00:32:46,756
You're right.

445
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:50,840
Should I call you "Big Brother" out of respect?

446
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,470
You've changed, Jaejoon.

447
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,410
To offer respect.

448
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:58,670
You guys are here.

449
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,310
You're here?

450
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:02,570
The rising star of Shooting Star.

451
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:04,850
Congrats, JJ.

452
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,334
You just flew in today.

453
00:33:07,334 --> 00:33:09,380
Why didn't you call me?

454
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,920
The food is good here.

455
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,264
Roy is the chef.

456
00:33:14,264 --> 00:33:17,330
He was a good chef.

457
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,560
Roy?

458
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,440
He's here?

459
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,180
Do you think he saw me in these heels?

460
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,470
Calm down.

461
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,370
It's been so long.

462
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,280
What's he going to do?

463
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,570
Right? I know.

464
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:33,730
He probably had no other choice.

465
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,680
You can't fool your feelings.

466
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,810
He probably forgot how you look.

467
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,479
Hey!

468
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:43,200
I'm not easy to forget.

469
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,260
You're wrong.

470
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,200
Okay.

471
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,580
Inhyung, over here.

472
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,540
Can I talk to you for a second?

473
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,096
Are you okay?

474
00:34:03,096 --> 00:34:04,760
Yes.

475
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,150
You're here, Inhyung.

476
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,860
Sit.

477
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,136
She's changed a lot, hasn't she?

478
00:34:19,136 --> 00:34:21,940
I don't know if he remembers.

479
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,130
It's been a while.

480
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:31,970
I know. Have you been well?

481
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:34,680
Of course, he's been well.

482
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,000
His album, drama, movies...

483
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,640
You're right.

484
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,770
That's why I couldn't really keep in touch with you guys.

485
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,140
That's fine.

486
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:48,190
We've been busy, too. Right?

487
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,430
Do you know what annoys me the most?

488
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:59,720
The fact that my ex was gay.

489
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,930
The fact that he's still a star chef

490
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:06,920
while I'm nothing, makes me miserable.

491
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:10,479
Yeah. You look miserable.

492
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,190
Friend.

493
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,760
People usually say,

494
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,674
"Come on!

495
00:35:16,674 --> 00:35:20,830
You're already beautiful enough."

496
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:21,640
Friend.

497
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:27,470
I'm the one who took their drunk friend home.

498
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,550
That's right.

499
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,426
Where are you going?

500
00:35:34,426 --> 00:35:36,620
Taking a leak.

501
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,390
This is expensive.

502
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,150
Protect this.

503
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,179
Yes, master.

504
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,720
Have you been well?

505
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,750
Take a look.

506
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,720
What's wrong?

507
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,900
You said you'd understand.

508
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,970
Yes.

509
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,640
That's enough.

510
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,740
What's taking him so long?

511
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:33,480
Restroom...

512
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,330
Hoo Joon...

513
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,579
He hit her.

514
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,470
Who is that?

515
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,370
Excuse me?

516
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,204
 Did you take— 

517
00:37:24,204 --> 00:37:25,409
 No. 

518
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,140
 I didn't take any photos. 

519
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,740
You are the girl from earlier.

520
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,050
Who are you?

521
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,820
Are you a stalker?

522
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,920
No, I'm not a stalker.

523
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,900
Give me the camera.

524
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,750
Give it to me.

525
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:10,350
It's hot.

526
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:12,400
Are you crazy?

527
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,080
This is nuts!

528
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,979
I'm sorry.

529
00:38:19,979 --> 00:38:23,250
Get me a pair of shoes and come to the emergency exit.

530
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,860
Hurry.

531
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,370
I'm sorry.

532
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:30,870
Don't say another word.

533
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:33,020
I felt I needed to apologize.

534
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:37,700
You shouldn't have done it in the first place.

535
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:41,120
An unlucky day.

536
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,670
Hey.

537
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:49,150
I originally wanted to apologize,

538
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:52,720
but you broke my expensive camera. Do you know how much that cost?

539
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,570
How much is it? I'll pay for it.

540
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:59,410
What a prick. Money's not everything.

541
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:01,700
I know you're a huge star.

542
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,020
Get some manners first.

543
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,180
You didn't even ask what happened.

544
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,800
What happened?

545
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,430
I know people like you.

546
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:14,640
You were playing with your camera earlier.

547
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,970
What do you expect?

548
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:18,870
I told you I didn't take any photos.

549
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:21,970
Right.

550
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:24,670
It was all an act?

551
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:27,706
You must be hiding who you really are.

552
00:39:27,706 --> 00:39:29,760
What's going on?

553
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,320
Hey, is that mine?

554
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,430
That wasn't me.

555
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:37,360
This is yours?

556
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,420
What happened?

557
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,875
- Are you his manager? 
 - Yes.

558
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:47,000
Your star broke our camera and was rude.

559
00:39:47,014 --> 00:39:48,810
I did apologize for that.

560
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:52,050
But not only did he not accept it, he also—

561
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:54,320
We're from Wonder Woman magazine.

562
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,060
Her name is Lee Geunyoung.

563
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:58,350
You're a journalist?

564
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:01,120
Yet, you didn't take any photos?

565
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,100
Are you always this suspicious?

566
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,970
I am because of trash like you.

567
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,040
Trash?

568
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,400
You think you're mighty with your cameras?

569
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,620
Hey!

570
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,530
What a freaking day.

571
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:14,780
I guess there's been a misunderstanding.

572
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:18,390
We'll pay for the camera.

573
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,290
What a jerk.

574
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:24,070
You said he was nice.

575
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,390
I was fooled.

576
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,130
Like all women in Korea.

577
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:29,020
Where are you going?

578
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:35,350
I told you not to come here.

579
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,520
Is this what you get?

580
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,970
Not again.

581
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,270
I'd rather take a taxi.

582
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,080
Stay here. I'll get the car.

583
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:51,380
Hey!

584
00:40:55,279 --> 00:40:56,850
You still have to apologize.

585
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,910
Miss,

586
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:01,600
just go home if you're drunk.

587
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,020
Look at this guy.

588
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,680
Now you're being polite?

589
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,410
Should I let everyone know what happened?

590
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:12,220
If you don't apologize,

591
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,350
I won't let this go.

592
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:17,010
I'll expose you.

593
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:21,300
Does it make you feel better?

594
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:24,140
I know your kind.

595
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,640
You can't say anything to anyone else.

596
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:31,470
You're coming to me to get rewarded.

597
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:33,270
Was I always like this?

598
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:35,640
I held back as much as I could.

599
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,150
I apologized for what I'd done.

600
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:42,670
If you just apologized, I wouldn't have come here.

601
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,010
Why didn't you hold back till the end?

602
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,450
 You're usually good at holding back. 

603
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:57,940
 Why didn't you just hold back till the end? 

604
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,770
Hey!

605
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:16,340
You should've been good when I was!

606
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:37,125
- Bitch! 
 - No. Not now.

607
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:39,920
She hit me in the face.

608
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:49,979
   

609
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:56,640
   

610
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,979
   

611
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:30,379
- Hi. 
 - Hi.

612
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:40,800
- As you were... 
 - It didn't leave any scars.

613
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,600
What do you think she saw?

614
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,777
She saw me with Inhyung.

615
00:44:01,778 --> 00:44:03,067
What?

616
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,770
Come on.

617
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,970
Wonder Woman...

618
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:14,870
I think we have an overseas project with them.

619
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:17,750
   

620
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,520
Hey!

621
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,930
You didn't get a single picture?

622
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:30,040
We took pictures.

623
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,600
But the camera...

624
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,680
So it's broken?

625
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:38,270
What did you do?

626
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:41,520
You wanted special coverage.

627
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,670
Don't you realize why you don't have one?

628
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:47,870
Yesterday...

629
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:49,520
something unexpected...

630
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,150
Amazing.

631
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:54,270
Hoo Joon was hit by a heel yesterday.

632
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:57,080
And that photoshoot...

633
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,560
I can't do it.

634
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,179
Why?

635
00:45:00,179 --> 00:45:02,660
A female journalist stalked me yesterday.

636
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:06,390
Tell her I won't work with that company

637
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:07,680
if she writes anything.

638
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,640
What does she have on you?

639
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,700
It's a misunderstanding.

640
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,140
Who could do that?

641
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:15,860
What's her name?

642
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:18,470
Lee Geunyoung.

643
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:20,790
I'll take care of her. And you can do the photoshoot?

644
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:22,850
Do you need me to promise?

645
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:24,779
Don't make me angry.

646
00:45:24,779 --> 00:45:27,200
You may be high and mighty,

647
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,680
but I took care of all the obstacles.

648
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,850
So do you want my help this time?

649
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:37,360
Yes, you've done great work.

650
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,220
So take good care of it this time, too.

651
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:45,650
 I will. And in the meantime don't go anywhere... 

652
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:47,930
He hung up.

653
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,379
Chief.

654
00:45:50,379 --> 00:45:52,760
Boss is looking for you.

655
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,470
I think that went well.

656
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:07,640
You think so?

657
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,390
I think it went terribly.

658
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:12,850
There's good news.

659
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:16,560
They said they're sending a new camera.

660
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,418
The best on the market.

661
00:46:19,418 --> 00:46:21,890
That went smoothly.

662
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:23,860
It sure did.

663
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,910
 Are you crazy? 

664
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:45,530
 You're barefoot. 

665
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,270
Angry heel.

666
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:59,600
 Let's just think of it as bad luck. 

667
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,270
Get over it.

668
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:03,610
Let's get over it.

669
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:06,020
Coffee's here.

670
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:07,770
Geunyoung.

671
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:09,600
The chief is looking for you.

672
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,330
Again?

673
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,670
Strawberry juice is mine.

674
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:25,620
I heard you looked for me.

675
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,320
Lee Geunyoung.

676
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,738
You're fired.

677
00:47:30,738 --> 00:47:32,130
I'm sorry?

678
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,970
You're fired.

679
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:39,390
Why...

680
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:41,430
Why all of a sudden?

681
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,825
What happened between you and Hoo Joon?

682
00:47:45,825 --> 00:47:50,290
The special project with him could've been ruined.

683
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:51,120
What?

684
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:55,179
You fight with celebrities now?

685
00:47:55,179 --> 00:47:57,948
I had my reasons.

686
00:47:57,948 --> 00:48:00,430
Do you know what he called us?

687
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:02,800
He called us trash. How do I let that go?

688
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,720
Out of nowhere?

689
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,640
The situation was unclear.

690
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,320
I had the camera around my neck.

691
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,970
- He thought I was taking... 
 - So you were trash.

692
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:11,720
Chief.

693
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:12,840
Is that unfair?

694
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,390
I don't understand.

695
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:16,270
I thought you'd say okay.

696
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:18,920
Do you see how hard I work?

697
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:19,979
I'm Lee Geunyoung.

698
00:48:19,979 --> 00:48:23,620
I worked on Christmas and on New Year's.

699
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,410
So what have you done?

700
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:27,320
You haven't had an original idea.

701
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:31,070
You've seen more than 10 of my ideas.

702
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,280
   

703
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,180
Mr. Lee.

704
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:39,060
Long time no see.

705
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,279
How are you?

706
00:48:40,279 --> 00:48:42,330
Who do you have nowadays?

707
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:45,150
Hello, I'm Oh Inhyung.

708
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:50,379
She used to be in Florence; a girl group.

709
00:48:50,379 --> 00:48:51,970
She must be old.

710
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:53,430
I'll work hard.

711
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,580
Please, Mr. Lee.

712
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:58,040
I don't have any power.

713
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,779
That's Hoo Joon.

714
00:48:59,779 --> 00:49:01,100
Wait a minute.

715
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:04,270
Hand him our project.

716
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:12,720
Hoo Joon.

717
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,979
How long has it been?

718
00:49:14,979 --> 00:49:16,120
Hello, Mr. Lee.

719
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,260
Hello.

720
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,220
This time...

721
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:23,020
- We have a special... 
 - Can we check our schedule first?

722
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,979
We have to get moving now.

723
00:49:24,979 --> 00:49:27,312
Sure.

724
00:49:27,312 --> 00:49:28,720
Please look into it.

725
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,770
Please.

726
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:30,930
Hoo Joon,

727
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:33,430
please look into it.

728
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:34,470
Sure.

729
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:36,590
You're producing it.

730
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:39,120
Thank you.

731
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:45,890
Mr. Lee,

732
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:48,640
I see that you have a project.

733
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,640
Can we have a meeting?

734
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,870
I'll work hard. I'll do it well.

735
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:08,770
Thank you.

736
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:11,370
Give us a call.

737
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:14,630
Inhyung,

738
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:16,470
what brings you here?

739
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:20,079
Have you been well?

740
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:22,770
You two know each other?

741
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:23,970
Of course.

742
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:26,390
We're close.

743
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:27,440
She's good, Mr. Lee.

744
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,520
Oh! Of course.

745
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:33,390
Please come onto our show sometime.

746
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:35,750
Okay. I'll get going first.

747
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:38,740
- Bye, Inhyung. 
 - Goodbye.

748
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:52,580
Be careful, guys.

749
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:57,280
No need to work your butts off like me.

750
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,040
If I'm gone, one of you has to take over my work.

751
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,470
Who will?

752
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:04,360
You?

753
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,570
Be quiet and leave.

754
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:08,310
Where are you to intigate?

755
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:10,179
You think this will make a difference?

756
00:51:10,179 --> 00:51:12,290
This should.

757
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:13,960
They should know.

758
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:18,030
The harsh words you hurt people with

759
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:21,230
will not help you in the future.

760
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:23,690
Look at me. I'm abandoned.

761
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:26,290
No one here will teach me about loyalty.

762
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:30,579
I should at least let them see the reality.

763
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:40,760
I'm letting you hit me.

764
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,930
So that you'll feel bad for a long time.

765
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:44,250
Maybe not now.

766
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:47,060
But you will later.

767
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:49,420
At least if you have a conscience.

768
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:50,852
Right.

769
00:51:50,852 --> 00:51:54,760
I hope you meet a boss like that.

770
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:06,100
Senior, please take your strawberry juice.

771
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,730
Going somewhere?

772
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:49,820
Why do you do this to me?

773
00:52:50,779 --> 00:52:54,350
I didn't even take a sip yet.

774
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:56,700
I'm so frustrated.

775
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:49,500
   

776
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:21,670
 Your call has been forwarded... 

777
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,500
 I'm at work. 

778
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,700
   

779
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:30,579
 Nope. 

780
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:44,300
   

781
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:49,090
   

782
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:52,320
I must be insane.

783
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:56,360
So expensive for a litmus paper.

784
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:02,000
   

785
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,000
Funny?

786
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:07,950
   

787
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:12,050
You made me lose my job?

788
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,790
You look disgusting.

789
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,750
Hold on, mister!

790
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:39,800
   

791
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,700
Come here!

792
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:10,379
Who...

793
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:12,210
Who are you!

794
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:16,080
This... crime of invading other people's homes. Under Article 319 of the Criminal Code, imprisonment for up to three years

795
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,000
or a fine of up to 5 million won—

796
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,779
Go. Just go.

797
00:56:19,779 --> 00:56:24,310
Today's not the day so leave.

798
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:27,970
You guys are so steamy.

799
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:30,830
I accept my mistakes.

800
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:32,840
But who is he to fire me?

801
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,979
I was a journalist.

802
00:56:34,979 --> 00:56:38,170
You know how hard I worked at Wonder Woman.

803
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:39,970
I'll expose him.

804
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:43,310
I was fired because of him.

805
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:45,930
You were. Drink and relax.

806
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:48,850
And go back...

807
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:50,879
to your place.

808
00:56:50,879 --> 00:56:52,580
Please go.

809
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,020
Mijeong.

810
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:55,970
What?

811
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:58,470
I'm staying here.

812
00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:00,590
Why?

813
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:03,500
Why would you stay here?

814
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,710
They cut off my power and water.

815
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:09,380
So move somewhere.

816
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:11,120
I could do that.

817
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,636
If it wasn't under my mom's name.

818
00:57:13,636 --> 00:57:15,670
Just for a while.

819
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:17,000
Please.

820
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,179
If I get reinstated, I'll leave.

821
00:57:21,179 --> 00:57:23,210
Do you have a plan?

822
00:57:35,079 --> 00:57:37,520
 What's your business here? 

823
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,740
I'm here to see Hoo Joon.

824
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:41,750
 Please contact his manager. 

825
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:45,579
I have his number but...

826
00:57:49,850 --> 00:57:51,570
You can't just go in there.

827
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:52,500
Mister,

828
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,960
I'm not a salesman.

829
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,370
I have business here.

830
00:57:55,370 --> 00:57:57,420
I see that you're his fan.

831
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:59,979
You can't walk in. Look at them.

832
00:57:59,979 --> 00:58:01,280
Mister!

833
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,890
What makes you think I'm his fan?

834
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:04,979
Then?

835
00:58:04,979 --> 00:58:06,210
I'm a journalist.

836
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:08,200
Get out.

837
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:11,370
Goodbye.

838
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:37,440
 I don't know if you still use this number, but thanks. 

839
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:55,990
♫  Baby, you~  I still love you  ♫

840
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:04,340
♫  Baby, you~  I'm still with you  ♫

841
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:10,360
♫  And in the cold, girl, I hold you close  ♫

842
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:14,310
♫  I will wake up from now?  ♫

843
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:21,120
♫  Baby, you~  I'm still with you  ♫

844
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:25,390
♫  With you  ♫

845
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:42,280
I knew this guy was shady.

846
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:44,455
Many people think he's shady.

847
00:59:44,455 --> 00:59:45,229
Really?

848
00:59:45,229 --> 00:59:46,690
Look at this.

849
00:59:46,690 --> 00:59:49,500
Him with the middle finger.

850
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,670
You can't even see his face.

851
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:53,420
I saw him in person.

852
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:55,520
His annoying finger.

853
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,710
I can tell by his silhouette.

854
00:59:57,710 --> 01:00:00,079
- So annoying. 
 - Hold on a second.

855
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:02,420
I thought you got kicked out.

856
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:04,830
You should plan your future.

857
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:06,350
Don't worry.

858
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:11,920
I'm not holding back anymore for this guy.

859
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:17,460
 I'm revealing the duplicity of Who Joon. 

860
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:23,120
 Who Joon, a top star, was violent with a woman. 

861
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:27,690
 Regardless, many people love him 

862
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:30,360
 because they don't know who he really is. 

863
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:34,779
 Before he embarrasses Korea on the world stage, 

864
01:00:34,779 --> 01:00:40,470
 I, Lee Geunyoung, will expose the truth about him. 

865
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:44,580
 I attached the detailed file account. 

866
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:50,240
 Contact me if you have any questions. 

867
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,700
   

868
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:03,950


869
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:11,130
♫  I'm your Pop Star  ♫

870
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:16,000
♫  Oh yeah, eh  ♫

871
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:23,330

872

873
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:30,560
♫  Oh, every day, every time  ♫

874
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,510
♫  If you can hear me  ♫

875
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:35,530
♫  If you can hear me  ♫

876
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:37,030
 They say she's done. 

877
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:37,790
 She was fired? 

878
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:38,450
 Lee Geunyoung! 

879
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:39,679
 Are you his anti-fan? 

880
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:40,980
 Yes! It's me! 

881
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:44,979
  I'm the one who can debunk his duplicity!  

882
01:01:44,979 --> 01:01:45,670
 Are you okay? 

883
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:49,600
 I'll even embrace my anti-fan. 

884
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:52,440
 Lee Geunyoung? I'm a producer from GBC. 

885
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,360
 A reality show? 

886
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:56,312
 "So I Married The Anti-Fan" 

887
01:01:56,312 --> 01:01:58,270
 Marry Hoo Joon? 

888
01:01:58,270 --> 01:02:02,280
 Will people believe me when I'm famous? 

889
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:05,020
♫  Where the light shines when I open my eyes  ♫

890
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:06,810
♫   I'll be standing right there   ♫

891
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:10,820
