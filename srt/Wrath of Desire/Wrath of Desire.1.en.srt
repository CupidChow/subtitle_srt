1
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,792
As once promised,

2
00:01:26,917 --> 00:01:31,042
I dance to mourn you.

3
00:01:54,792 --> 00:01:58,042
Who took your life?

4
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:03,375
Who was the killer?

5
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,600
(Wrath of Desire)

6
00:02:23,292 --> 00:02:24,042
Give it!

7
00:02:57,792 --> 00:02:59,500
You went too far

8
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:02,083
with the burglar.

9
00:03:05,292 --> 00:03:06,333
I found them.

10
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,375
The photo and the bank book.

11
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:10,208
Yes.

12
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:12,042
Okay.

13
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:26,625
Why take my bank book?

14
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,000
We want proof

15
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,458
of your relationship with the mayor.

16
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:37,542
We don’t have a "relationship".

17
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,583
How to understand life’s casual cruelty?

18
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:11,792
Are violence and death
just natural phenomena?

19
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:20,208
Your dad must be so proud of you!

20
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:23,208
We will now recognize a graduate.

21
00:04:24,042 --> 00:04:24,667
Dad!

22
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:28,125
You can’t acknowledge me in public.

23
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,583
Let’s welcome the mayor
to present the award.

24
00:04:37,292 --> 00:04:39,417
We also welcome Phoenix Du to receive

25
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:41,625
the highest honor, the Mayor’s Award.

26
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,542
Photographer, you can take the picture.

27
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:48,083
Thank you, Mayor.

28
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,583
May I invite my mom on stage,

29
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,125
to join me in the picture?

30
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:53,500
Of course.

31
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,917
Mrs. Du, please join us on stage.

32
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,292
Between us, mom.

33
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,958
Mayor, are rumors of your affair true?

34
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,208
It’s all nonsense.

35
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,458
Mrs. Mayor,

36
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,375
it’s claimed that to get your husband back,

37
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,542
you negotiated in private with Miss Du.

38
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,125
Is this her in the picture?

39
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:21,958
Make it clear.
Look!

40
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,000
I don’t know any Miss Du.

41
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,333
Please don’t frame me with random women.

42
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,792
Do you believe the smear is timed
for the election?

43
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,000
Stay strong, Phoenix.
Protect our family name.

44
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,417
I’m wanted back in hell.

45
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:38,375
Mom!

46
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:42,625
Mom!

47
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:35,917
How to understand life’s casual cruelties?

48
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:41,500
I must already be in hell.

49
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,542
How’s the burglar?

50
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,917
The doctor said, even if he wakes up,

51
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,500
he might stay in a vegetative state.

52
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,042
What will be, will be.
I’ll take responsibility.

53
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,292
It’s good that you accept your guilt.

54
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:24,583
I’ll request bail from the judge.

55
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,000
But...

56
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,333
you mustn’t miss your court date.

57
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,542
You graduated from NTNU’s College of Arts.

58
00:07:45,042 --> 00:07:46,458
You could teach painting.

59
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,167
Why become a tattoo artist?

60
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:52,500
I can’t teach.

61
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,125
Why?

62
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,583
You've won many awards.

63
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,208
I like tattoos. They’re real.

64
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,208
Are they more real

65
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:10,375
because they’re on your body?

66
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,458
The body never lies. Only the heart lies.

67
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:30,708
Do you recognize the letters on the table?

68
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,042
Yes.

69
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,667
They were written to me.

70
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,417
But Phoenix Du and I were never together.

71
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:56,292
What is it?

72
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,250
A new bathrobe.

73
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:02,792
I’ll need your help later.

74
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:07,667
We only knew each other

75
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,917
because she assaulted a burglar

76
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:12,667
four years ago.

77
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,083
I was the prosecutor who bailed her.

78
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,292
It looks like a violent struggle.

79
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,958
Yes. But according to her
written statement,

80
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,333
the attack was upstairs.

81
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,750
Family portrait at Phoenix’s ceremony

82
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:54,500
What are you doing?

83
00:09:55,292 --> 00:09:56,583
Don’t touch my things!

84
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,042
Get up! Stand up!

85
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,000
It’s alright.
Let her sit.

86
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:07,167
Can you confirm

87
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:08,583
that this was the crime scene?

88
00:10:38,917 --> 00:10:39,750
Ms. Du,

89
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:43,125
do you need a ride into town?

90
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:45,625
It’s late and hard to find taxis.

91
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:49,208
Thanks.

92
00:10:54,292 --> 00:10:57,542
I ran into her after she was bailed.

93
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,375
I thought

94
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,250
it was okay to give her a ride.

95
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:07,542
But, unexpectedly,

96
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:09,792
there was an accident that night.

97
00:11:10,542 --> 00:11:11,167
Are you alright?

98
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:13,250
What do you think?

99
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:15,833
Get back in the car.

100
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:29,458
Who sent you?!

101
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,417
Hold tight!

102
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:52,042
Who sent you?!

103
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:53,917
The Mayor is running for President.

104
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:55,042
You either disappear,

105
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,208
or go back to jail.

106
00:11:58,292 --> 00:11:59,417
His wife’s behind it?

107
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,667
It’s the Mayor’s orders.

108
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,708
How you assaulted them violated...

109
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:28,583
It wouldn’t make a difference.

110
00:12:56,917 --> 00:12:57,667
That night,

111
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,500
I witnessed

112
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,875
Phoenix Du’s fighting ability,

113
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,333
and her violent nature.

114
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,667
It was too late before I realized

115
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,625
that I should be scared of her too.

116
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,042
We should have called the police.

117
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:18,750
How?

118
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,708
It was a do or die moment.

119
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,583
But you struck them with the car!

120
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,583
According to the law,

121
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:29,417
Go make your phone call!

122
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:30,875
Just try!

123
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,375
Call them if you can.

124
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,250
Let go of me!

125
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,792
But you have to stay alive first!

126
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,333
You don't know the situation.

127
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,833
You’ve broken the law!

128
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,042
I don’t care!

129
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,292
I was a sinner the second I was born.

130
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,125
Everyone is a sinner.

131
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:57,458
But...

132
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:00,875
God will forgive you. You know that?

133
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,667
How can you be so naive?

134
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,458
Don’t hold back.

135
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,542
Let yourself go.

136
00:16:43,042 --> 00:16:43,917
God!

137
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,917
Your flushed flesh and gasping breath,

138
00:17:11,917 --> 00:17:18,875
are all that have meaning
in this world gone to hell.

139
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:47,083
You are the only oasis
in an endless desert.

140
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:55,375
I long to give myself to you.

141
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,208
Jade,

142
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:20,917
never forget.

143
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:22,792
You’re the pastor’s daughter.

144
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:32,625
Repent!

145
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,292
And God will cure you!

146
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,250
But mom...

147
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,208
Why’s it wrong to like my English teacher?

148
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,625
Your teacher is a man!

149
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:45,250
I’m sorry.

150
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,583
It’s okay.

151
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,542
Let’s have no secrets from God.

152
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,750
Let’s confess to Him.

153
00:18:55,042 --> 00:18:57,417
Repent.

154
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,333
Repent.

155
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,292
I must ask the judge to revoke your bail.

156
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:58,125
Fine. Whatever.

157
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,875
We...

158
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:06,167
We should stop seeing each other.

159
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,333
Why?

160
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,083
We shouldn’t blaspheme before God.

161
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,458
How can love be blasphemous?

162
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,750
It’s lust! Not love!

163
00:20:45,792 --> 00:20:47,500
What are you confessing?

164
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,000
Why confess?! What are you afraid of?

165
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,458
Are you confessing your orgasm?

166
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:53,500
Enough!

167
00:20:54,292 --> 00:20:55,042
Let me go.

168
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,000
Let me go!

169
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,708
I won’t have any further relationship
with you.

170
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,958
We’re already in a relationship.

171
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:13,125
Fine.

172
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,125
Let’s have a "relationship".

173
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,750
I’m the prosecutor.

174
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,167
You’re the suspect.

175
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,875
When your crime is proven,

176
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,208
I’ll convict you.

177
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,375
Okay.

178
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,833
If loving you is a crime, do what you must.

179
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,208
Defendant Phoenix Du

180
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:21,208
confronted Chen, the burglar,

181
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:24,250
at 11:25pm, April 20th, 2016.

182
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:26,292
Although she had the right
to defend herself,

183
00:22:26,292 --> 00:22:27,833
the accused used excessive force,

184
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,667
which resulted in Chen’s death.

185
00:22:30,042 --> 00:22:32,583
According to Article #284
of the Criminal Code,

186
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,208
it is a clear case
of involuntary man slaughter.

187
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,792
Your Honor,

188
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,917
I request a sentence of...

189
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:41,708
3 years and 6 months.

190
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,708
Phoenix Du, please present your defense.

191
00:22:50,042 --> 00:22:52,292
Defendant, do you have a response

192
00:22:52,292 --> 00:22:53,958
to the prosecutor’s statement?

193
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:03,125
I plead guilty.

194
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,225
In the world’s eyes, you’ve imprisoned me.

195
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:11,917
But in truth,
you’re only punishing yourself.

196
00:23:11,917 --> 00:23:15,167
It was your only escape from loving me.

197
00:23:25,542 --> 00:23:26,500
Give me the letters to be posted.

198
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,625
Bro Phoenix, you never stop writing!

199
00:23:32,417 --> 00:23:33,333
Fuck you, rookie!

200
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:35,250
You dare touch Bro’s stuff?

201
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:36,208
What the hell?

202
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:37,958
#5302 has no letters to send.

203
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:47,292
Do you know the person in the photo?

204
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:55,333
Of course I know her.

205
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:59,792
We were jailbirds together.

206
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,583
Don’t you know what that means?

207
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:12,708
Where do you want the green onions?

208
00:24:14,417 --> 00:24:15,500
Can’t you see they’re all chopped here?

209
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,083
Take them inside!

210
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:32,042
Stop dilly-dallying.

211
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:32,750
Aren’t you done!

212
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:35,917
Yes, I’m coming!

213
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:38,458
The kitchen is so fucking hot.

214
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:41,458
You’re lucky to be assigned here. Let’s go!

215
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:53,625
Yadi!

216
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:56,250
A dancer!

217
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:58,542
A dancer? You?

218
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:00,792
Join us.

219
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,083
We’ll celebrate Sis Bing’s birthday later.

220
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:05,542
Why don’t you hang with us?

221
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:08,042
You can celebrate birthdays inside?

222
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:09,667
It depends who you are.

223
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:11,917
Not just anyone can smoke on the job.

224
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,625
Can I borrow a light?

225
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:33,750
Your tattoos are so pretty.

226
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:35,167
Did you get them here?

227
00:25:39,292 --> 00:25:40,958
Chrys, hurry up!

228
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:05,167
Sis Bing, happy birthday.

229
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:09,625
Where you going?
Dance for the boss, won’t you?

230
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,458
Right. Aren’t you a dancer?

231
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:13,583
Give us a striptease!

232
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:18,292
Strip! Strip! Strip!

233
00:26:21,958 --> 00:26:23,208
Get your clothes off.

234
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:24,958
I’m a dancer.

235
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,333
Not a stripper.

236
00:26:29,417 --> 00:26:31,583
Sis Bing likes to show newbies
who’s the boss.

237
00:26:32,292 --> 00:26:34,792
I think Bing fancies her.

238
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:35,583
Don’t act so innocent!

239
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:37,375
Let’s chop the rest of the onions.

240
00:26:43,167 --> 00:26:45,958
It ain’t a birthday party
without a birthday suit!

241
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:47,917
Let me help you!

242
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:49,833
Let me take it off!

243
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:50,375
What’d you say?!

244
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:53,292
Don’t be so rude!

245
00:26:53,292 --> 00:26:54,542
This ain’t kitchen business.

246
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,250
What are you doing?

247
00:26:57,167 --> 00:26:58,042
Sis Bing,

248
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:00,583
a little respect here, okay?

249
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:16,000
What the fuck?

250
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,333
Don’t the performing arts deserve respect?

251
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:22,667
Give the dancer more time.

252
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:23,958
Tomorrow she’ll dance for us!

253
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:28,208
My Little Chrysanthemum...

254
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,542
Come!

255
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:33,208
Don’t be scared!

256
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:38,708
You’ll dance for us tomorrow.
We’re so excited!

257
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:42,458
Dance or die!

258
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:44,458
Strip for me tomorrow.

259
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:52,875
Ms. Dishwasher,

260
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:54,792
you want to win her back?

261
00:27:55,292 --> 00:27:56,208
No problem.

262
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:58,792
I’ll give you your chance.

263
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:01,333
Perform with her tomorrow.

264
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,917
Celebrate my birthday together.

265
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:09,458
Get moving!

266
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:11,625
Let’s go! Until tomorrow.

267
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:21,250
Xiao An, where’s the peeler?

268
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,583
Right here!

269
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,125
Thanks for yesterday.

270
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:32,292
You dare to come here?

271
00:28:32,458 --> 00:28:33,875
Don’t involve the kitchen staff, okay?

272
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,042
I’m scared.

273
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:38,958
I don’t know what to do.

274
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:42,000
And why should we give a damn!

275
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:45,667
You two, get more onions.

276
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:57,292
Are you a dancer?

277
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,125
Hmm.

278
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:02,250
I went to dance academy.

279
00:29:03,292 --> 00:29:04,375
You know Butoh?

280
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:07,792
The Japanese Dance of Darkness?

281
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:22,833
Striptease.

282
00:30:21,292 --> 00:30:22,792
Sis Bing...

283
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:25,000
Happy birthday.

284
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:32,375
Congratulations.

285
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:36,042
You’re one year closer to death!

286
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:43,667
Fuck you!

287
00:30:44,708 --> 00:30:45,500
Beat them!

288
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:47,750
Fuck! Fuck you!

289
00:30:48,792 --> 00:30:50,083
You think you’re smart? Fuck!

290
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:01,792
Get out of my way!

291
00:31:05,417 --> 00:31:06,542
What’s all this? Squat!

292
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:07,750
Hands behind your heads.

293
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,042
Squat!

294
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:12,958
What’s all this!

295
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:15,875
Hands behind your head!

296
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:24,250
My first impression of Phoenix,

297
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:26,875
was that...

298
00:31:27,917 --> 00:31:29,667
she’d risen from hell.

299
00:31:33,042 --> 00:31:34,417
She had no fear of pain.

300
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:38,458
She didn’t care about dying.

301
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:40,208
It was like she didn’t need anyone.

302
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:08,625
Didn’t you say you weren’t a lesbian?

303
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,542
It depends who’s asking!

304
00:32:24,917 --> 00:32:25,667
Just lie back.

305
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:27,542
And enjoy it.

306
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:43,083
The body doesn’t lie.

307
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:46,792
What?

308
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,917
The body doesn’t lie.

309
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:57,167
You love me.

310
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:16,167
The next case will start in 30 minutes.

311
00:33:16,167 --> 00:33:16,875
Come back on time.
Understood.

312
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:19,500
What are you doing?

313
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:21,375
Keep moving.

314
00:33:24,208 --> 00:33:25,417
Never forget you love me.

315
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:38,917
Afterwards,

316
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:43,708
She was like a dream

317
00:33:45,042 --> 00:33:48,292
that dissipated and left no trace.

318
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:09,042
The next few years,

319
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,250
I worked non-stop.

320
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:17,208
I filled every hour with work,

321
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:22,083
until I met him,

322
00:34:25,042 --> 00:34:26,125
Meng Ye.

323
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:29,458
Out!

324
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:44,292
Defendant Meng Ye, 22,
is a model’s assistant.

325
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,542
Charged with premeditated assault.

326
00:34:47,917 --> 00:34:51,583
After his parents died,
his cousin took him in

327
00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:53,708
His cousin is really something.

328
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:55,958
Director of Dafang TV’s brokerage department.

329
00:34:55,958 --> 00:34:56,917
Yin Wei.

330
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,958
Yin Wei’s attorney claimed,

331
00:34:58,958 --> 00:35:01,417
they wanted to teach
the ungrateful kid a lesson.

332
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:05,542
The injury assessment report
and evidence is prepped.

333
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,375
Did you stab your cousin inside?

334
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:39,792
Hmm.

335
00:35:40,667 --> 00:35:42,708
Please cooperate with my colleagues.

336
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:43,500
And reenact

337
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:45,708
exactly how you stabbed your cousin.

338
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:50,625
How should I demonstrate?

339
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:55,042
Will you handcuff me again?

340
00:36:44,042 --> 00:36:46,542
Do these belong to you?

341
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:50,042
My cousin uses them for play.

342
00:36:52,042 --> 00:36:53,250
What do you mean exactly?

343
00:36:59,542 --> 00:37:01,375
He sometimes wanted to
have his way with me.

344
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:07,583
Can you tell us

345
00:37:07,917 --> 00:37:10,000
what happened that day?

346
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:14,250
He asked me to take off my clothes.

347
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:22,417
He said he liked me rail-thin.

348
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,792
If I gained weight and strength,

349
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:31,667
he wouldn’t be able to control me.

350
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:35,625
How did he control you?

351
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:41,667
Didn’t you ask me to show you?

352
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:45,208
Like this.

353
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:48,500
He handcuffed me to the bed.

354
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:54,708
I was too tired that day.

355
00:37:56,417 --> 00:37:58,042
If I could have put up with it,

356
00:37:58,792 --> 00:38:00,833
I wouldn’t have accidentally stabbed him.

357
00:38:02,042 --> 00:38:03,708
I’m sorry, sister.

358
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:07,167
I mean Prosecutor.

359
00:38:10,542 --> 00:38:12,208
He’s the victim, not the defendant.

360
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,125
Give me the key to the handcuffs.

361
00:38:23,833 --> 00:38:26,583
Thank you, Prosecutor.

362
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:32,542
It’s alright.

363
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:34,000
You can call me sister.

364
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,083
Clerk.

365
00:38:43,417 --> 00:38:45,667
We recommend a restraining order
on the plaintiff

366
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:47,917
to keep at least 10 meters from Meng Ye.

367
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:50,500
I trust you understand.

368
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:54,667
The court should protect the victim,
not the perpetrator!

369
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,833
The judge will decide

370
00:38:58,292 --> 00:38:59,667
who is the victim and
who is the perpetrator.

371
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:00,875
Court is dismissed.

372
00:39:03,042 --> 00:39:05,125
Do you believe Meng Ye is so helpless?

373
00:39:06,917 --> 00:39:08,000
He is a beast!

374
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:09,625
And only I...

375
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,542
Only I can subdue him.

376
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:14,208
He was forced

377
00:39:14,792 --> 00:39:16,000
to become a beast, wasn’t he?

378
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:18,792
I never forced him.

379
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:21,333
He was always willing.

380
00:39:23,667 --> 00:39:24,458
Mr. Yin,

381
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,708
it’s my responsibility to remind you,

382
00:39:27,958 --> 00:39:30,458
the restraining order takes effect
in 4 hours.

383
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:34,583
If you even unintentionally
approach Meng Ye,

384
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:36,583
you will be immediately arrested.

385
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:44,375
You’ll regret this!

386
00:39:57,167 --> 00:39:58,083
Isn’t that Meng Ye?

387
00:40:01,417 --> 00:40:01,875
Sister!

388
00:40:03,292 --> 00:40:03,958
What are you doing here?

389
00:40:05,292 --> 00:40:06,625
I brought home-made cookies

390
00:40:07,667 --> 00:40:08,500
to thank you.

391
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,708
This kid is calling you sister.

392
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:12,458
Yes,

393
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:13,500
he’s very pure.

394
00:40:22,417 --> 00:40:24,000
There are veggies at home.

395
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,125
Let’s see what ingredients I need.

396
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:25,833
Instant noodles!

397
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:28,125
So unhealthy.

398
00:40:32,292 --> 00:40:34,250
Sis, let me cook today.

399
00:40:35,292 --> 00:40:37,417
No need. Hang this up.

400
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:38,750
Sure.

401
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:52,042
Sis,

402
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:56,417
why can I smell a man on this bathrobe?

403
00:40:57,167 --> 00:40:59,083
What man? Stop talking nonsense.

404
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,375
Sis, why no boyfriend?

405
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:08,042
Not interested.

406
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:11,958
How about a girlfriend?

407
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:15,042
Stop talking nonsense.

408
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:38,958
Sex without love is as empty

409
00:41:38,958 --> 00:41:42,625
as violence without hate inside.

410
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:47,500
I don’t want to forget
that I love you, Jade.

411
00:41:54,917 --> 00:41:55,958
Are you out of your mind?

412
00:41:58,208 --> 00:41:59,917
Do you feel empty with me?

413
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:02,292
Why?

414
00:42:09,542 --> 00:42:10,542
You read my private letter.

415
00:42:12,167 --> 00:42:14,333
I didn’t even peek when you fell asleep.

416
00:42:26,542 --> 00:42:27,292
Tell me,

417
00:42:28,708 --> 00:42:30,250
when I’m doing things to you,

418
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,833
don’t you feel anything at all?

419
00:42:33,375 --> 00:42:34,250
Feel what?

420
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:39,250
Even when Sis Bing threatened me,
I rejected her.

421
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:40,958
How can you ask me what you should feel?

422
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:43,792
You don’t I don’t normally have sex
with just anyone?

423
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,042
Then don’t!

424
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:50,625
I want you!

425
00:42:50,917 --> 00:42:53,042
Sis Bing said you won me, so I’m yours.

426
00:42:57,458 --> 00:42:58,667
You belong to yourself.

427
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:04,292
You think the person you write to

428
00:43:04,292 --> 00:43:06,292
will wait for you?

429
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,167
Meng Ye!

430
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:50,708
Sis!

431
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:54,583
You’re so amazing!

432
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:55,292
Thank you.
This is for you.

433
00:43:57,292 --> 00:43:58,000
Thanks for coming.

434
00:44:00,625 --> 00:44:03,083
Meng Ye, is this your sister?

435
00:44:06,667 --> 00:44:07,833
She’s my girlfriend!

436
00:44:10,042 --> 00:44:10,917
Is she?

437
00:44:12,208 --> 00:44:12,958
You think your boyfriend

438
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:15,875
looks good in women’s dresses?

439
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:21,083
Of course!

440
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:23,208
No one looked better than Meng Ye tonight.

441
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:26,542
Let’s go.

442
00:44:27,542 --> 00:44:29,208
Let’s have something to eat.

443
00:44:30,792 --> 00:44:31,250
Sis,

444
00:44:31,417 --> 00:44:33,083
can I sleep on your sofa tonight?

445
00:44:33,292 --> 00:44:34,000
Of course.

446
00:44:36,208 --> 00:44:37,625
It’s good you’re with me tonight.

447
00:44:40,542 --> 00:44:43,167
Because I’m cooking dumplings, right?

448
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:46,458
Help yourself.

449
00:44:47,667 --> 00:44:48,625
No.

450
00:44:49,125 --> 00:44:50,042
Without you,

451
00:44:51,625 --> 00:44:53,542
I’d still...

452
00:44:57,333 --> 00:44:59,125
I’d still be imprisoned in the mansion,

453
00:45:01,208 --> 00:45:03,042
or in jail until now.

454
00:45:07,792 --> 00:45:09,542
I'd never imagine this.

455
00:45:13,083 --> 00:45:14,667
It’s all okay now.

456
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:18,500
Have dumplings!

457
00:45:24,792 --> 00:45:25,833
Don’t stay up late.

458
00:45:27,042 --> 00:45:27,583
Good night.

459
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:29,458
Sis,

460
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:37,958
I’ve always

461
00:45:37,958 --> 00:45:39,750
used my body

462
00:45:40,375 --> 00:45:42,042
to get what I wanted.

463
00:45:44,417 --> 00:45:45,458
Do you want it?

464
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,833
Why would you think such a thing?

465
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:09,250
I’m afraid if I don’t give you something,

466
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,958
my luck won’t last.

467
00:46:15,542 --> 00:46:17,375
I don’t want anything from you.

468
00:46:19,917 --> 00:46:20,875
Nothing.

469
00:46:22,667 --> 00:46:24,000
Stop thinking too much.

470
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:34,000
Why are you so kind to me?

471
00:46:40,375 --> 00:46:42,958
No one ever treated me so nice.

472
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:56,375
Meng Ye,

473
00:47:01,208 --> 00:47:02,250
I used to have...

474
00:47:05,208 --> 00:47:06,833
a younger brother.

475
00:47:10,292 --> 00:47:11,792
He was your age.

476
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:16,667
Sheng,

477
00:47:18,083 --> 00:47:19,083
what are you doing?

478
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,667
Don’t come near.

479
00:47:23,958 --> 00:47:24,833
Sis,

480
00:47:25,875 --> 00:47:27,500
is desire so dirty?

481
00:47:28,542 --> 00:47:30,542
I'm so dirty, right?

482
00:47:32,625 --> 00:47:34,458
We’ll purify ourselves.

483
00:47:34,958 --> 00:47:36,750
We just need to pray.

484
00:47:37,083 --> 00:47:38,208
Please come down.

485
00:47:38,208 --> 00:47:39,750
But I love my teacher.

486
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:41,333
I really love him so much.

487
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,500
Sheng!

488
00:48:04,958 --> 00:48:06,500
So...

489
00:48:08,333 --> 00:48:10,042
I want you to be okay.

490
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:15,000
How can I be okay?

491
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,917
I don’t even have a home.

492
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:23,792
You can treat this as your home.

493
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:27,875
Do you mean it?

494
00:48:30,292 --> 00:48:31,333
Of course I mean it.

495
00:48:34,167 --> 00:48:35,000
Don’t worry.

496
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:38,458
You’ll always be welcome here.

497
00:50:10,792 --> 00:50:11,667
God!

498
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,575
Desire is the only truth.

499
00:50:24,575 --> 00:50:26,792
The body never lies.

500
00:50:26,792 --> 00:50:30,708
Don’t forget you love me.

501
00:50:40,292 --> 00:50:41,167
Bro Phoenix,

502
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:43,875
Chrys’ fighting a newbie.

503
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:44,833
But she’s Sis Bing’s bitch.

504
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:46,417
Sis Bing sent her gang to beat her.

505
00:50:47,917 --> 00:50:49,250
The newbie kept asking about you,

506
00:50:49,375 --> 00:50:51,833
Chrys got jealous and called her a slut.

507
00:50:51,833 --> 00:50:54,958
She called her used goods for
wanting you back.

508
00:50:59,292 --> 00:51:00,250
Fuck! Filthy whore.

509
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:04,250
Get up!

510
00:51:09,083 --> 00:51:09,833
Sis Bing.

511
00:51:11,167 --> 00:51:12,083
Fucking trash!

512
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,375
Like being a bitch, don’t you?

513
00:51:16,167 --> 00:51:17,208
Get up.

514
00:51:21,875 --> 00:51:23,292
Oh, you’re hurt.

515
00:51:24,208 --> 00:51:25,458
Aren’t you special?

516
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:27,792
Ain’t there a mouth on you?

517
00:51:27,917 --> 00:51:28,542
Sis Bing,

518
00:51:30,792 --> 00:51:31,500
let it go.

519
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:33,667
I’m teaching my girls.
Not your business.

520
00:51:35,083 --> 00:51:36,083
My side started it.

521
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,375
So you want your sloppy seconds back?

522
00:51:41,708 --> 00:51:42,333
She ain’t...

523
00:51:42,417 --> 00:51:43,917
This has nothing to do
with the kitchen staff.

524
00:51:43,917 --> 00:51:45,500
Then shut the fuck up!

525
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:03,167
Do I need to ask you?

526
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:21,458
The more you struggle,
the more you’ll suffer.

527
00:52:21,458 --> 00:52:22,250
You hear me?
Enough!

528
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:27,000
You can kill her before you finish a smoke.

529
00:52:33,208 --> 00:52:33,875
Okay.

530
00:52:36,875 --> 00:52:39,875
Have sex with her in front of me,

531
00:52:40,292 --> 00:52:42,250
and I’ll let the bitch go.

532
00:52:44,125 --> 00:52:45,458
Bro Phoenix, help me.

533
00:52:58,917 --> 00:53:00,000
Little Chrysanthemum,

534
00:53:00,792 --> 00:53:02,667
it’s a special gift from me.

535
00:53:03,208 --> 00:53:04,208
How do you like it?

536
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:24,292
There’s always altercations inside.

537
00:53:24,292 --> 00:53:27,667
By confessing to you, I get my redemption.

538
00:53:27,667 --> 00:53:30,542
And you, you’ll soon leave your prison too.

539
00:53:30,542 --> 00:53:34,083
Wait for me.

540
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,958
I’ll be released tomorrow.

541
00:53:41,833 --> 00:53:42,417
Hmm.

542
00:53:50,208 --> 00:53:51,208
I’ll wait for you.

543
00:53:52,542 --> 00:53:53,167
No need.

544
00:53:53,875 --> 00:53:55,750
Just deliver my letters to her.

545
00:53:56,583 --> 00:53:58,208
You’re so sure she’s waiting?

546
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,667
If you don’t want to,
leave them at my shop.

547
00:54:07,125 --> 00:54:08,542
Okay, I’ve got it.

548
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:10,708
I’ll hand deliver the letters myself.

549
00:54:27,625 --> 00:54:29,000
Is Jade Liu home?

550
00:54:29,083 --> 00:54:30,125
Your name?

551
00:54:32,458 --> 00:54:35,125
Tell her Phoenix Du has something for her.

552
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,167
Phoenix Du?

553
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:40,000
You can leave them with me.

554
00:54:40,583 --> 00:54:41,667
I can’t.

555
00:54:42,792 --> 00:54:45,500
Bro Phoenix told me to personally
deliver them.

556
00:54:46,792 --> 00:54:48,167
But she’s resting now.

557
00:54:49,083 --> 00:54:50,125
You’re so full of shit.

558
00:54:50,875 --> 00:54:51,958
I’ll come back tomorrow.

559
00:54:53,417 --> 00:54:53,833
Sis!
Wait!

560
00:55:00,875 --> 00:55:03,292
You’re Prosecutor Liu.

561
00:55:04,375 --> 00:55:04,833
Yes.

562
00:55:09,083 --> 00:55:11,208
Phoenix Du instructed me to
hand them to you.

563
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:17,083
They’re the letters she’s been writing you

564
00:55:18,208 --> 00:55:19,042
for over three years.

565
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:21,208
That means,

566
00:55:22,125 --> 00:55:22,917
she’ll be released soon?

567
00:55:24,917 --> 00:55:25,458
Pretty soon.

568
00:55:26,042 --> 00:55:26,833
In a few months.

569
00:55:27,708 --> 00:55:29,167
I’ll be waiting for her at her tattoo shop.

570
00:55:33,708 --> 00:55:34,250
I’m sorry.

571
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,708
I can’t accept them.

572
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:38,750
You can’t accept them?

573
00:55:39,583 --> 00:55:41,375
What do I tell Bro Phoenix?

574
00:55:41,958 --> 00:55:43,375
She’ll kill me.

575
00:55:47,375 --> 00:55:48,417
If you won’t accept them,

576
00:55:49,833 --> 00:55:50,667
then great.

577
00:55:51,625 --> 00:55:53,458
Then throw them away.

578
00:55:54,625 --> 00:55:56,042
Just stay away from her from this day on.

579
00:56:10,792 --> 00:56:11,458
Sis,

580
00:56:11,625 --> 00:56:13,750
she wrote you 372 letters!

581
00:56:16,792 --> 00:56:18,083
Where do you start to read so many?

582
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:20,667
Sis, how do you want to read them?

583
00:56:20,667 --> 00:56:21,875
Start with the old ones or the new ones?

584
00:56:23,125 --> 00:56:23,958
I’m busy now.
I don’t have time to read them.

585
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,250
It’s okay.

586
00:56:28,375 --> 00:56:29,458
I’ll read them for you.

587
00:56:36,333 --> 00:56:36,833
Jade,

588
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,292
I’ll never forget that night.

589
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:42,042
I never exerienced heaven before,

590
00:56:43,542 --> 00:56:45,333
but you took me there...

591
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:46,458
Stop!

592
00:56:49,708 --> 00:56:50,750
Sis, what’s wrong?

593
00:57:07,875 --> 00:57:08,417
I’m sorry.

594
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:49,375
Meng Ye.

595
00:57:53,333 --> 00:57:53,792
Sis,

596
00:57:55,708 --> 00:57:57,167
she really loves you.

597
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:02,333
It was momentary.

598
00:58:02,792 --> 00:58:03,667
It wasn’t love.

599
00:58:04,875 --> 00:58:06,958
She wrote that desire is the only truth.

600
00:58:08,083 --> 00:58:10,417
There was true desire between you, right?

601
00:58:12,958 --> 00:58:13,833
I don’t need desire.

602
00:58:14,917 --> 00:58:16,792
I just want a quiet life.

603
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:22,917
She’s leaving prison soon.

604
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:24,542
She’ll come looking for you.

605
00:58:35,292 --> 00:58:36,292
I won’t see her again.

606
00:58:45,667 --> 00:58:46,333
Sis,

607
00:58:47,417 --> 00:58:48,292
why don’t we get married?

608
00:58:50,375 --> 00:58:51,000
Get married?!

609
00:58:52,542 --> 00:58:54,500
Haven’t you always wanted a stable family?

610
00:58:55,958 --> 00:58:56,708
I want that too.

611
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:00,167
We can be our own family.

612
00:59:01,292 --> 00:59:02,625
Completely free of desire.

613
00:59:07,875 --> 00:59:08,667
Meng...

614
00:59:10,458 --> 00:59:11,625
But I...

615
00:59:12,375 --> 00:59:13,250
Unless...

616
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:15,583
you still love her?

617
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:19,333
Do you still love her?

618
00:59:25,917 --> 00:59:28,000
I don’t know what love means to Phoenix Du.

619
00:59:32,042 --> 00:59:32,750
But I feel that

620
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:34,833
I’ve sinned

621
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:38,958
and I should confess.

622
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:45,583
Meng Ye and I both want a simple life,

623
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,958
so I chose to marry him.

624
01:00:03,708 --> 01:00:06,167
Do you recognize the suspects in the photo?

625
01:00:24,958 --> 01:00:26,667
Does Meng Ye like girls now?

626
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:29,625
What a joke!

627
01:00:34,333 --> 01:00:35,500
What he’s good at

628
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:38,667
is having sex with men.

629
01:00:48,333 --> 01:00:49,167
I know one fact for certain.

630
01:00:50,375 --> 01:00:51,542
On their wedding night,

631
01:00:52,708 --> 01:00:54,125
Meng Ye wasn’t with her.

632
01:00:57,208 --> 01:00:58,583
He was in my bed.

633
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:05,875
Cousin.

634
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:12,375
Take it off.

635
01:02:02,167 --> 01:02:04,125
You ungrateful boy.

636
01:02:08,375 --> 01:02:09,750
You dare to come back?

637
01:02:26,917 --> 01:02:28,292
How could you forget

638
01:02:30,333 --> 01:02:31,583
how well I treated you?

639
01:02:36,625 --> 01:02:37,542
I didn’t forget.

640
01:02:40,708 --> 01:02:42,833
Tell me. What do you remember?

641
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:51,042
When I was 15,

642
01:02:51,625 --> 01:02:54,417
I promised myself to you.

643
01:02:58,083 --> 01:02:59,167
I belong to you.

644
01:03:05,083 --> 01:03:08,917
Take me with you. I’m yours.

645
01:03:19,667 --> 01:03:20,708
You’re mine.

646
01:03:22,417 --> 01:03:23,708
Tell me you love me.

647
01:03:25,708 --> 01:03:26,583
Tell me.

648
01:03:29,583 --> 01:03:30,333
Tell me.

649
01:03:32,458 --> 01:03:33,250
Tell me.

650
01:03:35,792 --> 01:03:36,667
Tell me!

651
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:49,833
Since you were 15..

652
01:03:49,833 --> 01:03:51,250
15!

653
01:04:02,375 --> 01:04:03,375
Don’t you get it?

654
01:04:05,125 --> 01:04:07,083
They only married to piss me off.

655
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:09,417
You don’t believe me?

656
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,208
Then ask Prosecutor Liu.

657
01:04:13,458 --> 01:04:14,333
Ask her whether

658
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:15,917
on their wedding night

659
01:04:16,792 --> 01:04:18,333
or any night after that,

660
01:04:18,333 --> 01:04:19,750
they slept together.

661
01:04:22,667 --> 01:04:23,333
On your wedding night,

662
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:25,708
your husband went out, didn’t he?

663
01:04:29,042 --> 01:04:29,958
It’s true that Meng Ye

664
01:04:31,417 --> 01:04:32,875
didn’t come home that night.

665
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,417
I thought

666
01:04:40,125 --> 01:04:42,542
marriage would usher in a stable life.

667
01:04:45,167 --> 01:04:46,542
I never expected

668
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:51,208
Phoenix Du would find me so quickly.

669
01:05:01,167 --> 01:05:02,000
Jade Liu,

670
01:05:08,667 --> 01:05:10,208
didn’t you get my letters?

671
01:05:14,542 --> 01:05:15,208
I did.

672
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:20,333
Why didn’t you wait for me?

673
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:24,875
Enough, Bro Phoenix, it’s her wedding day.

674
01:05:28,333 --> 01:05:29,125
Why?

675
01:05:37,625 --> 01:05:39,208
I’ve been waiting

676
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:47,333
for the day I could forget you.

677
01:05:51,083 --> 01:05:52,333
I’m getting married today

678
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:55,792
and I’ll forget you.

679
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:04,917
Sis,

680
01:06:05,833 --> 01:06:06,500
the car key.

681
01:06:06,792 --> 01:06:07,958
I’ll handle it. Don’t worry.

682
01:06:08,958 --> 01:06:09,917
Get off!

683
01:06:13,542 --> 01:06:14,583
Jade Liu!

684
01:06:16,792 --> 01:06:18,042
Excuse me, Please stop her.

685
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:20,000
Get off!

686
01:06:23,625 --> 01:06:25,125
Why not wait for me?

687
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:26,625
Why?

688
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:28,583
Why not wait for me?

689
01:06:29,208 --> 01:06:30,833
Why didn’t you wait for me?!

690
01:06:46,583 --> 01:06:47,958
I admit

691
01:06:49,792 --> 01:06:54,000
during Phoenix Du’s years of imprisonment,

692
01:06:57,125 --> 01:06:57,750
I...

693
01:07:00,917 --> 01:07:02,833
I made my own prison.

694
01:07:08,667 --> 01:07:10,125
I couldn’t face it.

695
01:07:15,042 --> 01:07:16,375
I didn’t read those 300-plus letters

696
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:20,542
until the day of my wedding.

697
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:52,375
Meng Ye.

698
01:07:53,667 --> 01:07:54,583
What are you doing?

699
01:07:55,917 --> 01:07:57,292
Sis, you still love her deeply, right?

700
01:07:57,917 --> 01:07:59,667
See, she really loves you.

701
01:08:01,125 --> 01:08:02,208
It’s too dangerous!

702
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:03,208
Put it down!

703
01:08:05,875 --> 01:08:07,958
You spent the whole night
reading her letters.

704
01:08:08,792 --> 01:08:11,458
You’re the one she was talking about.

705
01:08:13,625 --> 01:08:15,333
There’s nothing between me and Phoenix Du.

706
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,042
Trust me.

707
01:08:18,375 --> 01:08:20,417
But... Won’t her letters change your mind?

708
01:08:35,667 --> 01:08:36,417
Sis,

709
01:08:38,917 --> 01:08:39,958
I’m sorry.

710
01:08:42,333 --> 01:08:43,292
Why sorry?

711
01:08:47,125 --> 01:08:48,917
I was too insecure.

712
01:08:50,417 --> 01:08:52,333
Afraid you might leave me for her.

713
01:08:58,792 --> 01:08:59,583
Everything is fine now.

714
01:09:05,417 --> 01:09:06,208
It’s all in the past.

715
01:09:11,083 --> 01:09:12,958
I don’t know why I lost it.

716
01:09:15,042 --> 01:09:16,542
I’ve no right to be jealous.

717
01:09:22,542 --> 01:09:23,792
It’s not your problem.

718
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:25,417
It’s mine.

719
01:09:37,417 --> 01:09:39,375
Are you still mad at me?

720
01:09:48,583 --> 01:09:50,125
I’m not.

721
01:09:55,417 --> 01:09:57,792
Can I invite Phoenix Du to my fashion show.

722
01:09:59,708 --> 01:10:01,125
Why invite her?

723
01:10:03,792 --> 01:10:04,917
I think,

724
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,125
since it’s all in the past,

725
01:10:09,583 --> 01:10:11,833
we shouldn’t avoid her.

726
01:10:13,625 --> 01:10:15,708
We should all be friends.

727
01:10:16,833 --> 01:10:17,708
What do you say?

728
01:10:27,958 --> 01:10:29,667
Meng Ye wanted you here.

729
01:10:31,125 --> 01:10:32,833
He said he wants to be your friend.

730
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:47,042
Look!

731
01:10:47,625 --> 01:10:49,042
Isn’t Meng Ye gorgeous?

732
01:11:13,833 --> 01:11:14,667
Congrats.

733
01:11:17,083 --> 01:11:17,875
Bro Phoenix,

734
01:11:17,958 --> 01:11:19,583
do I look weird in women’s clothes?

735
01:11:20,208 --> 01:11:20,917
Not at all.

736
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:21,833
You look great.

737
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:23,417
Thank you.

738
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:25,708
Sis said the same thing.

739
01:11:26,792 --> 01:11:27,542
Sis,

740
01:11:28,042 --> 01:11:30,500
let’s visit Bro Phoenix’s tattoo shop sometime.

741
01:11:31,292 --> 01:11:33,542
It’s a bad idea. She has work.

742
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,708
Bro Phoenix, can we?

743
01:11:37,667 --> 01:11:38,625
Of course.

744
01:11:43,917 --> 01:11:44,958
Sis,

745
01:11:44,958 --> 01:11:46,750
I bought popcorn and fruit.

746
01:11:47,083 --> 01:11:48,167
Thanks, Bro Phoenix.

747
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:55,250
Meng Ye adjusted the quickest.

748
01:11:58,458 --> 01:12:00,542
They became fast friends.

749
01:12:03,625 --> 01:12:04,792
Because of that,

750
01:12:06,625 --> 01:12:08,958
Phoenix was ever present in my life.

751
01:12:10,792 --> 01:12:12,083
I saw her constantly.

752
01:12:14,875 --> 01:12:16,792
She was the devil that tempted me.

753
01:12:20,167 --> 01:12:21,792
It’s Bro Phoenix’s birthday.

754
01:12:22,042 --> 01:12:23,083
Let’s celebrate with her.

755
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:26,875
But we didn’t ask her.

756
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:27,958
She might have other plans.

757
01:12:29,458 --> 01:12:31,750
It’ll be okay. You go first.

758
01:12:32,333 --> 01:12:34,333
I’ll join after my rehearsal.

759
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:38,250
Okay.

760
01:12:53,958 --> 01:12:54,792
Phoenix!

761
01:13:08,667 --> 01:13:09,458
Phoenix,

762
01:13:11,792 --> 01:13:12,792
are you home?

763
01:13:35,458 --> 01:13:36,375
Happy birthday.

764
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,083
What’s wrong?

765
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:48,708
You burnt them?

766
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:55,417
I’m sorry.

767
01:13:57,250 --> 01:13:57,875
But why?

768
01:14:04,458 --> 01:14:06,333
I was getting married.

769
01:14:06,333 --> 01:14:07,292
Your marriage is fake.

770
01:14:07,292 --> 01:14:08,667
Don’t lie to me. Why?

771
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Why?

772
01:14:13,333 --> 01:14:14,708
It doesn’t matter if it’s real or not,

773
01:14:15,792 --> 01:14:17,042
I need it.

774
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:18,875
Is it me you’re hiding from?

775
01:14:20,833 --> 01:14:21,792
Why?

776
01:14:25,292 --> 01:14:26,333
Yes, I’m hiding from you.

777
01:14:28,333 --> 01:14:29,333
I’m hiding from you.

778
01:14:33,083 --> 01:14:34,000
Are you satisfied now?

779
01:14:35,333 --> 01:14:37,417
Why do you make me feel like I sinned?

780
01:14:39,042 --> 01:14:40,333
Love isn’t a sin.

781
01:14:43,042 --> 01:14:44,417
Our bodies aren’t sinful.

782
01:14:46,875 --> 01:14:48,250
God created physical desire.

783
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,250
What’s wrong with it?

784
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:57,458
Let me go!

785
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:00,042
Stop!

786
01:15:01,208 --> 01:15:04,000
Let me go! No!

787
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:14,750
Do you love me or not?

788
01:15:27,458 --> 01:15:28,625
I don’t know.

789
01:16:21,125 --> 01:16:21,667
Leave.

790
01:16:22,583 --> 01:16:23,250
Get out...

791
01:16:39,958 --> 01:16:40,958
I’m not leaving.

792
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,042
I’m sorry.

793
01:16:57,792 --> 01:16:59,458
Please take a look at me.

794
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:03,125
Please.

795
01:17:23,792 --> 01:17:25,000
It’s all my fault.

796
01:17:26,583 --> 01:17:27,833
I’m not going anywhere.

797
01:18:43,458 --> 01:18:44,792
I promised Meng Ye

798
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:48,792
that I’d always protect him.

799
01:18:52,333 --> 01:18:53,708
But I didn’t keep my promise.

800
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:00,500
It’s all because of

801
01:19:02,792 --> 01:19:04,792
my cowardice.

802
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:36,958
Don’t come near.

803
01:19:43,708 --> 01:19:45,500
I shouldn’t have bothered you both.

804
01:19:48,958 --> 01:19:51,625
I shouldn’t have bothered you.

805
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,667
I misunderstood.

806
01:19:57,542 --> 01:19:58,458
Meng Ye,
it’s not how it looks.

807
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:01,583
It’s all my fault.

808
01:20:02,167 --> 01:20:03,333
It’s alright, Sis.

809
01:20:03,958 --> 01:20:05,042
It has nothing to do with Jade.

810
01:20:06,458 --> 01:20:08,417
You used to be together.

811
01:20:09,583 --> 01:20:12,125
You lied when you promised
never to abandon me.

812
01:20:13,708 --> 01:20:14,917
There’s no reason for me to live.

813
01:20:15,833 --> 01:20:16,875
I'd rather be dead!

814
01:20:20,333 --> 01:20:21,375
Let me be.

815
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:23,458
You are together.

816
01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:24,458
Lay down the knife.

817
01:20:45,833 --> 01:20:47,000
I stabbed her.

818
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:51,417
By killing Phoenix,

819
01:20:57,333 --> 01:20:59,833
I murdered my own cowardice.

820
01:21:23,958 --> 01:21:24,792
If I sentenced myself

821
01:21:25,417 --> 01:21:27,542
to life imprisonment,

822
01:21:30,417 --> 01:21:31,708
or even the death penalty,

823
01:21:36,417 --> 01:21:38,125
I’ll happily accept it.

824
01:21:53,667 --> 01:21:54,917
You misunderstand.

825
01:21:58,792 --> 01:21:59,917
It wasn’t Jade Liu.

826
01:22:07,042 --> 01:22:07,917
It was me.

827
01:22:11,042 --> 01:22:12,958
I killed Phoenix Du.

828
01:22:19,792 --> 01:22:21,250
Why didn’t you wait for me?

829
01:22:33,167 --> 01:22:34,250
Let’s leave, alright?

830
01:22:34,458 --> 01:22:35,000
Let’s go.

831
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:37,583
Get lost.

832
01:22:41,125 --> 01:22:43,208
We’re together two years,
and you want me to leave.

833
01:22:59,125 --> 01:23:00,917
Phoenix Du,

834
01:23:01,542 --> 01:23:02,583
fuck you!

835
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,917
Since you’ve given up on yourself,

836
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:09,500
from this day on,

837
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:13,208
all my dances will be
in mourning of your death.

838
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:15,500
Go to hell!

839
01:23:17,875 --> 01:23:19,042
Fuck you!

840
01:23:23,417 --> 01:23:24,125
Sis,

841
01:23:24,458 --> 01:23:25,500
what should we do now?

842
01:23:30,458 --> 01:23:31,250
Meng Ye,

843
01:23:32,750 --> 01:23:34,417
can you help me take her home?

844
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:01,792
The moment I first saw her,

845
01:24:03,458 --> 01:24:06,625
I recalled the letters she wrote from jail.

846
01:24:09,083 --> 01:24:11,917
I knew she was my kind.

847
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:18,333
Jade...

848
01:24:21,542 --> 01:24:22,625
Just like me,

849
01:24:24,208 --> 01:24:25,292
she was half-human, half-beast.

850
01:24:25,292 --> 01:24:26,958
An androgynous ghost.

851
01:24:38,125 --> 01:24:39,917
Those who grew up in hell,

852
01:24:43,208 --> 01:24:45,042
are the most sensitive to

853
01:24:48,042 --> 01:24:49,000
mankind’s...

854
01:24:51,042 --> 01:24:52,833
mankind’s darkest desires.

855
01:24:59,167 --> 01:25:03,875
Cousin only reached the 10th level of hell.

856
01:25:06,042 --> 01:25:07,500
I entered the first level of hell

857
01:25:09,625 --> 01:25:11,667
when I was 14-years-old.

858
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:15,167
Dad, can you give me

859
01:25:15,542 --> 01:25:17,583
my school activity fees?

860
01:25:21,917 --> 01:25:23,000
You want money?

861
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:24,875
You want money.

862
01:25:25,792 --> 01:25:27,542
Trade your body for money,

863
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,375
just like your mom.

864
01:25:37,375 --> 01:25:38,292
Since then,

865
01:25:41,458 --> 01:25:43,208
I got whatever I wanted

866
01:25:47,625 --> 01:25:49,667
with my body.

867
01:25:54,667 --> 01:25:57,917
When I first set eyes on my cousin,

868
01:25:58,917 --> 01:26:01,125
I knew how to steal his heart.

869
01:26:02,333 --> 01:26:04,625
Meng Senior is gone.

870
01:26:05,792 --> 01:26:07,083
Who’ll take care of his son?

871
01:26:07,083 --> 01:26:08,167
I can’t.

872
01:26:08,167 --> 01:26:11,167
Both my parents-in-law had strokes.
I’m at breaking point.

873
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:15,167
Mr. Yin Wei donated $7,000 to the Mengs,

874
01:26:15,167 --> 01:26:17,083
and leaves the decision
in your capable hands.

875
01:26:17,083 --> 01:26:17,875
We don't have the time or energy.

876
01:26:24,458 --> 01:26:25,583
Thanks, cousin, for helping me.

877
01:26:26,417 --> 01:26:27,125
This is my gift to you.

878
01:26:35,125 --> 01:26:36,000
There’s something written on it.

879
01:27:12,167 --> 01:27:13,000
In this life,

880
01:27:15,125 --> 01:27:17,042
I was my cousin’s pet,

881
01:27:19,708 --> 01:27:21,542
and then a substitute for Jade’s brother.

882
01:27:25,792 --> 01:27:27,458
But Bro Phoenix was different.

883
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,542
I wanted her love.

884
01:27:36,375 --> 01:27:38,583
I wanted her body to betray her.

885
01:30:31,708 --> 01:30:35,750
Jealousy dragged me back to hell.

886
01:30:37,875 --> 01:30:38,917
The world

887
01:30:39,917 --> 01:30:42,083
abandoned me again.

888
01:30:49,042 --> 01:30:50,750
To regain the power to destroy,

889
01:30:53,167 --> 01:30:55,917
my return was predestined.

890
01:31:43,208 --> 01:31:43,792
Cousin,

891
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:48,375
I don’t owe you anymore, right?

892
01:31:50,792 --> 01:31:52,583
It’s my wedding night.

893
01:31:57,250 --> 01:31:57,875
What do you mean?

894
01:32:03,792 --> 01:32:06,208
Didn’t we have fun last time?

895
01:32:08,708 --> 01:32:10,583
But I’ll grow up.

896
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,292
I have to improve myself.

897
01:32:15,125 --> 01:32:16,375
Improve yourself?

898
01:32:24,208 --> 01:32:27,250
By stepping in other model’s shoes,

899
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:30,167
putting on their clothes,

900
01:32:30,167 --> 01:32:33,333
walking the runways of designers you fuck?

901
01:32:37,792 --> 01:32:39,667
I’m starting my career.

902
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,458
You shouldn’t hold me back.

903
01:32:46,417 --> 01:32:47,417
Liar.

904
01:32:52,667 --> 01:32:54,458
You let everybody ride you.

905
01:32:55,417 --> 01:32:57,167
You let everybody possess you.

906
01:33:00,417 --> 01:33:01,917
It’s not like that, cousin.

907
01:33:06,542 --> 01:33:08,167
It’s me who possesses them.

908
01:33:16,667 --> 01:33:17,375
So...

909
01:33:18,958 --> 01:33:19,917
What about Jade Liu?

910
01:33:22,042 --> 01:33:24,000
Is she who you really want?

911
01:33:25,875 --> 01:33:26,750
Is she?

912
01:33:30,125 --> 01:33:31,208
Is she?

913
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,792
It’s not that we want each other.

914
01:33:38,750 --> 01:33:40,792
But we want the same thing. That’s all.

915
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,542
She wants a stable family.

916
01:33:49,292 --> 01:33:51,083
I want acceptance by society.

917
01:33:52,542 --> 01:33:53,750
A union like that

918
01:33:54,792 --> 01:33:56,417
will help me climb up.

919
01:33:58,292 --> 01:33:58,917
Meng Ye.

920
01:34:01,083 --> 01:34:02,250
Meng Ye, don’t go!

921
01:34:29,250 --> 01:34:31,500
Prosecutor Liu’s restraining order
is iron-tight.

922
01:34:32,292 --> 01:34:33,625
Don’t go against her.

923
01:34:40,375 --> 01:34:41,375
Goodbye, cousin.

924
01:35:28,208 --> 01:35:30,500
Why can’t someone like her love me?

925
01:35:34,667 --> 01:35:35,542
Meng Ye!

926
01:35:37,542 --> 01:35:38,917
Sis, do you still love her?

927
01:35:39,958 --> 01:35:41,250
You wouldn’t abandon me, would you?

928
01:35:43,208 --> 01:35:44,667
Of course not!

929
01:35:46,125 --> 01:35:47,042
Didn’t I promise you

930
01:35:47,042 --> 01:35:49,083
that this is our home?

931
01:36:04,875 --> 01:36:05,667
Sis,

932
01:36:08,292 --> 01:36:10,208
can you burn all her letters?

933
01:36:36,958 --> 01:36:37,667
Sis.

934
01:36:39,583 --> 01:36:40,333
Thank you.

935
01:36:41,542 --> 01:36:43,500
You never expected Meng Ye
to be so alluring, huh?

936
01:36:46,292 --> 01:36:47,125
Congratulations.

937
01:36:48,375 --> 01:36:49,208
Anyway,

938
01:36:49,750 --> 01:36:51,667
Bro Phoenix saw me in a dress before.

939
01:36:54,417 --> 01:36:55,458
Before?

940
01:36:55,458 --> 01:36:57,250
Didn’t I take her home the other day?

941
01:36:57,917 --> 01:36:59,625
She mistook me for you.

942
01:36:59,625 --> 01:37:01,042
You know what she said?

943
01:37:02,167 --> 01:37:03,875
Sorry. I drank too much that day.

944
01:37:04,458 --> 01:37:05,875
She was drunk.

945
01:37:06,375 --> 01:37:07,833
Don’t take her words seriously.

946
01:37:08,708 --> 01:37:10,375
She wasn’t just drunk,

947
01:37:10,375 --> 01:37:11,500
but threw up all over me.

948
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:13,167
So I put on your gown.

949
01:37:13,417 --> 01:37:15,167
And she thought I was you.

950
01:37:19,875 --> 01:37:20,875
He’s slender.

951
01:37:20,875 --> 01:37:22,750
All my clothes fit him.

952
01:37:25,958 --> 01:37:28,333
Bro Phoenix, do I look weird
in women’s clothes?

953
01:37:30,083 --> 01:37:31,375
Not at all. You look great.

954
01:37:34,458 --> 01:37:36,292
Sis, cheers.

955
01:37:36,833 --> 01:37:37,500
Cheers.

956
01:37:38,792 --> 01:37:39,500
Bro Phoenix.

957
01:37:44,750 --> 01:37:48,458
Love

958
01:37:49,250 --> 01:37:54,750
Both heavenly and hellish

959
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:55,708
Meng Ye,

960
01:37:56,875 --> 01:37:57,667
come back here.

961
01:37:58,375 --> 01:37:59,500
It’s not safe there.

962
01:38:00,042 --> 01:38:01,083
It’s alright.

963
01:38:01,833 --> 01:38:03,958
The world will be fine without me.

964
01:38:13,750 --> 01:38:14,375
Come back.

965
01:38:15,042 --> 01:38:15,625
It’s dangerous.

966
01:38:25,125 --> 01:38:25,833
Bro Phoenix,

967
01:38:27,208 --> 01:38:28,458
can tattoos be removed?

968
01:38:31,708 --> 01:38:33,792
It’s not easy. It hurts a lot.

969
01:38:37,583 --> 01:38:38,583
What about memories?

970
01:38:38,958 --> 01:38:40,500
Does it hurt getting rid of them too?

971
01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:43,417
What do you mean?

972
01:38:46,625 --> 01:38:49,333
I read all the letters you wrote to Sis.

973
01:38:51,208 --> 01:38:52,167
Every one of them.

974
01:38:54,375 --> 01:38:56,542
You said desire is the only truth

975
01:38:57,292 --> 01:38:58,833
and you wanted Sis to embrace it.

976
01:39:15,292 --> 01:39:17,458
Sorry. I won’t write that again.

977
01:39:19,583 --> 01:39:21,458
Our marriage is fake.

978
01:39:22,292 --> 01:39:24,125
It’s just a refuge for me.

979
01:39:29,042 --> 01:39:30,083
What about Jade?

980
01:39:32,125 --> 01:39:34,000
She’s pure.

981
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,583
She doesn’t need desire.

982
01:39:37,083 --> 01:39:38,250
We’re together to

983
01:39:39,125 --> 01:39:41,000
comfort each other.

984
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:51,208
So that’s what she wants.

985
01:40:03,792 --> 01:40:04,917
It’s what I wanted as well

986
01:40:07,542 --> 01:40:08,750
until you showed up.

987
01:40:10,333 --> 01:40:11,250
Bro Phoenix,

988
01:40:12,417 --> 01:40:14,250
I never forgot our night together.

989
01:40:22,375 --> 01:40:24,667
Forget it. I was too drunk.

990
01:40:34,625 --> 01:40:35,958
We had sex that night.

991
01:40:37,083 --> 01:40:38,250
You had an orgasm.

992
01:40:38,583 --> 01:40:40,042
I don’t believe you feel nothing for me.

993
01:40:44,250 --> 01:40:45,042
I don’t remember.

994
01:40:49,917 --> 01:40:50,792
I can’t recall it.

995
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:55,125
Let me remind you.

996
01:40:56,833 --> 01:40:57,375
Kiss me.

997
01:41:04,125 --> 01:41:04,625
Sorry.

998
01:41:05,917 --> 01:41:06,583
Forgive me.

999
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:12,250
Why?

1000
01:41:15,667 --> 01:41:17,250
Don’t you think we’re the same kind?

1001
01:41:17,542 --> 01:41:19,167
I like women. You’re a man.

1002
01:41:20,125 --> 01:41:21,875
But I’m a woman as well.

1003
01:41:23,958 --> 01:41:26,292
I’m a woman just like you’re a man.

1004
01:41:29,625 --> 01:41:30,500
Look at me.

1005
01:41:33,083 --> 01:41:35,125
Why can’t I become what you want?

1006
01:41:39,792 --> 01:41:42,583
Don’t lock yourself up like Sis.

1007
01:44:24,625 --> 01:44:27,417
My body tells me something.

1008
01:44:30,417 --> 01:44:32,458
You said the body never lies.

1009
01:44:38,792 --> 01:44:40,208
Can’t you desire me?

1010
01:44:54,458 --> 01:44:55,417
Meng Ye,

1011
01:44:55,417 --> 01:44:56,708
it’s not the same.

1012
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:03,833
If I didn’t write
all those letters to Jade,

1013
01:45:03,833 --> 01:45:05,375
I wouldn’t have survived inside.

1014
01:45:19,833 --> 01:45:21,375
But she burnt them all.

1015
01:45:27,833 --> 01:45:29,167
She burnt the letters.

1016
01:45:38,292 --> 01:45:38,833
Meng Ye.

1017
01:45:40,542 --> 01:45:42,375
Don’t you have a rehearsal?
Why are you here?

1018
01:45:42,833 --> 01:45:44,375
It’s rescheduled to tonight.

1019
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:46,333
Such a last-minute change.

1020
01:45:48,417 --> 01:45:49,083
Look,

1021
01:45:50,375 --> 01:45:51,167
what do you think of this?

1022
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:55,292
It’s called a devil cake.

1023
01:45:57,833 --> 01:45:58,583
Phoenix.

1024
01:46:01,125 --> 01:46:02,167
Happy birthday.

1025
01:46:10,583 --> 01:46:11,667
Did you burn them?

1026
01:47:02,042 --> 01:47:03,042
My jealousy

1027
01:47:06,333 --> 01:47:08,000
tore me apart.

1028
01:47:25,667 --> 01:47:27,667
I had to either kill them

1029
01:47:31,833 --> 01:47:33,667
or kill myself.

1030
01:48:22,375 --> 01:48:23,667
I’m disposable.

1031
01:48:28,417 --> 01:48:30,375
No one ever loved me.

1032
01:48:32,792 --> 01:48:33,375
Meng Ye,

1033
01:48:33,708 --> 01:48:36,083
it’s my fault. My mistake.

1034
01:48:39,583 --> 01:48:40,750
Don’t come near.

1035
01:48:42,375 --> 01:48:44,375
I shouldn’t have bothered you both.

1036
01:48:46,625 --> 01:48:49,958
You don’t cherish me
in your hearts, do you?

1037
01:48:53,250 --> 01:48:55,375
You were together before.

1038
01:49:00,625 --> 01:49:02,042
There’s no purpose for me to keep living.

1039
01:49:02,958 --> 01:49:04,958
I'd rather be dead!

1040
01:49:10,208 --> 01:49:10,750
It’s my fault!

1041
01:49:12,042 --> 01:49:13,500
Leave me alone!

1042
01:49:13,792 --> 01:49:15,958
No one ever loved me!

1043
01:49:29,375 --> 01:49:31,333
Bro Phoenix.

1044
01:49:34,250 --> 01:49:37,167
I’m sorry. It wasn’t on purpose.

1045
01:49:38,958 --> 01:49:41,000
Bro Phoenix, what should I do?

1046
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:42,875
It’s okay.

1047
01:49:52,750 --> 01:49:54,042
I learnt

1048
01:49:56,375 --> 01:49:57,708
too late

1049
01:49:59,667 --> 01:50:00,917
that I do feel something for you.

1050
01:50:10,583 --> 01:50:12,792
I hurt Sis

1051
01:50:16,167 --> 01:50:18,292
and Bro Phoenix.

1052
01:50:23,708 --> 01:50:25,042
There’s no 19th level in hell,

1053
01:50:28,667 --> 01:50:31,125
no deeper level.

1054
01:50:33,875 --> 01:50:36,583
They were my light in hell.

1055
01:50:41,083 --> 01:50:46,000
The ones I loved most in life.

1056
01:51:41,333 --> 01:51:44,500
Happy birthday, Bro Phoenix.

1057
01:51:52,250 --> 01:51:54,500
Congratulations

1058
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:58,458
for almost completing
the cycle of destruction.

1059
01:52:13,958 --> 01:52:18,667
Who ended your life?

1060
01:52:22,208 --> 01:52:26,083
Why not wait for me to send you to hell?

1061
01:52:45,917 --> 01:52:46,875
Phoenix Du...

1062
01:52:48,167 --> 01:52:49,208
Phoenix Du

1063
01:52:52,250 --> 01:52:54,042
Can you communicate somehow

1064
01:52:54,792 --> 01:52:56,708
who stabbed you?

1065
01:52:57,917 --> 01:52:59,792
Both Meng Ye and Jade Liu

1066
01:53:00,417 --> 01:53:02,042
claim to be the killer.

1067
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:05,458
Who did it?

1068
01:53:14,667 --> 01:53:15,458
Doctor,

1069
01:53:15,833 --> 01:53:17,292
the patient is responding.

1070
01:53:24,333 --> 01:53:25,917
It was me...

1071
01:53:31,417 --> 01:53:33,000
Myself...

1072
01:53:35,042 --> 01:53:38,217
It was I myself

1073
01:53:38,250 --> 01:53:43,875
who pointed the knife at my heart.

1074
01:53:58,833 --> 01:54:01,375
Life is death’s illusion.

1075
01:54:01,375 --> 01:54:05,000
I thought I’d gone to hell.

1076
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:10,583
But... now I’m in paradise.

1077
01:54:44,500 --> 01:54:45,167
Stand.

1078
01:54:50,958 --> 01:54:52,292
Sit.

1079
01:54:53,792 --> 01:54:55,542
Clerk, please read the case.

1080
01:54:56,583 --> 01:54:58,417
Case #2020.3.

1081
01:54:58,417 --> 01:55:01,458
Phoenix Du’s murder trial
begins September 6.
