00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:09,867
I think dating you has made me lonelier.

8

You should just get married to your job.

Love is difficult because each experience is a new one.

Love and dating come in much more varied forms than the ones you can think of.

You can't be too quick to discern what's real or not. They could all be true love.

They want an open recruitment and said we should hire high school graduates too.

But the ones that last are the ones with good qualifications.

76

It's the trend nowadays, and we can use it for PR as well. It's not a bad plan.

77
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:37,567
Even if we hire only one high school graduate, it's good for the company's image

to show that we offer opportunities.

79

Please give extra attention to the recruitment process.

No, I don't know about that,

86

I'm certain it's a false rumor.

But to have that kind of rumor suddenly spreading

93

is also a failure on his part.

He failed to conduct himself properly!

You're right. We can't let him get away with this.

96

He also keeps us on our toes because we never know when he will leave the company.

How can we rely on one person to bring in half of the company's profit?

If we end up losing him,

104

This is a parody skit.

165
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:06,200
Gosh, it's cold. I should play a game of screen golf.

166
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,367
Not great, huh?

167
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:10,967
I think it's funny.

168
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:13,733
Not the ad.

169
00:15:13,733 --> 00:15:15,600
I meant me.

170
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,633
I keep talking about work.

171
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:25,300
It's okay. Work is your priority.

172
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,000
I want to understand things

173
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,360
that are important to you.

174
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:40,000
I thought you were scary and cold at first,

175
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,100
but I think you're very caring.

176
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:54,133
If you keep looking at me like that...

177
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,000
Wait.

178
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:17,800
Let's do this once we get closer.

179
00:16:19,767 --> 00:16:24,567
How do I get closer to you?

180
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,033
By being more caring?

181
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,033
Shall I take a shower and come back?

182
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,080
[I'm going to get some food. Make yourself at home.]

183
00:18:22,233 --> 00:18:25,100
I don't feel well, so I'm going home.

184
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,100
Sorry.

185
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,020
♫ The kind of love that other people have ♫

186
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:58,380
♫ I know it does not mean much to me ♫

187
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,810
♫ It's okay even if you don't get me ♫

188
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:07,560
♫ I spend my nights talking without regret ♫

189
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:12,430
♫ Oh, look at me now, I hug you without reservations ♫

190
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:16,790
♫ Let's just spend our days going with the flow ♫

191
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:21,430
♫ Just how close are we? ♫

192
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:28,950
♫ Lonely nights, so far away ♫

193
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:33,350
♫ Forget them completely ♫

194
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:36,750
♫ Waiting more ♫

195
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:41,120
♫ It makes no sense to us ♫

196
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:47,070
♫ If we kiss unexpectedly ♫

197
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:50,540
♫ We pretend it's nothing big ♫

198
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:55,040
♫ As if we already knew each other ♫

199
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:01,110
♫ Because time keeps passing, and we are hidden by the night ♫

200
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:23,780
♫ In a few of our pictures ♫
