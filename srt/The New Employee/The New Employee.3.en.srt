It's late, so go home. I'll take you home.

162
00:14:13,233 --> 00:14:18,567
But how did you know I'm here?

163
00:14:20,667 --> 00:14:22,167
I just...

164
00:14:22,167 --> 00:14:27,333
Did you come because you were worried?

165
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:31,767
Or because you wanted to save me or drink on my behalf?

166
00:14:31,767 --> 00:14:33,267
- It's not like that.
- Come on.

167
00:14:33,267 --> 00:14:35,090
I think you came to drink on my behalf.

168
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,230
I said it's not like that.

169
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,100
Department Head Kim...

170
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:53,933
Do you know that it's really hard to pretend that everything is normal?

171
00:15:59,267 --> 00:16:01,167
You look like something happened to you last night.

172
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:03,900
Pardon? Nothing happened to me.

173
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,667
You look like you are hiding something.

174
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:08,533
I'm not hiding anything.

175
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:12,167
Did you kiss?

176
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:13,500
It's not like that.

177
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,767
I was right! Did you guys decide to date? Or...

178
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:22,160
did you just kiss and leave things undefined?

179
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,167
How did you know that?

180
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,967
Wait.

181
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:32,467
It's all in here. Even your expression.

182
00:16:32,467 --> 00:16:34,733
We kissed.

183
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:37,500
But I'm still unsure.

184
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:40,867
Does he like me as well?

185
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:44,867
You have to clearly define your relationship in these cases.

186
00:16:44,867 --> 00:16:46,267
How?

187
00:16:46,267 --> 00:16:49,500
You should ask if you two are a couple now.

188
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,367
I'm worried that only I like him.

189
00:16:53,367 --> 00:16:58,333
I wish I could ask on your behalf. Does he work here?

190
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,200
No. Never!

191
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,467
I was just asking, but I guess he does, based on your strong reaction.

192
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:07,600
I told you he doesn't.

193
00:17:08,367 --> 00:17:11,800
Who the hell is he? Who was your first kiss?

194
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,067
Is he in Planning Team 1? Team 2?

195
00:17:20,033 --> 00:17:21,800
Hello.

196
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,260
[AR Communications]

197
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,767
- Seung Hyeon.
- Yes.

198
00:17:35,767 --> 00:17:41,267
I'm going to ask you to do a few things over the phone. You can do those and then leave at six.

199
00:17:41,267 --> 00:17:42,360
Okay.

200
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,060
Department Head...?

201
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,867
Hello.

202
00:18:16,867 --> 00:18:20,967
- If the Marketing Team looks for me, tell them to contact me directly.
- Okay.

203
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:24,567
If the Production Team calls, tell them to proceed according to the proposal.

204
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:26,800
Okay, I will.

205
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,200
And...

206
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:32,333
Yes?

207
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:36,333
Hello? Department Head Kim?

208
00:18:36,967 --> 00:18:39,267
What are your plans for tonight?

209
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:43,133
Not much. What else can I help you with?

210
00:18:43,133 --> 00:18:44,833
Then after you get off work,

211
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,867
"After getting off work..."

212
00:18:47,867 --> 00:18:50,933
- let's go to the movies.
- "go to the movi..."

213
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,267
What?

214
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:15,640
♫ The kind of love that other people have ♫

215
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,060
♫ I know it does not mean much to me ♫

216
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:24,420
♫ It's okay even if you don't get me ♫

217
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:29,220
♫ I spend my nights talking without regret ♫

218
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:33,900
♫ Oh, look at me now, I hug you without reservations ♫

219
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:38,390
♫ Let's just spend our days going with the flow ♫

220
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:43,120
♫ Just how close are we? ♫

221
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,330
♫ Lonely nights, so far away ♫

222
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:54,730
♫ Forget them completely ♫

223
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:58,320
♫ Waiting more ♫

224
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,740
♫ It makes no sense to us ♫

225
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:08,590
♫ If we kiss unexpectedly ♫

226
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:12,140
♫ We pretend it's nothing big ♫

227
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:16,590
♫ As if we already knew each other ♫

228
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:23,290
♫ Because time keeps passing, and we are hidden by the night ♫

229
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:44,620
♫ In a few of our pictures ♫

230
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,240
♫ We keep ascribing meaning to them as the days go by ♫
