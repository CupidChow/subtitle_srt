"Korea's Number One Card, J Card" is too boring.

00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:44,733
For the future of J Card, we need to win over Generation MZ.

72
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:48,367
I don't think we should rely on marketing using stars.

73
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:53,567
If anything, they should be a little bold and cast non-celebrities who are unique.

74
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:58,200
There should be restaurants, cafés, movie theaters, and exhibitions that Generation MZ likes.

What? What are you talking about?

97
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:35,100
If your new employee doesn't have the time to get his charger, then hire your own intern.

98
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:40,333
You did this before, too. Why do you keep pushing our intern around?

99
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,733
I wasn't aware of that.

100
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,767
I'm sorry. I'll talk to him.

101
00:07:50,767 --> 00:07:52,767
It's okay.

102
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:06,500
Since the slogan is, "Korea's Number One Card," we're thinking of selecting the best celebrity

103
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,133
to expand the brand image as being number one.

104
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:13,067
Also, as the number one card...

105
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:16,200
We will focus on the three big perks:

106
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,033
shopping discount, gas discount, and flight mileage,

107
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:23,167
which all can be done with a single J Card.

108
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:26,090
We believe these three benefits will help appeal to consumers naturally.

109
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:31,130
In this way, we can instill various perceptions of the product in the consumer.

110
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:39,133
Isn't that too boring? There's no difference from the previous one.

He's an intern.

118
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,233
I asked him on the spot, but he knew exactly what was wrong with this project.

119
00:09:08,233 --> 00:09:11,000
I think you can trust him to handle it.

Even an intern can have his own project.

132
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:22,733
It's also the worst thing about our company. People at the top get all the credit.

133
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:28,067
Your idea will look like it's mine or even the CEO's or the company's.

134
00:10:28,067 --> 00:10:33,233
And your participation in the project doesn't guarantee a permanent position.

It doesn't matter.

136

I'm just worried I'll make a mistake and trouble you.

137
00:10:40,633 --> 00:10:44,067
If you do, I'll take responsibility for it.

138

Hey! Not stuff like that!

148
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:32,230
He said, "Because it's you, Seung Hyeon."

149
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,200
He discounted all other reasons.

150
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,333
Did he confess his feelings to you?

151
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:41,400
Not really, but it feels like it.

152

Right. Seung Hyeon, why don't you join us if you are free?

Ji Yeon, you look too happy about your manager leaving.

162
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:27,000
He's got a better job offer. So it's all good!

163
00:12:27,033 --> 00:12:30,100
Department Head Kim, you're busy, right?

164
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:37,067
I'm going as well. I should.

165
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:41,100
- Yay!
- Yes!

166
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,900
How can I do it in front of Seung Hyeon and the team manager...?

167
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:03,000
We need to grill the meat.

168
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,260
Excuse me.

169
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,867
Department Head Kim, please pour me a drink.

170
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,933
Your glass is empty.

171
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,033
Let's say cheers.

172
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:33,267
Cheers!

173
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,500
- Don't you drink?
- No, I do.

174
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,833
Hey, you can't drink like that at work.

175
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,767
All right, cheers!

176
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,500
Have some more beef.

177
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,200
Thank you.

178
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,567
Department Head Kim, did you just drink on his behalf?

179
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,933
Then you should drink another glass!

180
00:14:21,933 --> 00:14:24,300
Come on!

181
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,233
My glass is empty. Please pour me a drink too.

182
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,900
It's not the first time Ji Yeon has done this.

183
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,467
Cheers!

184
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:46,030
- Why are you taking that away?
- Really.

185
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,333
- Just let me be.
- Slow down.

186
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,100
- I'm just happy.
- Are you okay?

187
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,067
Of course, I'm okay.

188
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,367
Are you two dating?

189
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:00,067
Excuse me?

190
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,533
Are you two dating?

191
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,000
You seem very close, very touchy with each other.

192
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,300
Not at all.

193
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,167
Not at all. We can't date.

194
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:23,367
Because we're the famous

195
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:26,367
Rainbow Rice Cakes!

196
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:30,333
Don't listen to her. It's nothing.

197
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,633
Okay, it seems like you're not dating.

198
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:37,533
Department Head Kim, let me tell you about Seung Hyeon, this poor thing.

199
00:15:37,533 --> 00:15:42,567
He has never dated anyone and is still a virgin!

200
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,200
What are you talking about?

201
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,667
Poor Seung Hyeon.

202
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,167
It's okay, it's okay.

203
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:54,200
But that is your charm.

204
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,967
I'm sorry. We'll get going.

205
00:15:56,967 --> 00:16:01,133
Let's go together. I'll call a driver, so wait a minute.

206
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,633
We could have taken a taxi...

207
00:16:13,633 --> 00:16:16,167
It's on my way, so no worries.

208
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,700
I heard that you live near work.

209
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,767
Seung Hyeon, are you okay?

210
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,667
Sorry. I'm just hot from drinking.

211
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,067
Wow. The night view is so pretty.

212
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:45,800
You must like night views.

213
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,133
I do. I like them a lot.

214
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,433
Did Ji Yeon get in safely?

215
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:17,100
Yes, I practically pushed her in.

216
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,233
Where is the driver?

217
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:22,967
He went to the restroom. Wait in the car.

218
00:17:22,967 --> 00:17:28,000
No, it's ok. I can get home on my own. Thank you for today.

219
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,467
I'll take you home. Don't worry about it and get in the car.

220
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,767
I'm really okay...

221
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:27,690
♫ The kind of love that other people have ♫

222
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,990
♫ I know it does not mean much to me ♫

223
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:36,450
♫ It's okay even if you don't get me ♫

224
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:41,190
♫ I spend my nights talking without regret ♫

225
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:45,960
♫ Oh, look at me now, I hug you without reservations ♫

226
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,260
♫ Let's just spend our days going with the flow ♫

227
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:55,160
♫ Just how close are we? ♫

228
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:02,660
♫ Lonely nights, so far away ♫

229
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:07,060
♫ Forget them completely ♫

230
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:10,460
♫ Waiting more ♫

231
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:14,930
♫ It makes no sense to us ♫

232
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:20,720
♫ If we kiss unexpectedly ♫

233
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,160
♫ We pretend it's nothing big ♫

234
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,690
♫ As if we already knew each other ♫

235
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:35,470
♫ Because time keeps passing, and we are hidden by the night ♫

236
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,070
♫ In a few of our pictures ♫
