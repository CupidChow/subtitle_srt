Don't do it. It's not our job.

159
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:39,567
Pardon?

160
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,400
If another team asks for your cooperation again like this, ask me first.

161
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:50,300
If I'm not in, tell them to email you and put me as CC.

162
00:13:51,067 --> 00:13:53,000
But you always look so busy.

163
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,133
Regardless, I need to do my job.

164
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:57,800
That's one of my jobs as the department head.

165
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,167
Thank you, Department Head.

[Format of Taking Meeting Minutes]

167
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,233
Did you draw this?

168
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:14,600
Sorry, it's been a habit since undergrad.

169
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,700
Come with me if you haven't had lunch.

170
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,833
Oh?

171
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:58,167
Kim Jong Chan, what took you so long?

172
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,267
Hyeong Yu Seong.

173
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,633
Seung Hyeon?

174
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,367
How do you two know each other? You were in different departments.

175
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:22,700
Do you remember when I was doing my PhD, I said there was a kid who was great at structuring content?

176
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,260
I said you would absolutely love his paper.

177
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,333
He's that kid.

178
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,333
Is that so?

179
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:34,433
Do you remember that group I attended at school?

180
00:16:34,433 --> 00:16:36,167
It was nothing much.

181
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:39,967
Hyeong Yu Seong majored in economics, so I just helped with his trend report a bit.

182
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:41,567
Right.

183
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:45,300
You were close to Ji Yeon. I heard she's a copywriter now.

184
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,900
Yes.

185
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,033
Excuse me, I need to take this call.

186
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,800
All he does is work.

187
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,933
You poor thing, having to intern for Jong Chan.

188
00:17:00,933 --> 00:17:04,730
What about official recruitment? Did you apply to any company?

189
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:08,367
I applied to many, but it didn't work out.

190
00:17:08,367 --> 00:17:10,100
Is that so?

191
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,800
Well, all you did was study, so it's a good to intern and gain experience.

192
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,167
I think everyone is having a tough time nowadays.

193
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:20,900
But you are a hard worker; you'll be fine.

194
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,667
Thank you.

195
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,433
Are you seeing someone?

196
00:17:24,433 --> 00:17:27,833
No, I don't have time for that.

197
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:33,333
What about you? Are you still with that person?

198
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,067
Oh, that person.

199
00:17:37,067 --> 00:17:40,433
Sorry, I got an urgent call.

200
00:17:40,433 --> 00:17:45,067
No worries. Let me know if you need anything.

201
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:47,867
I was a bit hurt that you never reached out to me.

202
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:51,500
Okay. I'll get going first.
