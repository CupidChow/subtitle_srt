I see you're currently interning with us, Mr. Wu Seung Hyeon.

168
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:58,467
Planning Team One? You're under Department Head Kim.

169
00:16:58,467 --> 00:17:02,967
Oh, are you the one who came up with the idea for J Card?

170
00:17:02,967 --> 00:17:04,633
Yes, I am.

171
00:17:04,633 --> 00:17:09,467
Good qualifications. Did you apply to other places as well?

172
00:17:09,467 --> 00:17:11,890
Actually, I only applied here at AR Planning,

173
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:15,800
since it's my goal to work here.

Yes, this is Kim Jong Chan.

Okay. I understand.

Something came up, you'll have to go home alone.

I'll call you after.

I have an urgent meeting, so I'll head out first. Everyone can leave when it's time and there are no issues.
