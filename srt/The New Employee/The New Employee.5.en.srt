00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:12,200
I know the other work seems trivial compared to the J Card project,

165
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,300
but someone has to do it. If not the youngest, then who else?

166
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,800
It's not like that, Sir.

167
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,033
Even if you think it's trivial labor, think carefully.

168
00:16:21,033 --> 00:16:24,400
It may not look like it, but everyone is watching you.

169
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,733
I'm sorry. I'll get it together.

170
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:34,633
Gosh, Team Leader Choi. An intern can make mistakes.

171
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,467
Seung Hyeon, have a drink.

172
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:42,200
Are we out of drinks?

173
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:46,467
Seung Hyeon, I'm sorry, but please go get some drinks.

174
00:16:46,467 --> 00:16:49,867
I'll go right away. Do you need anything else?

175
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:54,367
No, just buy us drinks. Sorry.

176
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,433
Department Head Kim, is something bothering you?

177
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,800
No.

178
00:17:26,267 --> 00:17:28,167
Department Head Kim.

179
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:33,267
I still can't understand you.

180
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:39,100
You used to like Yu Seong, and I used to date him.

181
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:43,333
And that bothers you.

182
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:46,000
I can't understand you beyond that.

183
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:52,833
I know I'm supposed to say that I understand you,

184
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,700
but I can't lie.

185
00:17:58,467 --> 00:18:00,433
This is me,

186
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,167
but I want to understand you from now on.

187
00:18:08,233 --> 00:18:13,033
I can't take away the heartbreak from when you had to pick out that damn fountain pen,

188
00:18:14,467 --> 00:18:20,333
but I'll do my best to make you think that all that heartache with Yu Seong lead you to me.

189
00:18:22,633 --> 00:18:27,510
Could you give me another chance to get closer to you?

190
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:31,980
♫ And your voice so sweet ♫

191
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,130
♫ As if you were born to ♫

192
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:40,820
♫ Make me fall for you ♫

193
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,800
♫ I am not that easy ♫

194
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,060
♫ But how do you keep making me smile like this? ♫

195
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:53,050
Gosh, how cute.

196
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:58,070
♫ Look at this, I am smiling ♫

197
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:02,030
♫ I don't know if you are familiar with this sort of me ♫

198
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,633
- Isn't it heavy? Give me one.
- It's okay.

199
00:19:04,633 --> 00:19:07,500
- Give me one.
- It's really okay.

200
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,350
I told you to give me one.

201
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:12,640
♫ If you keep being charming as if it were nothing ♫

202
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:21,340
♫ And if my heart keeps beating this fast ♫

203
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:27,890
♫ And if I keep blushing, it's all because of you  ♫

204
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:32,300
♫ You keep unlocking unknown sides to me ♫

205
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,533
You go ahead.

206
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:38,080
- No, you go ahead.
- I'm okay, really.

207
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:46,233
Department Head Kim.

208
00:19:47,067 --> 00:19:49,767
Why are you two coming in together?

209
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:54,300
- That's because...
- We met at the entrance.

210
00:19:57,233 --> 00:19:59,467
Seung Hyeon, why are you so late?

211
00:19:59,467 --> 00:20:03,190
Team Leader Choi has been looking for you. Go in quickly.

212
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:32,400
I'll be more honest from now on.

213
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:41,567
It's okay to fight. We can just work it out together.

214
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:44,667
But don't hide or run away.

215
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:53,100
I thought of breaking up first because I was afraid of getting hurt.

216
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:00,500
You are so attractive.

217
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:05,533
I'm totally into you and can't break up with you easily.

218
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:07,933
Go to sleep.

219
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:13,800
I'll go to sleep after you do.

220
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:25,533
I'm tired, but I can't sleep.

221
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:27,867
Close your eyes.

222
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,767
Time to go to bed.

223
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:02,620
♫ The kind of love that other people have ♫

224
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:06,910
♫ I know it does not mean much to me ♫

225
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:11,360
♫ It's okay even if you don't get me ♫

226
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,020
♫ I spend my nights talking without regret ♫

227
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:20,890
♫ Oh, look at me now, I hug you without reservations ♫

228
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:25,230
♫ Let's just spend our days going with the flow ♫

229
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:30,060
♫ Just how close are we? ♫

230
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:37,380
♫ Lonely nights, so far away ♫

231
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:41,780
♫ Forget them completely ♫

232
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,250
♫ Waiting more ♫

233
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:49,760
♫ It makes no sense to us ♫

234
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,500
♫ If we kiss unexpectedly ♫

235
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:59,020
♫ We pretend it's nothing big ♫

236
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:03,310
♫ As if we already knew each other ♫

237
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:10,400
♫ Because time keeps passing, and we are hidden by the night ♫

238
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:31,220
♫ In a few of our pictures ♫
