1
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,180
   

2
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,780
   

3
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,340
   

4
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,570
   

5
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,370
   

6
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:47,050


7
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,270
Make me coffee, Oppa.

8
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,610
A hot Americano with two extra shots.

9
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,970
I don't want to go to sleep tonight.

10
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,500
I'm Park Yunjae's girlfriend.

11
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm temporarily like this, but I will return to being a girl soon.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,170
So, could you please stop acting out?

13
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,820
Yunjae said he told you many times that he has a girlfriend.

14
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,870
That's me.

15
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,810
Don't you get it at this point?

16
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:29,330
It's me! I'm Park Yunjae's girlfriend!

17
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:00,590
   

18
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,220
It's all a mess.

19
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,280
Everything is a mess.

20
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,690
Everything's a mess.

21
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,710
You're the biggest mess!

22
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,730
Are you getting rashes on your face?

23
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,600
I'm just worried.

24
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,020
Must be nice to live a life without worries.

25
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,520
Your face is just beaming.

26
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,410
Oppa, hi.

27
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,340
Hey.

28
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,870
I stayed up all night, thanks to you.

29
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,800
But I'm not tired at all.

30
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,250
Huh?

31
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,030
Whoa.

32
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,540
You nailed the coffee.

33
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,180
- Sure. 
 - Whoa.

34
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,210
You really shouldn't say "Whoa" to a customer.

35
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,100
Give me a latte.

36
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,500
Did you sleep well, Oppa?

37
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,400
What's going on here?

38
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,060
Did you two...

39
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,000
Don't even go there.

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,300
You said you didn't sleep. You still want more?

41
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,680
What's with you?

42
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,160
Yesterday, you told me I was pretty.

43
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,140
- That's... 
 - You came here yesterday, too?

44
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,850
Something is definitely going on.

45
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,430
Hyeong, did you break up with your girlfriend?

46
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,160
I'm exactly the same as I was yesterday.

47
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,370
But I must not be pretty today.

48
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,600
- Minju. 
 - Yes?

49
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,920
I haven't been able to share something with you

50
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,700
due to some circumstances...

51
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,400
About what?

52
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,110
I have a girlfriend.

53
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,150
Oppa, are you kidding?

54
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,330
You've always been clear about that.

55
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,950
That you have a girlfriend.

56
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,270
I did tell you that,

57
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:15,090
but I don't think I told you in all seriousness.

58
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,190
Seems like you're in the danger zone now.

59
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,240
What?

60
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,040
You're not drawing a line with me,

61
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,530
but for yourself.

62
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,340
Look at this.

63
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,770
Huh? This is Jihun and I.

64
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,210
What is this situation?

65
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,610
Someone posted this on the Yeonhui University online forum last night.

66
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,600
People have been reposting it everywhere.

67
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,840
I am totally flabbergasted. 
    

68
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,210
I understand that Jihun stands out.

69
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:05,070
- But this much? 
  - Yes. 

70
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,890
You and I are blurred out.

71
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:14,850
How could they post a random person's photo like this?

72
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,800
Let's help.

73
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,630
- How? 
 - It's simple.

74
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:24,720
Just point out the identity and coordinates.

75
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,140
You can do that, no problem.

76
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,360
Did you answer all the questions?

77
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,980
I did, but I probably got them wrong.

78
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,020
Let's see.

79
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,200
Yuna, look at the textbook, not my face.

80
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,860
Your face is prettier than the book.

81
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,920
Thanks, Yuna.

82
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,980
But at this rate, we won't make enough progress before the midterms.

83
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:34,470
How much progress have you made with my brother?

84
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,240
- What? 
 - I know everything.

85
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,000
About your relationship with my brother.

86
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,580
Really?

87
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,220
Yunjae told you everything?

88
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,680
I could just tell.

89
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,670
Well, it's quite hard to explain.

90
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:57,250
Don't worry. I'll keep your secret.

91
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:02,100
Although you have a tough road ahead of you.

92
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,970
I'll cheer you two on.

93
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,040
Good luck.

94
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,420
Okay.

95
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,870
Good luck.

96
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,500
 You should have thought about it. 

97
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:31,540
 You... You don't realize how hard I'm trying not to have feelings for you, do you? 

98
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Why is everything such a mess?

99
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,960
I brought some tteokbokki.

100
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,650
That was such a satisfying meal, wasn't it?

101
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,530
Can you hand me a tissue?

102
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,670
Hey, how long will you act like this?

103
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:05,560
You know you haven't said a single word today?

104
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,910
Gosh, you cutie.

105
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:14,820
Stop! You're banned from doing this from now on.

106
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,140
"While Kim Jieun is living as a man,

107
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:29,650
the two parties agree to observe the following rules."

108
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,780
Keep reading.

109
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,070
"First, Kim Jieun will not appear

110
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,620
in front of Choi Yuri, like they're in a scene of a graphic novel."

111
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,670
 I'm late, aren't I? Happy birthday. 

112
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,770
 Yuri! 

113
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,350
"Secondly, whenever and wherever Choi Yuri wants,

114
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,750
Kim Jieun will do the penis fish dance."

115
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,260
 Penis fish! 

116
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,470
 Stop it! 

117
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,580
 Stop! 

118
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,250
- "Thirdly, 
  - Hey. 

119
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,060
Kim Jieun will not physically touch Choi Yuri while she is a man."

120
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,020
 You're warm. 

121
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,360
"Fourth,

122
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,000
Choi Yuri will not fall for Kim Jieun."

123
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,100
 You don't realize how hard I'm trying not to have feelings for you, do you? 

124
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,000
I guess it was really tough for you.

125
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,990
I crossed the line yesterday.

126
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,240
I'm the one who crossed the line. Sorry.

127
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,460
No, I'm more sorry.

128
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,280
   

129
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,500
Why is she not picking up?

130
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,430
Wow, Jihun is now the 7th most popular post on Night Fan.

131
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,940
What?

132
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,400
   

133
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,780
I can't believe it.

134
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,560
He's a regular person. Why?

135
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,760
Kang Dongwon was a regular person,

136
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,570
and so was Chalamet.

137
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,930
The world is so obsessed with looks.

138
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,370
I brought tteokbokki.

139
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,280
Come in.

140
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,990
Should I have brought something else?

141
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,120
No, I've been craving tteokbokki.

142
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,380
- And? 
 - It's just a lot.

143
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,280
Oh, I thought your sister would be here.

144
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,210
She must be busy these days.

145
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,310
She's often late.

146
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,330
Did you open the link I sent you?

147
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,880
The Yeonhui University's "Doe-eyed Hottie" post?

148
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,940
It was hilarious.

149
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,740
- Are you okay? 
 - It's not like I'm a celebrity.

150
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,530
I'm sure it'll die down soon.

151
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,270
It's okay.

152
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,980
Right?

153
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,320
Of course, it will be.

154
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,420
Yunjae.

155
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,880
Yeah?

156
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,800
Yesterday...

157
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,600
- Nothing happened, right? 
 - Yesterday?

158
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,480
No. Not really.

159
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,750
 Not really? 

160
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:41,050
I worked a shift... and went home to sleep.

161
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:44,010
I sent you a text. Didn't you see it?

162
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,580
 Of course, I saw it. 

163
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,930
 How you and that vixen were looking at each other so affectionately. 

164
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,990
Do I have something on my face?

165
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,010
No.

166
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:00,800
I just realized the tteokbokki is too much.

167
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,530
I'm getting heartburn.

168
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,630
You are?

169
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,550
- Want me to buy medicine? 
 - It's not that bad.

170
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,010
I need to rest.

171
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,250
Oh, okay.

172
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,960
Sure.

173
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,600
 Tteokbokki is her favorite. 

174
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,900
 What is she mad about? 

175
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:51,800
Hey! Kim Jieun! Hey! Have you seen this?

176
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,870
 Yeonhui University's doe-eyed hottie. 

177
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,210
 Many people have seen him, 

178
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:59,240
 but his identity has not been revealed. 

179
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,580
 According to a trustworthy source, 

180
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:07,400
 the doe-eyed hottie is the illegitimate son of a conglomerate. 

181
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,930
 According to Close Friend A, he is an idol trainee. 

182
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,970
 An entertainer, serving the top 10% of Gangnam rich ladies, 

183
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,920
 known to be very popular. 

184
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,990
Please do it like this.

185
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,920
Oh, just a moment.

186
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,280
- Honey. 
 - Yeah?

187
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,840
Come here for a moment.

188
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,360
Okay.

189
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,340
Isn't this our child?

190
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,420
Wait, why is our child...

191
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,120
Do you know him?

192
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,110
People say he's Yeonhui University's doe-eyed hottie.

193
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,540
Isn't he so handsome?

194
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,320
- Doe-eyed hottie? 
 - Doe-eyed hottie?

195
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,960
I saw the doe-eyed hottie in real life.

196
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,170
Wow, he's super manly.

197
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,700
- Manly? 
 - Why did he come to our afterparty?

198
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,230
He must know someone.

199
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,550
Right.

200
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,410
Didn't he carry Yunjae out that time?

201
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,510
Carried him out? What's with Park Yunjae?

202
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,930
He doesn't remember.

203
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,520
Do you know how heavy he was?

204
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,590
He was a total zombie.

205
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,610
He was really heavy to carry.

206
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,760
Oppa.

207
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,200
Huh?

208
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,400
What are you looking at so seriously with a frown on your face?

209
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,300
It's nothing.

210
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:28,140
Everyone is talking about Kim Jihun in there.

211
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,190
It'll be awkward if you go in there right now.

212
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,030
I hear he's a conglomerate family's youngest son.

213
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,750
No, he's an idol.

214
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,940
I don't get it.

215
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,490
Why the fuss?

216
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,740
Right?

217
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,330
You're the only one I'm curious about.

218
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,580
I should go to the library.

219
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,320
Really?

220
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,380
There's Park Yunjae.

221
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,240
Woah. Isn't he the doe-eyed hottie?

222
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,000
- So handsome. 
 - So cute!

223
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:18,670
   

224
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:23,470
- Hello? 
  - This is Kim Jihun, right? 

225
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,700
- Who is this? 
  - Hello, I'm President Hot from YouTube. 

226
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,210
 I heard you're the Yeonhui doe-eyed hottie. 

227
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,210
I'm not the doe-eyed hottie.

228
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,230
How did you get my number anyway?

229
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,210
 You know the web novelist Mina, right? 

230
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,200
I didn't love the idea,

231
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,000
but there is no safer place, so I suggested meeting here.

232
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,240
It's been crazy, so I just brought toilet paper.

233
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,750
Thank you. Sit down.

234
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,050
What is up with that Mina?

235
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,830
How dare she give out my number?

236
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,830
She's a born villain.

237
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,560
She feels victimized by us.

238
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,400
I bet she's dancing like a happy witch right now.

239
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:11,060
When did they snap these photos, anyway?

240
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,470
What? This one is dated today!

241
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,870
Gosh, what do I do?

242
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,770
You two... are serious about each other, right?

243
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,900
Well, of course.

244
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,760
- Yeah. 
 - Park Yunjae, what about you?

245
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,840
Huh? Yeah.

246
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,180
You two love each other enough not to care about what the world thinks, right?

247
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,140
At the same time. One, two, three.

248
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,500
 - Yes.  
 - That's all I needed to hear.

249
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,380
I'll clean up the mess I made.

250
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,740
What will you do?

251
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:50,510
The finale for Yeonhui University's doe-eyed hottie.

252
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,660
Chief Editor, this is Glass Shoes.

253
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,340
The fan signing event you mentioned the other day.

254
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,410
I changed my mind.

255
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:04,860
I'll do it.

256
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:09,340
And, of course, I'll reveal my face.

257
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:27,550
♫  Can't stop, can't stop thinking about the  ♫

258
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:31,260
♫  Through the cracks in the window where the wind of memory blows  ♫

259
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,990
Looks good.

260
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:38,830
   

261
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,340
♫  Wake up and make up  ♫

262
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,000
Nice.

263
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,140
Don't open your mouth too wide.

264
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,380
Like that.

265
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,290
So sexy.

266
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:55,200
♫  Can't stop, can't stop thinking about  ♫

267
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,440
There you go.

268
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,900
Exactly.

269
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:03,130
♫  From the space that is you  ♫

270
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:06,290
   

271
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,170
♫  Unable to leave, again like this,  ♫

272
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:16,200
♫  I wander around you  ♫

273
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,670
Will this actually be effective?

274
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:22,300
She has more than 150,000 followers.

275
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,230
150,000?

276
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:27,610
I didn't realize that you were such a famous author.

277
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,710
Thanks for acknowledging it now.

278
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:33,730
It won't be totally useless once people start reposting it.

279
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,000
   

280
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,452
   

281
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,121
   

282
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:43,651
   

283
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,660
   

284
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,470
   

285
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,700
- A cafe for civil servant exam students? 
 - That scared me.

286
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:06,800
Are you thinking of playing hooky and preparing for the civil servant exam?

287
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,600
No.

288
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,290
Black cards are only available to holders with 10 billion in their account,

289
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,530
and he has three of them.

290
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,020
He's a VVIP.

291
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,080
- You should better make this happen. 
 - Okay.

292
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,170
Yes.

293
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,500
   

294
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,640
What a quiet and nice café.

295
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,250
That's our café's greatest strength.

296
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,070
Come by and study here sometime.

297
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,180
It might be quieter than the student dorm.

298
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,740
Sure.

299
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,240
So, Yeongseok, what brought you here?

300
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,410
I thought about it and noticed you were always the one who came to me.

301
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,670
Well, I have nothing to do

302
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,870
and you're a student, Yeongseok.

303
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,460
But still, I'm a man.

304
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,630
Sticking to gender roles is my pet peeve.

305
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,010
You haven't had lunch yet, have you?

306
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,170
I found a hot spot.

307
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:11,300
Oh, but I bet you know this area better.

308
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,220
I only know bars.

309
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,240
Then, should we head out?

310
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,840
Give me five minutes.

311
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,360
Okay, I'll wait outside.

312
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,670
Yeongseok! You...

313
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,780
 Baekje Hospital, Room 804. 

314
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,200
I left my phone behind.

315
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,750
Here it is.

316
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,870
Thank you.

317
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,750
 Your dad is back at the hospital. 

318
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,590
 He says he'd die with his eyes open if he doesn't meet your future wife. 

319
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:54,190
 What should we do about his stubbornness? 

320
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,310
It totally slipped my mind.

321
00:20:56,310 --> 00:21:00,900
I forgot that I have a group reservation this evening.

322
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,850
Let's grab food later.

323
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,580
Sorry.

324
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,050
O-Okay.

325
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,410
- Let go of me! 
 - Come on!

326
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,620
Father, please don't do this!

327
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:21,590
Did I ever pressure you to make money?

328
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,620
Or get a job?

329
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:27,400
I just want you to get married like everyone else.

330
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,020
Your father is about to die, and you can't do that for me?

331
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,380
Who would want to marry me when I have a father like you?

332
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,420
What did you say?

333
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,260
- How dare you? 
 - Honey!

334
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,600
Is that all you have to say? Come over here.

335
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,030
- You bastard. 
 - W-Wait.

336
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,670
Who are you?

337
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,310
Mother. Father.

338
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,220
Good to meet you for the first time.

339
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,140
I'm Ham Jeongja.

340
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,300
Jeongja, how did you get here?

341
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,090
Do you know Yeongseok?

342
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,020
I'm not a bad person.

343
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:08,170
I happened to learn about you and came to say hello.

344
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,910
My goodness.

345
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,020
Could you be...

346
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,880
So, please don't worry.

347
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,980
If you just trust me and get your treatment,

348
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:24,230
then wouldn't only happy days await us?

349
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,800
My goodness!

350
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,010
I knew it.

351
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,010
Look here.

352
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:33,700
We don't need insurance.

353
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,120
- Pardon? 
 - Father, please behave.

354
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,100
The world has really come to this.

355
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:44,730
You want to do business with a dying old man?

356
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,460
How desperate do you have to be to do such a thing?

357
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,880
Shame on you!

358
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,750
Shame?

359
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,670
How could you say that to my baby?

360
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,350
You don't need to bring anything with you.

361
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:10,630
Not even a single spoon.

362
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,390
People misunderstand because he studied for the civil servant exam for a long time,

363
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:16,080
and because of his looks.

364
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,840
But we only eat Korean beef in our family.

365
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,850
- And only the top grade at that. 
 - That's right.

366
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:24,330
Oh my, I love beef.

367
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:33,350
Why don't we... set the date?

368
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:37,940
F-Father, you just met her. How can you set the wedding date?

369
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:50,870
He must really be in love.

370
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,760
I was talking about a date to butcher a cow

371
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,560
and he took it the other way.

372
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,430
All right, all right. Very good.

373
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:04,580
Yes, yes. Very good indeed.

374
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:13,970
While we're at it, let's set the date for the wedding.

375
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,460
F-Father.

376
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,830
Well, I wouldn't mind that.

377
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,800
Really?

378
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,500
All right!

379
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,720
Amazing!

380
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,380
- We did it! 
 - Father!

381
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,310
I can die in peace now!

382
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:35,660
Woah, I'm so happy! I'm so happy!

383
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,520
Father, are you seeing this?

384
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,810
Father, your grandson is getting married!

385
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,060
 So cute! 

386
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:46,620
 - Father, you'll get hurt! Come down. 
 - You'll fall! 

387
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,650
You didn't have to bring such an expensive gift.

388
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:53,030
You're a student, so you probably don't have much.

389
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,680
It's not expensive.

390
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,640
It's a popular bakery near Yeonhui University. It's good.

391
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,300
How come you're so different from my son?

392
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,160
Mom, won't you leave?

393
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:10,300
Gosh, I wish you could be my son-in-law.

394
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,400
My dream is to dote on my son-in-law.

395
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,240
Mom, are you not going to leave? I need to study!

396
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,710
I'm leaving. I will.

397
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,130
Have a good study session.

398
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,200
- Leave! 
 - My gosh!

399
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,540
Why did you lock the door?

400
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,900
   

401
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,230
Oh, this?

402
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,640
I see you also follow Yuri.

403
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,330
Oh, right.

404
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:48,820
You said your dream is to be a web novelist.

405
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,540
Don't think you can brush this off.

406
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,450
I wished you—

407
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:58,180
I wished you good luck just the other day.

408
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,840
How dare you cheat already?

409
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,810
Yuna, it's not what you think.

410
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,800
And with my favorite writer?

411
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,500
More than I feel bad for Park Yunjae,

412
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,130
I feel sorry for myself for having been her fan ever since she debuted,

413
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,700
only to lose her to my own overwhelming devotion.

414
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,840
I feel like I've been invalidated.

415
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,940
Do you know what that feels like?

416
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,010
Wait a second.

417
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:28,370
To summarize,

418
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,840
you and my brother are indeed in love.

419
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,540
Your best friend is the novelist Glass Shoes,

420
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,760
and she's covering for you, like I have been?

421
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,290
Is that it?

422
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:42,350
Yes. I'm sorry,

423
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,500
but could you speak quietly?

424
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,040
Q-Quiet...

425
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,960
Be quiet. Quiet...

426
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,210
   

427
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,940
   

428
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,830
   

429
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,980
   

430
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,560
   

431
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,230
- What's your name? 
 - Yejin.

432
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,810
Yejin.

433
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,950
Could you shake my hand?

434
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,390
I'm a fan.

435
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,280
Huh?

436
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,600
Huh?

437
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,380
Yuri 4?

438
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,280
You're my fan, too?

439
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,800
Whoa. You were Glass Shoes?

440
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,770
I thought you were far from

441
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,770
my romantic fantasy perspective of the world.

442
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,680
I love romantic fantasy.

443
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,380
I've read everything by Glass Shoes.

444
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,130
I can't believe it.

445
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:49,860
Yuri 4 is Glass Shoes...

446
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,870
The next person is waiting.

447
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,530
Will you go, please?

448
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,410
Hello.

449
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,600
- Your name? 
 - My codename is Penis Fish.

450
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:13,300
Are you... Kim Ji...

451
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,850
Yes, that's right!

452
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:18,410
I'm a student currently being tutored by Jihun.

453
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:22,420
I heard you're his best friend.

454
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,730
Oh, yes.

455
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:27,550
Wow, I thought he changed there for a second.

456
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,300
Nice to meet you.

457
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,170
- What's your name? 
 - Park Yuna.

458
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,250
- Park Yuna. 
 - Park Yuna...

459
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,580
Could you draw a heart, too?

460
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,980
Oh, a heart?

461
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,820
This place is huge.

462
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,690
Choi Yuri was this big?

463
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,500
I know right?

464
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,800
There's Yuri.

465
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,150
There she is.

466
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,220
Wow.

467
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,180
Incredible. Is this the line?

468
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,110
Looks like it.

469
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,620
You didn't need to come with me.

470
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:06,090
You said this is the finale of Yeonhui University's doe-eyed hottie.

471
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:09,000
I'm the protector of that doe-eyed hottie.

472
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,090
Wait a second.

473
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,360
That's my little sister, right?

474
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,210
It is.

475
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,090
Shouldn't she be at school right now?

476
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,870
Yuna.

477
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,180
It could get bad if we get involved.

478
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,670
Let's just quietly get an autograph and leave.

479
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,780
What?

480
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,370
Isn't that Minhyeok?

481
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,380
Hey, Park Yuna!

482
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,300
Hey.

483
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,120
- Brother? 
 - Hyeong?

484
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,790
What are you two doing here right now?

485
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,610
What do you think? Taking photos.

486
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,750
Exactly. Why is he taking photos of you?

487
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:00,110
She asked me, so I complied.

488
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:03,360
Do you two know each other?

489
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,960
She's my little sister.

490
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,930
Oh, really?

491
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:11,840
Oh, looking at you two... you look identical.

492
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,250
- What? 
 - What?

493
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,430
So annoying.

494
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,490
- What do you mean? 
 - Of course, I'm annoyed.

495
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,500
Hi, guys.

496
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,190
- Hyeong. 
 - Teacher!

497
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,220
Aren't you supposed to be in school right now?

498
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,890
I just stepped out during lunch.

499
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:26,250
Hurry back while I'm still nice.

500
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,800
Before I video call Mom.

501
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,990
You're such a pain.

502
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,630
See you later, Teacher.

503
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:34,840
Okay. Bye.

504
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,490
So annoying. Of all places...

505
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:38,320
Won't you hurry?

506
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,540
Gosh, seriously.

507
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,720
So annoying.

508
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,350
Writer, hello.

509
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,380
Hello.

510
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,700
Hello.

511
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,550
- Gosh, thank you. 
 - I'm enjoying your book!

512
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,380
Yes, thank you.

513
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,170
- Oh, yes. 
 - I loved your book.

514
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,990
Oh my.

515
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,330
Look who's here.

516
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:06,710
This is Glass Shoes' boyfriend!

517
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,840
Hello.

518
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,330
I could tell your looks were quite something.

519
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:18,370
You were the doe-eyed hottie!

520
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:21,340
Gosh, I can't believe it.

521
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,430
Who is this?

522
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:25,550
You know, Mina eonn—

523
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,920
Mina nuna.

524
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,680
Why are you standing here?

525
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,210
Oh, I was about to line up.

526
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:35,090
Why would the boyfriend line up?

527
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,720
You get a free pass. Come here.

528
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,880
I'm okay.

529
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,100
- Come here. 
 - I'm really okay.

530
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,900
Everyone, you know who he is. Right?

531
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,610
This is Writer Glass Shoes' boyfriend.

532
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,640
Her boyfriend. The doe-eyed hottie.

533
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,800
The doe-eyed hottie!

534
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,880
This can't be happening.

535
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,550
Writer Glass Shoes' boyfriend.

536
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,840
Step aside.

537
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,690
Yuri. Here.

538
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:03,440
Woah, your boyfriend is here.

539
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,360
Really?

540
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,430
I'm a fan.

541
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,890
"I'm a fan"? You sound so rigid.

542
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:22,590
Give us sweet talk like you did the other day.

543
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:26,340
Everyone, this is Glass Shoes' boyfriend.

544
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,850
Who knows about the doe-eyed hottie?

545
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,740
 Me! 

546
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,830
There we go!

547
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:36,450
Hey, do something about this.

548
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:41,610
Babe, you made it.

549
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:51,170
Hi, Babe.

550
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:54,100
"Babe." He said "Babe."

551
00:32:55,950 --> 00:33:00,150
How does "The Private Life of a Goddess" end?

552
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,420
 With a kiss! 

553
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,760
Yes, with a kiss!

554
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,880
Writer.

555
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,850
The fans desperately want it.

556
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:13,100
- Kiss! 
  - Kiss! 

557
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,330
 Kiss! Hurry up! 

558
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,770
Hurry up!

559
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:19,170
Kiss!

560
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:21,220
- There we go! 
  - Kiss! 

561
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:24,690
Hey, what the heck is this?

562
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:27,760
 - Kiss! 
 - Hurry up! 

563
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,920
 - Kiss! 
 - Come on! 

564
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,040
 Kiss! Kiss! 

565
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,800
Let's do it.

566
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,030
- Are you crazy? 
 - You have to put a period to end the book.

567
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,700
What are you talking about?

568
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,000
It's a bigger loss for me.

569
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,660
You know I've been single since birth. This would be my first kiss.

570
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,980
So why would you do it?

571
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,480
Can't you see them?

572
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,900
Actions speak louder than words.

573
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,800
- Just three seconds. 
 - Hey!

574
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:00,460
 Kiss! Kiss! 

575
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,310
Hey, smile.

576
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:33,530
I said smile.

577
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,920
They're kissing.

578
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,670
That looks like the doe-eyed hottie.

579
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,670
It is him.

580
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,390
So, they were kissing?

581
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,500
What is this?

582
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:01,210
Is that what it was?

583
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:06,340
   

584
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:12,340
   

585
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,460
Welcome.

586
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,870
Take a seat over there.

587
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:29,790
Could I get one portion civil servant udon noodles?

588
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:32,020
You don't look like a civil servant exam student.

589
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,800
It's your first time here, right?

590
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,710
Yes, a friend studying in Noryangjin said

591
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,930
you have the best noodles in the area.

592
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:40,940
Is that right?

593
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:45,560
Goodness. Whoever they are, they'll make it big.

594
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,490
Our udon noodles are known for being cheap rather than for the taste.

595
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:50,950
It's a big portion.

596
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:53,360
What's your friend's name?

597
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,280
It's Hong Yeongseok. Hong Yeongseok.

598
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,620
Yeongseok? Hong Yeongseok?

599
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,380
Of course, I know him.

600
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,810
So you're Yeongseok's friend.

601
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:04,750
Yeongseok came yesterday,

602
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:07,150
the day before yesterday, and the day before that.

603
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,390
He's so consistent.

604
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,550
He only eats udon noodles.

605
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:21,030
Ma'am, if you're not too busy, would you like to share a Sprite with me?

606
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:29,390
 While we're at it, let's set the date for the wedding. 

607
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:33,420
 Well, I wouldn't mind that. 

608
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,620
Gosh, I'm out of cigarettes.

609
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,650
Hi.

610
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,800
Hey... you...

611
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,720
You didn't expect to see me here, huh?

612
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:41,410
Yeah. What are you doing here?

613
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,760
The udon place lady told me.

614
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,590
She said you would be here.

615
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,390
Oh, that lady.

616
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:55,480
Yeah, I come here often,

617
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,850
because it's quiet here.

618
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:00,660
How did you find the udon place lady, though?

619
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,140
She seemed really popular on the online café for civil servant examinees.

620
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,900
She has been touted as the president of Noryangjin.

621
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,880
That's right.

622
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,740
Are you preparing for the exam, too?

623
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:12,860
No, I signed up to find you.

624
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,440
Me?

625
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,290
We didn't exchange numbers when we met last time.

626
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:23,550
I've been really curious about how you were doing.

627
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,760
Type in your number.

628
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,560
You're not married, are you?

629
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,740
- No. 
 - Or about to get married?

630
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:42,170
Having kids is okay.

631
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:49,910
You're still your wild self, Kim Jihye.

632
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:55,800
Here it is.

633
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,710
It's ringing.

634
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:12,990
We laughed a lot together when we were in school.

635
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:16,150
I think I laughed my fill back then.

636
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,460
I'm still super funny.

637
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,220
Huh?

638
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,900
The day after a company dinner,

639
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:29,670
people take a sick day because their stomachs hurt from laughing.

640
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,370
They take a sick day?

641
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,610
Because their stomachs hurt?

642
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:36,080
It hurts!

643
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,400
Gosh, seriously.

644
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,520
You hit as hard as usual.

645
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,590
Can I call you every once in a while?

646
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:58,240
Sure.

647
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,570
But there will be a lot of times when I won't be able to pick up.

648
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,630
I'll call you back, though.

649
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,010
It looked like you ran out of cigarettes.

650
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:42,110
What's this?

651
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:49,690
 Smoking isn't good for your health, so don't do it too much~! 

652
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:51,630
 From Jihye. 

653
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:57,190
Gosh, that wild girl.

654
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:25,790
What is she doing?

655
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:35,050
Should I just forget about everything and make him mine?

656
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:36,470
No, Choi Yuri.

657
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:38,240
That would make you a bad bitch.

658
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,270
Jieun is struggling a lot right now.

659
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,630
But...

660
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:49,580
I'm struggling, too.

661
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,350
So noisy.

662
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,580
Let me sit with you.

663
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,690
- Ma'am. 
 - Yes?

664
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:34,610
A Coke and rolled eggs.

665
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,960
- Also, some rice. 
 - Yes.

666
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,930
What's up with you?

667
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:46,200
Stop filling up with liquid. Eat some real food.

668
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,810
You probably starved all day.

669
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,780
Cheers.

670
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,770
What's all this?

671
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,800
Hey, what is this? What's going on?

672
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:36,260
World War 29.

673
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,920
Dad bought stocks behind Mom's back.

674
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,220
What's so bad about that?

675
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,760
She went as far as to kick Dad out?

676
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,620
He apparently lost 30 million won (~$30,000).

677
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,680
What's this? This is Dad's.

678
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,410
It was sitting outside.

679
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,800
Seriously.

680
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:03,880
 First shelf of the living room bookcase. 

681
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,290
 "The Know-Hows of an Expert on Getting Loved by His Wife" 

682
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:12,400
 Page 78, page 88, page 98. 

683
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,590
78...

684
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:53,970
   

685
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,860
Ma'am, could I have another glass?

686
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:09,550
Yes.

687
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,330
Gosh, Dad.

688
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:16,230
Straighten your shoulders.

689
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:19,210
A man can get into stocks at some point.

690
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:20,820
It happens.

691
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,630
You only lost 30 million, not 300 million.

692
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:25,410
It was 50 million.

693
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:27,230
50 million?

694
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,130
You worked for the government all your life.

695
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:32,980
Why play stocks now?

696
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:37,210
You told me not to touch money if I don't work for it.

697
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:39,740
You told me that so many times.

698
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:52,150
What do I do?

699
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,260
Go home.

700
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:06,730
   

701
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,040
Dad.

702
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,650
Let's just go home.

703
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:11,180
No, no.

704
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:13,980
I need to stay away tonight.

705
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,290
I'm sorry...

706
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:21,260
that you had to see your dad in this state.

707
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:26,040
Go.

708
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:40,920
 Welcome. 

709
00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:02,370
Do you know what life and soju have in common?

710
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:06,340
Nuna, you haven't even had a single shot of soju.

711
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:11,600
The common point is that...

712
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:16,330
they both have two syllables!

713
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:19,540
Should I just leave you and go?

714
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:27,330
I had my first-ever kiss today.

715
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:30,660
But that kiss was not the beginning.

716
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:33,010
It was the end. The end.

717
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:35,960
If you were going to cover for him, doing it that decisively was the best way.

718
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,250
I also sensed

719
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:41,740
that Yunjae and Jihun had that kind of relationship.

720
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:45,010
But that was my first kiss.

721
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,160
- Is it a problem that it was your first? 
 - Of course!

722
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,020
The first one is so important.

723
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:55,570
I wouldn't be acting like this if it were my second or third.

724
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,390
This is not love.

725
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:06,450
This is fandom.

726
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,950
That crazy...

727
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,050
Follow me.

728
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:35,680
What? Nuna, why are you being like this?

729
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,850
I'm not ready for that yet.

730
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:40,910
That's Park Yunjae, right?

731
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,720
Yunjae?

732
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,780
Why is he going in there?

733
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:51,470
- Is he with Jihun? 
 - He went to his mom's shop earlier.

734
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,990
Then?

735
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:56,820
 I stayed up all night, thanks to you. 

736
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,180
 What's with you? 

737
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:02,410
 Yesterday, you told me I was pretty. 

738
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,220
It has to be Kang Minju.

739
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,260
- Who? 
 - Kang Minju.

740
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:09,610
She has a crush on Yunjae.

741
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:12,650
He went to a motel with her?

742
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:14,770
I knew something was off.

743
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:16,380
Why? What is?

744
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:17,510
Is he cheating?

745
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:20,230
I mean they asked each other how they slept.

746
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:22,490
"Yesterday, you told me I was pretty."

747
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:24,530
Saying stuff like this.

748
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,150
- Mom. 
 - Yeah?

749
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:43,130
Could you teach me how to cut hair?

750
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:45,320
What do you need that for?

751
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:49,530
I mean... It's not like I can get a job while I'm a guy.

752
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:52,460
I thought I could learn at your shop.

753
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:55,710
Yes, Honey. That sounds like a good idea.

754
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:58,640
You think anyone can be a hairdresser?

755
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,360
You're not even good with your hands.

756
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:04,420
That's why I'm asking you to teach me.

757
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,630
What's up, Yuri?

758
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,980
Me? I'm at my mom's shop.

759
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:26,370
Yunjae? I talked to him earlier. Why?

760
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:30,220
What? Motel?

761
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:32,130
Who did you say he went with?

762
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:38,630
   

763
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,770
Where is he? Where is Park Yunjae?

764
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:52,180
Did he really go in with Kang Minju?

765
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:53,970
That's what I'm telling you.

766
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:58,990
Hyeong, hi. I'm sorry we're seeing each other like this.

767
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:02,290
How could Park Yunjae do this to me?

768
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:04,430
Call him right now.

769
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:07,250
It's Yunjae!

770
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:19,040
He was wearing a jacket earlier, but now it's gone.

771
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:23,540
What a bastard.

772
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,580
I can't hold back.

773
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:27,840
Hey, Park Yunjae!

774
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:31,080
Hey, hi. What are you doing here?

775
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,880
What? Hi?

776
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,370
You just got caught red-handed, yet you're acting so brazen.

777
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:40,090
Hey, Kim Jieun! Come out!

778
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,850
Hey, what's going on with you guys?

779
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:50,050
Jihun, why are you here?

780
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:54,390
We saw everything. We saw you enter and exit the motel.

781
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:58,360
It's been an hour, seven minutes and thirty-four seconds.

782
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,750
You were evem timing it?

783
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:05,150
Did you go with Minju?

784
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,890
Did you go with Kang Minju?

785
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:10,810
What are you...?

786
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:14,680
I went with my dad.

787
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:20,010
Dad? Hey, why not just say you went with your mom?

788
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,470
I get how this situation could lead to a misunderstanding,

789
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:30,140
but I really came with my dad.

790
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:31,470
Lead the way.

791
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:33,300
- That's right. 
 - What?

792
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,610
If you're so confident, lead the way.

793
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,490
There you go!

794
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:39,640
Do you really want to do this?

795
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,230
I have nothing more to lose.

796
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:45,320
You'll have to come to my house to tutor.

797
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:49,990
That's not what's important right now.

798
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:52,580
You're hilarious today.

799
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:53,900
Let's go.

800
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,620
- Hey, follow me. 
 - Huh?

801
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:08,760
Nuna, I think it's overkill for us to go, too.

802
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,660
Park Yunjae is the one who went overboard.

803
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:12,550
Hurry up and follow me.

804
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,340
Hey. Look carefully.

805
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:20,980
Will do.

806
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,790
Dad.

807
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:30,030
Dad!

808
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,570
Who are you?

809
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:39,890
I see. You must be Kang Minju.

810
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:41,410
No, no.

811
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:43,600
What's going on?

812
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:48,340
I'm sorry. I had the wrong room number.

813
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:50,010
Gosh.

814
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:51,810
Sorry.

815
00:53:56,370 --> 00:53:58,330
No, it's the room next door.

816
00:53:58,330 --> 00:54:01,370
Room next door, my foot. Open the door now!

817
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:04,970
It's really the room next door!

818
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:07,450
I had the wrong room number.

819
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:09,110
Follow me.

820
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,730
Look now.

821
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:20,330
Dad?

822
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:24,230
Dad.

823
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:27,970
You're so absent-minded. You left your jacket here.

824
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,860
Look, it's my dad.

825
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:36,130
My dad!

826
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:38,700
It's my dad!

827
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:41,900
My dad! Guys, look. It's my dad.

828
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,890
- Guys, my dad. 
 - Hello.

829
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:45,910
My dad.

830
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:51,050
See? It's not Kang Minju.

831
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:53,380
Dad.

832
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:55,690
I'm sorry.

833
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:59,020
Nuna. Nuna, where are you going?

834
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:06,530
Let's go. It's okay.

835
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:29,930
I'm a bit upset.

836
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:33,410
Never mind the others.

837
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:36,180
I didn't expect you would doubt me.

838
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:38,210
I'm sorry.

839
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:41,360
I kept telling myself there's no way,

840
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,740
but Yuri was so sure about it.

841
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:47,290
I had no idea you had so little trust in me.

842
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:50,540
If only I didn't see you with Kang Minju like that—

843
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,220
What did you see me doing with Kang Minju?

844
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:03,670
To be honest, I saw it.

845
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:07,260
You and Kang Minju were looking at each other tenderly at the café.

846
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,900
I was?

847
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:13,700
Oh, that was nothing.

848
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:16,520
I knew you would say that.

849
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:19,310
That's why I didn't want to bring it up.

850
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:24,590
I'm sorry.

851
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:27,060
But it's really nothing.

852
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:30,270
She's nothing more than a junior.

853
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:32,580
I'll keep my eyes on you.

854
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:37,450
Bye.

855
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:43,500
But...

856
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,810
I also have something to tell you.

857
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:52,280
It wasn't fun watching you and Yuri kiss.

858
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:54,220
That wasn't a kiss.

859
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:56,390
That was just one second—

860
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,140
Three seconds?

861
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:06,740
I'm sorry.

862
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:09,540
From now on, I'll draw a clearer line.

863
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:12,400
I'll keep my eyes on you.

864
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:14,680
Go in.

865
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,430
♫  I see your eyes  ♫

866
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:22,030
♫  Even the tears filled to the brim  ♫

867
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:25,050
♫  Will be no more  ♫

868
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:29,310
♫  So, believe me now  ♫

869
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:32,400
♫  Open your eyes  ♫

870
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:44,960
You scared me. Why are you here, Dad?

871
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,190
Why do you look like this?

872
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:52,170
Your mom said to come home right away.

873
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:53,290
Looking like this?

874
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:55,960
All can be forgiven if you're cute.

875
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:01,590
Not true. You're not cute at all.

876
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:05,070
I feel like Mom will ask you for a divorce.

877
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,370
Iljo!

878
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:50,490
Gosh, seriously.

879
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:21,050
Park Yunjae. What brings you here so early?

880
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:23,780
What's with that on your head?

881
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:41,690
What is this?

882
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:45,880
Want to try it together?

883
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:48,550
Lift your leg like this. Lift your leg and kick.

884
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:55,360
Link arms and spin, spin.

885
00:59:57,150 --> 00:59:59,220
Spin. Spin.

886
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:02,180
♫  Make scar, make scars on my heart?  ♫

887
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:05,100
♫  Unable to leave, again like this  ♫

888
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:11,370
♫  I wander around you  ♫

889
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:13,190
One more time. Okay.

890
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:15,170
One, two.

891
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:24,060
♫  Can't stop, can't stop thinking about you  ♫

892
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:30,200
What are you two doing here so early?

893
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:34,240
Minju, what about you? What brings you here so early?

894
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,650
Me? I'm moving in.

895
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:38,250
Moving in?

896
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:39,870
Where?

897
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:41,530
Here.

898
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:45,750
Here?

899
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:47,190
This building?

900
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:50,600
Yes. Second floor, unit 202.

901
01:00:54,020 --> 01:01:01,000


902
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:09,980
   

903
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:23,740
♫  You taught me how to feel with every word  ♫

904
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:29,560
♫  And every glance we've been through  ♫

905
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:33,470
♫  It will always be the same  ♫

906
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:37,890
♫  Running wild in the days of youth  ♫

907
01:01:37,890 --> 01:01:41,890
   

908
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:44,540
 Yunjae! Help me. 
 ~ Preview ~ 

909
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:47,130
 I can't believe I'm doing all this over jealousy. 

910
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:49,190
 I'm feeling a little warm, too. 

911
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:50,670
 Should I just go home? 

912
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:53,720
 Oh, that vixen next door? 

913
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:57,830
 Ouch. I must've sprained my leg walking fast. 

914
01:01:57,830 --> 01:02:00,850
 I don't think I can focus on studying if I send you off alone. 

915
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:02,940
 - Jihun. 
 - She acts like we're really close. 

916
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:04,670
 How did you get my number? 

917
01:02:04,670 --> 01:02:06,900
 How did you think to do that? 

918
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:09,410
 To shake up Park Yunjae? 

919
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:13,920
♫  You let me stay  ♫

920
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:18,480
♫  In the place where you belong  ♫

921
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:23,010
♫  Facing the night so long  ♫
