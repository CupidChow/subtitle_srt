1
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,370
   

2
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,030
   

3
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,550
   

4
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,790
   

5
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,390
   

6
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:46,990


7
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,500
Hey.

8
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,200
- So, what happened is... 
 - No need to explain.

9
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,370
No need?

10
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,780
No.

11
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,360
We're nothing to each other now.

12
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,310
♫  A strangely familiar feeling  ♫

13
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:33,380
♫  The same warmth, a steady flutter  ♫

14
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,860
♫  Beyond the fading sunset  ♫

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,200
♫  Your light seeps quietly into me  ♫

16
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,310
Right.

17
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,760
♫  The way you look at me  ♫

18
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,780
You and I...

19
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,690
♫  Touches memories that feel familiar  ♫

20
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,520
We're nothing to each other now.

21
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:10,260
♫  In the spreading stains of tears  ♫

22
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,570
♫  I finally recognized you  ♫

23
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,390
♫  I see you  ♫

24
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,980
♫  Always, I know more than I see  ♫

25
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,850
♫  It's not a dream  ♫

26
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,360
♫  You're growing clearer  ♫

27
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,920
♫  I hear you  ♫

28
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,610
What?

29
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,020
"Nothing to each other"?

30
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,510
♫  Will you remember?  ♫

31
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,700
♫  I promise you  ♫

32
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,150
♫  In every moment  ♫

33
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,310
♫  I'll see you  ♫

34
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:55,420
   

35
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,530
 I'm coming in. 

36
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,650
My goodness.

37
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,180
What is all this?

38
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,700
You should write with a clear soul.

39
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,590
If you work with dopamine as your main source, you'll die.

40
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,300
Do you now understand how I felt when you had beer cans rolling around?

41
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,600
Just drink instead.

42
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,340
- This time, alcohol is the answer. 
 - No, it's not that.

43
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,400
It's because the contest deadline is this week.

44
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,090
Yeah, sure.

45
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,910
Here.

46
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,400
I may not be a good cook, but I did my best.

47
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:48,520
Thank you, but... can you leave?

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,980
Be sure to eat it.

49
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,600
- Okay? 
 - Okay.

50
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,360
I can't believe we're leaving in three days for the US.

51
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,000
I know, right?

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,100
Going to Corning University with you feels like a dream.

53
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,300
Oh, right. I told my landlord today that I'm moving out.

54
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,550
- Good job. 
 - Let's have dinner together tonight.

55
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,240
- My treat. 
 - Sorry.

56
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,600
- I already have plans. 
 - Plans?

57
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,700
With whom?

58
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,720
It can't be... right?

59
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,310
With my family.

60
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,040
It's the last weekend before we leave.

61
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,740
Then, I should let you go.

62
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,780
We'll see each other every day anyway.

63
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,570
Yes.

64
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,660
Let's eat.

65
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,280
Okay.

66
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,940
Have a seat.

67
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,620
Honey, stop what you're doing and sit down.

68
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,130
There's no space to put more food.

69
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,650
He's right, Mom. Stop.

70
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,940
I'm done.

71
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,720
Here, here. Let's pray.

72
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,040
Our oldest son, Park Yunjae,

73
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,800
is about to study abroad at Corning University in the US.

74
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,970
May his journey be smooth without any trouble.

75
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:59,990
God, please be with him and take care of him. Amen.

76
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,770
Amen.

77
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,100
Let's eat.

78
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,850
Should we have some coffee?

79
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,400
I'll do it.

80
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,300
It's fine.

81
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,870
Let me do it, Mom.

82
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,000
I said it's fine.

83
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,060
Stop.

84
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,330
I'm sorry, Mom.

85
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,310
 Thank you for everything. 

86
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,620
Surprisingly, I'm sad.

87
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,020
Where in the US again?

88
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,470
Corning University.

89
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,000
It's in Maryland.

90
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,920
Corning University?

91
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,840
Were you that smart?

92
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,640
I've never felt that.

93
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,310
Me neither.

94
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,500
Anyway, safe travels.

95
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,590
- This is your severance pay. 
 - Pardon?

96
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,810
What kind of part-time job has severance pay?

97
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,020
I can't.

98
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:05,100
I'm the boss and you're not, so take it.

99
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,100
Thank you for everything.

100
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,530
Thank you.

101
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,200
Minhyeok, can we talk for a second?

102
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,700
   

103
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,700
 Hyeong, when will you return my clothes that you borrowed at the club? 

104
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,890
Oh, right.

105
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:12,160
I wanted to say something to you before I left for the US.

106
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,430
The US?

107
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,600
So, you're going.

108
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,360
Yes.

109
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,080
That's good.

110
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,150
When do you leave?

111
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,800
Tomorrow.

112
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,810
Really?

113
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,030
That's really great.

114
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,810
Congratulations.

115
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,840
You're...

116
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,370
doing well, right?

117
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,460
Of course.

118
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,300
I'm doing great.

119
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,370
I'm getting ready for the contest.

120
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:00,960
I'm eating and sleeping really well.

121
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,420
Yunjae, you should also...

122
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,200
take good care of your meals when you're in the States.

123
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,280
Study hard, too.

124
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,400
Something urgent came up, so I have to go.

125
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,870
Bye.

126
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,730
Hey!

127
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,400
That day,

128
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,400
I went to see you for the first time after holding back for so long.

129
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,340
I heard I got so drunk,

130
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:51,150
I passed out in front of your place.

131
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,070
I held back...

132
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,570
and held back.

133
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,090
I swear it was my first time going there.

134
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,750
I know you said I don't need to explain,

135
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,990
but I really wanted to.

136
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,770
Should I really go?

137
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,520
Jieun,

138
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,200
do you really want me to go?

139
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:37,580
♫  Even when it hurts so much I can't even walk  ♫

140
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:42,700
♫  Even when the tears cloud my vision  ♫

141
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:51,670
♫  I'll smile in front of my love, whom I can't have  ♫

142
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,600
♫  The happy memories of us together  ♫

143
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:04,540
♫  Even the short ones, I'll treasure them with my heart  ♫

144
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:11,370
♫  Like the stars embroidered in my eyes  ♫

145
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:14,760
♫  Forever  ♫

146
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,890
What's up?

147
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,420
I came to say goodbye.

148
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,430
A farewell.

149
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:31,360
I'm going to the US on the night flight tonight.

150
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,030
Okay.

151
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,420
With Yunjae.

152
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,620
I see.

153
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,360
Safe travels.

154
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,060
Don't worry about Yunjae.

155
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,260
Yeah, sure.

156
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,960
Oppa...

157
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,990
I mean, Eonni. You take care, too.

158
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,570
You, too.

159
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,800
Tonight at 9:20. Hana Airlines.

160
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,070
What's wrong with you?

161
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,210
Take care, Park Yunjae! Okay?

162
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:45,120
I'll take care of Mom and Dad.

163
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,900
Sure.

164
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,600
Take good care of them while I'm gone.

165
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,400
Son,

166
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,870
we all believe in you.

167
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,610
I'll be back safe, Mom.

168
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,300
Should we hug?

169
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,750
- Don't go! 
 - Don't go.

170
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,950
Don't go.

171
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:41,260
   

172
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,000
- Hey. 
 - Did you submit your work?

173
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,830
What?

174
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,380
Oh, right.

175
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,400
What do you mean by "oh, right"?

176
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,100
Hey, you have an hour until the deadline!

177
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,700
I'm writing.

178
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,600
You have an hour left and you're still writing?

179
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,480
Read me the last three sentences you wrote.

180
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,420
Three sentences?

181
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:08,940
   

182
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,500
9:20 p.m. Hana Airlines.

183
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,600
- What? 
 - 9:20 p.m. Hana Airlines.

184
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,700
 What are you saying? What? 

185
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,950
9:20 p.m.

186
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,770
Hana Airlines.

187
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,190
♫  Open your eyes  ♫

188
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,830
♫  This moment I dreamed about  ♫

189
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,520

192
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,460
I guess he's not coming.

193
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,970
What?

194
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,630
What? N-Nothing.

195
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,540
We should go in now.

196
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,130
Yeah. Let's go.

197
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,730

Geez.

What is all this?

213
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,780
Geez.

214
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,660
Oh my!

215
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,420
Hello?

216
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,220
Hey, I'm not Kim Jihye!

217
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,020
Hi, Hong Yeongseok!

218
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,890
Good luck with your exam! Fighting! Fighting!

219
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,370
Hi! Good job!

220
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:08,030
- Thank you! 
 - Good job!

221
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,120
Bye!

222
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,390
Thank you.

223
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,750
Good job!

224
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:18,110
Hey! Good job!

225
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,130
What is this?

226
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,730
   

227
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,380
I can't see.

228
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,420
Why can't I see?

229
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,610
I could see just fine yesterday.

230
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,500
Where do you rent something like this?

231
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,130
Hi.

232
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,020
Kim Jihye, seriously?

233
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,450
Did you do well on your exam?

234
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:16,790
Wait, no. It doesn't matter if you didn't do well.

235
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,970
I think I did well.

236
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,760
Really?

237
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,310
Hey! That's great!

238
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,200
How did you know I was here?

239
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,310
How did you know I was taking the exam here?

240
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,950
I'm friends with the President of Noryangjin.

241
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,740
- The udon place lady? 
 - Yeah.

242
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,520
Geez, seriously!

243
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,330
I'll get going now.

244
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,920
Huh?

245
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,120
Let's eat.

246
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,950
I'm hungry.

247
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,900
Hungry...

248
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,010
Y-You're hungry?

249
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,430
Yeah.

250
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,420
Y-You shouldn't be hungry.

251
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,880
L-Let's go eat.

252
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,400
Let's go eat. Let's do that.

253
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,950
Then, it's my treat. My treat!

254
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:21,210
Kim Jihye, you're so funny.

255
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,480
Where do you get this kind of thing?

256
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,550
Where did you buy it?

257
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,600
That's right!

258
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,370
I didn't know Hong Yeongseok could laugh that much.

259
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,620
Like this!

260
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,110
What's so funny?

261
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,100
 So cool, Kim Jihye. 

262
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,300
Now that he's laughing, he's ugly.

263
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:53,030
   

264
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,380
This is nothing!

265
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,200
What should we eat?

266
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,650
What should we eat?

267
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,910
Wow, this is...

268
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,140
What should we eat?

269
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,020
- This is red ginseng. 
 - Yeah.

270
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,340
Red ginseng is good for you.

271
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:12,710
   

272
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,810
Congratulations, Mom and Dad.

273
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,900
This is a gift from me.

274
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,400
- Matching pajamas. 
 - Oh my god!

275
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,350
Thank you!

276
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,800
Thank you, too, Jihye.

277
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,900
- Thanks for the food. 
 - Don't mention it.

278
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,000
But, Mom and Dad,

279
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,400
you know I'm 33 this year.

280
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,970
How is this your 30th wedding anniversary?

281
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,200
Huh?

282
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,420
Do you really have to ask that?

283
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,800
Your mom didn't want to have a wedding.

284
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,500
Even after we had you, she wasn't sure what was going to happen.

285
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,700
I think I know how you must've felt.

286
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,400
Honey, do you regret marrying me?

287
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,570
Gathering up the courage to hold onto you

288
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:11,800
was the best choice I've ever made.

289
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:16,300
Thanks to that, I gained Jihye and Jieun.

290
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:20,220
Gosh! Stop it. So cheesy.

291
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,460
But, Jihye, do you have some good news?

292
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,400
- You're glowing. 
 - Huh?

293
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,300
- Really? 
 - She has a crush on someone.

294
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,000
Really? Who?

295
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,700
Well...

296
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,940
you both know him.

297
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,360
Who?

298
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,890
You know...

299
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,600
it's Hong Yeongseok.

300
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,960
My deskmate in high school.

301
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,140
Ah, I know him! I know him!

302
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,300
Your first love!

303
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,960
- How did you run into him again? 
 - Somehow.

304
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,450
We're not dating yet.

305
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:05,060
I'll tell you later if we do.

306
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,300
How about you?

307
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:15,960
Grandma was gushing about your boyfriend, saying that he was so dependable.

308
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,650
Really?

309
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,350
I broke up with Yunjae.

310
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,800
It might have been a happy ending for you two,

311
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:32,130
but I made the best choice for Yunjae and me.

312
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,240
So that's also a happy ending. Isn't it?

313
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:39,610
My daughters... when did you all grow up?

314
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:43,150
I really don't need to worry anymore.

315
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:52,700
Okay. Let's raise a toast to "I love you," right?

316
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,030
 I love you! 

317
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,050
 Cheers! 

318
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:09,530
   

319
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,400
Thank you for this food.

320
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,560
Open your eyes straight.

321
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,730
Yeah.

322
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,910
You're looking good these days.

323
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,420
You know I must not get sick.

324
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,050
Oppa, do you want to go see a musical this weekend?

325
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:55,430
I have so much to do.

326
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,500
It's because you're taking on stuff you don't need to.

327
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,800
- You'll really only study here? 
 - Yeah.

328
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,390
That's why I'm here.

329
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,400
So annoying.

330
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,400
Let's go and get some pho.

331
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,600
- I was going to get a sandwich. 
 - Again?

332
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,600
I have to send this to the professor by 2:00 p.m.

333
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:24,650
I'm really busy!

334
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,430
 Brother, how are you? 

335
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:51,960
 Writer Glass Shoes recommended this, 

336
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,770
 but the male lead keeps reminding me of you, so I can't get into it. 

337
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:58,340
 Is it just me? 
   

338
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,560
   

339
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,800
   

340
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,800
Jellyfish: "I'm starting the binge today."

341
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:22,510
I'll take good care of you, Jellyfish.

342
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,710
Hey.

343
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,860
You have gotten quite a few comments this week.

344
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,340
Right?

345
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,210
It's all thanks to you, Writer Glass Shoes.

346
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:34,040
That's what friends are for.

347
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,200
But aren't you going home?

348
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,820
What? I'm going to have dinner with you.

349
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:46,400
I... had dinner.

350
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,700
It's two in the afternoon and you had dinner?

351
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,500
I was hungry, so I had it early.

352
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:07,000
- Didn't you just hear something? 
 - No.

353
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,800
It's so dry in here. So dry.

354
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,100
Hey, where are you going? Hey! Wait!

355
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,100
- W-W-What? What? 
 - Move.

356
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:28,140
Wait. W-W-What's in there? Hey!

357
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,020
Oh my.

358
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,910
What are you doing here?

359
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,380
Hyeong, hi.

360
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,550
It's Minhyeok. Hi.

361
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:42,090
Minhyeok, are you okay?

362
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,530
For some reason, you always barge in when Minhyeok is here.

363
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,140
Seriously.

364
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,810
But today, I'm here to change her lightbulb.

365
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,250
You two are dating, aren't you?

366
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,070
- Yes. 
 - No.

367
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,160
We're not?

368
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,500
I'm not even her parent. Why hide?

369
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,890
- You guys are dating, right? 
 - We're really not.

370
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,030
"We're really not"?

371
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,940
Wow, I come over if it's thundering.

372
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,440
I fixed your heater.

373
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,000
Now, I'm changing your lightbulb. Am I your maintenance guy?

374
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,700
We never made it official.

375
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,400
- Do we really have to spell that out? 
 - Yes, of course.

376
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,900
That's so important.

377
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,870
Jihun, why are you always at Yuri's apartment anyway?

378
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,080
She lives here alone.

379
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:32,350
That's because... I write well here.

380
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,000
It's also quiet.

381
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,100
You think it's quiet here?

382
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,350
Follow me.

383
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:44,040
I'll show you the quietest place on earth.

384
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,500
Boss.

385
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,300
- I can vouch for his identity— 
 - You're hired.

386
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,800
See?

387
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,150
- I told you. 
 - It's not because of you.

388
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:03,210
It's because of his face.

389
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,260
What?

390
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,470
You can see the trustworthiness through his face.

391
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,860
This is great.

392
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:12,190
I was nervous leaving this place entirely to Minhyeok.

393
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,900
Please take good care of it.

394
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,120
Okay.

395
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,510
I'll do my best.

396
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:19,110
Boss, are you going somewhere?

397
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,780
I'm going to travel for a few months.

398
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,290
You can start working today, right?

399
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,540
Yes, of course.

400
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,110
Here.

401
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,450
   

402
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,900
Well, we only have what Yunjae used to use.

403
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,310
It's okay.

404
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,760
- Go home and sleep. 
 - Okay.

405
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,400
- What time is it? 
 - 3:00 a.m.

406
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,050
What?

407
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,900
- You, too. Let's go. 
 - What?

408
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,600
I need to look at this a little more.

409
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,210
Are you trying to be in the history books?

410
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,910
I can't keep up.

411
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,340
I'm leaving.

412
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,190
Okay.

413
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,840
Good night.

414
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,530
See you tomorrow.

415
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:53,400
   

416
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,400
 - You're here. 
 - Yeah. 

417
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,710
 That night, I prepared everything and waited for Yunsu. 

418
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:30,510
 I broke a sweat while working out... 

419
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,500
 and got... so hot. 

420
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:39,800
 Even in the form of a man, I will make you fall for me. 

421
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,660
 It's dangerous. 

422
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,670
 I said, move over. 

423
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,390
 Hey. Where's the first-aid kit? 

424
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:52,590
 I'll do everything from now on, 

425
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,920
 so just sit back. 

426
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:00,060
 Since it has come to this, 

427
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,140
 want to stay over? 

428
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,320
 My sister isn't home. 

429
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:10,030
 In my household, you have to get permission if you sleep somewhere else. 

430
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,760
 Wow. 

431
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,310
 How did you come up with that? 

432
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:34,010
 That night was completely humiliating for Jiyeon. 

433
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,700
 Well, Yunsu must have been taken aback, too. 

434
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,600
 But in a way, he could have thought it was cute. 

435
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:51,100
 A kiss with Yurim. 

436
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,990
 Even in that moment, my head was full of Yunsu. 

437
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,780
 Hey! 

438
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:00,750
♫  'Cause I love you, I'll say it to you  ♫

439
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:06,170
♫  I'll express my fluttering heart  ♫

440
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:08,220
 I was worried that Yunsu might have seen it, 

441
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,850
 but seeing his calm attitude made me feel relieved. 

442
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:17,150
 Who says Yunsu was calm? 

443
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,600
That's cause... I... am the writer.

444
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,200
 That's not right. 

445
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,150
 I think Yunsu would have been super angry. 

446
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,020
 You bastard. 

447
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,000
 Die! 

448
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,600
 A hanbok date with Yunsu... 

449
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,800
 A moment she imagined for a long time. 

450
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,700
 But I don't know what I was doing? 

451
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,980
 Even though it was for show, 

452
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,630
 I think Yunsu would have been very hurt. 

453
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:02,190
 Do you think Jiyeon would've wanted to dress up as a young master? 

454
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:05,110
 She wanted a palace date with Yunsu so badly. 

455
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,970
 It was on her bucket list. 

456
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,230
 I see. 

457
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,520
 "I see"? 

458
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,000
 I mean, I think that makes sense. 

459
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:35,400
♫  'Cause I love you, all I need is you  ♫

460
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,700
♫  Don't you know how I feel?  ♫

461
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:42,110
♫  I hope it's not all a dream tonight (dream tonight)  ♫

462
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:48,130
♫  Following those stars in the night sky feels like I'm heading over to you  ♫

463
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:51,380
♫  So heart-fluttering (Ah-ah)  ♫

464
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:56,650
♫  I like it because it's you  ♫

465
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:59,700
   

466
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,570
Thank you.

467
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,630
Customer number six.

468
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:13,070
I got your number.

469
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,720
What can I help you with?

470
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,840
I'm here to file a death certificate.

471
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,130
Got it. For yourself?

472
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,200
Do you need to do it for yourself?

473
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,400
Oh no. My husband is long gone.

474
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,290
N-No, no.

475
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:32,890
Gosh, I-I'm so sorry.

476
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:33,990
   

477
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:36,680
Customer number 12.

478
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,300
What brings you in today?

479
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,850
I need a copy of my resident registration certificate.

480
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:49,110
600 won, right?

481
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:53,930
One, two, three, four, five, six.

482
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:56,000
You've been getting a copy every other day.

483
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,600
Yes. Getting it is my hobby.

484
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,800
One moment, please.

485
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,400
Here.

486
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:11,660
You don't want it?

487
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,600
Okay.

488
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,900
Nuna, do you have a way you've wanted to receive a confession

489
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,440
or fantasy moments?

490
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,850
All of a sudden?

491
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,820
Yes or no?

492
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,410
I do.

493
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,380
What is it?

494
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,600
It's a fantasy I've had since I was a child.

495
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,530
- In a dark... 
 - In a dark...

496
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,570
amusement park.

497
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,120
- Amusement park? 
 - Yeah.

498
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,570
When I enter a completely empty amusement park,

499
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:47,500
the lights on the carousel light up, and there you—

500
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,270
I mean, the male lead is standing there.

501
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:53,690
You really are a writer.

502
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:56,270
Nuna, you've seen way too many movies.

503
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:58,110
Who does that in real life?

504
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,300
Not a playground but an amusement park?

505
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,460
Seriously, I shouldn't have asked!

506
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,900
That's my fantasy.

507
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,900
In reality, you can just tell me.

508
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,600
Come on!

509
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,000
I don't know! Don't be mad!

510
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:42,140
   

511
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:50,380
   

512
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:59,850
   

513
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:07,650
   

514
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,480
   

515
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,950
   

516
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,300
But are you sure you won't regret this?

517
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,850
Yes, sir.

518
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:32,500
My universe is not here.

519
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,510
Your universe is not here?

520
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,350
No.

521
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,420
I'm sorry.

522
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,900
Well, I don't know what to say, Yunjae.

523
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,600
It's very disappointing.

524
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,530
Hold on.

525
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,470
Yes. So, please come right away.

526
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:22,200
What? Did you get hurt?

527
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,500
No. It's not that,

528
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,660
but it's hard for me to move.

529
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,700
Okay. Just wait.

530
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,700
- Yuri. 
  - Yeah? 

531
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,220
It would be nice if you could dress up a bit.

532
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,220
What?

533
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,700
Nothing. Just come!

534
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,910
Hey!

535
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:51,860
I'm here!

536
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,240
Where is he?

537
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:31,640
What's going on?

538
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,460
I couldn't rent out an amusement park, but...

539
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,740
would you be my girlfriend, Nuna?

540
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,600
Yes, I would love to.

541
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:30,060

 I'm sorry, but we're closed.

Excuse me,

566
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,620
Guest?

It's me.

569
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:45,900
Park Yunjae.

570
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:50,590
I'm here.

571
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:57,280
Why are you here?

572
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,580
I got kicked out.

573
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,790
Kicked out?

574
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,920
Don't you remember how we broke up?

575
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,650
You can go back, right?

576
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,380
I can't.

577
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:19,560
Open it.

578
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:43,760
"Park Yun Jae is a student who has brought me great disappointment.

579
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,600
However,

580
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:50,600
he is also someone who has reminded me of the meaning of the Universe, our Love.

581
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,730
The universe is so wide,

582
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:55,500
that I have decided to place my support not in the statistical possibility of uncertainty,

583
00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:00,200
but on the near-certainty of your happiness with him.

584
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,800
Park Yunjae's Universe is not here,

585
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,400
but it is where you are.

586
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:11,610
John O'Connor."

587
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,040
I didn't ask him to write this.

588
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,860
My professor wrote it on his own accord.

589
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,970
What should I do now?

590
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:30,800
Do you want to go and see the stars?

591
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,200
- What? 
 - The Chuncheon trip we didn't get to go to that time.

592
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,220
Let's go now.

593
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,610
Are you cold?

594
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:55,170
♫  Your pleasant laughter  ♫

595
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:57,160
Here.

596
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:00,940
♫  The world spins for me now  ♫

597
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,520
Aren't you hungry?

598
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,350
These are so good.

599
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:12,230
♫  Never disappears  ♫

600
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:16,050
♫  I am calling out to you  ♫

601
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:19,660
The fact that you and I are in Chuncheon right now.

602
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:22,230
This isn't a dream, is it?

603
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:26,410
It's a dream-like reality.

604
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,830
It's a place you can reach in one hour,

605
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:30,700
but we circled around for a long while.

606
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:33,590
♫  I see your eyes  ♫

607
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:37,220
♫  Even the tears filled to the brim  ♫

608
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:40,200
There are so many stars.

609
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,550
This is it.

610
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:48,560
This is so nice.

611
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:53,270
Idiot.

612
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,930
What?

613
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:57,630
Nothing.

614
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,940
Oh, how's Kang Minju doing?

615
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:04,860
Oh, right.

616
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:11,523
 Oppa, give this to your girlfriend. 

617
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:13,590
 What is this? 

618
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:16,220
 It's not a bomb, so give it to her. 

619
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:19,400
 Okay. 

620
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,100
 Thanks for everything, Minju. 

621
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:29,270
 It's honestly a little disappointing, isn't it? 

622
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:33,560
 You thought I would cry and hold on to you, but I'm being so chill and letting you go. 

623
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,020
 Even if you come back, I will never take you back. 

624
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,320
 That's right. 

625
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,960
 Don't ever take me back. 

626
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:47,760
 Well then, since this is the end for us, 

627
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,580
 I want it to be a good one. 

628
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:53,300
 So, I was thinking... 

629
00:48:57,330 --> 00:49:00,320
 Park Yunjae, give me a hug before you leave. 

630
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,230
 Be healthy. 

631
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:15,460
 Don't get sick. 

632
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,860
 Bye. 

633
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:23,620
 Bye. 

634
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:38,430
"I thought Kim Jieun being next to Park Yunjae was the worst,

635
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:41,760
but Park Yunjae being away from Kim Jieun's side was even worse.

636
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,700
I take back what I said about taking responsibility for Yunjae.

637
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:48,050
I'm returning him. From Kang Minju."

638
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:49,500
What is this?

639
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,800
She's returning me?

640
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,260
Yes. This is weird to you, too, isn't it?

641
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:55,880
Yeah.

642
00:49:56,890 --> 00:49:58,570
But...

643
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,690
I'm telling you ahead of time. Refunds and exchanges are not allowed.

644
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:05,050
You're stuck with me until the end.

645
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:06,950
What?

646
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:09,100
If my mom finds out I came back,

647
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:12,200
I think she'll return me, too.

648
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,060
Oh, wait! The apartment across from you.

649
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:16,320
Did someone move in?

650
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:19,380
If it's empty, I want to move in.

651
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:22,530
Hold on. Money.

652
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:25,370
How much is the deposit?

653
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:27,100
What about the rent?

654
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,800
Maybe Boss would lend it to me.

655
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,180
Did she change her number?

656
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:35,860
Are there lots of customers at the cafe? What about Minhyeok?

657
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:37,300
How is he?

658
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,700
Does he play hooky? I'm better than him, aren't I?

659
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:42,900
- What are you doing? 
 - Didn't you miss me?

660
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:48,100
What?

661
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:50,640
I said, didn't you miss me?

662
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:58,110
I missed you.

663
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:09,030
I wondered if I should have held on to you like Park Yunsu.

664
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:10,840
Like a cool guy.

665
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:16,080
You should have been more honest like Kim Jiyeon.

666
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,800
I would have held you tighter.

667
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:25,240
You... read my writing?

668
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,480
Jellyfish.

669
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:33,030
Who did you think it was?

670
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:42,330
I'm sorry I'm late.

671
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:49,660
♫  A strangely familiar feeling  ♫

672
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,580
Just five hours ago,

673
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:03,500
I believed that us breaking up was the happy ending.

674
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:07,520
Even when I missed you so much,

675
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:12,610
I imagined you being well somewhere else,

676
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:16,420
and held on like that.

677
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,170
And?

678
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:26,380
♫  Touches memories that feel familiar  ♫

679
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:30,000
I know now.

680
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:35,800
Not everything that will happen to us will be good,

681
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:39,140
but all the times we spend together

682
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:42,340
will become happy memories.

683
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:44,740
♫  I see you  ♫

684
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:48,000
 It's me. 

685
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,250
 Jieun. 

686
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,820
 From the first moment I transformed into a guy... 

687
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:54,200
 Remember it. 

688
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,530
 - Yangpyeong. 
 - Yangpyeong. 

689
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:58,500
 Yangpyeong. 

690
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:02,600
 Yes! I served in Pyeongyang! 

691
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,080
 - Up— 
 - I drove a tank 

692
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,340
 and served my country! 

693
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:11,730
 Just knowing you were by my side 

694
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:14,820
 helped me persevere. 

695
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:17,700
 In every moment I was with you, 

696
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:21,240
 whether I was a woman or a man 

697
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,640
 wasn't important. 

698
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:27,340
 I was just happy. 

699
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:35,030
♫  Even if I lose my way in the dark night  ♫

700
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:36,930
 I'm here. 

701
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,940
That's also why you came back, right?

702
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:46,580
Yes.

703
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:48,270
That's right.

704
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:50,980
Precisely.

705
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:54,800
Now...

706
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,080
it doesn't matter to me

707
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,550
whether you are Kim Jihun...

708
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:04,640
or Kim Jieun.

709
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:08,530
I just need you.

710
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:12,890
♫  It's not a dream, you're growing clearer  ♫

711
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:17,020
♫  I hear you  ♫

712
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:22,040
♫  Eyes don’t lie, oh it's you  ♫

713
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:26,440
♫  Will you remember? I promise you  ♫

714
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,950
♫  In every moment  ♫

715
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:31,510
♫  I'll see you  ♫

716
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:45,670
Come on out. We'll be late for the movie.

717
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:47,850
You look nice even if you don't try.

718
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:51,100
We have so much to do today!

719
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,690
Huh?

720
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:55,530
Hey! Kim Ji—

721
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:11,930
I'm ready, I'm ready.

722
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:13,600
So much nagging.

723
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,110
I'm not nagging. We're late.

724
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:18,470
Let's go.

725
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:20,370
I forgot my earrings. Wait a minute.

726
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:22,350
Let's just go!

727
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:24,440
It's not that important.

728
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,800
Of course, you'd look nice wearing them, though.

729
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,420
Hurry and put them on.

730
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:36,540
You've changed.

731
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:41,090
Earrings aren't important?

732
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:47,010
You're the one who wanted to go...

733
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:49,750
 It's been 98 days since Yunjae came back 

734
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:52,500
 and I turned back into a girl. 

735
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:57,700
 Thankfully, we are living happily in our universe. 

736
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,360
Here. 
    

737
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,670
What is this?

738
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:05,520
It's finally out! 
    

739
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,290
You're the first to get it.

740
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,600
Thanks.

741
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:16,830
"To my beloved Jellyfish.

742
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:20,240
Penis Fish Angel and Jellyfish."

743
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,100
 It's not an ordinary life like everyone else's. 

744
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:28,050
 But our non-ordinary days became even more special. 

745
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:29,220
It looks pretty.

746
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,720
- It's pretty, isn't it? 
 - Yeah.

747
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,540
I should look better than Minhyeok.

748
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,920
So cute.

749
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:51,600
Jieun.

750
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:54,500
Senior.

751
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,600
Who is this?

752
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,180
Say hi. This is my boyfriend, Park Yunjae.

753
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:02,020
This is my senior, Jeong Jinyeong, from my major.

754
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:07,400
You got a boyfriend while you were taking time off?

755
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,700
- I'm disappointed. 
 - We were dating before I took time off.

756
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:13,790
- Seems like you didn't know. 
 - I wasn't around then.

757
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:17,180
Would it have made a difference if you were?

758
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,350
Our friends are waiting. Let's go.

759
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:30,330
What?

760
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:32,410
You're acting weird.

761
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:37,440
Jieun has no taste.

762
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:42,700
I'm so much better.

763
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:48,580
- So funny, right? 
 - Yeah.

764
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:50,820
So funny.

765
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:53,610
Hey!

766
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:58,970
I'm going to the restroom.

767
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:00,800
Me, too.

768
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:06,300
Hyeong.

769
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:07,700
What do I do?

770
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,150
What? What's wrong?

771
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:11,000
I think Yuri is very sick.

772
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,600
Sick?

773
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,260
- Where? 
 - Her head.

774
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:17,760
Don't tell anyone.

775
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,400
Not even your girlfriend.

776
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,150
Explain so I can understand.

777
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:23,850
I think she's been devastated since Jihun disappeared.

778
00:58:23,850 --> 00:58:26,940
She keeps saying strange things these days.

779
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,070
Like what?

780
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:31,600
That Kim Jihun and Kim Jieun are the same person.

781
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:34,250
That she can be Jieun one moment, and then Jihun the next.

782
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:36,170
That's what she says.

783
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:39,700
I know she's a writer and has an active imagination,

784
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:42,710
but isn't she being delusional or something?

785
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:45,090
I'm not sure.

786
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:47,740
I-I don't really know.

787
00:58:58,050 --> 00:59:01,330
Please be nice to your girlfriend.

788
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:03,760
Tell her she's not a weirdo.

789
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,310
- Nice! 
 - That she's nice.

790
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:11,820
Sure.

791
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:37,960
Sis!

792
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,570
Do it inside!

793
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:42,700
Nunim, do it inside!

794
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:44,420
Y-You guys...

795
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:46,040
If you two are stuck to each other all the time,

796
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,680
Yunjae, start paying rent.

797
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,320
Yunjae?

798
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,900
Hey, Yunjae!

799
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,040
Yeongseok!

800
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:02,850
How do you know him?

801
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:04,460
Yunjae...

802
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:05,670
Your face!

803
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:07,720
- Oh no. 
 - Did it get smudged a lot?

804
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:11,030
It's everywhere. Let me take it off of you.

805
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:13,530
Your face is crazy right now.

806
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:14,810
Wait.

807
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:15,910
What?

808
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:17,980
You two know each other?

809
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,060
Yes. I introduced him to my boss.

810
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:24,350
It didn't work out, though.

811
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:28,550
He's my sister's first love, though.

812
01:00:29,570 --> 01:00:32,060
Don't tell my sister.

813
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:38,690
 A life where Kim Jihun and Kim Jieun coexist. 

814
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:42,580
 We accept that miracle as our reality. 

815
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:55,040


816
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:02,240
   

817
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:07,500
- Ready? 
 - Yeah.

818
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:10,450
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

819
01:01:10,450 --> 01:01:12,280
It must be heavy!

820
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:14,730
This is nothing.

821
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,470
Let's go. What should we eat?

822
01:01:17,470 --> 01:01:19,070
What should we eat?

823
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:21,140
What time will we arrive at Chuncheon?

824
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:22,380
 Around 5:00. 

825
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:24,720
 Our daily lives. 

826
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,190
 That is the greatest miracle of the universe. 

827
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:29,110
 In addition to love. 

828
01:01:31,330 --> 01:01:35,370
♫  'Cause I love you, I'll say it to you  ♫

829
01:01:36,350 --> 01:01:40,900
♫  I'll express my fluttering heart  ♫

830
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:46,090
♫  I keep smiling for no reason  ♫

831
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:50,360
♫  That's all because of you  ♫

832
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:53,180
♫  Can you hear my heart  ♫

833
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:55,640
♫  It's beating towards you  ♫

834
01:01:55,640 --> 01:02:00,000
♫  Love is you, my heart is pounding  ♫

835
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,020
♫  I'm imagining sweet things because I'm thinking of you  ♫

836
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:09,650
♫  I'm reminded again, I must've fallen for you  ♫

837
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:14,900
♫  ’Cause I love you, I'm curious about you (curious about you)  ♫

838
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:17,240
   

839
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,500
   

840
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:24,420
♫  You're so lovey, oh, dovey, lovable  ♫

841
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:28,790
♫  I think my heart has gone crazy  ♫

842
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:34,780
♫  This feeling, this fluttering, I like it all  ♫

843
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:38,410
♫  I like it because it's you  ♫

844
01:02:38,410 --> 01:02:42,650
♫  I'm so lonely, without you  ♫

845
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:48,010
♫  It's strange all day  ♫

846
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:53,160
♫  All I see is you  ♫

847
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:57,620
♫  Since when did this start  ♫

848
01:02:57,620 --> 01:03:00,400
♫  'Cause I love you, all I need is you  ♫

849
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,450
♫  Don't you know how I feel?  ♫

850
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:08,400
♫  Following those stars in the night sky feels like I'm heading over to you  ♫

851
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,510
♫  So heart-fluttering (Ah-ah)  ♫

852
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:16,480
♫  I like it because it's you  ♫
