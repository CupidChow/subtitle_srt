1
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,390
   

2
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,990
   

3
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,580
   

4
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,820
   

5
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,270
   

6
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:43,660


7
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,258
Minju.

8
00:00:45,258 --> 00:00:47,658
Dongi? Why are you here?

9
00:00:47,658 --> 00:00:50,278
- Let's watch a movie this weekend. 
 - I have plans.

10
00:00:50,278 --> 00:00:52,148
Even if I didn't, I don't want to.

11
00:00:52,148 --> 00:00:55,518
- You probably know, but I like you. 
 - What's going on?

12
00:00:55,518 --> 00:00:58,318
 It was love at first sight, and I have set my eyes on you ever since. 

13
00:00:58,318 --> 00:01:00,498
Must be nice to know so many oppas.

14
00:01:00,498 --> 00:01:01,908
 That's your problem. 

15
00:01:01,908 --> 00:01:03,218
 I'll treat you well. 

16
00:01:03,218 --> 00:01:05,478
Why am I hiding?

17
00:01:06,288 --> 00:01:09,268
I'll treat you way better than that bastard, Park Yunjae.

18
00:01:09,268 --> 00:01:11,238
Why are you bringing up Yunjae?

19
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,978
- Yunjae? 
 - I have a better GPA

20
00:01:12,978 --> 00:01:14,198
and a brighter future than he does.

21
00:01:14,198 --> 00:01:17,018
I told you my parents run a golf course.

22
00:01:18,428 --> 00:01:20,248
Oppa.

23
00:01:21,358 --> 00:01:23,058
If you say anything else,

24
00:01:23,058 --> 00:01:26,578
I don't think I'll ever want to see you again.

25
00:01:26,578 --> 00:01:28,358
Want to keep going?

26
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:33,388
If you want to maintain the distance we're currently at,

27
00:01:33,388 --> 00:01:35,128
leave.

28
00:01:35,778 --> 00:01:38,818
I've never thought of you as a man,

29
00:01:38,818 --> 00:01:42,118
and there's no chance I ever will.

30
00:01:42,838 --> 00:01:47,428
Then, what should I do to make you see me as a man?

31
00:01:48,668 --> 00:01:50,438
Be born again.

32
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:53,128
I'll think about it then.

33
00:01:55,628 --> 00:01:57,258
Step aside.

34
00:01:57,258 --> 00:02:00,008
Minju, please give me a chance.

35
00:02:00,008 --> 00:02:01,828
I'll scream.

36
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:04,148
Help!

37
00:02:06,158 --> 00:02:08,368
H-Help!

38
00:02:45,758 --> 00:02:48,158
- Oppa! 
 - Opâ”€

39
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:51,458
- Hey, who are you? 
 - Who are you?

40
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:54,958
- Who is he? 
 - Don't worry about him. Let's go.

41
00:02:55,658 --> 00:02:57,008
Seriously.

42
00:02:57,008 --> 00:02:59,908
- Let's go. 
 - Get your hands off Minju!

43
00:03:03,668 --> 00:03:07,008
Gosh, some people just ask for it.

44
00:03:13,088 --> 00:03:14,628
Are you okay?

45
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:16,188
Of course.

46
00:03:16,188 --> 00:03:18,898
I might look fragile, but I'm strong.

47
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,868
You don't look fragile.

48
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,638
Who was that?

49
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:26,478
Min Dongi. He's a senior in my major. I guess he followed me.

50
00:03:26,478 --> 00:03:28,448
Min Dongi?

51
00:03:28,448 --> 00:03:30,468
Crazy things sure happen to you.

52
00:03:30,468 --> 00:03:33,078
Did you learn martial arts?

53
00:03:33,078 --> 00:03:34,968
I noticed it at the festival part-time job already.

54
00:03:34,968 --> 00:03:37,678
Your angles are sharp.

55
00:03:37,678 --> 00:03:39,828
I did kendo in elementary school.

56
00:03:39,828 --> 00:03:42,968
I thought I had forgotten it, but I remembered once I held this.

57
00:03:42,968 --> 00:03:45,158
Are these bubbles?

58
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,358
Are they yours? Really?

59
00:03:49,008 --> 00:03:51,148
I picked it up on the way.

60
00:03:52,798 --> 00:03:55,418
I want to blow it, too.

61
00:04:02,088 --> 00:04:04,508
Wow, great.

62
00:04:05,338 --> 00:04:07,498
Wow, I haven't done this in so long. It's so fun.

63
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:11,778
It's so nice here. I'm so glad I moved here.

64
00:04:11,778 --> 00:04:15,188
Are you sure? You got followed as soon as you moved here.

65
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,558
The night air.

66
00:04:16,558 --> 00:04:18,068
It's so nice.

67
00:04:18,068 --> 00:04:20,758
You really don't have the basics on how to have a conversation.

68
00:04:20,758 --> 00:04:22,708
Huh, I want beer.

69
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,858
Oppa, do you want to have beer?

70
00:04:24,858 --> 00:04:27,568
- I'll buy the chicken. 
 - You go ahead.

71
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:29,568
My sister!

72
00:04:29,568 --> 00:04:31,928
I mean, brother!

73
00:04:31,928 --> 00:04:33,858
Do you want a beer?

74
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:35,788
I'll buy chicken.

75
00:04:35,788 --> 00:04:38,028
You have a guest.

76
00:04:39,158 --> 00:04:41,958
Oh, that vixen next door?

77
00:04:43,858 --> 00:04:46,748
Half marinated, half fried.

78
00:04:46,748 --> 00:04:48,588
Deal!

79
00:04:51,098 --> 00:04:53,188
Seriously?

80
00:04:55,608 --> 00:04:57,788
So pretty!

81
00:04:57,788 --> 00:04:59,328
There.

82
00:04:59,328 --> 00:05:03,468
   

83
00:05:22,748 --> 00:05:26,048
 Your mom and I are going on an overnight trip to look at fall foliage. 

84
00:05:26,048 --> 00:05:28,738
 Unless it's a matter of life or death, do not call. 

85
00:05:28,738 --> 00:05:30,738
 Do not text. 

86
00:05:30,738 --> 00:05:32,858
 Eat together. 

87
00:05:32,858 --> 00:05:34,418
 Watch movies together. 

88
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,528
 Talk about random stuff. 

89
00:05:36,528 --> 00:05:37,708
 Kiss. 

90
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,458
 You sure are teaching him a great lesson! 

91
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,408
 No kissing! 

92
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,308
Eat.

93
00:05:44,308 --> 00:05:46,488
Watch movies.

94
00:05:46,488 --> 00:05:49,328
Talk about random stuff.

95
00:05:50,148 --> 00:05:52,488
But not kiss?

96
00:05:55,368 --> 00:05:56,568
- Hey. 
 - Huh?

97
00:05:56,568 --> 00:05:58,258
Mom and Dad went to see the fall foliage overnight.

98
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:00,138
I know. I told them about it.

99
00:06:00,138 --> 00:06:02,318
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

100
00:06:03,198 --> 00:06:05,218
Hey. Don't you have tutoring today?

101
00:06:05,218 --> 00:06:07,438
Yes. But I'll ask him to reschedule.

102
00:06:07,438 --> 00:06:09,728
- Why? 
 - Why tutor when Mom and Dad aren't here?

103
00:06:09,728 --> 00:06:13,078
I'll go to the movies and karaoke with my friends.

104
00:06:13,078 --> 00:06:15,908
Aren't all your friends in 12th grade, too?

105
00:06:16,678 --> 00:06:18,438
What kind of question is that?

106
00:06:18,438 --> 00:06:21,508
I don't know how you got into Yeonhui University.

107
00:06:24,858 --> 00:06:27,598
Then, what if you don't reschedule tutoring

108
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:30,588
and proceed as planned?

109
00:06:30,588 --> 00:06:33,228
What I mean is...

110
00:06:33,228 --> 00:06:37,968
You're not home... but Jihun comes to tutor.

111
00:06:40,198 --> 00:06:42,258
I see.

112
00:06:42,258 --> 00:06:46,128
So, you want him to come hang out with you here?

113
00:06:46,998 --> 00:06:48,958
Okay.

114
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,338
Thank you.

115
00:06:50,338 --> 00:06:52,558
What will you two do at home alone?

116
00:06:52,558 --> 00:06:55,558
- Watch a movie. 
 - Just a movie?

117
00:06:57,948 --> 00:07:00,438
Open your eyes straight.

118
00:07:27,858 --> 00:07:31,628
Hello. I'm Team Leader Kim Jihye.

119
00:07:31,628 --> 00:07:32,688
   

120
00:07:32,688 --> 00:07:34,538
Nice to meet you.

121
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,358
Judge, doctor, and lawyer.

122
00:07:47,358 --> 00:07:48,718
These damn professionals.

123
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,838
Can you get more creative?

124
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,538
Excuse me?

125
00:07:55,098 --> 00:07:56,688
When you say more creative...

126
00:07:56,688 --> 00:08:00,058
Wrestler, inspector, charity donor.

127
00:08:00,058 --> 00:08:03,238
They're occupations, too.

128
00:08:09,998 --> 00:08:13,078
Wow. What a sense of humor you have.

129
00:08:13,078 --> 00:08:14,818
Yes.

130
00:08:16,558 --> 00:08:19,898
Apart from their careers, these people are rated top tier

131
00:08:19,898 --> 00:08:22,798
in family background, character, and all other traits.

132
00:08:22,798 --> 00:08:25,268
I only have my mom.

133
00:08:25,268 --> 00:08:26,848
I come from a single-parent family.

134
00:08:26,848 --> 00:08:31,698
Even when my dad was alive, I'd never seen them get along.

135
00:08:31,698 --> 00:08:34,288
That probably impacted my character.

136
00:08:34,288 --> 00:08:37,538
That's why I'm cynical about marriage

137
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:39,648
and ended up getting dragged here.

138
00:08:39,648 --> 00:08:43,578
Even so, I'm a VVIP, right?

139
00:08:47,108 --> 00:08:48,728
Yes.

140
00:08:51,758 --> 00:08:55,748
Then, if you tell me your opinion as a VVIP,

141
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:59,598
I'll make sure to consider that in the matchmaking.

142
00:09:00,968 --> 00:09:02,878
Really?

143
00:09:52,688 --> 00:09:54,318
You were home.

144
00:09:54,318 --> 00:09:56,108
Welcome.

145
00:09:57,658 --> 00:10:00,078
What's all this?

146
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:03,318
My parents are on a trip, and I asked Yuna for a favor.

147
00:10:03,318 --> 00:10:04,958
I wanted to hang out with you.

148
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,448
Hey, but still. Is this okay?

149
00:10:08,448 --> 00:10:11,058
We're not doing anything bad.

150
00:10:11,058 --> 00:10:13,208
Let's eat first.

151
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,058
Come.

152
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:21,548
One second.

153
00:10:23,558 --> 00:10:26,858
All right. Let's eat.

154
00:10:28,838 --> 00:10:30,238
I feel weird.

155
00:10:30,238 --> 00:10:32,998
I've never been here, even when I was your girlfriend.

156
00:10:32,998 --> 00:10:35,828
You're still my girlfriend.

157
00:10:35,828 --> 00:10:38,498
I know, but...

158
00:10:38,498 --> 00:10:40,978
Did you make all this?

159
00:10:42,788 --> 00:10:47,968
â™«  Running wild in the days of youth  â™«

160
00:10:47,968 --> 00:10:49,128
My goodness.

161
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:51,948
I was afraid that after you tasted it, you would think I bought the food,

162
00:10:51,948 --> 00:10:54,808
so I preserved the scene.

163
00:10:56,558 --> 00:10:58,138
Here.

164
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:06,620
â™«  These are... These are the new you  â™«

165
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,288
Then, let's see what you've got.

166
00:11:20,518 --> 00:11:22,188
Oh my.

167
00:11:22,188 --> 00:11:24,298
So tasty.

168
00:11:24,298 --> 00:11:27,038
See? If I hadn't left it like that,

169
00:11:27,038 --> 00:11:28,848
- you'd be mistaken. Yes or no? 
 - Totally.

170
00:11:28,848 --> 00:11:31,388
Yes. Totally.

171
00:11:35,658 --> 00:11:41,220
â™«  Intertwined  â™«

172
00:11:56,998 --> 00:11:59,068
Here.

173
00:11:59,068 --> 00:12:00,658
Thanks.

174
00:12:00,658 --> 00:12:02,728
You were looking at that?

175
00:12:03,518 --> 00:12:05,578
Last time I was here, I didn't even notice this,

176
00:12:05,578 --> 00:12:08,328
but you had all this.

177
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:10,878
I found it. "Romantic Dinner."

178
00:12:10,878 --> 00:12:12,988
This is the one you wanted to see, right?

179
00:12:12,988 --> 00:12:14,598
Yeah.

180
00:12:15,838 --> 00:12:18,928
So, where is this?

181
00:12:22,258 --> 00:12:26,358
Maunakea Observatories. It's in Hawaii.

182
00:12:27,898 --> 00:12:30,828
It used to be my dream.

183
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:36,788
You can see a galaxy 12.8 billion light-years away from Earth.

184
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:39,418
12.8 billion years is already so long.

185
00:12:39,418 --> 00:12:42,338
But 12.8 billion light-years?

186
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:46,468
If I lived there watching the stars,

187
00:12:46,468 --> 00:12:49,138
I think I would also be able to write "The Little Prince."

188
00:12:49,878 --> 00:12:51,608
Really?

189
00:12:51,608 --> 00:12:54,878
If you want, I'll work really hard.

190
00:12:54,878 --> 00:12:57,878
We can go there. Let's go together.

191
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,338
You said it was Hawaii, right?

192
00:13:02,338 --> 00:13:03,808
Yeah.

193
00:13:06,228 --> 00:13:09,118
I should hurry and get back to being Kim Jieun.

194
00:13:09,118 --> 00:13:12,498
That way, I can get on a plane with my passport.

195
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,808
Right.

196
00:13:20,018 --> 00:13:22,108
Should we watch the movie in the living room?

197
00:13:22,108 --> 00:13:24,048
Sure, sounds good.

198
00:13:30,158 --> 00:13:34,658
I need to connect this to the TV.

199
00:13:36,518 --> 00:13:40,658
 I'll never go on a trip with you again. 

200
00:13:40,658 --> 00:13:42,618
 I feel the same. 

201
00:13:42,618 --> 00:13:46,498
I should've known when you suddenly suggested viewing the fall foliage.

202
00:13:46,498 --> 00:13:48,958
You were talking so much while I was driving.

203
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,388
That's why I took the wrong route.

204
00:13:50,388 --> 00:13:51,798
So it's all my fault?

205
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:53,188
Darn it.

206
00:13:53,188 --> 00:13:54,928
Oh my gosh!

207
00:13:56,018 --> 00:13:58,428
W-What is all this?

208
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:03,538
Mom, so... what happened was...

209
00:14:03,538 --> 00:14:06,498
Oh no!

210
00:14:06,498 --> 00:14:08,158
This...

211
00:14:08,158 --> 00:14:11,468
This is my favorite wine!

212
00:14:11,468 --> 00:14:13,658
Was someone here?

213
00:14:16,128 --> 00:14:18,148
No.

214
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:21,718
So, you did this by yourself?

215
00:14:21,718 --> 00:14:24,828
The thing is... so...

216
00:14:24,828 --> 00:14:27,368
What happened was...

217
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:30,178
Yuna. I ate that with Yuna.

218
00:14:31,688 --> 00:14:34,888
She's been so stressed as a 12th-grader lately.

219
00:14:34,888 --> 00:14:37,328
As her brother, it has been bothering me.

220
00:14:37,328 --> 00:14:39,048
Where is Yuna?

221
00:14:39,048 --> 00:14:40,638
Yuna?

222
00:14:42,038 --> 00:14:45,348
She stepped out to see a friend.

223
00:14:53,818 --> 00:14:55,988
Gosh, my goodness!

224
00:14:55,988 --> 00:15:00,928
Why is the house such a mess? Seriously.

225
00:15:00,928 --> 00:15:04,368
I wish ghosts would take away these Parks.

226
00:15:04,368 --> 00:15:07,558
These Parks? Why bring that up now?

227
00:15:07,558 --> 00:15:10,038
- Geez! 
 - Mom, Mom, Mom.

228
00:15:10,038 --> 00:15:11,708
Go to your room and come out in 30 minutes.

229
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:15,138
I'll clean everything back up. You, too, Dad.

230
00:15:15,138 --> 00:15:16,298
Hey!

231
00:15:16,298 --> 00:15:18,738
You think I want to be around your dad right now?

232
00:15:18,738 --> 00:15:21,408
Same here.

233
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:30,278
Hey, your mom has a personality issue.

234
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:34,338
- So why did you go on a trip and fight? 
 - Hey.

235
00:15:34,338 --> 00:15:38,158
From the moment we left, she complained that the car was dirty,

236
00:15:38,158 --> 00:15:40,168
that the rest stop food was bad,

237
00:15:40,168 --> 00:15:42,748
asking why we were paying money to sleep outside,

238
00:15:42,748 --> 00:15:44,158
fussing and nagging.

239
00:15:44,158 --> 00:15:45,508
How do you think I felt?

240
00:15:45,508 --> 00:15:47,398
You think I was in my right mind?

241
00:15:47,398 --> 00:15:50,758
- Geez. 
 - Dad!

242
00:15:50,758 --> 00:15:53,968
Gosh, you look exhausted.

243
00:15:53,968 --> 00:15:56,768
Go to my room and get some rest.

244
00:15:56,768 --> 00:15:58,978
Get some sleep.

245
00:15:58,978 --> 00:16:00,988
Get some rest.

246
00:16:08,348 --> 00:16:10,148
Jihun.

247
00:16:19,888 --> 00:16:22,008
T-Teacher?

248
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,028
Ma'am, hello.

249
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,158
Hello.

250
00:16:30,868 --> 00:16:32,888
Right, it's tutoring day today.

251
00:16:32,888 --> 00:16:35,658
I'm a little frazzled.

252
00:16:35,658 --> 00:16:38,718
But did you come in that way?

253
00:16:38,718 --> 00:16:40,208
Pardon?

254
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,588
Oh, that.

255
00:16:42,588 --> 00:16:44,738
It was open so...

256
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,148
Mom, do you know what floor we're on?

257
00:16:48,148 --> 00:16:49,998
How could he get in through the window?

258
00:16:49,998 --> 00:16:52,118
He just got here.

259
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,748
I'm so frazzled right now.

260
00:16:58,748 --> 00:17:00,188
But this brat.

261
00:17:00,188 --> 00:17:02,668
Where did she go after making such a mess?

262
00:17:02,668 --> 00:17:04,988
Wait until this brat gets home.

263
00:17:06,188 --> 00:17:07,748
I'm sorry.

264
00:17:07,748 --> 00:17:10,068
Ma'am, it's okay.

265
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:12,648
I'll see you next week.

266
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:14,388
Sure, sure.

267
00:17:16,108 --> 00:17:18,288
Teacher, hi.

268
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:19,848
Hey, Yuna.

269
00:17:19,848 --> 00:17:22,178
Did you have fun with my brother?

270
00:17:22,178 --> 00:17:24,358
Mom, when did you get home?

271
00:17:24,358 --> 00:17:27,558
- You brat. Stay right there. 
 - Why?

272
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:29,928
- Hey! Can't you see? 
 - What's wrong?

273
00:17:29,928 --> 00:17:31,278
- Ma'am. 
 - You!

274
00:17:31,278 --> 00:17:33,758
You skip tutoring just because I'm not here?

275
00:17:33,758 --> 00:17:35,958
What? Park Yunjae told me to leave.

276
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:39,418
What? You're blaming your brother again?

277
00:17:39,418 --> 00:17:41,218
Hey! And...

278
00:17:41,218 --> 00:17:43,938
if you cooked...

279
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,888
you should clean up after yourself!

280
00:17:45,888 --> 00:17:47,288
No, no, no!

281
00:17:47,288 --> 00:17:49,348
- Honey! 
 - Mom!

282
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:51,218
Use your words!

283
00:17:51,218 --> 00:17:53,958
You're a Christian. Why are you so violent?

284
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,348
That's right! You're an elder!

285
00:17:57,008 --> 00:17:59,348
Are you for real?

286
00:18:12,548 --> 00:18:14,358
Honey.

287
00:18:14,358 --> 00:18:16,108
I'm okay.

288
00:18:16,998 --> 00:18:19,148
You should've moved.

289
00:18:25,848 --> 00:18:27,598
Geez!

290
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,128
Nuna.

291
00:18:35,128 --> 00:18:36,978
Hi.

292
00:18:39,668 --> 00:18:41,428
Hi.

293
00:18:43,918 --> 00:18:45,678
It's good.

294
00:18:45,678 --> 00:18:47,798
It's warm.

295
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:54,168
It's getting chilly outside.

296
00:18:54,168 --> 00:18:55,738
What are you doing after here?

297
00:18:55,738 --> 00:18:57,028
I should rush home.

298
00:18:57,028 --> 00:18:58,698
It's my favorite time of the day.

299
00:18:58,698 --> 00:19:00,588
Really?

300
00:19:00,588 --> 00:19:02,808
You look forward to the end of the day...

301
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,158
I'm jealous.

302
00:19:05,158 --> 00:19:09,408
If I had to choose between a deadline and the end of the world,

303
00:19:09,408 --> 00:19:11,268
I would honestly choose the end of the world.

304
00:19:11,268 --> 00:19:13,418
I see how that might be for you.

305
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,488
But don't be too stressed.

306
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,488
You have one life. Have fun and enjoy.

307
00:19:18,488 --> 00:19:22,718
I know, but... I don't go to school.

308
00:19:22,718 --> 00:19:24,438
I only have one friend.

309
00:19:24,438 --> 00:19:27,418
My parents live far away.

310
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,998
I don't really know what fun is.

311
00:19:31,998 --> 00:19:34,438
There are so many fun things in this world.

312
00:19:34,438 --> 00:19:38,558
Club. Karaoke. Escape room. Bowling.

313
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:42,018
I've tried them all, but they all don't really work for me.

314
00:19:49,498 --> 00:19:51,888
Good.

315
00:19:51,888 --> 00:19:53,748
You're wearing sneakers.

316
00:19:56,058 --> 00:19:59,858
I'm now closing, so just wait 10 minutes.

317
00:20:09,218 --> 00:20:11,398
Is there something fun here?

318
00:20:11,398 --> 00:20:13,558
It doesn't look like it.

319
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:18,058
Just trust me. Your boredom will completely go away.

320
00:20:19,948 --> 00:20:21,838
All right.

321
00:20:21,838 --> 00:20:23,858
We're going to run.

322
00:20:23,858 --> 00:20:25,328
No need to run fast.

323
00:20:25,328 --> 00:20:27,938
Just slowly, keeping the pace for 30 minutes.

324
00:20:27,938 --> 00:20:30,148
Run for 30 minutes?

325
00:20:30,868 --> 00:20:33,448
I'm too lazy to go to the convenience store near my house,

326
00:20:33,448 --> 00:20:35,158
so I get it delivered.

327
00:20:35,158 --> 00:20:38,598
That's why your life is boring.

328
00:20:38,598 --> 00:20:40,728
I can't do this.

329
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:45,158
Trust me. You can do it.

330
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,368
Come.

331
00:20:53,938 --> 00:20:55,588
I feel like I'm going to die.

332
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,058
It looks like we're headed in the right way.

333
00:20:58,058 --> 00:21:02,158
Hey. You go ahead. I really can't do this.

334
00:21:03,288 --> 00:21:05,688
You feel like you can't, but you will.

335
00:21:05,688 --> 00:21:07,988
Okay. Come on!

336
00:21:12,018 --> 00:21:14,268
Hey, run by yourself.

337
00:21:14,268 --> 00:21:15,918
Come on! Run!

338
00:21:15,918 --> 00:21:18,968
What, what, what? Come on, Yuri. Come on.

339
00:21:18,968 --> 00:21:21,938
Come on! Let's run!

340
00:21:21,938 --> 00:21:26,018
Let's go! Run, I said!

341
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,058
Please.

342
00:21:28,058 --> 00:21:31,188
- Please! 
 - Go ahead.

343
00:21:31,188 --> 00:21:34,728
â™«  I must've fallen for you  â™«

344
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:38,860
â™«  â€™Cause I love you, I'll say it to you (say it to you)  â™«

345
00:21:39,688 --> 00:21:43,860
â™«  I'll express my fluttering heart (oh)  â™«

346
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:50,100
â™«  Always missing you (missing you)  â™«

347
00:21:50,118 --> 00:21:54,158
â™«  The whole world is filled with you  â™«

348
00:21:54,158 --> 00:21:58,668
â™«  Sometimes I wonder if I may be burdensome  â™«

349
00:21:58,668 --> 00:22:03,528
â™«  Oh, carefully, I'll approach you slowly, oh  â™«

350
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:10,578
â™«  So lovey, oh, dovey, lovable  â™«

351
00:22:10,578 --> 00:22:12,548
We're done.

352
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:18,298
â™«  This feeling, this fluttering  â™«

353
00:22:18,298 --> 00:22:21,328
â™«  I like it all  â™«

354
00:22:21,328 --> 00:22:24,568
â™«  I like it because it's you  â™«

355
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:28,658
I feel like I'm going to die.

356
00:22:28,658 --> 00:22:32,558
You might feel like it, but you won't die.

357
00:22:34,108 --> 00:22:36,238
You did it in the end.

358
00:22:38,728 --> 00:22:41,558
I feel like I'm going to die.

359
00:22:45,928 --> 00:22:47,708
Here.

360
00:22:55,318 --> 00:22:57,538
While you were running,

361
00:22:57,538 --> 00:23:00,158
you didn't feel bored. Right?

362
00:23:00,158 --> 00:23:03,548
This wasn't what I wanted,

363
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,558
but that didn't cross my mind.

364
00:23:05,558 --> 00:23:08,648
See?

365
00:23:08,648 --> 00:23:11,408
But if you tell me to do it again,

366
00:23:11,408 --> 00:23:14,158
I don't think I can.

367
00:23:14,158 --> 00:23:18,478
I'll do it with you. Like today.

368
00:23:18,478 --> 00:23:23,358
Until you feel like a deadline is better than the end of the world.

369
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:43,758
   

370
00:23:46,148 --> 00:23:49,128
"Web novels are all about the details."

371
00:23:50,598 --> 00:23:54,198
"Record your daily moments as if they're scenes.

372
00:23:54,198 --> 00:23:58,588
Whether text or drawings, any method is good."

373
00:24:18,288 --> 00:24:20,778
   

374
00:24:38,068 --> 00:24:39,798
What are you doing here this late?

375
00:24:39,798 --> 00:24:41,508
Where's Jihye? Jihye!

376
00:24:41,508 --> 00:24:44,588
She's not here. She's not here!

377
00:24:46,158 --> 00:24:48,268
But why are you looking for her?

378
00:24:48,268 --> 00:24:51,198
Ah, could you give this to her?

379
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:54,098
- What is this? 
 - When we had beer on the rooftop,

380
00:24:54,098 --> 00:24:55,918
she said she liked my blush.

381
00:24:55,918 --> 00:24:58,558
I ordered an extra one while I was getting mine.

382
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:00,438
Oh, and this is for you.

383
00:25:00,438 --> 00:25:02,078
Me?

384
00:25:06,478 --> 00:25:08,338
Good night.

385
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:27,008
What?

386
00:25:35,828 --> 00:25:38,418
 Thank you. From your neighbor. 

387
00:25:38,418 --> 00:25:40,928
What do I do with her?

388
00:25:41,788 --> 00:25:44,808
But how did she know I like bunnies?

389
00:25:51,818 --> 00:25:53,968
Should I move?

390
00:26:29,818 --> 00:26:31,628
Ta-da!

391
00:26:34,168 --> 00:26:35,108
Let's go to class.

392
00:26:35,108 --> 00:26:38,698
Let's go. 
    

393
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:40,788
 So, where is this? 

394
00:26:44,058 --> 00:26:47,338
 Maunakea Observatories. It's in Hawaii. 

395
00:26:47,338 --> 00:26:49,258
 It used to be my dream. 

396
00:26:49,258 --> 00:26:51,058
 If I lived there watching the stars, 

397
00:26:51,058 --> 00:26:53,358
 I think I would also be able to write "The Little Prince." 

398
00:26:53,358 --> 00:26:56,568
 If you want, I'll work really hard. 

399
00:26:56,568 --> 00:26:59,538
 We can go there. Let's go together. 

400
00:27:00,768 --> 00:27:03,598
 I should hurry and get back to being Kim Jieun. 

401
00:27:03,598 --> 00:27:06,358
 That way, I can get on a plane with my passport. 

402
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:08,458
I don't want to go.

403
00:27:09,368 --> 00:27:11,368
See you later!

404
00:27:14,418 --> 00:27:15,928
Looks cool, right?

405
00:27:15,928 --> 00:27:18,308
It's even cooler in person.

406
00:27:18,308 --> 00:27:20,058
When did you get here?

407
00:27:20,058 --> 00:27:22,178
Just now.

408
00:27:22,178 --> 00:27:25,378
It would be so wonderful if we could study there together.

409
00:27:25,378 --> 00:27:26,988
Apply.

410
00:27:26,988 --> 00:27:29,598
I'm sure you can get in.

411
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:32,698
In the year I left to be an exchange student,

412
00:27:32,698 --> 00:27:34,548
another woman took Park Yunjae from me.

413
00:27:34,548 --> 00:27:36,558
How could I leave you again?

414
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:37,998
The iron wall between us

415
00:27:37,998 --> 00:27:40,858
just went from being a tall wall to a short ledge.

416
00:27:40,858 --> 00:27:43,418
Who said that? That it got shorter?

417
00:27:43,418 --> 00:27:46,068
I just feel it.

418
00:27:46,068 --> 00:27:50,458
You should consider our relationship based on facts, not feelings.

419
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:53,818
Nothing has changed between us.

420
00:27:53,818 --> 00:27:56,058
Class starts in three minutes.

421
00:27:56,058 --> 00:27:58,118
I'm off.

422
00:27:58,118 --> 00:28:00,198
Wait for me.

423
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:16,558
- I'm here. 
 - You made it.

424
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:22,008
Gosh.

425
00:28:22,628 --> 00:28:24,578
You'll be hospitalized tomorrow.

426
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:27,338
Lie down and rest.

427
00:28:28,438 --> 00:28:32,488
One of the reasons I don't want to be hospitalized

428
00:28:32,488 --> 00:28:35,798
is that I can't take this guy.

429
00:28:36,658 --> 00:28:39,728
I need you to come down as often as you can

430
00:28:39,728 --> 00:28:41,348
and take care of this guy.

431
00:28:41,348 --> 00:28:44,058
Mr. Kim next door takes good care of it.

432
00:28:44,058 --> 00:28:47,858
Listen to you. That's different.

433
00:28:49,108 --> 00:28:51,548
It's not the same as taking care of it myself.

434
00:28:51,548 --> 00:28:53,408
I got it.

435
00:28:53,408 --> 00:28:55,458
So lie down now.

436
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:57,158
Mom.

437
00:28:58,068 --> 00:29:01,858
Oh my, that orchid's life is better than a person's.

438
00:29:01,858 --> 00:29:05,258
- Wash your hands. 
 - Where are you going?

439
00:29:05,258 --> 00:29:08,358
Let me feed my son. Goodness.

440
00:29:08,358 --> 00:29:11,858
- Don't waste ingredients. 
 - Listen to you.

441
00:29:12,658 --> 00:29:15,868
Don't worry about wasting them. Use plenty.

442
00:29:15,868 --> 00:29:17,808
Goodness.

443
00:29:23,858 --> 00:29:28,158
Are you going to keep your hair long like that?

444
00:29:29,658 --> 00:29:31,618
Yes.

445
00:29:31,618 --> 00:29:33,908
Until I pass the exam.

446
00:29:33,908 --> 00:29:35,878
Goodness.

447
00:29:36,988 --> 00:29:40,868
That exam is making you do all kinds of things.

448
00:29:40,868 --> 00:29:43,238
I'll pass this year.

449
00:29:44,858 --> 00:29:48,248
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

450
00:29:48,248 --> 00:29:51,588
I have no desire for that.

451
00:29:54,678 --> 00:29:56,828
Thank you...

452
00:29:59,198 --> 00:30:01,298
for letting me see

453
00:30:01,298 --> 00:30:03,878
my daughter-in-law's face before I die.

454
00:30:03,878 --> 00:30:05,828
She's not...

455
00:30:05,828 --> 00:30:07,728
It's not like that yet.

456
00:30:07,728 --> 00:30:09,918
And why would you die?

457
00:30:09,918 --> 00:30:12,248
You're going to the hospital to live.

458
00:30:16,068 --> 00:30:19,728
I'm saying I can die happy now.

459
00:30:19,728 --> 00:30:22,838
My life's wish...

460
00:30:22,838 --> 00:30:25,988
was for you to have someone...

461
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,268
who could eat with you face-to-face.

462
00:30:30,218 --> 00:30:32,958
Do you get married to eat together?

463
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:35,998
You have no idea how important that is.

464
00:30:38,928 --> 00:30:41,148
Being a fool,

465
00:30:41,808 --> 00:30:45,138
I realized that way too late.

466
00:30:47,408 --> 00:30:49,378
It's fine.

467
00:30:49,378 --> 00:30:52,948
I made enough money for you to spend,

468
00:30:53,948 --> 00:30:56,738
so make memories instead.

469
00:30:57,548 --> 00:30:59,958
Make your family happy.

470
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:02,568
Your money isn't my money, Father.

471
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:07,068
Stop talking nonsense and go rest.

472
00:31:07,068 --> 00:31:10,268
We need to leave early tomorrow to get to the hospital.

473
00:31:30,028 --> 00:31:32,268
Gosh.

474
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,778
How beautiful.

475
00:31:46,108 --> 00:31:48,088
 Welcome. 

476
00:32:18,148 --> 00:32:23,128
Does he know who I am? How dare he make me wait?

477
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:28,628
You are eliminated.

478
00:32:28,628 --> 00:32:31,668
Eliminated! Eliminated! Eliminated!

479
00:32:31,668 --> 00:32:34,158
Eliminated. I said, eliminated!

480
00:32:34,158 --> 00:32:36,718
Eliminated! Eliminated!

481
00:32:36,718 --> 00:32:38,958
Ms. Go Yeongmi?

482
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:41,078
Yes? That's me.

483
00:32:41,078 --> 00:32:45,318
Yes, I'm Wang Chunbae, who's supposed to meet you today.

484
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:52,598
Damn it! That brat.

485
00:32:54,508 --> 00:32:56,728
 Those who want to eat the fruit must climb the tree. 

486
00:32:56,728 --> 00:32:58,188
 Fighting, Mom! 

487
00:32:58,188 --> 00:33:00,648
 Get me a stepdad. 

488
00:33:00,648 --> 00:33:03,488
Could I sit?

489
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:08,498
Oh my, it just happens that I got fluid drained from my knees today.

490
00:33:08,498 --> 00:33:10,888
That brat.

491
00:33:12,318 --> 00:33:15,578
She must be out of her mind.

492
00:33:15,578 --> 00:33:17,158
That little...

493
00:33:17,158 --> 00:33:19,118
Damn it!

494
00:33:22,568 --> 00:33:24,768
Thank you so much.

495
00:33:24,768 --> 00:33:28,368
You should've seen my mom's face.

496
00:33:28,368 --> 00:33:30,508
It must be crazy at the office, right?

497
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,738
Yes.

498
00:33:31,738 --> 00:33:33,958
She says she'll sue us.

499
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:36,738
That old lady. Don't worry.

500
00:33:36,738 --> 00:33:39,768
My friend will take care of it.

501
00:33:40,658 --> 00:33:43,058
But...

502
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:47,498
why did your relationship with your mother get so bad?

503
00:33:47,498 --> 00:33:48,868
I don't know.

504
00:33:48,868 --> 00:33:52,188
I think I hated my mom ever since I was born.

505
00:33:52,188 --> 00:33:55,108
I think my mom felt the same.

506
00:33:55,108 --> 00:33:59,518
No. Your mother really cares for you, Jeongja.

507
00:34:01,698 --> 00:34:05,128
You know what my mom hates the most?

508
00:34:06,598 --> 00:34:10,198
My dad. But I'm exactly like him.

509
00:34:10,198 --> 00:34:12,768
Both looks and personality.

510
00:34:12,768 --> 00:34:14,918
But what I'm really upset about,

511
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:18,328
is that my dad loved my mom until the very end, before he passed.

512
00:34:18,328 --> 00:34:20,858
That's what makes me so mad.

513
00:34:25,448 --> 00:34:28,348
Well... what's your ideal type?

514
00:34:28,348 --> 00:34:32,418
If you tell me in detail, I'll do my best to look for someone.

515
00:34:33,228 --> 00:34:36,098
I just told you my sad family story.

516
00:34:36,098 --> 00:34:39,158
But you're still doing business?

517
00:34:39,158 --> 00:34:43,058
- I'm really not into this. Really. 
 - W-Wait!

518
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:50,888
There's one thing I told myself when I joined this matchmaking company.

519
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:52,738
Regarding a client's complaints,

520
00:34:52,738 --> 00:34:55,238
if the reason is love, not qualifications,

521
00:34:55,238 --> 00:34:59,188
I will take on that responsibility in any case.

522
00:35:00,448 --> 00:35:03,348
I will do my best to take care of you.

523
00:35:04,788 --> 00:35:07,048
I like you.

524
00:35:07,048 --> 00:35:10,018
It must be time for you to get off work soon.

525
00:35:10,018 --> 00:35:12,338
Do you have plans?

526
00:35:36,558 --> 00:35:38,658
Sir, do you have someone with you?

527
00:35:38,658 --> 00:35:41,928
Oh, I'm alone.

528
00:35:41,928 --> 00:35:43,638
Let me explain how you're shooting.

529
00:35:43,638 --> 00:35:45,948
- Sure. 
 - Follow me.

530
00:35:49,628 --> 00:35:51,668
Come over here.

531
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:54,628
Have a seat.

532
00:35:54,628 --> 00:35:57,798
The camera is over there.

533
00:35:57,798 --> 00:36:00,488
To take a photo, you press this button.

534
00:36:00,488 --> 00:36:02,328
Oh, yes.

535
00:36:57,378 --> 00:36:59,648
 Bye now. 

536
00:37:02,158 --> 00:37:04,608
- Father-in-law! 
 - Son-in-law! Have you been well?

537
00:37:04,608 --> 00:37:07,908
You didn't tell us you were coming.

538
00:37:07,908 --> 00:37:09,748
- Come on in. 
 - Okay.

539
00:37:09,748 --> 00:37:11,008
Honey!

540
00:37:11,008 --> 00:37:13,658
Father-in-law is here!

541
00:37:13,658 --> 00:37:18,068
- Dad! 
 - Oh my, my daughter!

542
00:37:18,068 --> 00:37:20,068
But what is this?

543
00:37:20,068 --> 00:37:21,958
I got my funeral portrait taken.

544
00:37:21,958 --> 00:37:23,858
- Dad! 
 - Father.

545
00:37:23,858 --> 00:37:28,738
It's trendy to get it taken when you're healthy these days.

546
00:37:29,468 --> 00:37:31,308
Come over here.

547
00:37:36,858 --> 00:37:38,988
Look.

548
00:37:38,988 --> 00:37:41,938
This outfit fits me.

549
00:37:41,938 --> 00:37:44,558
I tried it on, just in case.

550
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,118
Look.

551
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,148
Didn't the photographer say something?

552
00:37:51,148 --> 00:37:54,728
I went to a self-portrait place just in case.

553
00:37:54,728 --> 00:37:55,898
Say cheese.

554
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:58,278
You should have told us. We would have accompanied you.

555
00:37:58,278 --> 00:38:00,268
There you go again. Treating me like an old man.

556
00:38:00,268 --> 00:38:03,358
You don't need to accompany me.

557
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:06,248
- Get me something to drink. 
 - Okay.

558
00:38:06,248 --> 00:38:09,558
Father, you're staying over tonight, right?

559
00:38:09,558 --> 00:38:12,818
- I'll see. 
 - Come on. It's been a while. We should...

560
00:38:12,818 --> 00:38:15,228
play a round. You're staying over!

561
00:38:15,228 --> 00:38:17,608
Listen to him.

562
00:38:42,148 --> 00:38:44,068
Mom.

563
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:58,568
What, my daughter?

564
00:39:00,908 --> 00:39:02,898
Why would you take a photo like this?

565
00:39:02,898 --> 00:39:05,428
You can be so melodramatic, Mom.

566
00:39:05,428 --> 00:39:08,888
It's not melodramatic, it's romantic.

567
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,978
How is Jieun?

568
00:39:12,178 --> 00:39:13,888
I don't know.

569
00:39:13,888 --> 00:39:16,808
She's pretending to be well.

570
00:39:19,368 --> 00:39:21,738
Let me meet with her.

571
00:39:21,738 --> 00:39:25,628
Unlike you, I tend to be cool-headed in dealing with problems.

572
00:39:25,628 --> 00:39:27,638
Why? You're going to meet her and say,

573
00:39:27,638 --> 00:39:30,728
"Actually, I'm not your grandpa. I'm your grandma"?

574
00:39:30,728 --> 00:39:32,008
Come on.

575
00:39:32,008 --> 00:39:34,648
You think I'm an idiot?

576
00:39:34,648 --> 00:39:37,338
You know Jihye is exactly like you, Mom.

577
00:39:37,338 --> 00:39:40,498
Her lifelong nickname is "idiot."

578
00:39:41,758 --> 00:39:45,258
She can be like that.

579
00:39:48,088 --> 00:39:51,128
Being in your position,

580
00:39:51,128 --> 00:39:54,048
I get how hard it must have been for you.

581
00:39:55,998 --> 00:39:58,888
It's hard enough just being a mom.

582
00:40:05,658 --> 00:40:09,088
Our Jieun is so sweet,

583
00:40:09,088 --> 00:40:11,678
and so is her dad.

584
00:40:13,048 --> 00:40:18,188
Your husband ran off, and your daughter resented you.

585
00:40:22,258 --> 00:40:25,278
How did you survive, Mom?

586
00:40:25,278 --> 00:40:27,968
I'm too old to remember.

587
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:30,118
Gosh, hey, hey.

588
00:40:31,058 --> 00:40:34,948
Wow. This is a great color.

589
00:40:35,748 --> 00:40:37,858
Mom.

590
00:40:37,858 --> 00:40:40,528
Have you ever had this thought?

591
00:40:40,528 --> 00:40:48,618
That you want to be a woman again before you die?

592
00:40:52,628 --> 00:40:58,788
If not for Jieun, I would have lied until I died.

593
00:41:01,518 --> 00:41:03,868
Of course, I want that all the time.

594
00:41:07,568 --> 00:41:10,838
Jieun must be lying, too.

595
00:41:14,698 --> 00:41:16,448
Jieun!

596
00:41:29,158 --> 00:41:31,088
Jieun!

597
00:41:55,288 --> 00:41:57,348
J-Jieun!

598
00:42:12,938 --> 00:42:15,318
I'm sorry.

599
00:42:19,588 --> 00:42:21,778
Let's talk later.

600
00:42:22,658 --> 00:42:26,358
Jieun, let's talk.

601
00:42:30,078 --> 00:42:32,908
Dad, you also knew?

602
00:42:32,908 --> 00:42:36,378
That Grandpa was a woman, not a man?

603
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:47,758
Jieun, your parents did nothing wrong.

604
00:42:54,668 --> 00:42:56,968
My sister and I both...

605
00:42:57,868 --> 00:43:01,588
called you "Grandpa" our whole lives, but you're our grandma.

606
00:43:03,288 --> 00:43:06,298
But our parents did nothing wrong?

607
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,628
I'm sorry.

608
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:11,838
It's all because I wanted them toâ€”

609
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:14,578
You're not Grandpa!

610
00:43:16,448 --> 00:43:18,558
I'm sorry.

611
00:43:22,358 --> 00:43:25,528
How long were you going to hide this?

612
00:43:25,528 --> 00:43:29,588
You should have at least told me when I became a guy.

613
00:43:29,588 --> 00:43:32,048
That I might have to...

614
00:43:34,588 --> 00:43:37,568
live as a man for the rest of my life.

615
00:43:38,268 --> 00:43:41,158
My parents may not have been able to tell me,

616
00:43:41,158 --> 00:43:43,068
but Grandpa...

617
00:43:45,788 --> 00:43:48,678
Grandma, you should have told me.

618
00:43:51,888 --> 00:43:53,378
It's all my fault.

619
00:43:53,378 --> 00:43:55,758
I'm sorry, my daughter.

620
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:59,158
No. I'm sorry.

621
00:44:00,158 --> 00:44:03,358
- Jieun. 
 - I'm going to go home alone today.

622
00:44:04,138 --> 00:44:06,108
Give me some time.

623
00:45:03,858 --> 00:45:08,148
   

624
00:45:08,148 --> 00:45:11,208
   

625
00:45:53,228 --> 00:45:55,218
This is a special spirit that was gifted to me,

626
00:45:55,218 --> 00:45:57,858
but I don't have the right glasses.

627
00:45:57,858 --> 00:46:00,358
What's inside matters, not the outside.

628
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:03,508
Oh my. You and I will get along.

629
00:46:03,508 --> 00:46:05,158
Cheers!

630
00:46:13,818 --> 00:46:15,658
This is so delicious.

631
00:46:15,658 --> 00:46:16,828
Really?

632
00:46:16,828 --> 00:46:19,918
Maybe I'm not used to it. It's bitter.

633
00:46:19,918 --> 00:46:24,588
But alcohol tastes the same after a while.

634
00:46:26,258 --> 00:46:28,668
So, what's your type?

635
00:46:28,668 --> 00:46:31,958
I'll do the follow-up properly,

636
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:34,218
so tell me everything.

637
00:46:34,218 --> 00:46:35,758
Anyhow, I might...

638
00:46:35,758 --> 00:46:39,968
come across as someone shallow, who only cares about qualifications,

639
00:46:39,968 --> 00:46:41,738
but when it comes to love,

640
00:46:41,738 --> 00:46:45,528
I become endlessly hopeless.

641
00:46:46,238 --> 00:46:49,018
You become hopeless when it comes to love?

642
00:46:49,018 --> 00:46:51,858
I like that wording.

643
00:46:51,858 --> 00:46:55,448
But I already found someone I like.

644
00:46:55,448 --> 00:46:58,588
I even met his parents.

645
00:46:58,588 --> 00:47:01,478
My gosh! That's great!

646
00:47:01,478 --> 00:47:03,808
How about you? Single?

647
00:47:03,808 --> 00:47:07,508
Well... right now, yes.

648
00:47:07,508 --> 00:47:10,508
I also have someone I like.

649
00:47:10,508 --> 00:47:13,818
Actually, I finally found him.

650
00:47:13,818 --> 00:47:15,908
What do you mean you found him?

651
00:47:15,908 --> 00:47:18,178
He was my first love.

652
00:47:19,258 --> 00:47:23,168
I missed him for 10 years and finally met him again.

653
00:47:23,168 --> 00:47:25,338
How cute.

654
00:47:26,738 --> 00:47:29,448
Then, if that love comes true,

655
00:47:29,448 --> 00:47:31,268
I will throw you a wedding.

656
00:47:31,268 --> 00:47:33,578
What? Eonni, I'm recording this.

657
00:47:33,578 --> 00:47:36,698
Go ahead. I'll pay for the honeymoon, too.

658
00:47:37,338 --> 00:47:38,828
Oh? Listen to this eonni!

659
00:47:38,828 --> 00:47:42,958
You're a rich eonni, aren't you?

660
00:47:42,958 --> 00:47:46,588
If things go well for you, I will sing at your wedding.

661
00:47:46,588 --> 00:47:48,658
I was going to hire an orchestra.

662
00:47:48,658 --> 00:47:51,548
I'll save money and make a friend.

663
00:47:54,248 --> 00:47:56,908
One second. It might be work.

664
00:47:56,908 --> 00:47:59,518
Go ahead.

665
00:47:59,518 --> 00:48:03,658
   

666
00:48:05,828 --> 00:48:07,448
Oh no, Eonni.

667
00:48:07,448 --> 00:48:09,968
Something urgent just came up.

668
00:48:09,968 --> 00:48:12,058
Looks like I have to go.

669
00:48:12,058 --> 00:48:13,998
Is it work?

670
00:48:13,998 --> 00:48:17,338
- Is it because of my mom? 
 - No.

671
00:48:18,068 --> 00:48:21,838
Father passed away.

672
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:23,278
Really?

673
00:48:23,278 --> 00:48:26,318
Then, I'll go with you. Give me a moment.

674
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:30,268
Not my father. My friend's father.

675
00:48:30,268 --> 00:48:33,268
My first love's.

676
00:48:33,268 --> 00:48:34,838
My goodness.

677
00:48:34,838 --> 00:48:36,748
Hurry along.

678
00:48:37,868 --> 00:48:40,558
I'll call you, Eonni.

679
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:44,318
I'm sorry.

680
00:49:02,088 --> 00:49:04,308
You scared me!

681
00:49:05,128 --> 00:49:07,388
What are you doing here?

682
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:10,518
Oppa, what's wrong?

683
00:49:11,618 --> 00:49:13,658
My goodness! Are you okay?

684
00:49:13,658 --> 00:49:15,028
I'm fine.

685
00:49:15,028 --> 00:49:16,928
You don't look fine.

686
00:49:16,928 --> 00:49:20,818
What are you doing? Get up. Can you get up?

687
00:49:20,818 --> 00:49:24,148
Huh? One, two, three.

688
00:49:25,928 --> 00:49:27,688
Careful.

689
00:49:27,688 --> 00:49:29,898
What is going on?

690
00:49:31,518 --> 00:49:33,298
This won't do.

691
00:49:33,298 --> 00:49:34,848
I'm calling 911.

692
00:49:34,848 --> 00:49:36,508
No.

693
00:49:36,508 --> 00:49:37,958
I'm fine.

694
00:49:37,958 --> 00:49:39,108
I'm fine.

695
00:49:39,108 --> 00:49:41,688
What do you mean? You need to get to the ER.

696
00:49:41,688 --> 00:49:43,658
Not the hospital.

697
00:49:43,658 --> 00:49:46,608
- I'm fine. 
 - Why not? You're so frustrating.

698
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:48,058
- Here? 
 - Yes.

699
00:49:48,058 --> 00:49:50,758
Gosh! Oppa!

700
00:49:51,828 --> 00:49:53,488
Oppa!

701
00:49:53,488 --> 00:49:55,398
Oppa!

702
00:49:55,398 --> 00:49:57,548
Oppa, wake up!

703
00:49:57,548 --> 00:49:59,908
Oppa, wake up!

704
00:49:59,908 --> 00:50:02,138
What do I do?

705
00:50:18,958 --> 00:50:20,858
Getting surgery was out the window to begin with.

706
00:50:20,858 --> 00:50:24,058
It was a miracle that he was even alive.

707
00:50:24,058 --> 00:50:26,778
But how could he overnight...

708
00:50:26,778 --> 00:50:28,658
In life,

709
00:50:28,658 --> 00:50:34,008
there are many more unexpected deaths than natural deaths.

710
00:50:34,008 --> 00:50:40,458
Despite that, your father gave us a lot of time.

711
00:50:44,448 --> 00:50:45,958
Oh my, your uncle is here.

712
00:50:45,958 --> 00:50:48,278
Oh my. Hyeongnim, you made it.

713
00:50:48,278 --> 00:50:50,168
Gosh, you came.

714
00:50:50,168 --> 00:50:53,738
- Goodness. 
 - How could this be?

715
00:50:53,738 --> 00:50:55,578
- Goodness... 
 - I'm sorry...

716
00:50:55,578 --> 00:50:58,358
How could this happen?

717
00:51:37,198 --> 00:51:39,898
He was sick.

718
00:51:39,898 --> 00:51:42,808
I didn't know he would pass away so quickly.

719
00:51:45,108 --> 00:51:47,628
Thank you for coming, Jihye.

720
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:51,608
Of course.

721
00:51:52,618 --> 00:51:56,188
Mom, this is my deskmate from high school. Jihye.

722
00:51:56,188 --> 00:51:58,068
Gosh, thank you.

723
00:51:58,068 --> 00:52:01,318
- Thank you for coming all this way. 
 - No, no.

724
00:52:03,448 --> 00:52:04,598
Jeongja is here.

725
00:52:04,598 --> 00:52:07,258
- Jeongja! 
 - Mother.

726
00:52:07,258 --> 00:52:09,468
Goodness, thank you.

727
00:52:09,468 --> 00:52:11,448
Goodness, thank you.

728
00:52:11,448 --> 00:52:13,908
Goodness, thank you.

729
00:52:13,908 --> 00:52:16,458
H-How come she's here?

730
00:52:16,458 --> 00:52:19,968
It's all thanks to you, Jeongja.

731
00:52:19,968 --> 00:52:23,498
My goodness, come on in.

732
00:52:24,668 --> 00:52:27,548
Oh, Jihye.

733
00:52:30,688 --> 00:52:34,198
 But I already found someone I like. 

734
00:52:34,198 --> 00:52:36,978
 I even met his parents. 

735
00:52:41,228 --> 00:52:44,378
 Father passed away. 

736
00:52:44,378 --> 00:52:46,448
 Not my father. 

737
00:52:46,448 --> 00:52:49,158
 My friend's father. 

738
00:52:49,158 --> 00:52:51,408
 My first love's. 

739
00:53:09,658 --> 00:53:11,638
Thank goodness.

740
00:53:11,638 --> 00:53:13,738
His fever went down a bit.

741
00:53:17,628 --> 00:53:21,188
I don't think he's the type to do something bad.

742
00:53:21,188 --> 00:53:24,808
Why can't he go to the hospital?

743
00:53:51,178 --> 00:53:52,938
No.

744
00:53:56,138 --> 00:53:58,908
I don't want to live like this.

745
00:53:59,798 --> 00:54:01,738
Mom.

746
00:54:05,258 --> 00:54:07,208
Mom.

747
00:55:01,188 --> 00:55:03,118
Cold.

748
00:55:19,778 --> 00:55:21,678
So to summarize,

749
00:55:21,678 --> 00:55:25,368
we like the same person. Is that it?

750
00:55:26,388 --> 00:55:30,898
Yeongseok doesn't know that I like him.

751
00:55:30,898 --> 00:55:34,348
I hope you don't take it the wrong way.

752
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:39,838
- How so? 
 - I know you already met his parents.

753
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:41,678
I don't want things to sour

754
00:55:41,678 --> 00:55:45,038
between you two because of what I said.

755
00:55:45,038 --> 00:55:46,928
It was a total coincidence.

756
00:55:46,928 --> 00:55:48,518
There's nothing between us.

757
00:55:48,518 --> 00:55:50,588
We were also getting to know each other

758
00:55:50,588 --> 00:55:52,988
through a blind date that my employee set up.

759
00:55:52,988 --> 00:55:57,658
I met his parents, but there was a reason.

760
00:55:57,658 --> 00:56:02,868
I don't want to get between you two at all.

761
00:56:02,868 --> 00:56:04,768
You said you become hopeless when it comes to love.

762
00:56:04,768 --> 00:56:06,338
Seems like it's true.

763
00:56:06,338 --> 00:56:08,678
Did you commit a sin?

764
00:56:10,058 --> 00:56:14,408
Yeongseok is a really good person.

765
00:56:14,408 --> 00:56:17,868
Innocent, honest...

766
00:56:17,868 --> 00:56:19,858
and handsome.

767
00:56:19,858 --> 00:56:22,258
I know.

768
00:56:22,258 --> 00:56:25,018
But the person who holds the key

769
00:56:25,018 --> 00:56:28,938
is not us, but Yeongseok.

770
00:56:28,938 --> 00:56:31,238
Let's not decide this by ourselves.

771
00:56:31,238 --> 00:56:32,998
Let us both love him.

772
00:56:32,998 --> 00:56:36,468
It could be one of us or neither.

773
00:56:36,468 --> 00:56:39,668
Yeongseok will figure it out.

774
00:56:39,668 --> 00:56:44,748
I never played sports or studied because I don't like competition.

775
00:56:44,748 --> 00:56:48,478
But this time, I'll willingly participate.

776
00:56:48,478 --> 00:56:51,768
Seems like it would be worth it.

777
00:56:53,288 --> 00:56:56,008
My main weapon is money.

778
00:56:56,858 --> 00:56:59,148
What is yours, Jihye?

779
00:57:03,728 --> 00:57:06,038
Nostalgia?

780
00:57:06,038 --> 00:57:08,918
Money versus time, huh?

781
00:57:11,048 --> 00:57:13,558
I'm at a disadvantage.

782
00:57:13,558 --> 00:57:17,358
- But you're pretty, Eonni. 
 - And you're young.

783
00:57:24,068 --> 00:57:26,198
Nunim, the door is open.

784
00:57:26,198 --> 00:57:28,938
I'll check and let you know.

785
00:57:28,938 --> 00:57:30,518
Okay.

786
00:57:51,678 --> 00:57:53,788
Yunjae.

787
00:57:54,558 --> 00:57:57,988
What are you guys doing?

788
00:57:57,988 --> 00:57:59,548
What?

789
00:58:06,028 --> 00:58:07,788
S-So...

790
00:58:07,788 --> 00:58:09,538
Yunjae?

791
00:58:10,458 --> 00:58:12,798
Why are you heâ€”

792
00:58:17,158 --> 00:58:21,058
Exactly. Why are you sleeping next to me, Oppa?

793
00:58:21,058 --> 00:58:23,898
Why are you asking me?

794
00:58:23,898 --> 00:58:26,128
Are you pulling my hair right now?

795
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:27,158
Hey!

796
00:58:27,158 --> 00:58:28,158
- Won't you let go? 
 - Let go!

797
00:58:28,158 --> 00:58:30,298
- You let go! 
 - You first!

798
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:31,858
Hey, hey, hey! Guys! Wait!

799
00:58:31,858 --> 00:58:35,378
- Let go! 
 - Wait, guys!

800
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:37,558
You little skank!

801
00:58:37,558 --> 00:58:39,568
Watch how this skank will kill you!

802
00:58:41,668 --> 00:58:43,058
- Let go! 
 - Use your words.

803
00:58:43,058 --> 00:58:45,258
- This is our house. 
 - So why am I asleep here?

804
00:58:45,258 --> 00:58:47,258
- What would I do to you? 
 - Stop it!

805
00:58:47,258 --> 00:58:49,948
- Why would I make a move on you? Come here! 
 - What the heck!

806
00:58:49,948 --> 00:58:51,998
You guys! You guys!

807
00:58:51,998 --> 00:58:54,328
- Wait, wait. 
 - Get over here.

808
00:58:54,328 --> 00:58:55,918
- Are you crazy? 
 - Get over here.

809
00:58:55,918 --> 00:58:58,078
Are you crazy?

810
00:58:58,078 --> 00:59:00,518
Guys! You guys!

811
00:59:01,578 --> 00:59:03,898
 Let go! The hair, hair! 

812
00:59:03,898 --> 00:59:05,808
 Wait! Let go! 

813
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:13,100
   

814
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:18,200


815
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:22,520
â™«  'Cause I love you, I'll say it to you  â™«

816
00:59:23,288 --> 00:59:27,858
â™«  I'll express my fluttering heart  â™«

817
00:59:27,858 --> 00:59:33,118
â™«  I keep smiling for no reason  â™«

818
00:59:33,118 --> 00:59:37,358
â™«  That's all because of you  â™«

819
00:59:37,358 --> 00:59:40,158
â™«  Can you hear my heart  â™«

820
00:59:40,158 --> 00:59:42,558
â™«  It's beating towards you  â™«

821
00:59:42,558 --> 00:59:46,178
   

822
00:59:46,178 --> 00:59:48,528
 Come and help out this weekend. 
 ~ Preview ~ 

823
00:59:48,528 --> 00:59:51,658
 I told Grandpa I'd work hard. 

824
00:59:51,658 --> 00:59:53,858
 - Are you okay? 
 - Oppa, come with me. 

825
00:59:53,858 --> 00:59:56,428
 So you've never seen me as a woman? 

826
00:59:56,428 --> 00:59:59,158
 You too... kissed? 

827
00:59:59,158 --> 01:00:02,288
 Just get mad at me. Like Kim Jieun used to. 

828
01:00:02,288 --> 01:00:04,348
 I don't look like Kim Jieun to anyone. 

829
01:00:04,348 --> 01:00:06,418
 How can I be like Kim Jieun in this state? 

830
01:00:06,418 --> 01:00:09,738
 I should tell Yunjae that we should break up, shouldn't I? 

831
01:00:09,738 --> 01:00:11,878
 At least in this very moment, 

832
01:00:11,878 --> 01:00:14,738

833
01:00:16,158 --> 01:00:19,858
â™«  Sometimes I wonder if I may be burdensome  â™«
