1
00:00:07,053 --> 00:00:10,303
   

2
00:00:12,783 --> 00:00:15,813
   

3
00:00:21,293 --> 00:00:24,573
   

4
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:29,663
   

5
00:00:32,663 --> 00:00:36,410
   

6
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:45,970


7
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:53,533
 It's the tail end of summer and heavy rain is pouring down. 

8
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:58,333
 The world-renowned astronomer Carl Sagan said this: 

9
00:00:59,013 --> 00:01:01,613
 "We, who are as minuscule as dust, 

10
00:01:01,613 --> 00:01:06,573
 can endure the vastness of the cosmos only through love." 

11
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:11,033
 The moment we realize everything we take for granted 

12
00:01:11,033 --> 00:01:15,233
 is not to be taken for granted 

13
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:19,120
 our lives become miraculous. 

14
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:27,010
♫  Let's spend the time we share  ♫

15
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,833
 Guest. 

16
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:56,333
 I'm sorry, but we're closed. 

17
00:02:08,323 --> 00:02:10,603
   

18
00:02:10,603 --> 00:02:15,363
 Guest, where did you find this? 

19
00:02:16,393 --> 00:02:19,083
 I asked where you found this? 

20
00:02:31,593 --> 00:02:33,643
 Y-Yunjae. 

21
00:02:34,343 --> 00:02:38,613
 You... know me? 

22
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:45,333
 I'm sorry, but who are you? 

23
00:02:46,673 --> 00:02:48,683
 It's me. 

24
00:02:48,683 --> 00:02:50,643
 Jieun. 

25
00:02:51,373 --> 00:02:52,933
 What? 

26
00:02:56,433 --> 00:03:00,243
 I have no idea what you're talking about right now. 

27
00:03:00,243 --> 00:03:02,043
 I'm... 

28
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:06,293
 I'm your girlfriend... 

29
00:03:07,273 --> 00:03:09,593
 Kim Jieun. 

30
00:03:26,393 --> 00:03:30,623
   

31
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:36,953
   

32
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:39,093
 Kim Jieun. 

33
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,633
Yes.

34
00:03:42,963 --> 00:03:44,933
Of all the books you read by our publishing house,

35
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:50,413
you noted "The Birth and Extinction of the Cosmos" as your favorite.

36
00:03:51,223 --> 00:03:53,843
I first learned about the novel,

37
00:03:53,843 --> 00:03:56,073
"The Birth and Extinction of the Cosmos,"

38
00:03:56,073 --> 00:04:00,453
when my boyfriend, an astronomy major, recommended it to me.

39
00:04:02,063 --> 00:04:05,063
By linking the physical cosmos to a character named Cosmos,

40
00:04:05,063 --> 00:04:08,093
it explored quantum mechanics from a literary perspective.

41
00:04:08,093 --> 00:04:10,173
I had to read it several times

42
00:04:10,173 --> 00:04:13,513
to understand the book's message.

43
00:04:13,513 --> 00:04:16,063
And what was that?

44
00:04:16,063 --> 00:04:18,843
That love is...

45
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:21,753
the source of trouble.

46
00:04:21,753 --> 00:04:23,353
In the book,

47
00:04:23,353 --> 00:04:25,243
everything happens

48
00:04:25,243 --> 00:04:28,813
as a result of the protagonist's love.

49
00:04:28,813 --> 00:04:30,743
If he didn't love anything,

50
00:04:30,743 --> 00:04:33,613
nothing would've happened.

51
00:04:33,613 --> 00:04:35,233
Therefore,

52
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,893
"Love again today."

53
00:04:36,893 --> 00:04:38,763
"Don't stop loving."

54
00:04:38,763 --> 00:04:43,523
That's what I learned from this book.

55
00:04:58,973 --> 00:05:00,913
Kim Jieun!

56
00:05:09,983 --> 00:05:11,473
Ta-da!

57
00:05:11,473 --> 00:05:13,283
What is this?

58
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:15,133
How did you get here?

59
00:05:15,133 --> 00:05:16,403
I took the bus.

60
00:05:16,403 --> 00:05:18,013
This place is pretty massive.

61
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:21,043
Thanks to you, I get to check out a place like this.

62
00:05:22,803 --> 00:05:24,283
I knew it.

63
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:25,923
You said those shoes hurt your feet.

64
00:05:25,923 --> 00:05:27,873
But still, they're pretty.

65
00:05:27,873 --> 00:05:30,163
Gosh, it must hurt.

66
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,153
Wait a second.

67
00:05:36,613 --> 00:05:38,323
Ta-da.

68
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:47,733
- Ouch. 
 - Did you get hurt?

69
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:50,533
- Yeah. 
 - I also brought a band-aid.

70
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:58,103
There you go.

71
00:06:03,313 --> 00:06:04,333
What?

72
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,733
- Did something happen? 
 - No.

73
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:10,413
Thank you for understanding and loving me, Park Yunjae.

74
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:12,233
Huh?

75
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:15,183
So out of the blue.

76
00:06:16,013 --> 00:06:18,123
I feel the same.

77
00:06:18,123 --> 00:06:20,443
Thank you, Kim Jieun.

78
00:06:20,443 --> 00:06:23,063
I love you so much.

79
00:06:26,743 --> 00:06:28,433
Me, too.

80
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:32,633
♫  I can't stop thinking about you  ♫

81
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:34,373
What's all this?

82
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:37,253
What do you think? It's our Suncheon trip itinerary.

83
00:06:37,253 --> 00:06:39,713
Wow, classic Park Yunjae.

84
00:06:39,713 --> 00:06:42,013
So thorough.

85
00:06:42,013 --> 00:06:44,493
This is our first overnight trip together.

86
00:06:44,493 --> 00:06:48,103
I don't want to waste a single moment with you.

87
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:58,733
How come... there are no plans after 9:00 p.m.?

88
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:02,953
Are we really going to bed at 9:00 p.m.?

89
00:07:08,683 --> 00:07:11,103
The purpose of this trip

90
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:16,943
is to... stargaze with you all night long.

91
00:07:18,683 --> 00:07:20,543
Star...

92
00:07:21,363 --> 00:07:23,433
Hey! What if someone hears you?

93
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:25,833
- That hurt! 
 - So old-school.

94
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,833
- You're so... 
 - What's wrong with stargazing?

95
00:07:31,793 --> 00:07:34,803
I was... I was eating already.

96
00:07:34,803 --> 00:07:36,973
So funny.

97
00:08:21,683 --> 00:08:24,193
Are you shooting a film?

98
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,093
Oh my god!

99
00:08:28,403 --> 00:08:29,373
Hello, Nunim.

100
00:08:29,373 --> 00:08:31,633
It's a hot day. Why don't you continue inside?

101
00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:33,773
Can't you just ignore us and go in?

102
00:08:33,773 --> 00:08:35,793
Why not continue in a cool place?

103
00:08:35,793 --> 00:08:38,013
It'll be a pleasure.

104
00:08:39,613 --> 00:08:43,143
What do you mean? Continue what?

105
00:08:46,523 --> 00:08:47,783
Go in already.

106
00:08:47,783 --> 00:08:49,533
I'll leave.

107
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:52,863
My sister drives me crazy.

108
00:08:52,863 --> 00:08:55,033
I'm going. I'll call you later.

109
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:58,563
W-Why? Come in and continue. I'll stay in my room.

110
00:08:58,563 --> 00:09:00,093
What are you saying?

111
00:09:00,093 --> 00:09:01,963
I said come inside...

112
00:09:01,963 --> 00:09:03,703
What's wrong with you?

113
00:09:03,703 --> 00:09:05,613
What's with you?

114
00:09:09,053 --> 00:09:11,543
   

115
00:09:11,543 --> 00:09:14,553
When did she sneak this in?

116
00:09:22,163 --> 00:09:23,973
Aren't you going to die after drinking all that?

117
00:09:23,973 --> 00:09:27,603
It would be great, not having to age or earn money.

118
00:09:27,603 --> 00:09:32,293
Gosh, I'm sure our parents would love to hear that.

119
00:09:32,293 --> 00:09:34,703
Abracadabra...

120
00:09:34,703 --> 00:09:37,053
There you go again.

121
00:09:37,053 --> 00:09:38,933
Why? Is something not going well again?

122
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:42,353
What's with the question? As if anything has ever worked out for me.

123
00:09:45,593 --> 00:09:48,453
If you're going to be like that, I wonder if you're better off

124
00:09:48,453 --> 00:09:53,213
flipping all of them and picking the ones you want.

125
00:09:54,043 --> 00:09:55,153
Oh my!

126
00:09:55,153 --> 00:09:58,473
T-This is my first time picking this card.

127
00:09:58,473 --> 00:09:59,783
Hey, hey.

128
00:09:59,783 --> 00:10:03,263
Even from your young perspective, isn't this card beautiful?

129
00:10:03,263 --> 00:10:05,203
What do I do?

130
00:10:05,203 --> 00:10:08,603
I guess I'm finally about to find true love!

131
00:10:10,003 --> 00:10:12,473
10% chance of precipitation...

132
00:10:12,473 --> 00:10:14,103
Okay.

133
00:10:14,103 --> 00:10:17,403
Also, music.

134
00:10:26,373 --> 00:10:28,023
Okay.

135
00:10:37,983 --> 00:10:39,933
One...

136
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:41,753
What are you doing?

137
00:10:42,423 --> 00:10:44,563
Can't you knock?

138
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:48,933
What are you doing in the middle of the night?

139
00:10:49,663 --> 00:10:51,723
What a performance.

140
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:55,683
Hey! What do you think?

141
00:10:55,683 --> 00:10:58,333
Don't you think my shoulders have gotten broader?

142
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:02,263
You might crap your pants.

143
00:11:02,263 --> 00:11:04,083
Look, look.

144
00:11:06,143 --> 00:11:08,163
What do you think?

145
00:11:09,653 --> 00:11:12,773
It does look like they've gotten broader.

146
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:14,293
But...

147
00:11:14,293 --> 00:11:15,233
But?

148
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:17,643
It looks like your face has gotten broader, too.

149
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:19,763
Don't try too hard.

150
00:11:25,283 --> 00:11:27,660
Geez, that little...

151
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,750
   

152
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,760
   

153
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,360
   

154
00:11:40,613 --> 00:11:44,593
   

155
00:11:57,613 --> 00:11:59,523
Boss?

156
00:12:05,343 --> 00:12:06,643
Hey, Part-timer.

157
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,233
Looks like you're in a good mood.

158
00:12:13,743 --> 00:12:19,233
Boss, will our café be okay like this?

159
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:27,703
Part-timer, do you by any chance,

160
00:12:27,703 --> 00:12:29,563
know the name of this building?

161
00:12:29,563 --> 00:12:31,183
I used to know.

162
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:33,963
   

163
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:35,383
Jeongja Building.

164
00:12:35,383 --> 00:12:38,683
I remember it since it's a very impactful name.

165
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:42,563
That's also your name...

166
00:12:42,563 --> 00:12:44,633
My mom named us both.

167
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:48,633
Me... and this building.

168
00:12:49,733 --> 00:12:53,513
So, you're the daughter of the building owner

169
00:12:53,513 --> 00:12:55,563
I had only heard about?

170
00:13:02,693 --> 00:13:04,573
Gosh.

171
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:11,953
Those damn deadlines.

172
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:18,933
Writer Yuri, where are you?

173
00:13:20,773 --> 00:13:22,703
She's not here.

174
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:31,813
You scared me.

175
00:13:31,813 --> 00:13:33,723
What are you doing?

176
00:13:33,723 --> 00:13:36,133
I'm about to hit the deadline,

177
00:13:36,133 --> 00:13:40,733
but I can't think of anything, so I was punishing myself.

178
00:13:41,413 --> 00:13:43,353
Jieun,

179
00:13:44,873 --> 00:13:47,853
I don't think I'm cut out to be a writer.

180
00:13:47,853 --> 00:13:50,943
Gosh, come out already.

181
00:13:50,943 --> 00:13:52,243
What?

182
00:13:52,243 --> 00:13:54,533
An overnight trip?

183
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:57,073
Your friend is barely surviving a deadline,

184
00:13:57,073 --> 00:13:59,463
and you're going on a trip with your boyfriend?

185
00:14:00,293 --> 00:14:02,733
This is why they say it's pointless to have friends.

186
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:05,733
But you know, about the trip...

187
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:09,953
Yunjae seems to be preparing a bunch of stuff.

188
00:14:09,953 --> 00:14:12,373
It feels weird that I'm just showing up.

189
00:14:12,373 --> 00:14:14,493
What's wrong with just showing up?

190
00:14:14,493 --> 00:14:16,273
That's the most important part.

191
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:18,263
What do you mean?

192
00:14:18,263 --> 00:14:20,123
Follow me.

193
00:14:24,753 --> 00:14:27,123
   

194
00:14:28,073 --> 00:14:30,933
What could this be?

195
00:14:30,933 --> 00:14:35,233
You must protect your own body.

196
00:14:36,093 --> 00:14:38,673
Hey! What are you imagining?

197
00:14:38,673 --> 00:14:41,013
We're not like that!

198
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:44,593
Two adults, madly in love with each other, are going on a trip together.

199
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:46,773
Are you 100% sure you won't do it?

200
00:14:46,773 --> 00:14:48,753
As for that, of course─

201
00:14:48,753 --> 00:14:50,833
 The purpose of this trip 

202
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:55,133
 is to stargaze with you all night long. 

203
00:15:01,313 --> 00:15:05,503
It's better to bring it just in case than to regret not having it.

204
00:15:06,293 --> 00:15:08,183
Put it away.

205
00:15:13,233 --> 00:15:14,423
So...

206
00:15:14,423 --> 00:15:17,533
why do you have this? You've been single all your life.

207
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:19,783
I write my will every day.

208
00:15:19,783 --> 00:15:21,993
I might die any day.

209
00:15:21,993 --> 00:15:23,823
Of course, I have a condom.

210
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:27,553
If only you tackled deadlines with that kind of mindset.

211
00:15:28,753 --> 00:15:30,623
Stupid cow.

212
00:15:30,623 --> 00:15:33,003
   

213
00:15:33,003 --> 00:15:35,723
All that fuss, and look what she wrote.

214
00:15:36,793 --> 00:15:41,013
Anyway, Choi Yuri, she has the talent of a devil.

215
00:15:43,183 --> 00:15:46,123
   

216
00:15:52,753 --> 00:15:54,813
Hey, Yunjae.

217
00:15:57,843 --> 00:16:00,933
Where did you get this car?

218
00:16:00,933 --> 00:16:03,833
It's actually my boss's car.

219
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,643
I told her I'm going away with you, and she lent it to me. Wild, right?

220
00:16:06,643 --> 00:16:09,503
Your boss at the café?

221
00:16:09,503 --> 00:16:11,653
But still...

222
00:16:11,653 --> 00:16:15,603
she lent this expensive car to a part-timer for no reason?

223
00:16:15,603 --> 00:16:20,513
You could say it's the result of my constant dedication and effort.

224
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:24,153
Still, what if we scratch it or something?

225
00:16:24,153 --> 00:16:25,393
I'm nervous.

226
00:16:25,393 --> 00:16:27,543
Just trust me.

227
00:16:28,693 --> 00:16:31,543
Plus, nervous or not,

228
00:16:31,543 --> 00:16:35,133
the deal is already done.

229
00:16:35,133 --> 00:16:37,283
 So what if I'm the building owner's daughter? 

230
00:16:37,283 --> 00:16:39,653
 I don't have a man. 

231
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:45,333
 Boss, a building is a hundred times better than a man. 

232
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:48,333
 Really? Then, do you want to have me? 

233
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:52,563
 Having me means having this building, too. 

234
00:16:56,513 --> 00:16:59,163
 There's a guy I know. 

235
00:16:59,163 --> 00:17:01,453
 Is he handsome? 

236
00:17:03,503 --> 00:17:05,273
 This is a photo from five years ago, 

237
00:17:05,273 --> 00:17:07,833
 but he is really good-looking. 

238
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,783
 He's also tall and has whatchamacallit... 

239
00:17:10,783 --> 00:17:13,513
 He seems decent. 

240
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,523
 Boss, the thing is, he's still looking for a job... 

241
00:17:18,523 --> 00:17:20,443
 Tell me his number. 

242
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:25,413
Wow. Your boss is all about looks, too, huh?

243
00:17:25,413 --> 00:17:27,683
Just like my sister.

244
00:17:27,683 --> 00:17:29,673
Right, your sister...

245
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,843
She might be more pressing.

246
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,753
You're right.

247
00:17:38,033 --> 00:17:41,333
Everything will be fine tonight, right?

248
00:17:44,433 --> 00:17:45,543
My sister

249
00:17:45,543 --> 00:17:49,423
downed all the booze last night, and now she's totally knocked out.

250
00:18:03,433 --> 00:18:06,503
Guys, do it inside.

251
00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:15,363
Hello, Nunim.

252
00:18:15,363 --> 00:18:16,983
Are you a pervert?

253
00:18:16,983 --> 00:18:18,353
Why do you keep peeping?

254
00:18:18,353 --> 00:18:22,093
I can't help it. Why don't you take it easy, then?

255
00:18:22,093 --> 00:18:24,843
What? Is that...

256
00:18:24,843 --> 00:18:28,523
a cigarette in your hand? You're smoking again?

257
00:18:28,523 --> 00:18:31,413
I'm going to tell Dad!

258
00:18:31,413 --> 00:18:35,103
It's a cotton swab. A cotton swab.

259
00:18:35,103 --> 00:18:37,213
Gosh, feels good.

260
00:18:37,213 --> 00:18:40,353
Okay, take your time.

261
00:18:43,303 --> 00:18:45,363
Seriously.

262
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,113
Looks delicious.

263
00:20:09,363 --> 00:20:10,373
Have a seat.

264
00:20:10,373 --> 00:20:12,623
What? I thought you were going on a retreat.

265
00:20:12,623 --> 00:20:14,493
What's up with the hair?

266
00:20:14,493 --> 00:20:16,893
What about my hair? Why?

267
00:20:16,893 --> 00:20:20,133
Huh? You're wearing cologne, too?

268
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:22,143
You're suspicious.

269
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:24,533
No. Not suspicious at all.

270
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:26,733
- Definitely suspicious. 
 - Stop yapping.

271
00:20:26,733 --> 00:20:28,623
Let's eat.

272
00:20:28,623 --> 00:20:31,873
Honey, go ahead.

273
00:20:31,873 --> 00:20:33,973
Let's pray.

274
00:20:35,793 --> 00:20:37,863
Our eldest son, Park Yunjae,

275
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:40,803
is going on a trip with his girlfriend today.

276
00:20:40,803 --> 00:20:44,403
My lord, please help him

277
00:20:44,403 --> 00:20:48,603
- have a joyful trip free from any trouble. 
 - Lord...

278
00:20:48,603 --> 00:20:49,993
Amen.

279
00:20:49,993 --> 00:20:51,083
Amen.

280
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,003
No. Dad...

281
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:55,153
Wait, what did you just say?

282
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,033
Let's eat. Eat.

283
00:20:57,033 --> 00:21:00,843
Yuna, did you look into the Web Novel Creation Academy?

284
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,343
Right, I'll look into it later.

285
00:21:02,343 --> 00:21:04,233
Mom, wait.

286
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:07,003
- Listen to me— 
 - Honey, Honey.

287
00:21:07,003 --> 00:21:11,063
The dried pollack soup is so delicious.

288
00:21:12,123 --> 00:21:14,923
Yunjae, eat up so you can have the strength.

289
00:21:14,923 --> 00:21:16,363
Yes, eat up.

290
00:21:16,363 --> 00:21:18,863
Eat the meat. Eat up.

291
00:21:18,863 --> 00:21:21,893
W-Why would I need strength?

292
00:21:21,893 --> 00:21:24,203
- Eat the meat. 
 - Excuse me.

293
00:21:24,203 --> 00:21:25,663
Family.

294
00:21:25,663 --> 00:21:30,073
Dad. Mom. It's not like that. Okay?

295
00:21:30,073 --> 00:21:31,583
I mean...

296
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,603
I'm really going on a retreat!

297
00:22:52,503 --> 00:22:54,503
No way—

298
00:23:06,033 --> 00:23:08,113
What do I do?

299
00:23:11,543 --> 00:23:13,503
All right.

300
00:23:13,503 --> 00:23:15,553
This is a dream.

301
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:29,613
Sorry. I'll be quick.

302
00:23:42,653 --> 00:23:45,683
Hey, your clothes look like they shrunk.

303
00:23:45,683 --> 00:23:48,273
It's all bunched up in your butthole.

304
00:23:48,273 --> 00:23:50,223
Hilarious.

305
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:54,823
I told you to go easy on the dryer.

306
00:23:54,823 --> 00:23:58,333
Oh, you must've gained weight.

307
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:37,713
T-Then, I'm leaving.

308
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:46,423
Who are you? You pervert!

309
00:24:46,423 --> 00:24:48,333
How dare you come in here?

310
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:49,733
You, you, you...

311
00:24:49,733 --> 00:24:51,813
I'll get you.

312
00:24:57,193 --> 00:24:59,453
- It's me! 
 - Let go!

313
00:24:59,453 --> 00:25:01,163
Please let me go.

314
00:25:01,163 --> 00:25:04,673
- I'm telling you, it's me! 
 - Please spare me.

315
00:25:04,673 --> 00:25:07,153
Please spare me.

316
00:25:28,623 --> 00:25:31,223
It's me, Jieun.

317
00:25:31,223 --> 00:25:34,243
Kim Jieun. Your little sibling.

318
00:25:35,653 --> 00:25:38,133
I only have a little sister.

319
00:25:38,133 --> 00:25:41,853
I know. I'm that sister!

320
00:25:41,853 --> 00:25:45,793
Oh, I see. This is a dream. Okay.

321
00:25:45,793 --> 00:25:49,223
Since this is a dream, should we just kiss?

322
00:25:52,253 --> 00:25:55,473
Pull yourself together.

323
00:25:57,903 --> 00:25:59,203
Sis,

324
00:25:59,203 --> 00:26:03,373
I even look like a man to you, too. Right?

325
00:26:03,373 --> 00:26:05,193
"Sis"?

326
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:08,263
Look carefully.

327
00:26:08,263 --> 00:26:10,543
I'm Jieun.

328
00:26:10,543 --> 00:26:12,413
Kim Jieun.

329
00:26:12,413 --> 00:26:14,613
Your little sister.

330
00:26:18,393 --> 00:26:20,643
Ji...

331
00:26:20,643 --> 00:26:22,533
J-Ji...

332
00:26:23,673 --> 00:26:25,783
J-Ji...

333
00:26:31,183 --> 00:26:33,890
J-Jieun. Jieun! I'll help you!

334
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,400
 Hey, Jieun! 

335
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:40,883
 What do we do, Jieun? 

336
00:26:40,883 --> 00:26:43,053
 Jieun! 

337
00:26:46,133 --> 00:26:49,633
You know, since I have been

338
00:26:49,633 --> 00:26:52,993
raised properly by my parents,

339
00:26:52,993 --> 00:26:57,533
I am quietly enduring this ridiculous situation.

340
00:26:57,533 --> 00:27:02,583
But I'm wondering if it's not too late to call the police.

341
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:04,163
Go ahead if you want.

342
00:27:04,163 --> 00:27:07,383
I'm also curious about how things will go.

343
00:27:09,633 --> 00:27:13,023
Could you please close your legs...

344
00:27:19,913 --> 00:27:24,173
Well. Let's be honest. This situation doesn't make sense.

345
00:27:24,173 --> 00:27:26,473
My very average little sister

346
00:27:26,473 --> 00:27:29,033
turned into a hottie like you overnight.

347
00:27:29,033 --> 00:27:32,933
What was the focus of that statement?

348
00:27:32,933 --> 00:27:36,833
The problem is that your average sister turned into a hottie?

349
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:41,203
N-No, that's not what I meant. I was trying to say that...

350
00:27:42,923 --> 00:27:47,113
But why are you speaking to me so casually when we've just met?

351
00:27:53,233 --> 00:27:55,123
W-W-What? Oh, my.

352
00:27:55,123 --> 00:27:57,013
I'll really call the police! I'll report you.

353
00:27:57,013 --> 00:28:00,003
D-Don't come near me! Don't come. I said I'll call.

354
00:28:00,003 --> 00:28:01,183
- Look at this. 
 - I mean it!

355
00:28:01,183 --> 00:28:03,733
Don't come near me. I'll make a report.

356
00:28:03,733 --> 00:28:06,943
- Really. I will. 
 - Kim Jihye, look at this!

357
00:28:21,813 --> 00:28:25,803
 It won't happen, but just in case, like mom and dad said, 

358
00:28:25,803 --> 00:28:28,583
 if something actually happens to us, 

359
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:30,403
 let's show each other these. 

360
00:28:30,403 --> 00:28:32,713
 Once we do that, we’ll prove ourselves to each other 

361
00:28:32,713 --> 00:28:35,183
 and believe in each other, no matter what. 

362
00:28:35,183 --> 00:28:36,673
 Until we return to normal again. 

363
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,363
 But... 

364
00:28:38,363 --> 00:28:41,373
 what if this goes away, too? 

365
00:28:43,603 --> 00:28:45,843
 I hadn't thought about that. 

366
00:28:45,843 --> 00:28:47,953
 We'll think about it when it happens. 

367
00:28:47,953 --> 00:28:49,353
 Got it? 

368
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:50,723
 Sure. 

369
00:28:50,723 --> 00:28:53,403
 - So cute. 
 - Cute. 

370
00:28:58,313 --> 00:28:59,793
Thankfully, this is still here.

371
00:28:59,793 --> 00:29:04,063
W-W-Why is that on your shoulder?

372
00:29:04,063 --> 00:29:05,693
What do I do?

373
00:29:05,693 --> 00:29:08,033
What do I do now?

374
00:29:08,033 --> 00:29:11,943
- This makes no sense... 
 - I kept telling you that it makes no sense!

375
00:29:11,943 --> 00:29:13,543
You're telling me you're really Kim Jieun?

376
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,573
Yes!

377
00:29:24,893 --> 00:29:26,123
Wait a second.

378
00:29:26,123 --> 00:29:28,663
What? What now? Y-You're scaring me.

379
00:29:28,663 --> 00:29:31,453
I can't hold back any longer.

380
00:29:32,183 --> 00:29:36,613
I've been holding back this whole time.

381
00:29:38,663 --> 00:29:41,593
Oh, my gosh! Hey, no way. Really. Not me.

382
00:29:41,593 --> 00:29:44,513
Oh, gosh. Oh, no.

383
00:29:44,513 --> 00:29:47,373
I need to use the bathroom.

384
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:51,963
But... I must have male parts.

385
00:29:51,963 --> 00:29:53,933
I can't look. What do I do?

386
00:29:53,933 --> 00:29:56,293
Can you do something for me?

387
00:29:56,293 --> 00:29:58,133
Y-You must be crazy!

388
00:29:58,133 --> 00:30:00,633
- I need to pee! 
 - Wait!

389
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:02,533
Oh my gosh!

390
00:30:02,533 --> 00:30:05,493
Just pee by yourself. Hey!

391
00:30:13,703 --> 00:30:15,583
Here.

392
00:30:16,263 --> 00:30:18,283
You didn't have to come all this way.

393
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,503
You two have been texting the whole time.

394
00:30:20,503 --> 00:30:22,543
Is Jieun really sick?

395
00:30:22,543 --> 00:30:26,363
Yes, she's really sick. She had medicine and passed out.

396
00:30:26,363 --> 00:30:27,743
But Nunim,

397
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:30,643
I'm really worried because this has never happened before.

398
00:30:30,643 --> 00:30:32,583
Can I see Jieun, even for a little bit?

399
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:36,523
No way. Never. Not over my dead body. No.

400
00:30:40,993 --> 00:30:45,013
I absolutely hate having people in my house.

401
00:30:46,483 --> 00:30:48,183
 It's a hot day. Why don't you continue inside? 

402
00:30:48,183 --> 00:30:50,823
 Guys, do it inside. 

403
00:30:51,863 --> 00:30:54,173
My mood tends to fluctuate.

404
00:30:54,823 --> 00:30:57,953
Anyway, no way, not today.

405
00:31:06,093 --> 00:31:08,563
Drive carefully.

406
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:11,873
- Please! 
 - No way!

407
00:31:11,873 --> 00:31:14,073
- Just a moment. Just once. 
 - No. Seriously. No.

408
00:31:14,073 --> 00:31:16,913
Watch your leg. Watch your leg.

409
00:31:18,803 --> 00:31:20,943
Wear your seatbelt.

410
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:28,573
What do I do?

411
00:31:30,423 --> 00:31:32,583
What do I do...

412
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:38,323
Hey. Here.

413
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:42,363
I bought some things I thought you might need.

414
00:31:45,543 --> 00:31:47,383
Rest up.

415
00:31:51,783 --> 00:31:53,283
   

416
00:31:53,283 --> 00:31:55,663
   

417
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,513
   

418
00:32:01,473 --> 00:32:04,313
   

419
00:32:20,493 --> 00:32:23,243
 I wanted to watch it with you today. 

420
00:32:23,243 --> 00:32:26,053
 I guess we're watching it like this. 

421
00:32:26,053 --> 00:32:29,313
 I'm very worried, and I miss you. 

422
00:32:29,313 --> 00:32:31,373
 I love you. 

423
00:32:38,183 --> 00:32:41,993
♫  I see you  ♫

424
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:46,463
♫  Always, I know more than I see  ♫

425
00:32:46,463 --> 00:32:51,840
♫  It's not a dream, you're growing clearer  ♫

426
00:32:52,933 --> 00:32:56,683
♫  I hear you  ♫

427
00:32:56,683 --> 00:33:01,003
♫  Eyes don’t lie, oh it's you  ♫

428
00:33:01,003 --> 00:33:05,313
♫  Will you remember? I promise you  ♫

429
00:33:05,313 --> 00:33:10,333
♫  In every moment, I'll see you  ♫

430
00:33:48,763 --> 00:33:50,773
 Kim Jieun. 

431
00:33:50,773 --> 00:33:54,853
Hey, at this rate, it's not love. It's a funeral tribute.

432
00:33:54,853 --> 00:33:57,893
You can't keep using sickness as an excuse.

433
00:33:57,893 --> 00:34:01,443
Gosh, do something.

434
00:34:01,443 --> 00:34:04,573
Like, break up with him...

435
00:34:04,573 --> 00:34:06,793
or confess.

436
00:35:35,353 --> 00:35:37,103
   

437
00:35:37,103 --> 00:35:41,863
Guest... Where did you find this?

438
00:35:42,813 --> 00:35:45,443
I asked where you found this?

439
00:35:49,703 --> 00:35:51,293
Yunjae.

440
00:35:51,293 --> 00:35:55,633
You... know me?

441
00:35:57,253 --> 00:36:01,163
I'm sorry, but who are you?

442
00:36:02,603 --> 00:36:04,513
It's me.

443
00:36:04,513 --> 00:36:05,973
Jieun.

444
00:36:05,973 --> 00:36:07,483
What?

445
00:36:11,233 --> 00:36:14,903
I have no idea what you're talking about right now.

446
00:36:14,903 --> 00:36:16,543
I'm...

447
00:36:17,283 --> 00:36:20,433
I'm your girlfriend...

448
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:25,743
Kim Jieun.

449
00:36:49,823 --> 00:36:52,283
   

450
00:37:01,933 --> 00:37:05,053
Except for the fact that I became a man,

451
00:37:05,053 --> 00:37:07,523
nothing has changed.

452
00:37:07,523 --> 00:37:09,733
Except for the fact that you became a man?

453
00:37:09,733 --> 00:37:12,283
- Are you being serious? 
 - What I'm saying is...

454
00:37:12,283 --> 00:37:14,383
only my appearance changed for a moment.

455
00:37:14,383 --> 00:37:17,033
Inside, I’m still 100% Kim Jieun.

456
00:37:19,703 --> 00:37:21,193
Is this a hidden camera prank?

457
00:37:21,193 --> 00:37:22,573
Did Jieun sign up for this?

458
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,903
It's not like that.

459
00:37:24,903 --> 00:37:27,633
I should've told you before something like this happened.

460
00:37:27,633 --> 00:37:30,613
But I couldn't, because I didn't think you would believe me.

461
00:37:30,613 --> 00:37:32,143
Of course not.

462
00:37:32,143 --> 00:37:34,873
What kind of person would believe this?

463
00:37:34,873 --> 00:37:36,803
You might be flabbergasted right now,

464
00:37:36,803 --> 00:37:38,903
but you'll soon understand.

465
00:37:38,903 --> 00:37:41,113
Please try to see it in a positive light.

466
00:37:41,113 --> 00:37:42,473
Positive light?

467
00:37:42,473 --> 00:37:46,703
You told me that you would rather have a normal little brother than a weird little sister.

468
00:37:46,703 --> 00:37:48,503
Think of me as your temporary little brother.

469
00:37:48,503 --> 00:37:51,753
I never said I wanted a normal little brother...

470
00:37:52,573 --> 00:37:53,523
Wait, I did.

471
00:37:53,523 --> 00:37:57,223
See? How would I know that if I weren't your girlfriend?

472
00:37:57,223 --> 00:38:01,053
Ask me anything if you don't believe me. I can answer it all.

473
00:38:01,053 --> 00:38:02,693
We first met on June 7th.

474
00:38:02,693 --> 00:38:04,953
The first flowers you gave me were tulips.

475
00:38:04,953 --> 00:38:06,873
The first café we met at was Dalsenyu.

476
00:38:06,873 --> 00:38:09,333
The place you want to visit the most is the Atacama Desert.

477
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:11,693
And my favorite thing is...

478
00:38:12,863 --> 00:38:15,123
your collarbone.

479
00:38:18,703 --> 00:38:22,723
Even if I have to stay up all night, I'll answer every one of your questions.

480
00:38:26,163 --> 00:38:27,943
There's no way this is happening.

481
00:38:27,943 --> 00:38:30,813
This makes no sense at all.

482
00:38:32,063 --> 00:38:35,453
How dare you? You're a total psycho!

483
00:38:35,453 --> 00:38:36,423
Hey!

484
00:38:36,423 --> 00:38:38,573
Where's Jieun?

485
00:38:38,573 --> 00:38:40,133
I asked, where is Jieun?

486
00:38:40,133 --> 00:38:42,073
Yunjae, calm down and listen to me.

487
00:38:42,073 --> 00:38:43,893
- Let go. 
 - Yunjae...

488
00:38:43,893 --> 00:38:46,383
I said let go, you bastard!

489
00:38:49,733 --> 00:38:50,933
Hey.

490
00:38:50,933 --> 00:38:55,433
In any case, where did you get Jieun's things from?

491
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,463
Are you a stalker?

492
00:38:57,463 --> 00:38:59,543
Get up. Let's go to the police station.

493
00:38:59,543 --> 00:39:03,213
Let's see if you can tell them exactly what you told me.

494
00:39:04,433 --> 00:39:06,333
Fine.

495
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:09,173
I'm willing to go to the police station.

496
00:39:09,173 --> 00:39:11,963
But there's a place for us to visit before that.

497
00:39:17,433 --> 00:39:19,663
So, you're saying...

498
00:39:19,663 --> 00:39:22,203
the tattoo on Jieun's shoulder...

499
00:39:22,203 --> 00:39:25,853
So... that's what it was for?

500
00:39:25,853 --> 00:39:27,723
Proof of identity?

501
00:39:28,503 --> 00:39:30,663
It's passed down genetically on my mom's side.

502
00:39:30,663 --> 00:39:34,123
It's kind of like having high blood pressure or diabetes.

503
00:39:35,913 --> 00:39:38,013
Passed down genetically?

504
00:39:43,503 --> 00:39:46,213
Long story short,

505
00:39:46,213 --> 00:39:48,513
it happened to our mom.

506
00:39:48,513 --> 00:39:53,193
Within her family, it's a hit-or-miss situation.

507
00:39:53,193 --> 00:39:55,483
Depending on your luck, you either get it or you don't.

508
00:39:55,483 --> 00:39:57,783
Turns out, she did.

509
00:40:00,383 --> 00:40:02,323
And I'm supposed to believe this right now?

510
00:40:02,323 --> 00:40:04,863
Of course, you won't believe it. I get it.

511
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:08,443
Honestly, I feel the same way.

512
00:40:08,443 --> 00:40:12,923
The important thing is that we know how this ends.

513
00:40:12,923 --> 00:40:15,003
I'll turn back.

514
00:40:15,003 --> 00:40:17,063
Like my mom.

515
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:36,933
I need time.

516
00:40:36,933 --> 00:40:38,923
As long as you need.

517
00:40:38,923 --> 00:40:41,743
I'll give you as much time as you need.

518
00:40:46,913 --> 00:40:48,813
But...

519
00:40:53,423 --> 00:40:58,383
we're not... ending it like this, right?

520
00:41:12,793 --> 00:41:14,653
Yunjae.

521
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:19,583
Park Yunjae.

522
00:41:21,393 --> 00:41:24,703
Can you please believe me, just this once?

 Excuse me.

00:43:08,563 --> 00:43:11,733
 Are you Park Yunjae? 

538
00:43:11,733 --> 00:43:13,573
 Yes, I am. 

539
00:43:13,573 --> 00:43:15,513
 Who are you? 

540
00:43:16,733 --> 00:43:20,593
 I'm Song Jieun, your blind date today. 

541
00:43:24,803 --> 00:43:29,433
 By chance, are you not Han Yunjae, 

542
00:43:29,433 --> 00:43:31,233
 business major at Yeonhui University? 

543
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:34,843
 No, I'm Park Yunjae, an astronomy major. 

544
00:43:34,843 --> 00:43:37,053
 You're not Song Jieun, an English major? 

545
00:43:37,053 --> 00:43:40,763
 I'm Kim Jieun, a Korean major. 

546
00:43:40,763 --> 00:43:42,473
 I'm sorry. 

547
00:43:42,473 --> 00:43:44,493
 I'm sorry. 

548
00:43:48,393 --> 00:43:51,133
 I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. 

549
00:44:07,233 --> 00:44:15,773
♫  You taught me how to feel with every word  ♫

550
00:44:15,773 --> 00:44:20,733
♫  And every glance we've been through  ♫

551
00:44:20,733 --> 00:44:22,603
 Looking back, 

552
00:44:22,603 --> 00:44:26,453
 every moment I shared with Jieun since the moment we first met 

553
00:44:26,453 --> 00:44:28,713
 was a miracle to me. 

554
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:32,773
 It's different from what you can see with your bare eyes. 

555
00:44:32,773 --> 00:44:34,633
 Up close, 

556
00:44:34,633 --> 00:44:38,550
 it looks and feels very different. 

557
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:49,000
♫  These are... These are the new you  ♫

558

 I see. 

559
00:45:01,733 --> 00:45:05,970
 Up close, it's different. 

560
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:12,523
 How it feels... and how it looks. 

561
00:45:20,643 --> 00:45:25,163
♫  You let me stay  ♫

562

♫  In the place where you belong  ♫

563
00:45:29,093 --> 00:45:31,393
 I must be crazy. 

564
00:45:32,533 --> 00:45:33,873
 I... 

565
00:45:33,873 --> 00:45:37,003
 I don't know why I'm saying this, 

566
00:45:37,003 --> 00:45:41,663
 but you're the first guy I've ever kissed other than my dad. 

567
00:45:43,713 --> 00:45:47,503
 So, what I'm saying is I'm not usually this reckless─ 

568
00:45:49,223 --> 00:45:54,133
♫  Blessed be the time we shared  ♫

569
00:45:55,793 --> 00:46:00,073
 I also don't know why I'm saying this, 

570
00:46:00,073 --> 00:46:02,313
 but it's my first time, too. 

571
00:46:03,083 --> 00:46:05,303
 Having my heart beat this much 

572
00:46:05,303 --> 00:46:10,533
 while looking at something other than stars. 

573
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:14,400
♫  Every day will  ♫

574
00:46:14,473 --> 00:46:24,033
♫  Through every tear, we'll hold on to what we know is near  ♫

575
00:46:24,033 --> 00:46:31,090
♫  'Cause we're intertwined  ♫

576
00:46:33,033 --> 00:46:36,063
♫  Intertwined  ♫

577
00:47:04,683 --> 00:47:07,653
Could this ridiculous incident

578
00:47:07,653 --> 00:47:11,803
be another miracle I experience with Jieun?

579
00:47:28,733 --> 00:47:32,053
- Hello? 
  - Did you get home okay? 

580
00:47:32,053 --> 00:47:33,463
Who is this?

581
00:47:33,463 --> 00:47:35,773
 It's me, Jieun. 

582
00:47:36,523 --> 00:47:39,553
How dare you prank call me?

583
00:47:52,683 --> 00:47:54,123
 Out of all things... 

584
00:47:54,123 --> 00:47:57,493
 I'm actually teaching my girlfriend how to shave? 

585
00:47:57,493 --> 00:47:59,543
 No, this is too much. 

586
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:02,483
 But she might nick her face if she does it wrong. 

587
00:48:04,133 --> 00:48:05,633
Whatever. Whatever.

588
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:08,143
I'll just give it to her, and she'll figure it out.

589
00:48:31,163 --> 00:48:34,173
You don't need to go that far.

590
00:48:36,453 --> 00:48:39,733
Strangely, I'm getting butterflies.

591
00:48:42,563 --> 00:48:45,403
Have you applied the ointment?

592
00:48:47,803 --> 00:48:49,133
Oh, this?

593
00:48:49,133 --> 00:48:51,633
It looks bad but it doesn't hurt.

594
00:48:51,633 --> 00:48:55,133
You should still put on some ointment...

595
00:48:55,133 --> 00:48:56,823
sir.

596
00:48:56,823 --> 00:48:58,773
What if it leaves a scar?

597
00:48:58,773 --> 00:49:00,703
Let it leave a scar.

598
00:49:00,703 --> 00:49:03,533
It's a badge of honor for getting punched by you.

599
00:49:03,533 --> 00:49:04,883
Hey!

600
00:49:04,883 --> 00:49:07,993
Don't say it like that.

601
00:49:07,993 --> 00:49:11,633
- Sir. 
 - Decide if you're going to use honorifics or not.

602
00:49:12,993 --> 00:49:14,273
Okay.

603
00:49:14,273 --> 00:49:16,403
What do I do now?

604
00:49:25,143 --> 00:49:27,743
Lather it on both of your hands

605
00:49:27,743 --> 00:49:30,273
and spread it across your face.

606
00:49:30,273 --> 00:49:31,933
Okay.

607
00:49:31,933 --> 00:49:35,013
From the top to the bottom. Like this.

608
00:49:36,033 --> 00:49:37,173
You're pretty good at this.

609
00:49:37,173 --> 00:49:39,603
This is so much fun.

610
00:49:39,603 --> 00:49:42,073
Don't I look like Santa?

611
00:49:42,073 --> 00:49:44,243
Look at the mirror.

612
00:49:46,633 --> 00:49:48,753
Your razor is beside you, right?

613
00:49:48,753 --> 00:49:50,333
Yeah.

614
00:49:52,413 --> 00:49:54,203
Wipe.

615
00:49:55,133 --> 00:49:56,763
Here.

616
00:49:58,733 --> 00:50:01,943
Gently glide over the foamed areas from the top to the bottom.

617
00:50:01,943 --> 00:50:03,113
Top to bottom?

618
00:50:03,113 --> 00:50:04,973
Gently.

619
00:50:06,063 --> 00:50:07,623
Be more gentle.

620
00:50:07,623 --> 00:50:09,413
A lot more.

621
00:50:09,413 --> 00:50:11,333
Gentle.

622
00:50:12,613 --> 00:50:14,963
I told you to be gentle.

623
00:50:14,963 --> 00:50:16,883
Let me see.

624
00:50:16,883 --> 00:50:18,973
Gosh, you're bleeding.

625
00:50:21,983 --> 00:50:25,743
When it comes to shaving, the angle is important.

626
00:50:25,743 --> 00:50:27,963
I'll show you,

627
00:50:27,963 --> 00:50:30,903
so don't talk and stay still.

628
00:50:30,903 --> 00:50:34,503
- Got it. 
 - I told you not to talk.

629
00:50:40,033 --> 00:50:44,703
Diagonally, from top to bottom. Slowly.

630
00:50:45,483 --> 00:50:47,513
The angle is important.

631
00:50:47,513 --> 00:50:49,593
From the top to the bottom.

632
00:50:49,593 --> 00:50:51,803
Just like this.

633
00:51:20,033 --> 00:51:24,033
Turn your head this way.

634
00:51:25,933 --> 00:51:27,453
Like this?

635
00:51:27,453 --> 00:51:29,033
Yes.

636
00:52:00,903 --> 00:52:03,073
I'll do it.

637
00:52:06,773 --> 00:52:09,093
Okay, here.

638
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:16,783
- Like this? 
 - No.

639
00:52:16,783 --> 00:52:18,863
The angle is a bit...

640
00:52:19,733 --> 00:52:23,153
Like this? Okay.

641
00:52:24,253 --> 00:52:26,523
 Wait a second, 

642
00:52:27,523 --> 00:52:31,353
 why is he so ridiculously good-looking? 

643
00:52:54,353 --> 00:52:55,843
Excuse me.

644
00:52:55,843 --> 00:52:59,063
I'm heading out since we're all done.

645
00:53:01,173 --> 00:53:02,693
You're leaving already?

646
00:53:02,693 --> 00:53:05,583
You only got here 30 minutes ago.

647
00:53:06,833 --> 00:53:09,373
It's dinnertime. I should head out. I also need to get to my part-time shift.

648
00:53:09,373 --> 00:53:11,643
Your evening shift starts at 5:00 p.m.

649
00:53:11,643 --> 00:53:13,713
It's only three right now.

650
00:53:15,033 --> 00:53:17,013
Your sister is also about to get home from work.

651
00:53:17,013 --> 00:53:20,323
My sister went on a business trip to Busan.

652
00:53:22,003 --> 00:53:23,593
I see.

653
00:53:23,593 --> 00:53:27,273
She's usually glued to the house, as if she's part of the decor.

654
00:53:29,363 --> 00:53:32,043
Can't you stay for ramen?

655
00:53:36,453 --> 00:53:38,183
Huh?

656
00:53:38,183 --> 00:53:40,683
Stay and eat.

657
00:53:43,443 --> 00:53:45,783
Stay and eat.

658
00:53:47,333 --> 00:53:50,673
Do you not want to be with me?

659
00:53:50,673 --> 00:53:52,693
Please. Huh?

660
00:53:52,693 --> 00:53:54,333
Please.

661
00:53:54,333 --> 00:53:56,513
- Huh? Pretty please. 
 - I mean...

662
00:53:56,513 --> 00:53:59,293
- I... 
 - Please.

663
00:54:05,133 --> 00:54:08,833
I think I should go today.

664
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:45,200
♫  But looking back, again, I get it, I can make it again, here I go again  ♫

665
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:49,630
♫  But looking back, again  ♫

666
00:55:03,113 --> 00:55:04,463
What in the world?

667
00:55:04,463 --> 00:55:07,373
Your already heavy dark circles are looking even heavier.

668
00:55:07,373 --> 00:55:09,543
What's going on?

669
00:55:09,543 --> 00:55:11,183
Hey, Lee Minhyeok.

670
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:13,313
How would you feel if your girlfriend

671
00:55:13,313 --> 00:55:15,833
suddenly turned into a man?

672
00:55:15,833 --> 00:55:18,833
Hyeong, why would you say such a horrific thing?

673
00:55:18,833 --> 00:55:21,003
On top of that, what if he were better looking,

674
00:55:21,003 --> 00:55:23,133
taller, and stronger than you?

675
00:55:23,133 --> 00:55:25,793
Oh, you're playing the balance game.

676
00:55:25,793 --> 00:55:27,493
Like between a boyfriend that's like a girlfriend

677
00:55:27,493 --> 00:55:29,153
or a girlfriend that's like a boyfriend?

678
00:55:29,153 --> 00:55:32,453
Yeah, it's the balance game. What do you say?

679
00:55:32,453 --> 00:55:34,573
The latter, of course.

680
00:55:34,573 --> 00:55:37,063
You call that a question?

681
00:55:44,373 --> 00:55:46,493
I'm heading out now.

682
00:55:46,493 --> 00:55:48,413
All right.

683
00:55:48,413 --> 00:55:51,283
Oh, right. Hyeong,

684
00:55:51,283 --> 00:55:54,693
I gave it some thought.

685
00:55:54,693 --> 00:55:57,083
If my girlfriend suddenly turned into a man one day,

686
00:55:57,083 --> 00:55:59,523
I would ask her one thing for sure.

687
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:00,843
What?

688
00:56:00,843 --> 00:56:03,933
What caused it?

689
00:56:03,933 --> 00:56:05,963
- What caused it? 
 - That's how it works in fairy tales.

690
00:56:05,963 --> 00:56:08,983
Something like a broken promise, jealousy, or excessive curiosity.

691
00:56:08,983 --> 00:56:11,663
There has to be a cause for the spell.

692
00:56:11,663 --> 00:56:15,763
Once you figure it out, it's only a matter of time before you break the spell.

693
00:56:17,913 --> 00:56:20,783
What caused me to turn into a man?

694
00:56:20,783 --> 00:56:24,383
I'm not sure. There wasn't anything special.

695
00:56:25,833 --> 00:56:27,733
Oh, right.

696
00:56:27,733 --> 00:56:30,533
- The double-yolked egg. 
 - Double-yolked egg?

697
00:56:32,303 --> 00:56:33,213
 Amazing. 

698
00:56:33,213 --> 00:56:35,053
That was the first time.

699
00:56:35,053 --> 00:56:37,703
Seeing a double-yolked egg.

700
00:56:40,573 --> 00:56:42,293
A double-yolked egg...

701
00:56:42,293 --> 00:56:45,773
 If all else fails, there's one last thing to try. 

702
00:56:45,773 --> 00:56:48,073
 Just go in for it. 

703
00:56:48,073 --> 00:56:50,113
 Just go in? 

704
00:56:51,683 --> 00:56:52,883
 A kiss. 

705
00:56:52,883 --> 00:56:54,773
 A kiss. 

706
00:56:56,443 --> 00:56:58,103
 The ultimate cheat key 

707
00:56:58,103 --> 00:57:02,163
 across all cultures and time is a kiss. 

708
00:57:02,163 --> 00:57:05,093
 Of course, you would say that. 

709
00:57:05,093 --> 00:57:07,373
 Kiss? Ridiculous. 

710
00:57:07,373 --> 00:57:10,503
 If you're stuck in a shitty situation like that, just break up. 

711
00:57:10,503 --> 00:57:12,713
 You're racking your brain because you can't break up. 

712
00:57:12,713 --> 00:57:15,543
 So, do something about it! 

713
00:57:21,723 --> 00:57:23,513
 Jelly? 

714
00:57:24,503 --> 00:57:27,333
 I used to be really shy as a kid. 

715
00:57:27,333 --> 00:57:30,133
 But my mom would give me jelly candies 

716
00:57:30,133 --> 00:57:34,933
 telling me that if I ate one whenever I felt nervous, I’d feel better. 

717
00:57:34,933 --> 00:57:37,353
 Maybe it was just a feeling, 

718
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:40,573
 but I really did feel better. 

719
00:57:40,573 --> 00:57:44,723
 You have me now. Shouldn't that mean you don’t need jellies anymore? 

720
00:57:46,123 --> 00:57:48,133
 Excuse me. 

721
00:57:48,133 --> 00:57:52,533
 There's nothing that requires more courage 

722
00:57:52,533 --> 00:57:55,333
 than loving someone. 

723
00:57:55,333 --> 00:57:58,733
 I ate so many jellies while dating you. 

724
00:58:01,993 --> 00:58:05,163
 If I don't want to propose with dentures instead of a ring, 

725
00:58:05,163 --> 00:58:07,813
 I should better step up my game. 

726
00:58:11,153 --> 00:58:13,253
 You're doing more than enough. 

727
00:58:13,253 --> 00:58:16,303
 Just stay as you are. 

728
00:58:16,303 --> 00:58:18,583
 That's all I need. 

729
00:58:26,133 --> 00:58:29,333
   

730
00:58:36,253 --> 00:58:38,143
 Who's there? 

731
00:58:38,143 --> 00:58:39,893
It's me,

732
00:58:39,893 --> 00:58:41,433
Yunjae.

733
00:58:41,433 --> 00:58:43,353
 Yunjae? 

734
00:58:52,653 --> 00:58:53,763
What's up?

735
00:58:53,763 --> 00:58:56,123
What brings you here at this hour?

736
00:58:57,553 --> 00:59:00,693
There's something I have to do right now.

737
00:59:01,783 --> 00:59:03,433
What is it?

738
00:59:03,433 --> 00:59:05,843
What do you need to do?

739
00:59:09,163 --> 00:59:11,373
Let's try using it.

740
00:59:11,373 --> 00:59:13,403
The cheat key.

741
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:48,643
   

742
00:59:54,753 --> 00:59:57,483
I need time.

743
00:59:57,483 --> 00:59:59,483
As long as you need.

744
00:59:59,483 --> 01:00:02,513
I'll give you as much time as you need.

745
01:00:02,513 --> 01:00:04,123
But...

746
01:00:04,123 --> 01:00:09,083
we're not... ending it like this, right?

747
01:00:21,223 --> 01:00:23,093
Yunjae.

748
01:00:26,043 --> 01:00:28,073
Park Yunjae.

749
01:00:29,573 --> 01:00:32,723
Can you please believe me, just this once?

750
01:00:34,093 --> 01:00:36,103
 I couldn't believe it. 

751
01:00:36,103 --> 01:00:39,983
 No, I didn't want to believe it. 

752
01:00:39,983 --> 01:00:42,103
I don't think...

753
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:46,483
I can live without you, not even a single day.

754
01:00:46,483 --> 01:00:49,183
 But I knew at that moment, 

755
01:00:50,913 --> 01:00:53,433
 that the bastard standing in front of me 

756
01:00:53,433 --> 01:00:55,733
 was really my girlfriend, 

757
01:00:55,733 --> 01:00:58,210
 Kim Jieun.

 I'm afraid Yunjae might want to break up.

 Honestly, I don't think we can keep going like we did before.

 - Gosh. 
 - Huge eyes.

 Pale skin. 

773
01:01:56,273 --> 01:01:57,680
 Introduce me. 

774
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:58,613
 Yuri.

 Let me teach you a thing or two.

01:02:07,033 --> 01:02:08,043
 Hello.
