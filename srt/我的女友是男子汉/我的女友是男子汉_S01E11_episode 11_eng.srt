1
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,120
   

2
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,030
   

3
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,660
   

4
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,740
   

5
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,130
   

6
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,590
It's time for you to go.

7
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,210
   

8
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:54,010


9
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:00,880
   

10
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,080
 The call is not going through. You'll be directed to the voicemail. 

11
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,140
 After the beep... 

12
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,520
   

13
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,430
 The call is not going through. You'll be directed to the voicemail. 

14
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,100
   

15
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,510
6734. That's you, isn't it? 
    

16
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,330
Kim Jihun.

17
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,730
6734.

18
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,850
All right.

19
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,870
It's me...

20
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,550
Kim Jihun.

21
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:19,560
   

22
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,060
Yunjae knew all along, didn't he?

23
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,770
Yes.

24
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,220
Even after knowing everything...

25
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,560
It must've been fun for you two to watch me.

26
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,510
Watching me get fooled like an idiot...

27
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,930
It must've been so much fun.

28
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,930
I do feel sorry about that.

29
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,680
Since I knew all too well just how...

30
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,380
you looked at Yunjae.

31
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,810
   

32
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,910
   

33
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,560
Fish-shaped pastry?

34
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,000
Jieun would love some.

35
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,900
- Hello. 
 - Welcome.

36
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,450
I would like a bag of fish-shaped pastries.

37
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,260
Which flavor?

38
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,900
Red bean for all of them.

39
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,300
But can you put only a small amount of red bean filling in them?

40
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,260
Only a small amount of red bean? Why?

41
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,840
My girlfriend doesn't really like red bean.

42
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,460
How strange.

43
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,810
Should I just leave the red bean out then?

44
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,300
Would that be okay?

45
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,600
- Please do that, then. 
 - It'll be the same price, though.

46
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,780
Park Yunjae.

47
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,430
I brought some fish-shaped pastries.

48
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,280
I bought a lot, so share them with your sister.

49
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,960
Okay.

50
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,890
You're leaving?

51
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,210
I'd better.

52
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,600
My sister is working late tonight.

53
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,790
- Won't you come in? 
 - You should've said so earlier!

54
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,890
I'm so cold.

55
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,630
There are really no red beans in them.

56
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,130
I asked her to leave them out.

57
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,500
But you like red beans.

58
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,900
I like watching you enjoy them more.

59
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,130
Here.

60
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,300
- Tasty? 
 - It's pretty good.

61
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,010
By the way...

62
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,510
Kang Minju found out about everything.

63
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,080
About what?

64
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,530
That I'm Kim Jihun.

65
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,230
How so?

66
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,410
She somehow found out.

67
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,480
I see.

68
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,500
I promise to live a good life from now on.

69
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,800
I will be grateful for everything I took for granted.

70
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,600
So, please let me continue living as Kim Jieun.

71
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,300
Please?

72
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,310
I'm in trouble, aren't I?

73
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,100
What am I supposed to do?

74
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,920
What else? You should eat the fish-shaped pastry.

75
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,370
Here. Say, "Ah."

76
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,020
Me, too.

77
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,740
Yummy.

78
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,480
Oh, right. Did you submit the paperwork to Corning University?

79
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,010
Huh?

80
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,860
Of course.

81
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:54,550
I'm getting chills imagining you studying there...

82
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,530
because you look so cool.

83
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,810
I want to stay by your side,

84
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,320
but since it's your wish,

85
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,880
I'll live up to it.

86
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,010
So cool.

87
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,120
It's getting too late.

88
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,440
I'm going now. Go to sleep.

89
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,110
Come on. I am sleepy,

90
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,070
but I don't want you to go.

91
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,650
I'll stay until you've fallen asleep.

92
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,840
- Really? 
 - Yes.

93
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,960
- Close your eyes already. 
 - Okay.

94
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,800
Got it.

95
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,350
Gosh.

96
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,700
It is 3:00 a.m.

97
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:14,200
This slave, Kim Jihye, is finally home from work.

98
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,400
This slave is heading back to work.

99
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,750
I dozed off.

100
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,070
What?

101
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,100
She just prayed and fell asleep.

102
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,100
This is too much.

103
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,970
Yunjae.

104
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,110
- You're awake. 
 - Yeah.

105
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,230
What time is it?

106
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,430
I transformed again?

107
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,500
Is this a dream or real?

108
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,440
What do you want it to be?

109
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,790
Dream.

110
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:20,140
I also wish this were a dream.

111
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,510
So you're saying a female acquaintance became a man overnight.

112
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,300
Am I understanding this correctly?

113
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,840
Yes. How many times do I have to tell you?

114
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,550
I saw it with my own eyes.

115
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,270
Excessive stress

116
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:44,260
and sensory overload. Environmental triggers like these

117
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:48,300
can temporarily disrupt the brain's normal functions.

118
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,400
Are you saying I'm abnormal right now?

119
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:57,000
Well, no one goes from being a woman to a man overnight.

120
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,530
But you can make a full recovery through therapy and treatment—

121
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,380
Gosh. Forget it.

122
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,790
I didn't come all this way to hear this nonsense.

123
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,610
I should've just asked AI instead.

124
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,400
Yunjae.

125
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,570
I need to talk to you.

126
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,700
You must've heard that I know everything now.

127
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,950
Yeah.

128
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,400
I even went to see a therapist just now.

129
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,890
The therapist said that my brain is functioning abnormally.

130
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,340
Are you okay?

131
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,110
Can you really date someone whose gender changes?

132
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,630
Are you totally okay with that?

133
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:54,450
Maybe it's because I have to be someone who's okay with it.

134
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm okay.

135
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,020
Why do you have to be okay?

136
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,730
That's how I can protect Jieun.

137
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:17,300
Hey. I hope you don't tell other people.

138
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,700
No one would believe me anyway.

139
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,350
Plus, even if you didn't ask me,

140
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,830
I'm not interested in weaponizing someone else's weakness.

141
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:49,810
Yuri.

142
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,330
Is she okay?

143
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,480
No, she's not okay.

144
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,700
Don't leave her alone.

145
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,100
Oh my. I'm running late.

146
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,800
- I'll get going. 
 - Okay.

147
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,260
Hey!

148
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,500
I knew you would be like this.

149
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,500
- What? 
 - Gosh, stop wallowing.

150
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,600
Hey. Isn't it about time you got used to it?

151
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,460
Try going through it. To see if you can get used to it.

152
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,870
I would've gotten used to it early on.

153
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,130
I would've hunted down the bitches who bullied me,

154
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,650
seduced them, ditched them,

155
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,370
and lived down a cathartic revenge drama.

156
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,280
That's so you.

157
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,800
Let's go outside.

158
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,100
- I don't want to. 
 - What's the point of being here like this?

159
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,400
- Let's go out. 
 - I said I don't want to.

160
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,240
What's up with you?

161
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,600
Are you crazy? Hey.

162
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,000
- Let's go. Let's go out! 
 - I said no!

163
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,310
Run.

164
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,210
Run until you're out of breath.

165
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:06,460
Run until you feel like you're going to die.

166
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,040
Just like that!

167
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,790
You're so fast.

168
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,370
♫  Open your eyes  ♫

169
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:30,090
♫  This moment I dreamed about  ♫

170
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,870
♫  Will be remembered, for you  ♫

171
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,290
♫  I'm always with you  ♫

172
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,270
 Yunjae. 

173
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,480
 I'm sorry, but who are you? 

174
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,980
 I'm your girlfriend... 

175
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,500
 Kim Jieun. 

176
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,550
 A person... 

177
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:54,620
 can't just... change overnight. 

178
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,590
 But... 

179
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,300
 Mom... but... 

180
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,200
 I feel most apprehensive around you. 

181
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,260
 - What? 
 - I said I'm most apprehensive around you. 

182
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,420
♫  Just like yesterday, I long for you  ♫

183
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,990
 I had no idea I made you feel that way. 

184
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:20,440
 I also wish this were a dream. 

185
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,760
♫  The warmth that drifts through my fingertips  ♫

186
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,740
♫  Your heart, clearly felt  ♫

187
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,760
♫  Is not anxious  ♫

188
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,470
♫  It is calling out for me  ♫

189
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,050
♫  Open your eyes  ♫

190
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:43,810
♫  This moment I dreamed about  ♫

191
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:50,340
♫  Will be remembered, for you, I'm always with you  ♫

192
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,040
♫  I see your eyes  ♫

193
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,740
♫  Even the tears filled to the brim  ♫

194
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,560
♫  Will be no more  ♫

195
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,050
♫  So, believe me now  ♫

196
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:09,190
♫  Open your eyes  ♫

197
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,730
Here.

198
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,100
Do you feel better now?

199
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,690
Yeah, thanks to you.

200
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,730
I was able to organize a lot of my thoughts.

201
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,690
My mood is also much better.

202
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:30,960
By the way, Jieun.

203
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,290
You'll be switching back and forth for the rest of your life, right?

204
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,200
It seems like it.

205
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,700
I can't be sure about anything on that front.

206
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,750
Then,

207
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,660
don't you think you should approach your situation differently?

208
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,350
How?

209
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,830
Is Park Yunjae all there is to your life?

210
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,630
That's not true.

211
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,560
Before, when you became a man and Park Yunjae stood by your side,

212
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,350
I was grateful and relieved.

213
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,350
But if you have to live like this for the rest of your life,

214
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:09,350
I think Park Yunjae will be the one

215
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:12,550
who stops you from being resilient.

216
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:19,440
I could also be the one who stops Yunjae from being resilient.

217
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,400
Cheer up, friend.

218
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,380
I support whatever decision you make.

219
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,120
Should I do the penis fish dance for you?

220
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,770
Next time. Thanks.

221
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,000
 Teacher, can I give you a call if you have time? 

222
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,820
Are you crazy?

223
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,690
You really won't go?

224
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,640
No, I won't go.

225
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,950
Is it because of Kim Jieun?

226
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,510
Yeah.

227
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,880
Was your dream this easy to discard?

228
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,650
Do you realize what you threw away?

229
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,600
I know.

230
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,940
Oppa, I... seriously, this is not jealousy or envy.

231
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,510
I'm asking you seriously.

232
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:49,500
Do you think of Kim Jieun and Kim Jihun as the same?

233
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,000
Yeah.

234
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,700
I mean, can you love them both the same?

235
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,160
You must be shocked that I called you without notice.

236
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,000
No, it's okay.

237
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,400
I felt bad that I quit tutoring so suddenly.

238
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:29,700
Teacher, you saw the photo I took of Yuna's report card, right?

239
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,120
I can't believe her grades shot up in only the subjects you tutored her in.

240
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,040
Yuna followed along nicely.

241
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:47,600
Teacher, there's only a month left until her college entrance exam.

242
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,250
Could you tutor her just one more month?

243
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,720
Pardon?

244
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,200
Well, that's...

245
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,400
Teacher, I'm begging you.

246
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,700
I'm begging you. Please?

247
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,900
Just... Just one month.

248
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,600
- Gosh, ma'am. 
 - Mr. Kim!

249
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,500
This might be hard to believe, but this is the first time

250
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,600
Yuna's grades have improved since she was born.

251
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,720
All right. I got it.

252
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,850
Thank you. Thank you!

253
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,200
My Lord!

254
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,950
Thank you!

255
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,260
Oh my.

256
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,100
Gosh.

257
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,690
What are you doing there?

258
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,900
How did he teach Yuna that her grades improved?

259
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,750
I'm so curious.

260
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,750
Gosh, seriously.

261
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,320
What...

262
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:17,730
Now that we're here, let's do our best until the end.

263
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,500
You two fought, didn't you?

264
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,080
Huh?

265
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,110
No.

266
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,550
What will happen to the two of you when my brother goes to the US?

267
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,040
Huh?

268
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,500
Yuna, your mom is around.

269
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,470
Even if she hears, my mom is so close-minded

270
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,230
that she would never think of that.

271
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,660
Park Yunjae and you?

272
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,370
Gosh, no way. No way!

273
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,400
Still.

274
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,300
You should follow him to the US.

275
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:55,030
Over there, you can be free and see each other as a couple.

276
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,220
Hold hands, too.

277
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,620
They say, "Out of sight, out of mind."

278
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,300
W-W-What's wrong?

279
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,800
- Mom! 
 - Ma'am!

280
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,560
What...

281
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:16,600
did I just hear?

282
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,300
- Oh my! 
 - Mom! Mom!

283
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,700
Let go. Let go, let go!

284
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,910
Sit up and drink water.

285
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,330
Gosh.

286
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,350
Oppa.

287
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,900
Mom.

288
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:09,660
Do you two... really have that kind of relationship?

289
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,360
Is that right?

290
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,040
I see.

291
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,980
Let's say it's true.

292
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:22,330
Is that why he started tutoring Yuna?

293
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,850
Fooling all of us?

294
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,900
The other day, when our house was turned upside down.

295
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,040
That time, you sent Yuna out,

296
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,400
and the two of you, in the house...

297
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,200
Gosh, my gosh!

298
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,600
- Mom. 
 - My gosh!

299
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,000
Let me send off Jihun first.

300
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,600
- Park Yunjae! 
 - Geez.

301
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,270
Mom.

302
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,090
Let's go.

303
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:13,730
My god! What do we do?

304
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,770
 Mom! Mom! 

305
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,450
- Hurry inside. 
 - Don't worry.

306
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,700
I'll deal with it.

307
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,430
Let's go.

308
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,240
Go where?

309
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,520
Hurry back inside.

310
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:50,700
I'm sorry, but please go inside.

311
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,700
Why are you crying?

312
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,640
Yunjae,

313
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,640
I think we underestimated everything.

314
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,560
Jieun...

315
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,780
Hurry back inside.

316
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,870
 Kim Jieun! 

317
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,820
How did you hide it all this time?

318
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,220
Why did you call me over?

319
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,070
I don't really want to talk to you.

320
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,270
Same here.

321
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,940
So, why did you call me?

322
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:26,010
Did you know that Yunjae is not going to Corning University?

323
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:28,180
What are you talking about?

324
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,500
He definitely said he applied.

325
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,430
He told the professor today that he won't go.

326
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:36,430
He can't go due to personal circumstances.

327
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:40,150
Don't you think you're being selfish?

328
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:44,340
How long will you hold onto Yunjae for your own benefit?

329
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,160
The astronomy department at Corning University

330
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,970
is a dream for people like us.

331
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:52,170
He missed that opportunity because of you.

332
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,100
I'll...

333
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:02,260
I'll tell Yunjae to go, no matter what.

334
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:05,480
He missed the deadline already. So, how?

335
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:11,400
Do you think this was the only opportunity Yunjae missed because of you?

336
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,620
Have you thought about the ones he'll miss in the future?

337
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:19,570
If you really love Yunjae, please let him go.

338
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:22,430
I'll take care of it from there on.

339
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,040
Sit.

340
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,530
Are you okay?

341
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:18,040
That's something I should be asking you.

342
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,380
How did it go?

343
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,680
I'm okay.

344
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,800
I'm completely fine.

345
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:32,580
But... my mom is still upset.

346
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,290
How are you completely fine?

347
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,090
That's because... it's me.

348
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:47,140
How come everything is always fine?

349
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,960
I heard you're not going to Corning University.

350
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,960
How did you find out?

351
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,360
That's not important right now.

352
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,410
You're not going because of me.

353
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:07,600
How can I leave you when I saw you change right in my lap?

354
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,700
Why can't you go?

355
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,550
Will it kill me?

356
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,180
It's not that, so why can't you go?

357
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:17,310
It's not that I can't go. I choose not to go.

358
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,660
I don't want to go.

359
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,140
How much more pathetic will you make me?

360
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,490
I already hate that I'm shamelessly glued to your side.

361
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:37,990
I'm ruining your dream and your family.

362
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,940
Ruin?

363
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,550
Nothing has been ruined.

364
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,820
Park Yunjae,

365
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,340
I need you to do me a favor.

366
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,760
Break up with me.

367
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,840
What?

368
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,990
That again?

369
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:18,170
This is too hard for me to bear.

370
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:23,310
I can't help it if you think I'm being selfish,

371
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,490
or even if you think I'm being cowardly.

372
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,990
Park Yunjae,

373
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:40,820
I'm not as happy...

374
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,450
as I used to be with you.

375
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,840
Hey.

376
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,540
Kim Jieun.

377
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:57,480
Let's please break up this time.

378
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,840
Please.

379
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,640
I'm begging you.

380
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:28,700
♫  Even when it hurts so much I can't even walk  ♫

381
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:33,900
♫  Even when the tears cloud my vision  ♫

382
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:42,960
♫  I'll smile in front of my love, whom I can't have  ♫

383
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,800
♫  The happy memories of us together  ♫

384
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:55,700
♫  Even the short ones, I'll treasure them with my heart  ♫

385
00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:02,800
♫  Like the stars embroidered in my eyes  ♫

386
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:11,060
♫  I won't cry today  ♫

387
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:16,600
♫  Even if the tears fill my eyes  ♫

388
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:24,870
♫  Like the stars over there, I will smile  ♫

389
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:37,910
♫  I'll treasure all of the happy memories with my heart  ♫

390
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:45,320
♫  Like the stars embroidered in my eyes  ♫

391
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,170
♫  Forever  ♫

392
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,000
I'm home.

393
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,020
You're home?

394
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,230
Your mom's on a strike. I did my best.

395
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,820
Okay.

396
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:32,330
Have you eaten?

397
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:34,420
- Yes. 
 - If you didn't, how about some udon?

398
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:38,440
Dad, I'm tired.

399
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,380
I'm sorry.

400
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,030
Okay.

401
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:51,340
Yunjae.

402
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,600
You are responsible for your life.

403
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,600
If you can take responsibility for it, live however you want.

404
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:12,700
Rest up.

405
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,990
Hey.

406
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,000
An amazing chicken feet spot opened up in front of my office.

407
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,400
Should we sisters go for some drinks?

408
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,980
Or do you want to watch a movie?

409
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,250
I heard a really good one came out.

410
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,810
No, no.

411
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:24,100
Let's go to Eurwangni and eat some grilled clams.

412
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,090
That sounds good, right?

413
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,720
Sis,

414
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,400
I'll stay at Yuri's place for a while.

415
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,350
Well, sure.

416
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,520
Do what makes you comfortable.

417
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,600
Don't use my stuff just because I'm not around.

418
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,300
Gosh. Why don't you lock up your room, then?

419
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,370
Jieun,

420
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:08,700
your sister loves you very, very, very much.

421
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,650
I'm cheering you on.

422
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,840
What are you doing? So cringe.

423
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,020
Gosh, acting all shy.

424
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,300
Dress warmly.

425
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,330
What do you want?

426
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:53,480
Do you remember saying

427
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,480
that you’d take care of him if I broke up with him?

428
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:59,000
Yes.

429
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,610
I broke up with Yunjae.

430
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,130
Really?

431
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,210
You two broke up?

432
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:12,650
Yes.

433
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:16,000
So, I was wondering.

434
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,620
Is there no way Yunjae can go to Corning University?

435
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,030
I told you the deadline passed.

436
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,400
Still, I'll look into it.

437
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:36,800
Thanks.

438
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,780
Here.

439
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,870
My sister doesn't like spicy food.

440
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:53,900
Take care.

441
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,000
Wait, are you going somewhere?

442
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:01,220
Stop getting into my business now.

443
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,920
Gosh.

444
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,620
Here.

445
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,900
So, when did you start writing?

446
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,400
I told you. You've got talent.

447
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,510
I'm just giving it a try.

448
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,900
Like you said, I'm trying out a different approach to my situation.

449
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,380
Good thinking.

450
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,820
Who's that?

451
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:08,960
Huh? Minhyeok.

452
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,760
Fried chicken!

453
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,880
Jihun.

454
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,090
Hey, Minhyeok.

455
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:24,580
When did you get back from the US?

456
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:27,460
I was so sad when you suddenly disappeared.

457
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,250
What's the deal?

458
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:35,190
But... why are you here, Hyeong?

459
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:38,730
Due to some circumstances, we decided to live together.

460
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:41,800
Live here? The two of you? Together?

461
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,900
Oh, yes. I have some circumstances.

462
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,900
So temporarily...

463
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:52,500
Hyeong, my place is better than here. Let's go.

464
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:58,800
You might be best friends, but this is not right, as a grown man and woman.

465
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,600
Let's go to my place. It'll be more comfortable to live with a guy.

466
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:05,700
- Wait, but the thing is... 
 - No way!

467
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,400
No! That can't be.

468
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:16,060
Nuna, do you really not know why I'm doing this?

469
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,500
Huh?

470
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:25,010
The thing is...

471
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,840
   

472
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,290
Kim Jihye, seriously...

473
00:41:04,993 --> 00:41:07,865
- Hey, buddy! 
 - Kim Jihye,

474
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:08,799
what's all this?

475
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:12,300
 Wow, you already got the delivery? 

476
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,200
I thought I'd send over some small gifts to cheer up my friend,

477
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,500
who's about to take an exam.

478
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,750
I thought I was clear about how I felt.

479
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,360
I told you not to do stuff like this.

480
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,500
Well, you told me not to confess my feelings.

481
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,630
I didn't hear you say that I can't send you stuff like this.

482
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:31,240
Next time, I'll hit you up with something different.

483
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,270
Bye! Ta-ta!

484
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:35,890
Hey!

485
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:56,000
What? She still had this?

486
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:01,100
 Our friendship will last a hundred million years! 

487
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,820
 Hey! You startled me! 

488
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:09,530
You skipped class and ignored my calls.

489
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:11,500
What are you doing here?

490
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:15,800
Oh, right. We had class.

491
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,270
Seriously.

492
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:22,130
Do you have to make it so obvious that you just went through a breakup?

493
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,560
How did you know?

494
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,350
That's not important.

495
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:33,200
I'm on my way back from speaking with the professor.

496
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:38,330
It might be possible for you to apply to Corning University again.

497
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:40,250
What?

498
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,300
What are you talking about?

499
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:46,600
Professor O'Connor was quite disheartened after hearing that you were not going.

500
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:54,610
Rather than staying under the same sky,

501
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:57,160
focusing on something else elsewhere

502
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,040
might make the breakup a little easier.

503
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:03,420
It's ultimately your choice, Oppa.

504
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,650
Give it some thought.

505
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:20,500
Hyeong, did you know that Jihun is back in Korea?

506
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,150
- You saw him? 
 - Yeah.

507
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:25,800
He was at Yuri's.

508
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,460
They may be best friends,

509
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:31,600
but it doesn't make sense for a grown man and a woman to live together.

510
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:34,530
Is he doing okay?

511
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:36,100
Jihun?

512
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,800
Yeah. He looked like he was doing well.

513
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,500
Oh, right. I heard he's preparing for some kind of contest.

514
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:46,800
According to Yuri, he's working at least four times harder than she does.

515
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:53,080
I was worried that she'd be like me, for no reason.

516
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,900
   

517
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:05,700
 I'm not as happy as I used to be with you. 

518
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,350
 Hey. 

519
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:09,880
 Kim Jieun. 

520
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,860
 Let's please break up this time. 

521
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:17,400
 Please. 

522
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,960
 I'm begging you. 

523
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:27,420
   

524
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:48,640
Jeongja!

525
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,910
I still had this with me.

526
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:57,740
Oh, I'm sorry.

527
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:00,300
I should've picked it up sooner.

528
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,200
By the way, since you had a lot to drink

529
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,700
and I was flabbergasted, I didn't get to ask.

530
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:13,000
Why do you not want to see me anymore?

531
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,910
At first, thanks to you, I felt like I was being a good son.

532
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:22,900
I was grateful.

533
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:25,990
But?

534
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:33,400
At some point, I found myself relying on you more and more.

535
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,290
Do that. Rely on me.

536
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:38,810
Do that all you want.

537
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:42,400
No.

538
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:48,100
I want to live relying on myself from now on.

539
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:51,360
But if you're by my side,

540
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,090
I don't think I'd ever be able to.

541
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,820
I'm sorry for being selfish until the very end.

542
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:06,200
You shouldn't be sorry that you're selfish until the end.

543
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:10,060
You're selfish for being sorry until the end.

544
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:13,140
I can't hang onto someone

545
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,960
who's been sorry from the beginning to the end.

546
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,400
I hope you grow up all on your own.

547
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:55,670
I'm sorry I made the situation complicated, Professor.

548
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:01,200
You won't change your mind this time, will you?

549
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:05,350
No. I really want to go to Corning University.

550
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,090
Great.

551
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,340
Oppa.

552
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:20,780
Let's go.

553
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:30,000
You made the right decision. Cheers.

554
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,140
- I quit drinking. 
 - Huh? Why?

555
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:35,380
Just because.

556
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:39,540
- I don't want to slip up. 
 - Slip up?

557
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:43,070
Never mind, I don't need to know.

558
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,760
But I need to drink tonight.

559
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,350
Cheers.

560
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,210
Oppa, let me know if I can help you with anything

561
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:05,300
as you prepare for Corning.

562
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,180
Sure. I will.

563
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:10,160
Thanks.

564
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:16,170
Everything will get better once you go there.

565
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:18,030
Just trust me.

566
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,380
I hope so.

567
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,210
Gosh, seriously,

568
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:34,600
It's about time you cheered up!

569
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,580
What? What's wrong with me?

570
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:40,100
I'm totally fine.

571
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:44,000
Sure. Just get drunk. That'll be better.

572
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,370
Drink up.

573
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:58,800
Come on.

574
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,280
- Are you 100 kilograms? 
 - Second round!

575
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,810
Second round, my foot!

576
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:03,350
Second round!

577
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:04,400
That's a coffee shop.

578
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,530
Second round over there.

579
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:07,600
Hey!

580
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:11,170
Park Yunjae, get yourself together.

581
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:12,780
I'm not drunk.

582
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:14,900
I got it, so please!

583
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:18,360
Minju, I'm serious. I'm really not drunk!

584
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,800
I said I got it.

585
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:23,380
I'm seriously... not okay.

586
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:25,380
Oh my.

587
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:28,490
Jieun.

588
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:34,150
I'm seriously not okay!

589
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,490
Jieun!

590
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:39,090
Jieun!

591
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:41,420
Jieun!

592
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:48,870
If only I didn't have a crush on him,

593
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:52,530
I would've punched him in the face!

594
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,810
- I'm going home. 
 - What?

595
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:57,000
Going home.

596
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,340
Oppa! Can you really get home by yourself?

597
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:03,780
Do you want me to take you home? Huh?

598
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,980
I'm okay.

599
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:10,380
No problem.

600
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,000
- Can I get a lift? 
 - Look at him.

601
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,900
Gosh.

602
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,990
- Bye! 
 - Seriously.

603
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:28,100
Whatever.

604
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:40,190
Wow.

605
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,800
You're driving me crazy.

606
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,000
Oh, gosh.

607
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:17,190
Yunjae.

608
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:19,060
Get up, Oppa.

609
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:23,170
Yunjae, get up. Get yourself together.

610
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:25,110
Yunjae.

611
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:28,590
Let's go. Get up.

612
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:30,620
Two, three.

613
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,920
Wait a—

614
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,860
Just a second.

615
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:42,560
Oppa!

616
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:47,120
So tired.

617
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:53,600
Oh my.

618
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,700
Take it off.

619
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,440
Gosh.

620
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:30,860
You dummy.

621
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:36,200
Well? Who's calling whom a dummy?

622
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:40,800
When I have a crush on a guy who can't get over a girlfriend

623
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,080
who switches genders.

624
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,950
Jieun.

625
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:02,760
This is the worst, Park Yunjae.

626
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:51,600
Hey.

627
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:55,200
- So, what happened is... 
 - No need to explain.

628
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,210
No need?

629
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,620
No.

630
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:11,370
We're nothing to each other now.

631
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:43,980
Right.

632
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:49,860
You and I...

633
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:54,870
We're nothing to each other now.

If you let her sleep without transforming,

I, Park Yunjae,

652
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:05,090

 ~ Preview ~ 

663
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:11,570
 Jieun, 

664
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:12,930
 do you really want me to go? 

665
01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:14,800
 Just drink instead. 

666
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,500
 Tonight at 9:20. Hana Airlines. 

667
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:20,500
 Goodbye, Park Yunjae. 

668
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,930
 Didn't you just hear something? 

669
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:25,390
 For some reason, you always barge in when Minhyeok is here. 

670
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:26,640
 You two are dating, aren't you? 

671
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,090
 - Yes. 
 - No. 

672
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:29,220
 We're not? 

673
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:31,320
 You can start working today, right? 

674
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:33,100
 I'll do my best. 

675
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,680
 Excuse me, Guest? 

676
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:40,900
