2
00:00:12,863 --> 00:00:15,813
   

3
00:00:21,293 --> 00:00:24,373
   

4
00:00:26,513 --> 00:00:29,513
   

5
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:36,303

 Timing and Subtitles by the 
 "(S)he is the one" team @Viki.com 

7
00:00:53,173 --> 00:00:55,493
No way.

8
00:00:56,873 --> 00:00:59,303
It's really Jieun.

9
00:01:17,793 --> 00:01:19,543
Jieun.

10
00:01:20,323 --> 00:01:22,103
Jieun.

11
00:01:30,543 --> 00:01:32,643
She's burning up.

12
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:47,433
What are you doing?

13
00:01:57,933 --> 00:01:59,683
Minhyeok, I'll explain everything later.

14
00:01:59,683 --> 00:02:01,393
I'm sorry!

15
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:07,123
Are you Kim Jieun's guardian?

16
00:02:07,123 --> 00:02:09,173
- Yes. 
 - Yes, Kim Jieun...

17
00:02:09,173 --> 00:02:12,443
Her bloodwork and CT scan look normal.

18
00:02:12,443 --> 00:02:15,183
There are no particular concerns.

19
00:02:15,183 --> 00:02:17,013
Since she got an IV and her fever went down,

20
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:20,193
she may be discharged when she wakes up.

21
00:02:20,193 --> 00:02:22,993
Excuse me, Doctor. There's nothing wrong with her, right?

22
00:02:22,993 --> 00:02:25,273
Yes. She's fine.

23
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,973
Jieun, are you awake?

24
00:02:29,973 --> 00:02:31,863
Yunjae?

25
00:02:39,813 --> 00:02:43,193
Why am I at the hospital?

26
00:02:44,483 --> 00:02:47,893
Jieun, it's over.

27
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:51,793
You're a girl again!

28
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,333
Huh?

29
00:03:03,563 --> 00:03:06,563
Nurse, arrange for a psychiatric evaluation.

30
00:03:06,563 --> 00:03:09,733
Am I really a girl? Really?

31
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:12,053
Doctor, thank you.

32
00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:13,343
Thank you.

33
00:03:13,343 --> 00:03:15,563
Congratulations.

34
00:03:15,563 --> 00:03:17,373
Jieun...

35
00:03:19,673 --> 00:03:24,523
I'm really a girl again! My gosh! 
    

36
00:03:24,523 --> 00:03:27,283
 I haven't told my sister yet. She'll be so surprised. 

37
00:03:27,283 --> 00:03:29,733
 Even I can't believe it yet. 

38
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:32,143
 Neither can you, right, Yunjae? 

39
00:03:33,893 --> 00:03:37,203
But... why aren't you saying anything?

40
00:03:38,173 --> 00:03:40,033
What? Wait.

41
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:41,933
I think your screen is frozen.

42
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:43,283
I'll call you back later.

43
00:03:43,283 --> 00:03:46,303
 No. It's not frozen. 

44
00:03:47,183 --> 00:03:49,913
What? What is going on? You're being weird.

45
00:03:49,913 --> 00:03:53,093
I'm so happy just looking at you.

46
00:03:53,093 --> 00:03:55,823
But we were just together.

47
00:03:55,823 --> 00:03:57,233
No.

48
00:03:57,233 --> 00:04:00,073
I get it. I totally get it.

49
00:04:02,103 --> 00:04:04,623
 Oppa, can I come in? 

50
00:04:04,623 --> 00:04:05,823
One second.

51
00:04:05,823 --> 00:04:09,083
- I'll call you back later. 
  - Oh, sure. 

52
00:04:10,653 --> 00:04:13,073
Hey, come on in.

53
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:16,023
Wow.

54
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:18,493
Do you finally know what a knock means?

55
00:04:18,493 --> 00:04:20,413
What is going on?

56
00:04:21,203 --> 00:04:23,923
Who were you talking to? You're grinning big.

57
00:04:23,923 --> 00:04:26,263
Why do you want to know?

58
00:04:26,263 --> 00:04:31,413
Because... I'm your one and only little sister?

59
00:04:33,243 --> 00:04:35,313
Oppa, you know...

60
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:40,383
No matter what kind of love you choose, I'll understand.

61
00:04:40,383 --> 00:04:44,083
- What? 
 - There is no such thing as "wrong" love.

62
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,503
Just love that's different.

63
00:04:45,503 --> 00:04:48,343
Are you on something?

64
00:04:50,593 --> 00:04:53,203
I'm sorry I never picked up on it before.

65
00:04:53,203 --> 00:04:55,663
Hey, let me go! Let go.

66
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:57,123
Oppa, be strong!

67
00:04:57,123 --> 00:04:58,373
Be strong!

68
00:04:58,373 --> 00:05:00,783
Hey! Let me go, I said!

69
00:05:00,783 --> 00:05:03,023
Hey! Let me go, I said!

70
00:05:03,023 --> 00:05:04,683
Jihye.

71
00:05:07,673 --> 00:05:10,333
- Hey. 
 - You're so mean.

72
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,553
- Here you go. 
 - I thought I wasn't invited.

73
00:05:13,553 --> 00:05:15,133
No way.

74
00:05:15,133 --> 00:05:16,933
- You picked this venue? 
 - The parking is great there.

75
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:19,593
Parking space is important.

76
00:05:21,373 --> 00:05:23,013
So...

77
00:05:23,013 --> 00:05:25,533
Jihye, are you seeing anyone?

78
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,883
Right. Havenâ€™t you been resting a little too long? You have to consider your age.

79
00:05:28,883 --> 00:05:32,743
I feel bad giving you a bouquet when you're not even seeing anyone.

80
00:05:35,383 --> 00:05:38,463
I am seeing someone.

81
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,231
- Really? 
 - Yes.

82
00:05:40,231 --> 00:05:42,563
- Of course. 
 - I can't seem to believe you.

83
00:05:42,563 --> 00:05:44,903
Show us a picture.

84
00:05:44,903 --> 00:05:47,783
Have you been lied to all your lives?

85
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:55,553
- A picture? 
 - Yes.

86
00:05:56,353 --> 00:05:58,173
Right.

87
00:06:01,213 --> 00:06:02,913
Here it is.

88
00:06:06,323 --> 00:06:07,923
What?

89
00:06:25,943 --> 00:06:28,623
He looks like an idol. How old is he? When did you meet him?

90
00:06:28,623 --> 00:06:31,303
We've known each other for a while, but...

91
00:06:31,303 --> 00:06:33,073
it somehow happened.

92
00:06:33,073 --> 00:06:34,523
Amazing.

93
00:06:34,523 --> 00:06:37,263
Kim Jihye, I was unfamiliar with your game.

94
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:41,733
- But why don't you have any pictures together? 
 - Smart.

95
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:45,863
I don't like getting my picture taken.

96
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,393
That's suspicious.

97
00:06:47,393 --> 00:06:49,333
- Call him. 
 - Huh?

98
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,743
That's right, call him.

99
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,003
Just make it a video call.

100
00:06:53,003 --> 00:06:55,123
Video call sounds good.

101
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,083
Video call?

102
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,373
Just a minute.

103
00:07:00,373 --> 00:07:01,973
Let me ask.

104
00:07:01,973 --> 00:07:03,563
Sure.

105
00:07:03,563 --> 00:07:05,673
Go ahead, eat.

106
00:07:05,673 --> 00:07:07,873
Where are you going for your honeymoon?

107
00:07:07,873 --> 00:07:08,863
Africa. 
    

108
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:11,113
Africa?

109
00:07:11,113 --> 00:07:12,663
That suits you. 
    

110
00:07:12,663 --> 00:07:15,433
But why Africa?

111
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:17,693
Don't you know? Many go to Africa these days.

112
00:07:17,693 --> 00:07:20,133
  - Do you want to do a video call?   
 - Oh, really?

113
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:22,583
- You didn't go? 
 - We didn't go.

114
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,063
I'm getting a call! 
     

115
00:07:24,063 --> 00:07:25,883
Here.

116
00:07:29,223 --> 00:07:32,423
Honey, I told you I'm meeting my college friends today.

117
00:07:32,423 --> 00:07:33,663
Say hi.

118
00:07:33,663 --> 00:07:35,493
 - Hello! 
 - Ta-da! 

119
00:07:35,493 --> 00:07:36,633
 I'm back! 

120
00:07:36,633 --> 00:07:39,433
 I'm a girl again! 

121
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:40,763
Give that to me.

122
00:07:40,763 --> 00:07:43,693
 I can't believe it, but I'm so happy. 

123
00:07:43,693 --> 00:07:47,643
 Just now, I almost cried while I was peeing. 

124
00:07:47,643 --> 00:07:51,103
 Eonni, it was tough living in the same house, huh? 

125
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:52,903
 I'll be good to you. 

126
00:07:52,903 --> 00:07:54,343
 I love you! 

127
00:07:54,343 --> 00:07:56,173
 Bye! 

128
00:07:58,363 --> 00:07:59,733
This girl...

129
00:07:59,733 --> 00:08:03,033
T-This must be a new kind of voice phishing.

130
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:05,013
Right, guys?

131
00:08:12,023 --> 00:08:13,903
That was so shocking.

132
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,473
 Eonni! Cutie Jieun is back! 

133
00:08:28,473 --> 00:08:31,393
 Get lost! 

134
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:14,413
   

135
00:09:18,773 --> 00:09:21,363
We talked all night.

136
00:09:31,943 --> 00:09:36,403
 I'm taking a bath right now, so it'll be difficult to take a video call. 

137
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:02,053
Thank you!

138
00:10:02,053 --> 00:10:04,093
Thank you.

139
00:10:17,663 --> 00:10:18,963
Thank you!

140
00:10:18,963 --> 00:10:20,963
Thank you!

141
00:10:26,253 --> 00:10:28,033
Okay.

142
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:30,893
Come. Bring it on.

143
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:48,833
- What's up? 
 - Just hold for three seconds.

144
00:10:53,413 --> 00:10:57,573
If you're satisfied, get out of my way.

145
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:00,513
I knew God was real.

146
00:11:00,513 --> 00:11:03,803
I'll believe everything people say from now on.

147
00:11:03,803 --> 00:11:07,023
God, Buddha, aliens, conspiracy theories, everything.

148
00:11:07,023 --> 00:11:09,733
Sure, it's better to believe than not to believe.

149
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:12,733
Do you even remember being a guy?

150
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:15,593
What? Do I remember you glancing at me up and down every day?

151
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:16,733
When did I do that?

152
00:11:16,733 --> 00:11:21,773
You just didn't touch. You undressed me with your eyes many times.

153
00:11:21,773 --> 00:11:24,053
Gosh, seriously.

154
00:11:24,053 --> 00:11:26,023
Wow! Come on.

155
00:11:26,023 --> 00:11:28,213
When did I ever?

156
00:11:28,213 --> 00:11:29,863
Seriously?

157
00:11:29,863 --> 00:11:32,953
For real? Gosh.

158
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:36,983
Hey, Yeongseok. Thank you.

159
00:11:36,983 --> 00:11:39,293
- Did you eat? 
 - I'm about to.

160
00:11:39,293 --> 00:11:41,123
Thank you.

161
00:11:42,593 --> 00:11:44,983
Hello.

162
00:11:44,983 --> 00:11:46,293
Long time no see.

163
00:11:46,293 --> 00:11:48,673
Bye, see you later.

164
00:11:48,673 --> 00:11:50,153
Hello, ma'am.

165
00:11:50,153 --> 00:11:51,703
- Hi, Oppa. 
 - Hi, hi.

166
00:11:51,703 --> 00:11:53,993
Goodness, Yeongseok. Have a yogurt.

167
00:11:53,993 --> 00:11:56,613
Goodness, thank you. You didn't have to, but thank you.

168
00:11:56,613 --> 00:11:58,583
- Bye. 
 - See you.

169
00:12:01,433 --> 00:12:03,063
Hey! No, it's okay.

170
00:12:03,063 --> 00:12:05,563
It's okay. Gosh, it's okay.

171
00:12:05,563 --> 00:12:07,433
I said it's okay.

172
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:12,363
Just leave the heavy stuff. I'll get it when I come by.

173
00:12:12,363 --> 00:12:14,653
You should think about getting out of here!

174
00:12:14,653 --> 00:12:17,573
For how long will you come by? Do you like me that much?

175
00:12:17,573 --> 00:12:19,093
Wow.

176
00:12:19,093 --> 00:12:20,333
Just you wait and see.

177
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:24,033
This is the last year you'll see me in the alleys of Noryangjin.

178
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:26,473
Gosh, you said that last year.

179
00:12:26,473 --> 00:12:28,853
The year before that, and the year before, and the year before that.

180
00:12:28,853 --> 00:12:30,643
You said the same thing.

181
00:12:30,643 --> 00:12:32,633
How can you be so consistent?

182
00:12:32,633 --> 00:12:36,343
Sit down. I'll fry you a pork cutlet.

183
00:12:36,343 --> 00:12:38,303
I'll do that.

184
00:12:46,753 --> 00:12:48,133
Yes, Jeongja.

185
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:50,813
No, I'm about to eat.

186
00:12:51,543 --> 00:12:53,023
You're in Noryangjin?

187
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:55,133
   

188
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:57,033
Here you go.

189
00:13:02,753 --> 00:13:04,333
Oh.

190
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,733
I'll drink this.

191
00:13:12,273 --> 00:13:15,313
Do you normally not drink?

192
00:13:15,313 --> 00:13:18,033
It gets in the way of my studies,

193
00:13:18,033 --> 00:13:21,233
- so I just stopped drinking. 
 - I see.

194
00:13:22,023 --> 00:13:24,963
You said you've been studying for the civil servant exam for 10 years?

195
00:13:24,963 --> 00:13:27,523
To be exact, seven years and 8 months.

196
00:13:27,523 --> 00:13:30,553
This year, I intend to pass.

197
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:36,673
Yeong Seok, you live a hardworking life

198
00:13:36,673 --> 00:13:39,083
with goals and determination.

199
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,063
I'm jealous.

200
00:13:42,713 --> 00:13:46,413
Are you indirectly trying to say that I'm pathetic?

201
00:13:46,413 --> 00:13:49,093
Even I can't do it.

202
00:13:52,993 --> 00:13:55,893
I'm jealous of people who live their lives to the fullest.

203
00:13:55,893 --> 00:13:59,433
That's a talent and a skill of its own.

204
00:13:59,433 --> 00:14:04,033
I have never once lived a hardworking life.

205
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:07,713
Except for when I drink.

206
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:16,433
Eat while you drink. Otherwise, you'll damage your stomach.

207
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:22,023
Have you always been so nice to anyone?

208
00:14:22,023 --> 00:14:25,033
We went on a blind date. You're not just "anyone."

209
00:14:25,033 --> 00:14:27,773
A blind date is not a big deal.

210
00:14:29,233 --> 00:14:32,143
It wasn't even your first blind date.

211
00:14:32,143 --> 00:14:34,343
You're not even young.

212
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,463
I'll leave it at "no comment".

213
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,083
If you have no comment on this,

214
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,973
I'll get a little scared.

215
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,683
Oh, wait.

216
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:01,833
From now on, I'll fill the glasses.

217
00:15:09,813 --> 00:15:12,093
Sure, go ahead.

218
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:18,853
Do you like... braised spicy angler?

219
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,753
My goodness.

220
00:15:26,753 --> 00:15:28,553
Gosh.

221
00:15:29,823 --> 00:15:31,783
Oh, it stinks!

222
00:15:31,783 --> 00:15:34,163
I can't believe the state of the fridge of two young women.

223
00:15:34,163 --> 00:15:38,293
Mom, isn't it impolite to open someone else's fridge?

224
00:15:38,293 --> 00:15:39,713
Right.

225
00:15:39,713 --> 00:15:41,793
Someone else's?

226
00:15:41,793 --> 00:15:43,673
Someone else's?

227
00:15:43,673 --> 00:15:45,363
You took 22 hours,

228
00:15:45,363 --> 00:15:48,593
and you took 15 hours during labor. "Someone else's"?

229
00:15:48,593 --> 00:15:52,233
Eonni, how can you say it like that?

230
00:15:52,233 --> 00:15:54,323
- What? 
 - Anyway...

231
00:15:54,323 --> 00:15:55,403
- Honey. 
 - Yeah?

232
00:15:55,403 --> 00:15:57,673
- Start over here. 
 - Okay.

233
00:15:59,513 --> 00:16:03,123
- I'll get started on the bathroom. 
 - Sure.

234
00:16:03,123 --> 00:16:04,643
Gosh.

235
00:16:04,643 --> 00:16:06,393
Geez.

236
00:16:12,653 --> 00:16:15,283
- Dad! 
 - Dad.

237
00:16:17,713 --> 00:16:20,493
You should be neater. You're all grown up, Princesses!

238
00:16:20,493 --> 00:16:23,653
You should've told us you were coming! We would've cleaned.

239
00:16:23,653 --> 00:16:26,663
That's why I didn't. So I could do it for you.

240
00:16:26,663 --> 00:16:29,743
I missed you so much, Dad!

241
00:16:29,743 --> 00:16:31,133
You're staying the night, right?

242
00:16:31,133 --> 00:16:32,673
It's your day off.

243
00:16:32,673 --> 00:16:34,843
I want to, but...

244
00:16:34,843 --> 00:16:37,723
we have an appointment this afternoon. We have to open the salon.

245
00:16:37,723 --> 00:16:39,173
Tell Mom to go by herself.

246
00:16:39,173 --> 00:16:40,373
- Should I? 
  - Yes!  

247
00:16:40,373 --> 00:16:43,213
- What would you even do there? 
 - Right?

248
00:16:43,213 --> 00:16:45,353
Stop everything!

249
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,673
What?

250
00:17:03,673 --> 00:17:05,543
We're grown-ups now.

251
00:17:05,543 --> 00:17:09,053
We're adults. This kind of thing could happen.

252
00:17:09,053 --> 00:17:10,993
It could.

253
00:17:10,993 --> 00:17:13,393
Yes, it could.

254
00:17:13,393 --> 00:17:16,633
But I need to know what man has the audacity

255
00:17:17,763 --> 00:17:22,253
to shave and leave his underwear behind at my daughters' house.

256
00:17:22,253 --> 00:17:24,803
Is it the guy all over your room?

257
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:27,683
No!

258
00:17:27,683 --> 00:17:31,133
Yunjae is very innocent!

259
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,933
So, it's you.

260
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:34,573
Who is it?

261
00:17:35,403 --> 00:17:38,433
Since it has come to this, let's just tell her.

262
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,803
- No, no... 
 - What is it?

263
00:17:40,803 --> 00:17:42,043
Tell me now.

264
00:17:42,043 --> 00:17:43,723
Mom...

265
00:17:43,723 --> 00:17:45,823
Actually, what happened is...

266
00:17:45,823 --> 00:17:48,943
a little while ago, she wasâ”€

267
00:17:51,263 --> 00:17:54,703
It belongs to Eonni's boyfriend!

268
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,853
- R-Really? 
 - Yes!

269
00:17:57,853 --> 00:18:00,973
It's really your boyfriend's?

270
00:18:00,973 --> 00:18:02,803
Boyfriend?

271
00:18:03,643 --> 00:18:06,683
Since it has come to this, show them a picture.

272
00:18:06,683 --> 00:18:08,203
You seemed to have a ton on your phone.

273
00:18:08,203 --> 00:18:12,283
Yes. Let's see my eldest daughter's boyfriend's face.

274
00:18:12,283 --> 00:18:15,403
I never got to see it. I'm so curious.

275
00:18:20,513 --> 00:18:23,173
If I see that kind of thing again,

276
00:18:23,173 --> 00:18:25,063
then...

277
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,333
tell him to come back after booking a wedding venue.

278
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,603
Eat well.

279
00:18:28,603 --> 00:18:31,193
If something happens, call me.

280
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:35,123
Don't forget to bring back the glass tupperware.

281
00:18:35,883 --> 00:18:37,533
Jihye.

282
00:18:49,683 --> 00:18:51,393
Open the door while I ask you nicely.

283
00:18:51,393 --> 00:18:53,383
It's better than making them worry!

284
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:55,283
Then, say it was your boyfriend's! Why sell me out?

285
00:18:55,283 --> 00:18:57,453
Because I can't taint Yunjae's image!

286
00:18:57,453 --> 00:19:00,183
And it's okay to taint mine? Open the door now!

287
00:19:00,183 --> 00:19:02,663
Who told you to take those pictures? It's your karma!

288
00:19:02,663 --> 00:19:04,863
- What's with you? 
 - W-W-What?

289
00:19:04,863 --> 00:19:06,433
Hey!

290
00:19:06,433 --> 00:19:10,533
Wow, you've gotten strong ever since you became a guy.

291
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:13,023
- Please stop it. 
 - Fine, okay.

292
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,443
- One more time. 
 - Ow! Stop it!

293
00:19:15,443 --> 00:19:19,803
Mom! She's so strong, what do I do?

294
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,633
Why aren't you honest and tell our parents?

295
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:33,943
- About what? 
 - That you turned into a guy.

296
00:19:33,943 --> 00:19:37,753
You turned back into a girl anyway, so it doesn't matter.

297
00:19:45,753 --> 00:19:48,723
 I would rather go through it again myself if I have to. 

298
00:19:49,763 --> 00:19:52,393
 But not our kids, Honey. 

299
00:20:04,283 --> 00:20:07,703
I'm not telling them because I turned back.

300
00:20:07,703 --> 00:20:10,543
No need to make them worry about past stuff.

301
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,253
It'll never happen again anyway.

302
00:20:19,073 --> 00:20:21,063
W-What's going on?

303
00:20:22,553 --> 00:20:24,143
Ta-da!

304
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:28,153
Look closely.

305
00:20:28,153 --> 00:20:30,573
This is the last time.

306
00:20:33,993 --> 00:20:35,903
Penis fish!

307
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:37,963
Penis fish!

308
00:20:37,963 --> 00:20:40,633
Penis fish!

309
00:20:40,633 --> 00:20:42,623
Crazy bitch.

310
00:20:50,173 --> 00:20:51,933
Together!

311
00:21:00,933 --> 00:21:04,803
Our boss... Could she be a conglomerate's daughter?

312
00:21:04,803 --> 00:21:08,333
Or a divorcee who walked away with a fortune?

313
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,733
- What? 
 - I mean, it makes no sense.

314
00:21:11,733 --> 00:21:14,873
She only sits around at her own store, then spends money elsewhere.

315
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:17,103
She doesn't care how her store does.

316
00:21:17,103 --> 00:21:19,483
- But she owns designer clothes and a sports car. 
 - Hey.

317
00:21:19,483 --> 00:21:21,913
We're part-timers. We just need to get paid on time.

318
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:24,963
Don't be so curious about those things.

319
00:21:24,963 --> 00:21:29,423
Or maybe... does she own the building?

320
00:21:29,423 --> 00:21:31,783
The daughter of the building owner?

321
00:21:31,783 --> 00:21:35,293
S-Stop with the maybes. Let's just work.

322
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:37,833
We have nothing to do.

323
00:21:46,053 --> 00:21:48,833
 I won't get another double-yolked egg, right? 

324
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,663
 - I'm kind of scared.  
 - Maybe?

325
00:21:51,663 --> 00:21:54,113
"Maybe" is a dangerous word.

326
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:57,923
She might actually be the owner of the building.

327
00:21:57,923 --> 00:21:59,833
"Maybe"...

328
00:22:00,363 --> 00:22:02,173
is a dangerous word.

329
00:22:02,173 --> 00:22:04,023
No way.

330
00:22:04,863 --> 00:22:07,063
What if another double-yolked egg turns her into a guy again?

331
00:22:07,063 --> 00:22:09,933
 I cracked open an egg for the ramen. 

332
00:22:09,933 --> 00:22:12,753
 But it was a double-yolked egg again. 

333
00:22:12,753 --> 00:22:14,643
 So... 

334
00:22:16,723 --> 00:22:19,543
 I turned into a guy again. 

335
00:22:21,613 --> 00:22:24,433
 Yunjae, are you okay? 

336
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,393
You're coming now?

337
00:22:28,393 --> 00:22:30,623
I thought you were at work.

338
00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:37,453
Yeah. I'll be right there. Just wait.

339
00:22:37,453 --> 00:22:40,283
I'll bring a ton of food, so don't eat anything else.

340
00:22:40,283 --> 00:22:43,823
Tteokbokki, blood sausage, and dumplings. Once of each to go.

341
00:23:21,973 --> 00:23:24,623
I thought flour wasn't good for you.

342
00:23:24,623 --> 00:23:27,763
Are the dumplings and tteokbokki not made of flour?

343
00:23:29,623 --> 00:23:33,283
Oh, this is made out of rice.

344
00:23:33,283 --> 00:23:36,923
As for the dumplings, you can just eat the fillings.

345
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,983
Look at you sweating.

346
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:46,333
Dummy.

347
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:51,043
There's no way I turned into a guy because of an egg.

348
00:23:51,043 --> 00:23:52,943
You caught that?

349
00:23:54,003 --> 00:23:58,543
When I was a guy, was it that horrendous for you?

350
00:23:58,543 --> 00:24:02,643
I had fun after we became friends.

351
00:24:02,643 --> 00:24:05,583
Rather than horrendous, it was...

352
00:24:07,273 --> 00:24:09,423
never mind.

353
00:24:09,423 --> 00:24:11,243
I'm sorry.

354
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:17,613
It's okay. I'm more sorry.

355
00:24:17,613 --> 00:24:19,313
Thank you.

356
00:24:19,313 --> 00:24:21,373
I love you.

357
00:24:55,543 --> 00:25:00,533
â™«  'Cause I love you, I'll say it to you  â™«

358
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:04,570
â™«  I'll express my fluttering heart  â™«

359
00:25:05,533 --> 00:25:09,403
 That day, the two of us 

360
00:25:09,403 --> 00:25:12,123
 couldn't find a way to close the gap 

361
00:25:12,123 --> 00:25:14,343
 between our past and present selves. 

362
00:25:14,343 --> 00:25:17,313
 So, we just held each other and kissed. 

363
00:25:19,113 --> 00:25:21,173
 I found myself yearning 

364
00:25:21,173 --> 00:25:25,290
 for the short but powerful memories of the past. 

365
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,813
 But thankfully it didn't last long. 

366
00:25:27,813 --> 00:25:30,033
 As a result, we can remember it as a comma, 

367
00:25:30,033 --> 00:25:32,383
 and not a period between the two of us. 

368
00:25:32,383 --> 00:25:34,803
 We reassured each other of that. 

369
00:25:34,803 --> 00:25:37,163
 We didn't even fathom... 

370
00:25:37,163 --> 00:25:38,533
Good night.

371
00:25:38,533 --> 00:25:43,643
  - just how many things awaited us in the future.
 - just how many things awaited us in the future. 

372
00:25:43,643 --> 00:25:48,593
â™«  You're so lovey, oh, dovey, lovable  â™«

373
00:25:48,593 --> 00:25:50,353
Yeah.

374
00:25:50,353 --> 00:25:52,003
How I feel?

375
00:25:52,003 --> 00:25:53,903
I'm all right.

376
00:25:54,683 --> 00:25:56,883
I'm almost there.

377
00:25:56,883 --> 00:25:58,473
Yeah.

378
00:26:00,313 --> 00:26:02,133
Oppa!

379
00:26:02,993 --> 00:26:05,433
- I missed you. 
 - Hey!

380
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:07,933
- When did you get back to Korea? 
 - A week ago.

381
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:10,533
- Have you been well? 
 - Yes! I missed you.

382
00:26:10,533 --> 00:26:13,083
I was planning to call you.

383
00:26:14,143 --> 00:26:16,833
What are you doing today? Todayâ€”

384
00:26:18,033 --> 00:26:20,443
- You made it. 
 - Hey.

385
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,543
Who is this?

386
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,163
Ah. Say hello.

387
00:26:28,163 --> 00:26:29,733
My girlfriend, Kim Jieun.

388
00:26:29,733 --> 00:26:32,333
This is a junior in my major, Kang Minju.

389
00:26:33,163 --> 00:26:35,493
- Hi, I'm Kim Jieunâ€” 
 - Oppa,

390
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:38,353
you got a girlfriend while I was gone?

391
00:26:38,353 --> 00:26:41,533
You couldn't wait a year while I was an exchange student?

392
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:45,233
Is that true?

393
00:26:45,233 --> 00:26:49,163
- No. 
 - I called dibs on you to everyone.

394
00:26:49,163 --> 00:26:51,413
How could you do that?

395
00:26:51,413 --> 00:26:53,103
Hey.

396
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:56,323
Called dibs?

397
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,343
What do you mean?

398
00:26:58,343 --> 00:27:01,663
You know we have a meeting for our major on Friday, right?

399
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:04,913
We're also having a welcome party for me, so you have to come.

400
00:27:04,913 --> 00:27:06,883
It's at the Star Club in front of Yeonhui University.

401
00:27:06,883 --> 00:27:10,293
If you don't come, I'll call you until you do.

402
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:14,133
- A club? 
 - Huh?

403
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:18,493
It's an astronomy major gathering, so...

404
00:27:18,493 --> 00:27:21,643
Are you a criminal? Why are you so flustered?

405
00:27:22,553 --> 00:27:25,963
If you have time, you should come, too.

406
00:27:25,963 --> 00:27:29,493
I'm not sure if you would like it, though.

407
00:27:38,593 --> 00:27:42,013
That was top secret information for our major.

408
00:27:42,013 --> 00:27:44,183
So I'll see you on Friday.

409
00:27:55,303 --> 00:27:56,843
Jieun!

410
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:59,023
Jieun!

411
00:27:59,023 --> 00:28:00,933
Jieun!

412
00:28:00,933 --> 00:28:03,533
 Jieun! Jieun! 

413
00:28:03,533 --> 00:28:05,893
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

414
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:07,833
- Let go! 
 - You're not okay.

415
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:09,433
I don't know why that happened, but...

416
00:28:09,433 --> 00:28:11,603
- Minju. Minju. 
 - Wait.

417
00:28:11,603 --> 00:28:14,613
Is she really Yunjae's girlfriend?

418
00:28:14,613 --> 00:28:16,423
- Yeah, it's been a while. 
 - Forget it!

419
00:28:16,423 --> 00:28:18,673
He only hangs out with her.

420
00:28:18,673 --> 00:28:21,833
- So, it's real? 
 - Yes.

421
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:25,033
- Forget it. 
 - Jieun...

422
00:28:25,033 --> 00:28:27,943
Oh yeah, you said you didn't want to go clubbing on Friday. Right?

423
00:28:27,943 --> 00:28:29,663
And that a welcome party was burdensome.

424
00:28:29,663 --> 00:28:31,933
Then, want to go see a musical with me?

425
00:28:31,933 --> 00:28:35,633
Who said I didn't want to go? I'm definitely going.

426
00:28:35,633 --> 00:28:38,373
- You just said... 
 - I changed my mind.

427
00:28:38,373 --> 00:28:41,223
I suddenly really want to go.

428
00:28:45,693 --> 00:28:49,443
I'm going to get all dolled up, so you have to come.

429
00:28:50,153 --> 00:28:51,763
Okay.

430
00:28:57,723 --> 00:28:59,343
Jieun.

431
00:28:59,343 --> 00:29:01,543
Just drink a beer.

432
00:29:01,543 --> 00:29:06,213
My dad said I shouldn't drink when I'm upset.

433
00:29:06,213 --> 00:29:08,563
What was that secret?

434
00:29:08,563 --> 00:29:10,003
Oh, that...

435
00:29:10,003 --> 00:29:12,983
I didn't really hear it, because I was so taken aback.

436
00:29:12,983 --> 00:29:14,923
Don't worry about it.

437
00:29:17,743 --> 00:29:19,233
Could I get a half pint of beer?

438
00:29:19,233 --> 00:29:22,413
- Actually, a full one. 
 - Wow, this looks amazing!

439
00:29:22,413 --> 00:29:25,813
Here's a drumstick. Enjoy.

440
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,983
Some girl calls dibs on you. You go ahead and just eat.

441
00:29:30,983 --> 00:29:32,333
Hey!

442
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:35,503
How does a Korean major like you not understand idioms?

443
00:29:35,503 --> 00:29:36,933
She didn't literally calls dibs on me.

444
00:29:36,933 --> 00:29:39,363
So there was something.

445
00:29:39,363 --> 00:29:40,663
I mean...

446
00:29:40,663 --> 00:29:42,463
She has always been the type to make jokes,

447
00:29:42,463 --> 00:29:44,503
and gets along with everyone.

448
00:29:44,503 --> 00:29:49,013
She's just social. She's definitely not a bad personâ€”

449
00:29:49,013 --> 00:29:51,233
Are you taking her side in front of me?

450
00:29:51,233 --> 00:29:54,823
Jieun, I have a weak heart. Be gentle.

451
00:29:54,823 --> 00:29:57,183
- Gentle. 
 - So?

452
00:29:57,183 --> 00:29:58,903
You're going clubbing on Friday?

453
00:29:58,903 --> 00:30:01,433
No. I'm not going.

454
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:03,583
If you tell me not to, I could even not go to heaven.

455
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:05,273
No. Please go.

456
00:30:05,273 --> 00:30:07,013
You have to go clubbing on Friday.

457
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,843
Got it?

458
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,083
This one?

459
00:30:36,523 --> 00:30:38,583
What are you doing?

460
00:30:41,963 --> 00:30:43,743
Ta-da!

461
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,343
Why? Is it bad?

462
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,843
How about this?

463
00:30:54,843 --> 00:30:55,853
No.

464
00:30:55,853 --> 00:30:57,723
Not this one either?

465
00:30:57,723 --> 00:30:59,743
No.

466
00:30:59,743 --> 00:31:01,350
This one?

467
00:31:04,033 --> 00:31:07,433
Why am I thinking of a bath?

468
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:10,063
Do you have to go clubbing?

469
00:31:10,063 --> 00:31:12,003
A bath?

470
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,920
What about this one?

471
00:31:15,793 --> 00:31:18,373
What is wrong with you?

472
00:31:18,373 --> 00:31:20,433
Hey, Eonni.

473
00:31:20,433 --> 00:31:22,033
Eonni.

474
00:31:22,873 --> 00:31:25,573
Pass! Seriously, stop it.

475
00:31:25,573 --> 00:31:28,243
Hey, Kim Jihye. Look!

476
00:31:28,243 --> 00:31:30,233
This is hell. Stop it.

477
00:31:30,233 --> 00:31:31,370
Darn it!

478
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:35,520
â™«  I'm lost, not knowing where to go  â™«

479
00:31:35,523 --> 00:31:36,703
Eonni.

480
00:31:36,703 --> 00:31:39,040
I said stop it.

481
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,570
â™«  Like a star in the sky  â™«

482
00:31:42,573 --> 00:31:44,073
What do you think?

483
00:31:44,073 --> 00:31:45,663
Hey.

484
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,813
Simple is best.

485
00:31:48,813 --> 00:31:50,533
This looks the best on you.

486
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:53,233
- Do I look okay? 
 - Come here.

487
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,580
Lips.

488
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:04,603
Not bad.

489
00:32:04,603 --> 00:32:05,653
Thank you.

490
00:32:05,653 --> 00:32:07,383
Go now.

491
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,833
You're all dead.

492
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:13,453
 Your call is not going through. 

493
00:32:15,423 --> 00:32:17,380
Oppa!

494
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,373
Oppa!

495
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:24,343
- Hey. 
 - Oppa, you made it.

496
00:32:24,343 --> 00:32:25,733
I knew you would come.

497
00:32:25,733 --> 00:32:27,013
- Yeah. 
 - Let's go inside.

498
00:32:27,013 --> 00:32:28,583
Everyone is waiting.

499
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:33,463
Actually, we made a bet. Whether you would come or not.

500
00:32:33,463 --> 00:32:35,713
- Only I said you would come. 
 - Hey.

501
00:32:35,713 --> 00:32:38,733
We'll get to drink for free all night. Let's go.

502
00:32:38,733 --> 00:32:43,683
Wait. I'll go inside when my girlfriend gets here.

503
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,473
Your girlfriend is coming?

504
00:32:47,473 --> 00:32:50,013
Yes. She said she would.

505
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:54,133
She'll come inside when she gets here. Or call you.

506
00:32:54,133 --> 00:32:57,163
- Let's go inside. 
 - Hey!

507
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,213
No, wait.

508
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:24,833
- Hey, Minju! 
 - Hi.

509
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:27,303
What's up, Minju?

510
00:33:28,663 --> 00:33:31,693
Hey, Park Yunjae. You never come out when we invite you.

511
00:33:31,693 --> 00:33:34,173
But when Min Ju invites you, you show up?

512
00:33:34,173 --> 00:33:36,713
It's not like that.

513
00:33:36,713 --> 00:33:37,983
I'll stop by the bathroom.

514
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:40,343
Sure, it's over there.

515
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,363
- He's embarrassed. 
 - What was that? What's going on between you two?

516
00:33:44,363 --> 00:33:47,003
You're so...

517
00:33:48,323 --> 00:33:51,033
     

518
00:33:51,033 --> 00:33:52,593
It tastes good.

519
00:33:52,593 --> 00:33:54,133
Should we order another?

520
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:58,233
I didn't know either that Yunjae would come because I asked him to.

521
00:33:58,233 --> 00:34:00,373
 Hey, Yunjae is a guy, after all. 

522
00:34:00,373 --> 00:34:02,453
 He knows you're pretty. 

523
00:34:02,453 --> 00:34:05,333
 But I thought he said he had a girlfriend. 

524
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:08,433
 Hey, didn't you see Minju walking in with arms linked to his? 

525
00:34:08,433 --> 00:34:10,993
 It's game over. 

526
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,013
 W-Why? What happened? 

527
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:18,053
What? Oh my God!

528
00:34:18,053 --> 00:34:21,093
Why didn't you change yet?

529
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:25,433
What do I do?

530
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:30,463
Goodness, goodness. I know, right?

531
00:34:30,463 --> 00:34:33,400
I had to take a calming pill earlier, too.

532
00:34:35,213 --> 00:34:37,163
Park Yunjae went clubbing with that sly vixen.

533
00:34:37,163 --> 00:34:38,933
Hey, is that important now?

534
00:34:38,933 --> 00:34:41,433
Of course it is!

535
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,120
I shouldn't be doing this right now.

536
00:34:48,043 --> 00:34:49,513
Hey, Minhyeok. It's me.

537
00:34:49,513 --> 00:34:52,223
I have a favor to ask this time.

538
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:53,733
Are you free right now?

539
00:34:53,733 --> 00:34:56,703
Cheers!

540
00:34:56,703 --> 00:34:58,733
 - Hooray! 
 - Yeah! 

541
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,853
Drink up!

542
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:17,033
 Cheers! 

543
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,733
I feel better now.

544
00:35:21,733 --> 00:35:25,533
 Jieun, did something happen? 

545
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,903
Hey, just two hours...

546
00:35:30,913 --> 00:35:34,253
I missed you so much, but I guess you didn't.

547
00:35:34,253 --> 00:35:35,533
I'm also glad to see you.

548
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:37,383
Are you sure?

549
00:35:37,383 --> 00:35:38,983
I'm so sad.

550
00:35:38,983 --> 00:35:42,473
I can't get in touch with my girlfriend, so...

551
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,193
Sorry.

552
00:35:44,193 --> 00:35:47,393
If you're sorry, drink. Please?

553
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:58,133
- Drink. 
 - Okay, cheers!

554
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,923
Hyeong!

555
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,293
Okay. Let's go.

556
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,230
Drink!

557
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,283
- This is crazy. 
 - Give me your glass.

558
00:36:16,283 --> 00:36:18,733
- Hey. That's yours. 
 - No.

559
00:36:18,733 --> 00:36:22,133
- Drink! 
 - Cheers!

560
00:36:22,133 --> 00:36:23,770
Cheers.

561
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,833
I won't kill you.

562
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:38,253
Instead, dance with me, Oppa.

563
00:36:38,253 --> 00:36:39,713
Okay?

564
00:36:39,713 --> 00:36:41,383
What?

565
00:36:42,513 --> 00:36:44,033
So cute.

566
00:36:44,033 --> 00:36:45,593
Let's go.

567
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:23,553
So cute.

568
00:37:23,553 --> 00:37:25,423
So cute.

569
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,923
What is this?

570
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,173
Hey, you...

571
00:37:40,173 --> 00:37:42,053
You're Kang Minju, right?

572
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,800
Lee Minhyeok.

573
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,690
Do you know her, too, Hyeong?

574
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,273
Hyeong?

575
00:37:51,273 --> 00:37:55,790
If you know this guy, could you tell him to let go of my hand?

576
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,323
What is Park Yunjae doing?

577
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,233
Yunjae-oppa!

578
00:38:20,233 --> 00:38:22,023
Park Yunjae!

579
00:38:22,773 --> 00:38:24,393
What is this?

580
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,553
I'm sorry.

581
00:38:26,553 --> 00:38:28,233
I'm sorry!

582
00:38:28,233 --> 00:38:29,723
I'm sorry.

583
00:38:29,723 --> 00:38:31,533
I'm soâ€”

584
00:38:37,533 --> 00:38:39,163
I'm here!

585
00:38:39,163 --> 00:38:40,543
Wait.

586
00:38:40,543 --> 00:38:43,863
Why are you here? I mean...

587
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,933
Why are you again?

588
00:38:46,643 --> 00:38:50,393
I'm sorry. It just... happened.

589
00:38:50,393 --> 00:38:52,003
Hey!

590
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:55,023
Long time no see.

591
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:58,240
It's nice to see you like this.

592
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,370
Hey!

593
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:04,133
Should we dance?

594
00:39:07,483 --> 00:39:10,073
What? Lee Minhyeok?

595
00:39:10,073 --> 00:39:12,143
You're here, too?

596
00:39:12,143 --> 00:39:14,613
Hey. The three of us.

597
00:39:14,613 --> 00:39:16,530
Let's dance.

598
00:39:17,683 --> 00:39:20,143
No, that's not it.

599
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,400
Nope, give me your hand.

600
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,210
Hand!

601
00:39:27,313 --> 00:39:29,043
Good boy.

602
00:39:29,043 --> 00:39:32,080
You're very drunk. Let's go outside.

603
00:39:33,933 --> 00:39:36,873
March on!

604
00:39:36,873 --> 00:39:39,493
Oh my goodness. What's going on here?

605
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,113
What is going on?

606
00:39:43,113 --> 00:39:47,543
Eunseuk. You're with Iljo.

607
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:50,083
Who are you?

608
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:53,163
I'm sorry. Yunjae had a lot to drink.

609
00:39:53,163 --> 00:39:55,183
It's hard to stay sober in this world.

610
00:39:55,183 --> 00:39:56,753
It's okay, Oppa.

611
00:39:56,753 --> 00:39:59,203
Over here. Come over here. Come, come.

612
00:39:59,203 --> 00:40:00,253
Be careful.

613
00:40:00,253 --> 00:40:02,353
- Careful, careful. 
 - My goodness.

614
00:40:02,353 --> 00:40:04,233
Gosh.

615
00:40:04,233 --> 00:40:07,003
Gosh, thank you.

616
00:40:07,003 --> 00:40:08,333
Hey.

617
00:40:16,863 --> 00:40:19,013
Am I in space?

618
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:25,743
Zero gravity!

619
00:40:25,743 --> 00:40:27,733
I'm in space!

620
00:40:28,663 --> 00:40:30,593
I'm in space.

621
00:40:33,963 --> 00:40:37,593
I'm Neil Alden Armstrong.

622
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:42,233
That's one small step for man.

623
00:40:42,933 --> 00:40:47,633
One giant leap for mankind.

624
00:40:47,633 --> 00:40:50,023
What is he saying? Hey, hey.

625
00:40:50,023 --> 00:40:51,273
Dad, jump.

626
00:40:51,273 --> 00:40:53,183
Jump, jump! Mom!

627
00:40:53,183 --> 00:40:56,443
- Jump with us! Mom! 
 - You're nuts!

628
00:40:56,443 --> 00:40:59,663
- Jump! Let's jump! 
 - Get over here!

629
00:40:59,663 --> 00:41:03,193
How much did you drink to lose it like this?

630
00:41:03,193 --> 00:41:06,383
- Gosh! 
 - Get up, bastard!

631
00:41:06,383 --> 00:41:09,023
What is it? Mom!

632
00:41:09,023 --> 00:41:11,063
It hurts.

633
00:41:12,313 --> 00:41:18,413
You know... my mom is so consistent.

634
00:41:18,413 --> 00:41:20,973
No matter how many times I ask her to knock,

635
00:41:20,973 --> 00:41:23,933
she always forgets to.

636
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:27,033
My mom's helmet hairstyle?

637
00:41:27,033 --> 00:41:31,533
She has had the same hairstyle since I was born.

638
00:41:32,953 --> 00:41:34,933
She has never changed it.

639
00:41:34,933 --> 00:41:37,633
It's like she had it tattooed on her.

640
00:41:37,633 --> 00:41:40,343
Shut your mouth!

641
00:41:43,093 --> 00:41:45,803
- Do something about this! 
 - Stop it!

642
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:49,063
Stop this, you brat!

643
00:41:50,733 --> 00:41:52,633
- Goodness, Honey! 
 - What the heck!

644
00:41:52,633 --> 00:41:55,663
Oh my gosh! Look at this guy!

645
00:41:55,663 --> 00:41:57,943
Hey! Park Yunjae!

646
00:41:57,943 --> 00:42:00,163
Go to your room. Hurry!

647
00:42:00,163 --> 00:42:01,833
Mom, it hurts.

648
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:05,433
- Go to your room now! 
 - It hurts!

649
00:42:05,433 --> 00:42:07,473
You're dead.

650
00:42:09,973 --> 00:42:11,893
Mom.

651
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:20,903
You know... a person...

652
00:42:21,843 --> 00:42:27,593
can't just... change overnight.

653
00:42:27,593 --> 00:42:29,503
But...

654
00:42:30,543 --> 00:42:32,083
Mom...

655
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:34,393
But...

656
00:42:35,773 --> 00:42:37,893
Yes, yes, yes.

657
00:42:39,213 --> 00:42:42,093
Yes, it's okay.

658
00:42:43,253 --> 00:42:45,073
Yunjae?

659
00:42:46,423 --> 00:42:48,883
Park Yunjae!

660
00:43:13,963 --> 00:43:15,973
My goodness.

661
00:43:15,973 --> 00:43:18,403
Come out in five minutes.

662
00:43:20,893 --> 00:43:22,543
Okay.

663
00:43:24,973 --> 00:43:28,303
Ramen is the best for hangovers.

664
00:43:28,303 --> 00:43:30,653
Here. Eat up.

665
00:43:34,553 --> 00:43:37,373
Do you remember last night?

666
00:43:38,953 --> 00:43:40,953
A little.

667
00:43:40,953 --> 00:43:45,023
Your mom didn't sleep a wink and has gone to the early morning prayer.

668
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:49,583
I'll tell her I'm sorry.

669
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:51,563
Of course.

670
00:43:52,493 --> 00:43:54,273
Go on, eat.

671
00:43:55,213 --> 00:43:57,743
Is something going on lately?

672
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,853
No. Nothing.

673
00:44:02,893 --> 00:44:05,333
Is your girlfriend okay?

674
00:44:06,703 --> 00:44:10,483
No. She's gone.

675
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:16,033
I mean, I don't have one.

676
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:21,533
Okay. The ramen will get soggy. Eat quickly.

677
00:44:22,543 --> 00:44:26,983
Make sure you apologize to the friend who brought you home.

678
00:44:26,983 --> 00:44:31,743
He even undressed and washed you. Geez.

679
00:44:31,743 --> 00:44:33,523
Okay.

680
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,993
Undressed and washed me?

681
00:44:39,993 --> 00:44:42,663
He washed me where?

682
00:44:42,663 --> 00:44:45,533
Here and here...

683
00:44:45,533 --> 00:44:48,563
- Why does that matter? 
 - It matters!

684
00:44:49,633 --> 00:44:51,933
I'm so out of shape.

685
00:44:57,543 --> 00:44:59,213
Park Yunjae!

686
00:44:59,213 --> 00:45:01,993
Hey, don't get discouraged over that stuff.

687
00:45:01,993 --> 00:45:03,493
It's okay.

688
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:04,933
Hey, sit up straight.

689
00:45:04,933 --> 00:45:07,373
- Dad, stop. Stop. 
 - A man can drink and act like that sometimes.

690
00:45:07,373 --> 00:45:10,413
It's okay. Sit up straight!

691
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:16,863
Are you okay?

692
00:45:16,863 --> 00:45:19,063
 The rumor spread among our classmates. 

693
00:45:19,063 --> 00:45:20,833
 Are you dating a voice phishing criminal? 

694
00:45:20,833 --> 00:45:22,013
I don't know.

695
00:45:22,013 --> 00:45:24,363
Let them talk amongst themselves.

696
00:45:24,363 --> 00:45:27,233
 This stop is Noryangjin Park. 

697
00:45:27,233 --> 00:45:31,643
 The next stop is Noryangjin Station, Exit 3. 

698
00:45:57,283 --> 00:45:59,133
Excuse me.

699
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:05,623
   

700
00:46:05,623 --> 00:46:07,673
Thank you.

701
00:46:13,653 --> 00:46:16,533
 Why is it your dream to become a civil servant? 

702
00:46:18,933 --> 00:46:20,793
 I like the stability. 

703
00:46:20,793 --> 00:46:23,293
 Something that doesn't crumble. 

704
00:46:23,293 --> 00:46:24,833
 Something that doesn't change. 

705
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:26,803
 But why? 

706
00:46:28,183 --> 00:46:31,653
 If I had your face, I wouldn't waste it on becoming a civil servant. 

707
00:46:31,653 --> 00:46:35,223
 You're not even taking advantage of your blessed genes. 

708
00:46:35,223 --> 00:46:37,603
 Gosh, what a fool. 

709
00:46:38,223 --> 00:46:42,773
 As for my blessed genes, I can pass them down to my kids. 

710
00:46:42,773 --> 00:46:46,413
 I... want around three kids. 

711
00:46:46,413 --> 00:46:48,453
 Three? 

712
00:46:49,523 --> 00:46:51,203
 Three? 

713
00:46:54,673 --> 00:46:55,993
 Three? 

714
00:46:55,993 --> 00:46:58,513
 To afford a living while raising three kids, 

715
00:46:58,513 --> 00:47:00,533
 I'll also have to work. 

716
00:47:00,533 --> 00:47:04,433
 - What? 
 - It'll be tight with your salary alone. 

717
00:47:10,603 --> 00:47:12,973
 What I meant was... 

718
00:47:12,973 --> 00:47:14,343
 You can be a housewife. 

719
00:47:14,343 --> 00:47:17,353
 I'll be a civil servant that makes a lot of money. 

720
00:47:21,633 --> 00:47:23,463
 Let's go. 

721
00:47:47,233 --> 00:47:49,233
 Hong Yeongseok. 

722
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:51,113
 That's him. 

723
00:48:03,063 --> 00:48:04,033
   

724
00:48:04,033 --> 00:48:05,283
    
    

725
00:48:05,283 --> 00:48:08,393
    
    

726
00:48:21,003 --> 00:48:22,653
Mom says to give it to you.

727
00:48:22,653 --> 00:48:26,083
It's a detox juice made with spinach.

728
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:30,253
After all that, Mom still loves her son to death.

729
00:48:30,253 --> 00:48:32,113
Drink it.

730
00:48:37,693 --> 00:48:40,063
Jihun is mad, right?

731
00:48:42,323 --> 00:48:44,343
How did you know?

732
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:49,103
My singing was the worst, wasn't it?

733
00:48:49,103 --> 00:48:51,923
Why did I dance?

734
00:48:51,923 --> 00:48:54,413
- You should've stopped me. 
 - What do you mean?

735
00:48:54,413 --> 00:48:56,283
That's not the reason why.

736
00:48:56,283 --> 00:48:58,023
It's not?

737
00:48:58,023 --> 00:48:59,543
Then...

738
00:49:00,633 --> 00:49:04,803
Oh, is it because he washed me?

739
00:49:04,803 --> 00:49:06,693
Don't you remember?

740
00:49:09,353 --> 00:49:13,733
I took videos so I could gather some of your embarrassing moments.

741
00:49:13,733 --> 00:49:16,293
And I got this.

742
00:49:16,293 --> 00:49:17,513
Take a look.

743
00:49:17,513 --> 00:49:20,203
 Dad, jump! Mom, jump! 

744
00:49:20,203 --> 00:49:22,793
 This is the moon! Over there is... 

745
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:25,993
W-What is this? Is this me?

746
00:49:25,993 --> 00:49:28,033
You really don't remember anything?

747
00:49:28,033 --> 00:49:29,983
No.

748
00:49:29,983 --> 00:49:32,153
What is all this?

749
00:49:33,883 --> 00:49:35,483
Start here.

750
00:49:35,483 --> 00:49:37,083
Here.

751
00:50:01,493 --> 00:50:04,293
 Drink some honey water, Park Yunjae. 

752
00:50:05,393 --> 00:50:08,183
 Come on, wake up. 

753
00:50:08,183 --> 00:50:11,913
 A person shouldn't change. 

754
00:50:13,723 --> 00:50:16,603
 But you changed again. 

755
00:50:17,563 --> 00:50:19,473
 I mean... 

756
00:50:19,473 --> 00:50:25,873
 Like my mom... a person shouldn't change. 

757
00:50:30,133 --> 00:50:37,313
 Why do you keep going from being Jihun to being Jieun? 

758
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:46,020
 Why are you a guy and then a girl? 

759
00:50:47,313 --> 00:50:49,973
 How is that possible? 

760
00:50:50,973 --> 00:50:52,593
 Why? 

761
00:50:53,433 --> 00:50:56,003
 Why are you doing that? 

762
00:50:56,003 --> 00:50:57,663
 Why? 

763
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:59,573
 Why? 

764
00:51:00,673 --> 00:51:03,793
 Why are you playing with my heart? 

765
00:51:07,003 --> 00:51:09,583
 Is this a dream? 

766
00:51:10,933 --> 00:51:12,843
 It has to be. 

767
00:51:14,913 --> 00:51:17,823
 It hurts. 

768
00:51:17,823 --> 00:51:22,263
 It hurts! It's not a dream. 

769
00:51:22,263 --> 00:51:27,463
â™«  In the spreading stains of tears  â™«

770
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,213
 I'm sorry, Yunjae. 

771
00:51:34,213 --> 00:51:36,110
 I guess I've been too selfish. 

772
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:39,440
â™«  I see you  â™«

773
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,363
 I'm sorry. 

774
00:51:44,153 --> 00:51:49,590
â™«  It's not a dream, you're growing clearer  â™«

775
00:51:50,553 --> 00:51:54,283
â™«  I hear you  â™«

776
00:51:54,283 --> 00:51:58,623
â™«  Eyes donâ€™t lie, oh it's you  â™«

777
00:51:58,623 --> 00:52:03,073
â™«  Will you remember? I promise you  â™«

778
00:52:03,073 --> 00:52:05,523
â™«  In every moment  â™«

779
00:52:05,523 --> 00:52:09,963
It's absurd to us. How do you think she feels?

780
00:52:09,963 --> 00:52:11,783
I'm sure she's just cooling off.

781
00:52:11,783 --> 00:52:13,233
She'll be back.

782
00:52:13,233 --> 00:52:15,033
It's my fault.

783
00:52:15,033 --> 00:52:19,633
I got drunk last night and said a lot of things without thinking.

784
00:52:22,153 --> 00:52:24,643
I completely understand.

785
00:52:25,533 --> 00:52:29,943
Also, you should think this through again.

786
00:52:29,943 --> 00:52:31,443
What?

787
00:52:33,803 --> 00:52:37,423
I mean... if you have anything you need to think about.

788
00:52:37,423 --> 00:52:39,043
Jieun...

789
00:52:39,043 --> 00:52:41,493
isn't having any weird thoughts or anything, right?

790
00:52:41,493 --> 00:52:45,183
Gosh. Don't worry so much. Let's just wait.

791
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:49,133
I'm sure Kim Jieun will shake it off and come back soon.

792
00:53:34,553 --> 00:53:36,913
There's a typo here.

793
00:53:38,713 --> 00:53:40,843
You should focus.

794
00:53:42,963 --> 00:53:45,253
Sorry. What did you say?

795
00:53:45,253 --> 00:53:47,753
There's a typo here.

796
00:53:47,753 --> 00:53:50,703
Look, the coordinates are different.

797
00:53:50,703 --> 00:53:53,443
- Right. 
 - Let's do it again.

798
00:53:53,443 --> 00:53:55,173
Okay.

799
00:54:11,133 --> 00:54:19,803
â™«  You taught me how to feel with every word  â™«

800
00:54:19,803 --> 00:54:25,323
â™«  And every glance we've been through  â™«

801
00:54:25,323 --> 00:54:29,293
â™«  It will always be the same   â™«

802
00:54:29,293 --> 00:54:35,643
â™«  Running wild in the days of youth  â™«

803
00:54:35,643 --> 00:54:42,313
â™«  And we'll get even closer  â™«

804
00:54:42,313 --> 00:54:44,760
â™«  Blessed be the time we shared  â™«

805
00:54:45,603 --> 00:54:49,133
â™«  These are...  â™«

806
00:54:49,133 --> 00:54:53,293
â™«  These are the new you  â™«

807
00:55:07,153 --> 00:55:10,113
You didn't forget and found this place.

808
00:55:10,113 --> 00:55:13,683
Of course. How could I forget this place?

809
00:55:13,683 --> 00:55:17,293
It's where we first met.

810
00:55:19,603 --> 00:55:21,683
Have you been well?

811
00:55:23,023 --> 00:55:25,663
Well, I...

812
00:55:25,663 --> 00:55:28,533
have been deeply regretting my actions.

813
00:55:32,323 --> 00:55:33,703
Uhm.

814
00:55:33,703 --> 00:55:36,063
I'm sorry I made a scene.

815
00:55:36,063 --> 00:55:39,093
I'll never drink like that again.

816
00:55:39,093 --> 00:55:42,073
There's a famous tteokbokki place nearby.

817
00:55:42,073 --> 00:55:44,003
Want to go there?

818
00:55:45,913 --> 00:55:47,793
Yunjae.

819
00:55:49,543 --> 00:55:53,153
I thought it might be good to end things where they began.

820
00:55:55,073 --> 00:55:58,433
That way, the good memories we had at the beginning

821
00:55:58,433 --> 00:56:02,733
and the painful memories at the end would half each other out.

822
00:56:04,743 --> 00:56:06,473
Park Yunjae,

823
00:56:07,893 --> 00:56:10,343
let's stop seeing each other.

824
00:56:14,693 --> 00:56:16,753
This whole time, I didn't want to break up with you,

825
00:56:16,753 --> 00:56:20,173
so I've been thinking only about myself. I'm sorry.

826
00:56:21,073 --> 00:56:22,953
But...

827
00:56:22,953 --> 00:56:26,953
I'm hurting someone I love while looking like a stranger.

828
00:56:28,263 --> 00:56:30,943
I don't want to hurt you anymore.

829
00:56:31,933 --> 00:56:34,703
If it's because of that day, I had too much to drinkâ€”

830
00:56:34,703 --> 00:56:36,703
It's not like that.

831
00:56:38,043 --> 00:56:41,313
This is different from the first time I became a guy.

832
00:56:42,183 --> 00:56:45,043
I thought it would end at once,

833
00:56:46,413 --> 00:56:49,023
but even I don't know

834
00:56:49,023 --> 00:56:51,643
what's going to happen in the future.

835
00:56:53,383 --> 00:56:59,853
But... continuing to see you in this kind of situation...

836
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:05,493
would be too selfish of me.

837
00:57:10,943 --> 00:57:15,123
Have you... thought this through?

838
00:57:19,723 --> 00:57:21,173
Yeah.

839
00:57:31,913 --> 00:57:36,983
Do you want to... go play a game?

840
00:57:50,463 --> 00:57:52,923
Don't you think I improved?

841
00:57:54,173 --> 00:57:57,263
I played every day while you've been gone.

842
00:57:58,323 --> 00:58:01,283
So you've been having fun.

843
00:58:01,283 --> 00:58:03,093
When we played this last time,

844
00:58:03,093 --> 00:58:06,773
I know it was a game, but I couldn't protect you.

845
00:58:07,623 --> 00:58:10,803
I didn't like watching you die.

846
00:58:12,083 --> 00:58:15,263
- It's just a game. Don't reach that far. 
 - I know.

847
00:58:15,263 --> 00:58:17,173
I'm funny, right?

848
00:58:19,893 --> 00:58:22,723
I'll be honest.

849
00:58:22,723 --> 00:58:25,983
I feel sad and hopeless that you're a guy.

850
00:58:25,983 --> 00:58:27,073
I know.

851
00:58:27,073 --> 00:58:30,323
You're stronger and taller than me.

852
00:58:30,323 --> 00:58:32,293
I really don't like it.

853
00:58:32,293 --> 00:58:34,663
That's why we should stop.

854
00:58:34,663 --> 00:58:35,933
No.

855
00:58:35,933 --> 00:58:37,653
Not yet.

856
00:58:38,933 --> 00:58:40,053
Wait.

857
00:58:40,053 --> 00:58:42,363
Someone is shooting us.

858
00:58:42,363 --> 00:58:44,373
Get in the car.

859
00:58:48,713 --> 00:58:50,853
Why not?

860
00:58:50,853 --> 00:58:53,583
Just because you became a guy overnight,

861
00:58:53,583 --> 00:58:56,573
I have to get rid of my feelings overnight as well?

862
00:58:56,573 --> 00:58:58,113
That's not what I mean.

863
00:58:58,113 --> 00:58:59,383
Park Yunjae, seriously?

864
00:58:59,383 --> 00:59:03,823
I may have never imagined that you would turn into a man,

865
00:59:03,823 --> 00:59:06,623
but not having you by my side is worse.

866
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:10,293
So, let's just stay as we are for a bit.

867
00:59:14,323 --> 00:59:17,783
I don't want to mess up your life because of me.

868
00:59:20,673 --> 00:59:24,333
My dad, who eventually takes my mom's side while fighting her, said this.

869
00:59:24,333 --> 00:59:28,933
"If I didn't have your mom, my life would have been very tiring."

870
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:31,123
That was his reason.

871
00:59:31,123 --> 00:59:32,470
And I feel the same.

872
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:33,950
â™«  The warmth that still lingers  â™«

873
00:59:33,953 --> 00:59:35,893
If I don't have you,

874
00:59:35,893 --> 00:59:39,110
my life will be very tiring and meaningless.

875
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:42,140
â™«  Never disappears  â™«

876
00:59:42,143 --> 00:59:44,153
They're shooting.

877
00:59:45,143 --> 00:59:46,983
Where are they?

878
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:49,633
If we don't get out of the car, we'll both die.

879
00:59:49,633 --> 00:59:51,953
No. If we both try to live,

880
00:59:51,953 --> 00:59:53,523
we'll both die.

881
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:56,443
 Stop meandering and get out of the car, you idiots! 

882
00:59:56,443 --> 00:59:59,733
 It's always kids without driver's licenses who act pretentious. 

883
00:59:59,733 --> 01:00:00,800
 Are you on a date or something? 

884
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:04,380
â™«  Open your eyes  â™«

885
01:00:04,383 --> 01:00:08,043
â™«  Even the tears filled to the brim  â™«

886
01:00:08,043 --> 01:00:11,783
â™«  Will be no more  â™«

887
01:00:11,783 --> 01:00:14,620
â™«  So, believe me now  â™«

888
01:00:15,683 --> 01:00:18,893
 I don't know, but for us... 

889
01:00:18,893 --> 01:00:20,533
 I mean, 

890
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:24,983
 for my sake, let's keep the status quo for a while. 

891
01:00:25,733 --> 01:00:29,083
â™«  I'm always with you  â™«

892
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:30,590
I got him.

893
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:32,490
â™«  I see your eyes  â™«

894
01:00:32,493 --> 01:00:34,390
- I got better, right? 
 - Yeah.

895
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:37,433
â™«  Even the tears filled to the brim  â™«

896
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:41,603
   

897
01:00:44,883 --> 01:00:47,393
He hasn't changed one bit.

898
01:01:04,583 --> 01:01:07,313
The Lovers card.

907

 If she weren't my daughter, it would be unimaginable. 

908
01:01:53,073 --> 01:01:55,173
 Yunjae and his friend are coming over in a bit. 

909
01:01:55,173 --> 01:01:57,633
 - Perfect. 
 - You're totally my ideal type, Hyeong. 

910
01:01:57,633 --> 01:01:59,693
 How long have you two known each other? 

911
01:01:59,693 --> 01:02:02,343
 - 453 days. 
 - You keep track of that? 

912
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:05,163
 You came. I've been struggling. 

913
01:02:05,163 --> 01:02:08,663
 What? Park Yunjae, are you possessed by the devil? 

914
01:02:08,663 --> 01:02:10,913
 Yuri is staying over tonight. 

915
01:02:10,913 --> 01:02:16,430
 You have no idea how much I'm trying to not have other thoughts, do you?
