1
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,310
   

2
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,810
   

3
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,410
   

4
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,610
   

5
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,510
   

6
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,400
We're here.

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,120
Go on in.

8
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,020
Hey, Yunjae. You know─

9
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,390
Oh, right. I have something to give you.

10
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,070
One second.

11
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,990
Here you go.

12
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,030
This is a super trendy jelly right now.

13
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,890
You'll get cavities, so don't have too much.

14
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,670
If you have any, be sure to brush your teeth.

15
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,000
Why jelly all of a sudden?

16
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:08,710
Someone told me jelly could give you courage.

17
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,540
"There's nothing that requires more courage

18
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,730
than loving someone."

19
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,790
 You have me now. Shouldn't that mean you don’t need jellies anymore? 

20
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,500
 Excuse me. 

21
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,760
 There's nothing that requires more courage 

22
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,040
 than loving someone. 

23
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,630
 I ate so many jellies while dating you. 

24
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,390
♫  The warmth that still lingers  ♫

25
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,800
♫  Your heart, always felt  ♫

26
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,740
 Just stay as you are. 

27
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,240
 That's all I need. 

28
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,770
♫  Open your eyes  ♫

29
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:51,470
♫  This moment I dreamed about  ♫

30
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,250
♫  Will be remembered, for you  ♫

31
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,910
♫  I'm always with you  ♫

32
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,530
♫  I see your eyes  ♫

33
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,300
♫  Even the tears filled to the brim  ♫

34
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,960
♫  Will be no more  ♫

35
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,560
♫  So believe me now  ♫

36
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,430
It's good.

37
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,540
I feel braver.

38
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:25,930


39
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,530
♫  Just like yesterday, I long for you  ♫

40
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,190
♫  I hide the tears  ♫

41
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,170
Good night, Kim Jieun.

42
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,460
♫  You want to know that I still see you  ♫

43
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:44,300
♫  'Cause you are the only one  ♫

44
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,890
   

45
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,740
Are you crazy?

46
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,500
- What did you say? 
 - It's a good thing.

47
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,020
You were going to tell our parents this weekend anyway.

48
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,800
It's best to rip off the band-aid.

49
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,860
Just do it while you can.

50
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,890
But how can I go home like this?

51
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,040
As the boyfriend you're bringing home?

52
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,960
I know.

53
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,380
So, who told you to lie?

54
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,640
Hey.

55
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,590
After your little scheme, take a look at this.

56
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,720
I can't work because of Mom's texts and calls.

57
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,500
Their daughter turned into a man, and now you're telling me to be their son-in-law?

58
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,960
I said it was just a casual meal.

59
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,240
Just tell them when the moment feels right.

60
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,120
 Do your best and leave it to God. 

61
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,850
 We are closed today. 

62
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,870
   

63
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,540
I'm here.

64
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,740
Oh my!

65
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,680
Gosh, welcome.

66
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,510
Dad, what are those flowers for?

67
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,250
Mom, what's with your hair and outfit?

68
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,180
What do you mean?

69
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,000
I always dress like this.

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,130
It's nice to meet you.

71
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,640
I'm Jihye's dad.

72
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,050
Yes.

73
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,940
Hello.

74
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,100
I'm Jihye's mom.

75
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,710
H-Hello.

76
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,560
Mom, here.

77
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,280
He brought it.

78
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,820
Goodness, you shouldn't have! There's no need.

79
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,900
Thank you.

80
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,240
Your face and your heart are both so thoughtful.

81
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,690
- Come on in. 
 - You must be hungry.

82
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,740
Just wait a second.

83
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,170
Trying to make a son-in-law out of me?

84
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,850
Hey, this is just common sense.

85
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,660
You don't go to someone else's house empty-handed.

86
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,500
Someone else's house?

87
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,450
Hey. I'll give you a sign, so tell them.

88
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,590
Mom!

89
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,900
- Hey! 
 - Mom!

90
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,670
Gosh, this is not enough food.

91
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,510
Jihye... told us to keep it simple.

92
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,660
So I really just put one more spoon on our usual table.

93
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,110
- Gosh, what lies. 
 - Gosh, what lies.

94
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,650
Huh?

95
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,410
Nothing.

96
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,910
Wow. This is amazing.

97
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:52,040
My mom has never set up a feast like this for me.

98
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,390
I'm so jealous, Jihye.

99
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,630
I know.

100
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,600
Whoa, I'm so used to it.

101
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,150
Go on, eat.

102
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,130
Eat.

103
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,800
Try this.

104
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,560
Try this, too.

105
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:32,470
Gosh, you eat nice big bites, too.

106
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:36,810
Jihye takes after her dad and eats like a bird.

107
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,830
Here. Have this, too.

108
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,460
Mom, stop it. She'll—

109
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:51,090
I mean... he must feel pressured.

110
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,200
Oh, gosh.

111
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,850
Did I make a mistake?

112
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,410
No.

113
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,400
It's delicious.

114
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,650
Our other daughter also eats everything we give her.

115
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,620
That's why whenever I see someone who eats well,

116
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,970
I get so excited.

117
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,230
You haven't met Jieun, our youngest?

118
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,900
Gosh, Honey, don't you remember last time?

119
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,550
He was at their place. Of course, he saw her.

120
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,330
Should we call Jieun?

121
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,980
- Should we? 
 - Yes.

122
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,440
Dad!

123
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,300
Why would you call her?

124
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,630
Why do you talk about your sister like she's a stranger?

125
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,030
She's family. It would be nice for all of us to get to know each other.

126
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,230
Right, Honey?

127
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,400
Of course, that would be nice.

128
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,400
You might become her future brother-in-law.

129
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,850
Brother-in-law?

130
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,990
My goodness.

131
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,610
What? W-Why?

132
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,350
Mom.

133
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,660
Mom!

134
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,280
What's wrong?

135
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,220
Mom!

136
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,330
Try me one more time.

137
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,760
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,680
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,040
I said, try me one more time!

140
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,740
I said, try me one more time!

141
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,310
Oh, my. H-Honey.

142
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,700
I...

143
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,440
I thought...

144
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,400
I'm so, so sorry.

145
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,760
- One second. 
 - Why did you...

146
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,960
Mom, stay strong.

147
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,360
Dad, you too.

148
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,690
- It's okay. 
 - I'm sorry. So sorry.

149
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,370
It's okay. Here.

150
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,980
He's all grown up now. 
    

151
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,400
I'm so touched that I could cry. 
     

152
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,740
I'm sorry.

153
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,230
You didn't even get to eat properly because of me.

154
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,400
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,100
No, we made such a fuss over food.

156
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,990
Is your stomach okay?

157
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,560
Yes.

158
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,480
I noticed how tall you are when you walked in.

159
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,710
How tall are you?

160
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,730
165 cm.

161
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,990
Wait, that's it?

162
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,270
You look pretty tall.

163
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,680
I have a small face,

164
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,100
so I get that a lot.

165
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,270
I see.

166
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,090
Have some Shine Muscat grapes.

167
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,120
Where did my phone go?

168
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,930
Jihye, have you seen my phone?

169
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,620
Phone?

170
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,440
There.

171
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,100
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you.

172
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,530
Here.

173
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,590
Have some fruit.

174
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,050
Have some.

175
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,250
Honey, what are you doing?

176
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,060
It's late. We should let him go soon.

177
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,810
Yeah. Come to think of it,

178
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,580
we have nice teacups that Jieun gave us for my birthday.

179
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,140
I was saving them for a special guest.

180
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,360
When else could I bring them out?

181
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,200
Mom, it's okay. Just come.

182
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,470
I also have something to say.

183
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,960
What? You have something you want to say?

184
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,630
My goodness.

185
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,330
Okay, I'll be right there. One moment.

186
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,740
Are you okay?

187
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,390
Are you hurt anywhere?

188
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:47,290
Mom, I told you to move the heavy cups down.

189
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,290
They're not that expensive. Why are you saving them?

190
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,310
Dad, I told you to switch out this stool.

191
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,130
The legs are shaky because it's old.

192
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:59,180
What... is going on here?

193
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,800
Honey.

194
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:41,690
Our Jieun... likes tangerines.

195
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:44,390
- Go get the best ones. 
 - Oh.

196
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,800
Okay.

197
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,600
- I'll come with you. 
 - Yeah, sure, sure.

198
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,810
Are you okay?

199
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,940
That must have scared you.

200
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,600
It would be a lie if I said I wasn't scared.

201
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,460
I'm sorry.

202
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,560
Where's the energy you had when you taught us about this?

203
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,300
I was worried you would throw me a party or something.

204
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,610
You know...

205
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:04,660
now that it has happened, I don't feel like it.

206
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,800
I'll go back to the way I was, just like you did.

207
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,550
Time will take care of it. Right?

208
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,780
But I'm super handsome, aren't I?

209
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,460
I surprised myself, too.

210
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,370
Except for the part where I'm a guy,

211
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,350
I would be saying "thank you" to God.

212
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,790
- Dad, you're okay? 
 - Huh?

213
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,410
Of course, I'm okay.

214
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,850
I think Mom was pretending to be okay.

215
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:59,700
If you pretend long enough, it becomes true.

216
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,210
While we're at it, want to hear a secret from me?

217
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,660
What?

218
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,440
I...

219
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,800
love our daughters, of course, but...

220
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,300
I used to also wish we had a son.

221
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,830
Why is that a secret?

222
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:19,600
Your mom and I have been trying until recently.

223
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,840
This whole time,

224
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,610
I've been having eel, blackberries, live octopus...

225
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:27,410
No, no, gosh. Okay, okay.

226
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,400
I know daughters are the best,

227
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,300
but when my friends with sons would go to the bathhouse together,

228
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,880
or bring them along to play soccer,

229
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,000
I would get jealous and envious.

230
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,900
Dad.

231
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,620
Although Jieun turned into a guy,

232
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,240
she would never go to the bathhouse with you.

233
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,180
Of course, I feel the same way.

234
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,150
My goodness.

235
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,120
Dad!

236
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,660
It's so nice out.

237
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,560
I know right.

238
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,750
Your husband told me.

239
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,290
It's okay.

240
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,720
We knew this could happen at any given point.

241
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,580
If she weren't my daughter, it would be unimaginable.

242
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,960
It's the card we were dealt.

243
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,340
   

244
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,110
   

245
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,760
I wonder how Yunjae is doing.

246
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,500
I think it would be good to explain the concept a bit more in depth here.

247
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,700
All right. I'll do that. Okay.

248
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,890
The presentation is coming up so soon, isn't it?

249
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,000
- What are you doing tomorrow? 
 - Here, too.

250
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,950
I think we should also explain this in more detail.

251
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,750
Okay.

252
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,340
- One second. 
 - Okay.

253
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,190
Hey, Jieun.

254
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,890
How are your parents?

255
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,520
- You saw them? 
  - Yeah. 

256
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,740
It didn't go the way I expected,

257
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,000
but it turned out well in the end.

258
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,290
- Is the prep going well? 
 - Yeah.

259
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,640
I'm still at school.

260
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,150
I want to go to school, too.

261
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,340
How did I end up with this unlucky fate?

262
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,050
You know...

263
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,730
in quantum mechanics,

264
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,000
there is no such thing as a predestined fate.

265
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,370
Since nothing exists before it can be measured,

266
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,140
our individual futures

267
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,360
depend on what we focus on and the choices we make.

268
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,370
Why are you suddenly bringing up quantum mechanics?

269
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,360
The minute you think this is your unlucky fate,

270
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,960
that is also a choice.

271
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,180
When I'm having a hard time, I think of Kim Jieun.

272
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,470
 Thinking of Kim Jieun when I'm struggling 

273
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,750
is my choice.

274
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,610
Then, strangely, I feel better

275
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,910
and instantly become happy.

276
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,620
 I hope Park Yunjae 

277
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:31,900
can also be that choice for Kim Jieun.

278
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,010
 Oppa! 

279
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,670
What are you doing in the middle of making the presentation?

280
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,400
We don't have much time.

281
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,100
Okay.

282
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,660
Sorry, Jieun.

283
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,500
I'll call you back when I get home.

284
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,370
No, it's okay. Good luck.

285
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,570
I didn't get to tell him the moon looks pretty.

286
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,810
What are you looking at?

287
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,630
First time seeing a woman get stood up?

288
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,940
I'm so sorry.

289
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,900
I was on the subway and it stopped out of nowhere.

290
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,880
It started running again after 32 minutes.

291
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,940
It's true.

292
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,690
I'm sorry.

293
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:38,600
Then, I happened to be watching an online lecture, and my phone died.

294
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Seriously. I'm never the type to be late.

295
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,310
I'm sorry.

296
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,230
So sorry.

297
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,120
I want to get you a sports car instead of the subway.

298
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,000
Y-You're not mad?

299
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,520
I was going to, but the food is good...

300
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,780
and the moon is pretty.

301
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,770
So pretty.

302
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,950
   

303
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,920
Wow!

304
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,360
No way.

305
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,150
Wow!

306
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,230
Goddess of fortune, if you're here,

307
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:12,860
could you let me see Hong Yeongseok one more time?

308
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,130
No worries if you don't want to.

309
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:18,130
Actually, please do. Please.

310
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,780
Are you that happy?

311
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,240
Of course.

312
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,130
I love a home-cooked meal.

313
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,740
Be honest.

314
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,530
Is it the home-cooked meal that you like? Or Jihun?

315
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,950
Both.

316
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:54,440
I really like both home-cooked meals and Jihun.

317
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:59,320
Really like? Please.

318
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:10,060
Your mom should've started a side dish store, not a salon.

319
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,110
Hey!

320
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:14,270
Put some on a plate. Don't be lazy and eat out of the container.

321
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,240
Fine.

322
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,770
Yunjae and his friend are coming over in a bit.

323
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,380
I get Yunjae.

324
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,210
But why Yunjae's friend?

325
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,100
It's a guy Yunjae works part-time with.

326
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,410
I owe him one, so I'm treating them to a meal.

327
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:30,010
Oh, the one who likes girls, talks a lot, and gets into trouble?

328
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,250
- That guy? 
 - That's not true.

329
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:35,400
After getting to know him, he seems like a nice guy despite being loud.

330
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,290
So you even invited him over?

331
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,370
- Are you going to be okay? 
 - Yup.

332
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,400
Turns out my sister has to go to a funeral after work.

333
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,060
Not that. That's not the issue.

334
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,370
Are you ready?

335
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:51,970
My mom marinated some bulgogi, so I'm making that.

336
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,980
Not that.

337
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,510
Did you put away stuff like this?

338
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,040
Hey!

339
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,140
I have to go.

340
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,280
Bye.

341
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,630
Perfect.

342
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,010
- You made it. 
 - Hyeong.

343
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,730
Thanks for inviting us.

344
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,540
Let's head in.

345
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,060
- Go, go, go. 
 - What are you doing?

346
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,420
Okay, okay, go in.

347
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,600
Wait.

348
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,800
What is...

349
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:07,330
Hyeong, did you break a perfume bottle?

350
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:10,730
Isn't it nice? It's number one in the Olive Young men's perfume section.

351
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,410
Gisele Homme No. 5.

352
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:21,010
Hyeong, your house is so clean. Practically spotless.

353
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,540
It's always like this.

354
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:26,500
Oh, Minhyeok. Do you want to sit on the couch for a bit?

355
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:48,100
Oh my. Why is your underwear here?

356
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,420
Oh, no! I forgot.

357
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:55,480
Geez, I'm so clumsy.

358
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,570
Wait.

359
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,900
Is this a smokescreen?

360
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,230
Minhyeok. Why don't you read a magazine while you wait?

361
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:07,670
Magazine?

362
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:12,450
Wow. Hyeong, do you read this kind of stuff?

363
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:13,770
Of course.

364
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:17,180
If you're a man, you should at least be aware of these.

365
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,800
Hyeong.

366
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,300
You're so cool.

367
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:30,400
- Just sit here for a second. 
 - Okay.

368
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,390
 Ta-da! 

369
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,840
 What a surprise. Flowers? 

370
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,760
 Thanks. 

371
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:01,730
 Your place is so clean. 

372
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,420
 It smells nice, too. 

373
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:08,370
 Really? It's always like this. 

374
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:10,950
 You must be hungry. Sit on the couch. 

375
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,380
 Okay. 

376
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,350
 Drink this. 

377
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,970
 Thanks. 

378
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,990
Cheers!

379
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,340
I hope it suits your taste.

380
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,810
You made all this?

381
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:02,250
I like to cook.

382
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:05,490
You're totally my ideal type, Hyeong.

383
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:07,130
Ideal type?

384
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:09,270
He's just an older brother to you.

385
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,090
How long have you two known each other?

386
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:15,120
Are you guys college friends?

387
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,180
It's been a little more than a year.

388
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,300
453 days.

389
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,340
You keep track of that?

390
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,830
Wow, Minhyeok. This looks really good. Try it. Say, "ah".

391
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,760
- Say ah. That's right. 
 - I'll eat.

392
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,940
What's wrong with you?

393
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:33,080
You don't look like it, but you act so rough.

394
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,590
He's not like that with me.

395
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,980
How is he with you?

396
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,900
Seems like someone's here.

397
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,790
Give me a second.

398
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,400
Coming!

399
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,670
You made it.

400
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:02,770
Thanks, Yuri. I've been struggling.

401
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:11,940
Hello. I'm Lee Minhyeok.

402
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,750
I work with Yunjae.

403
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,050
Yes.

404
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,300
- I'm— 
 - Wow.

405
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,960
Your glasses are huge.

406
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,180
They're fake, right?

407
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,770
Damn it!

408
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,030
They're real. Sorry.

409
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,580
This is my friend Choi Yuri.

410
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,490
We've been friends since elementary school.

411
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:37,140
This is my boyfriend, Yunjae.

412
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,750
Boyfriend?

413
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,080
I guess so.

414
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,930
Hello, his boyfriend, Park Yunjae.

415
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:53,110
I'm his female friend, Choi Yuri.

416
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:57,840
I've heard a lot about you.

417
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:03,000
Oh, yes. I've heard a lot about you, too.

418
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,420
I see that we're both raising...

419
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,370
a unicorn* together. 
  (Can refer to people or situations as special or unique) 

420
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,810
Yes.

421
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,550
Where's the unicorn?

422
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,100
Hey.

423
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:25,500
You said you guys met on a blind date, right?

424
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,770
Who is "you guys"?

425
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:35,340
Who here would have met on a blind date?

426
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,170
I think Yuri is quite drunk.

427
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:41,130
Hey, stop drinking.

428
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:43,690
This is non-alcoholic, though.

429
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,660
Sorry.

430
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,950
This is so nice.

431
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,650
Invite me over often, Hyeong.

432
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,310
Well...

433
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,790
Maybe I will sometime.

434
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,750
Hey, stop squeezing that!

435
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,140
- Sorry. 
 - What was that?

436
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,040
It's all over Jihun's clothes.

437
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:25,400
It's okay. I was going to change anyway because it's so hot.

438
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,800
- Let me go and change. 
 - Sorry...

439
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,640
I'm going to the bathroom.

440
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,620
Geez.

441
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:42,000
What? It wasn't on purpose.

442
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,590
Hey.

443
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,190
What's up?

444
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,140
There's no... toilet paper in the bathroom.

445
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,910
Really?

446
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:06,640
One moment.

447
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:12,210
Hey, I thought you had non-alcoholic beer.

448
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:14,410
Your face is so red.

449
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:17,420
Even your ears are red.

450
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:20,440
So warm.

451
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,560
Also, blind date?

452
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,540
Be careful.

453
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:29,260
Yeah.

454
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,700
I'll stop drinking.

455
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,820
Did you guys get into a fight downstairs?

456
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,600
Why are you all acting like this?

457
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,550
It's nothing.

458
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,700
It's been a while since I've had a drink.

459
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,600
I'm tired.

460
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,980
Should we go now?

461
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,570
Oh, yeah. Good idea.

462
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,400
Let's go now.

463
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,600
What do you mean? We're just getting started.

464
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,160
Jihun, I can stay longer. Right?

465
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,860
I'm a little tired, too.

466
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,700
I haven't even gotten started.

467
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,540
Come on. Let's hang out more.

468
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,800
Huh?

469
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,370
     

470
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:53,800
Who's Yuri 3?

471
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:58,710
Yuri 1, Yuri 2, Yuri 3, Yuri 4.

472
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,780
Hey. Right now?

473
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,950
You miss me?

474
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,670
Yuri?

475
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,660
Yeah.

476
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,910
Hey. Keep an eye on your boyfriend.

477
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:22,360
Birds of a feather flock together.

478
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,250
What are you trying to say?

479
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,160
As long as a player is by his side,

480
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,480
you can't trust your boyfriend.

481
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,670
Hey.

482
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,510
Yunjae is not like that.

483
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,470
Nice line.

484
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,260
Can I use that as my new novel's title?

485
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:40,160
Just so you know, the genre is dramatic romantic thriller.

486
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:48,190
Anyway, it's really late, so I'll need to call a taxi.

487
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,700
- Which way are you going? 
 - Me?

488
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,770
Yuri is staying over tonight.

489
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,460
That's right, but...

490
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:03,200
it might be okay to go home and sleep.

491
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,600
Don't fall asleep on your way again and make me worry.

492
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,410
Just stay over.

493
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,500
D-Do that.

494
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:15,900
It's better to safely stay over at a friend's place than to be out so late.

495
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,090
Go on in.

496
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,720
Good night.

497
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,620
Let's go.

498
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,100
 I've been waiting for this moment to be alone with you. 

499
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,580
 Choi Yuri. We're friends. 

500
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,730
 We can't do this. 

501
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:04,940
 Do I still look like a friend to you? 

502
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,820
 Look. 

503
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:11,590
 We look pretty good together. 

504
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:17,340
No. No!

505
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,990
What am I thinking?

506
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:22,700
They've been friends since elementary school.

507
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:27,880
So what? That doesn't matter between a guy and a girl.

508
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:32,530
But they're not a guy and a girl. Right?

509
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:41,380
Park Yunjae. Get it together.

510
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,800
Are you possessed by the devil?

511
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:57,110
- It would be nice to sleep in the bed together. 
 - What?

512
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,630
Why are you so shocked?

513
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,880
We always slept together.

514
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:06,500
But my body has grown too big, so it'll be better for me to sleep on the floor.

515
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,740
Okay.

516
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,810
I'm going to bed then.

517
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:12,930
Already?

518
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,920
I think I drank too much.

519
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,260
I'm a little tired.

520
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,800
But you didn't drink.

521
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:23,280
Hey!

522
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,500
Let's talk a little before we sleep.

523
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,780
Hey.

524
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,450
Stop drinking the non-alcoholic stuff, too.

525
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:50,160
My stupid life...

526
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,340
All I do is celebrate and pay my condolences to other people.

527
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:58,450
No special event since my first birthday party.

528
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:00,900
No event.

529
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,360
Excuse me.

530
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,730
Could I borrow a lighter?

531
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,180
Thank you.

532
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,400
Are you... It's you.

533
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,620
My deskmate Kim Jihye.

534
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:39,490
H-Hong Yeongseok?

535
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:41,360
You look exactly the same.

536
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,930
But do you recognize me?

537
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:44,600
I've changed so much.

538
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,570
You would probably not recognize me.

539
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,190
 No way. 

540
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:51,100
 Is he human? 

541
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,880
 He's so good-looking. 

542
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,300
 - What is it? 
 - Is that him? 

543
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,580
 Who is that girl? 

544
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:04,160
 - She's glaring at us. 
 - So good-looking. 

545
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,970
 Your book is upside down. 

546
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:17,640
   

547
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,880
 I like reading books upside down. 

548
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,980
 It helps me think outside the box. 

549
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,670
 It's true. 

550
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,540
 I didn't say anything. 

551
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:32,670
 Then stop looking this way and sleep. 

552
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:35,140
 I like looking at you. 

553
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,270
 Because you're funny. 

554
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:43,630
 I'm going to sleep now. 

555
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,920
You look the same! You haven't changed at all.

556
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,680
Really?

557
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:13,060
This is why they say old friends are the best.

558
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,920
You look exactly the same.

559
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,490
But why were you at the hospital?

560
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:20,240
Oh, a-a funeral?

561
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,030
Oh, yeah. My colleague's mother passed away.

562
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,700
H-How about you?

563
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,750
I'm here... because of my dad...

564
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:33,040
Anyway, good to see you, Jihye.

565
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:46,890
What's so funny?

566
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:51,440
So, if we were to summarize your encounter with your first love,

567
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,530
it would be "smoking together in front of a funeral"?

568
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,950
It's still kind of sexy.

569
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,300
After those young and innocent days,

570
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:04,920
a jaded man and woman in their mid-30s cross paths again.

571
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,820
Cute.

572
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:11,300
Hey, is this fun for you guys?

573
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,090
So, what is he up to? Is he married?

574
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:16,580
You got his number, right?

575
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:20,470
Come on, no way. He was your first love!

576
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:24,000
You couldn’t have simply smoked together and left it at that.

577
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,930
No, right?

578
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:31,530
 What are you up to these days? 

579
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:34,200
 I work at a company. 

580
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,190
 Oh, a company. 

581
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,900
 My business card. 

582
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:43,600
 I'm telling you because I feel self-conscious. 

583
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,850
 I'm still not a civil servant. 

584
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:47,970
 I failed the exam seven times, 

585
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:51,420
 and retaking it this year for the eighth time. 

586
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:01,670
 Things happen. 

587
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:05,640
 They say if you fall seven times, you should stand up eight. 

588
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,890
 It'll work out, Hong Yeongseok! Fighting! 

589
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,320
 Thanks, Jihye. 

590
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:20,620
That was it?

591
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,600
I screwed up, didn't I?

592
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:29,400
I was a complete dumbass, wasn't I?

593
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,400
- What are you doing? 
 - That was you yesterday.

594
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,460
I had no way to put it into words,

595
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,720
so I wanted to demonstrate it.

596
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,650
Give me a break, you guys!

597
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:51,480
You, pick up that tissue.

598
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,860
And you, clean up the food. Go and buy ice cream. Go!

599
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:54,960
Go!

600
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,370
Go!

601
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:57,400
Go!

602
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,700
- You! Go! 
 - Stop teasing.

603
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,630
You'd better stop!

604
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,890
Hey, Dummy.

605
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:16,200
Your shirt is getting wet.

606
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,690
It'll dry.

607
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:26,030
Give me your arms.

608
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,350
You look good now, my friend.

609
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:00,330
I'll go and buy ice cream. What do you want?

610
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,120
Anything.

611
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,960
Anything? I'll get Tank Boy then.

612
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,100
Okay.

613
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:10,350
- Eonni, you want chocolate, right? 
 - Yeah.

614
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:26,980
Yuri.

615
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:36,760
People say a green light is when the feelings start.

616
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,500
But in my experience,

617
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:42,200
it’s the red light you really need to watch out for.

618
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,200
What are you talking about?

619
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,150
When does the red light appear?

620
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:53,750
When you shouldn’t cross or when you shouldn’t speed up.

621
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:56,490
It turns on when it's dangerous.

622
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:04,420
Be careful.

623
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:07,200
Your warning light is on.

624
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:15,300
No.

625
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,320
No, no, no!

626
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:28,190
   

627
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:43,460
   

628
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:49,610
- Hello? 
 - Hello.

629
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,100
I'm very impressed with your work!

630
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:56,800
- Really? 
 - Yeah. Very interesting.

631
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,600
- Good job! 
 - Thank you.

632
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:02,520
- Hi. 
 - Hello.

633
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:09,020
Very intriguing, Mr. Park.

634
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:13,260
Your test results may suggest new information about the comet.

635
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,930
What data have you used?

636
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:22,100
I processed the image based on the ultraviolet imaging spectrograph.

637
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,000
I see.

638
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,430
Well, thank you.

639
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:28,170
Do you mind if I take a picture?

640
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:30,570
- Sure. 
 - Very nice.

641
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:46,320
   

642
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:53,790
   

643
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:00,300
Park Yunjae is sure something.

644
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:03,040
But where did he go?

645
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:12,560
We wrapped it up nicely.

646
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,860
- Should we go now? 
 - Sure.

647
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,300
What is this? Without notice?

648
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,830
I stopped by on my way somewhere.

649
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:38,730
You're Yunjae's friend, right?

650
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:41,450
We met at the club, that day.

651
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:45,530
Yes. Hello.

652
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:50,650
- What is that behind you? 
 - Huh?

653
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:52,430
Oh, nothing.

654
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:54,000
You must be busy. Go on your way.

655
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,400
What's with you? You should look around since you're here.

656
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,920
No, I really just stopped by for a minute on my way.

657
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,990
Go on your way.

658
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,300
W-What was that?

659
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,870
They are all my favorites.

660
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:33,610
Looks good.

661
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:36,750
You said you ate already.

662
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,180
It wasn't good, so I barely ate.

663
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:43,780
Don't overdo it.

664
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:46,080
Drink some water.

665
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:51,000
This is so good.

666
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:53,770
Don't even think of stealing bites.

667
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:56,200
I'm going to finish them all.

668
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,670
♫  Love is you, my heart is pounding  ♫

669
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:01,960
I won't steal any bites.

670
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,520
Eat slowly.

671
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,970
♫  Because I'm thinking of you  ♫

672
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:07,080
Have some water.

673
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:10,230
♫  I must've fallen for you  ♫

674
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:14,400
♫  So heart-fluttering (Ah-ah)  ♫

675
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:19,380
♫  I like it because it's you  ♫

676
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:20,440
Hello.

677
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,570
Hi.

678
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:24,160
What modeling have you used?

679
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:28,670
I applied the multi-fitting method based on the Gaussian function.

680
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:29,900
Nice.

681
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:32,230
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you, too.

682
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:33,820
This student?

683
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:35,430
Hi.

684
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:36,670
Wow.

685
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:38,820
What is the resolution of the image?

686
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:40,700
It is 3 angstroms.

687
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,100
I see. Thank you.

688
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,140
It's really big.

689
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:48,660
- Indeed. 
 - Can we take a photo with the students?

690
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:52,400
Of course. Let's go. This way.

691
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,230
Are you ready?

692
00:51:58,230 --> 00:52:01,940
One, two, three!

693
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:03,600
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

694
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,900
Thank you.

695
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:06,510
- Nice to meet you. 
 - Nice to meet you, too.

696
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:08,140
Thank you. Nice to meet you.

697
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:10,360
- Thank you. 
 - See you.

698
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,960
- Thank you. 
 - I wish you all the best.

699
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:17,080
- Thank you. 
 - We will come back for this.

700
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,800
Are you okay?

701
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,670
Are you okay?

702
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:00,010
 Jeongmun Whelks? 

703
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,740
 You can't eat whelks. 

704
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:03,550
I know.

705
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:07,120
It's difficult to leave because of my professor.

706
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,140
 Don't drink too much. 

707
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,480
Okay.

708
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,730
I'll call you as soon as we're done.

709
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:16,070
You sound a little strange though.

710
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:17,910
Are you sick?

711
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:20,870
No.

712
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:23,510
I think I just got too nervous today.

713
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:26,440
I have to go now.

714
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,440
Okay, got it.

715
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,140
Okay.

716
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:35,760
Hello?

717
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:38,080
Yunjae?

718
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:40,480
Park Yunjae!

719
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:44,660
Did he hang up?

720
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:49,780
Yunjae!

721
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:52,170
Oppa, what's wrong?

722
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:53,310
Wake up!

723
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:54,560
Wake up!

724
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:57,020
Yunjae, are you okay? 
    

725
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:59,460
 - Yunjae!  
 - Park Yunjae!

726
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:18,600
What happened?

727
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,000
They said it was indigestion.

728
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,790
By the way, how did you know to come here?

729
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:24,170
Park Yunjae.

730
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:27,500
Wake up! Park Yunjae!

731
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,830
Yunjae. Yunjae! Excuse me.

732
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:31,210
Oh my. Honey!

733
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:33,590
Oh, Yunjae!

734
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:36,190
Yunjae! Yunjae...

735
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:38,630
Yunjae! Are you okay?

736
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:41,010
Your mom is here.

737
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,750
Wait.

738
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:46,170
You're the friend from last time, right?

739
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:48,620
You brought him home blackout drunk last time.

740
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:51,290
You look so normal,

741
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:53,830
but you must party way too hard.

742
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:55,700
I'm sorry.

743
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,660
Hello.

744
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:00,710
W-Who are you?

745
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:03,970
I'm the one who called you earlier, Yunjae's junior.

746
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:07,480
As for him, he just got here, too.

747
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:11,430
Yunjae passed out from indigestion during the seminar afterparty.

748
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:15,720
They said he's fine and he can get discharged as soon as he wakes up.

749
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:20,770
Goodness, what was the point of raising him on organic food?

750
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:23,620
He just eats anything and gets indigestion!

751
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,670
Seriously.

752
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,480
Yunjae...

753
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,000
Yunjae, wake up.

754
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,590
Your mom is here!

755
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:35,480
Excuse me.

756
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:38,500
Oh, so many of you are here now.

757
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:41,690
His girlfriend must have been really startled.

758
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:52,300
W-Well...

759
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:54,000
I...

760
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:57,700
Yes. Well...

761
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:01,270
so we're getting to know each other.

762
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,240
Gosh.

763
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:10,600
Maybe it's because you're Yunjae's junior.

764
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:15,360
Not only are you pretty, you must have gotten good grades.

765
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,900
I know these circumstances aren't ideal,

766
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:19,830
but nice to meet you.

767
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:23,380
We should treat you to a meal with Yunjae sometime.

768
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,160
Really?

769
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,810
That sounds nice.

770
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:29,220
Gosh. My goodness.

771
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:35,840
I had no idea such a smart and sweet girl was by my Yunjae's side.

772
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:40,300
- Right? You also had no idea, right? 
 - Of course not.

773
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:43,010
I had no idea.

774
00:56:43,010 --> 00:56:46,390
Yunjae is really popular. I guess you didn't know.

775
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:49,980
By the way, would you like something to drink?

776
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:53,200
You must have been really startled. Please wait for a moment.

777
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,230
Excuse me.

778
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:02,800
As far as I know, Yunjae has a girlfriend.

779
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:12,630
You're still here.

780
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:15,610
Yunjae has a girlfriend.

781
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:19,360
Did I say something?

782
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,680
There's been a big misunderstanding.

783
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:25,200
It seems like you told the hospital you were his girlfriend.

784
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,510
If I said I was just a friend, it wouldn't have felt urgent.

785
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:31,380
That's why I told them I was his girlfriend.

786
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:34,400
Is that a problem?

787
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,900
That's a lie.

788
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:42,260
Why is this your business?

789
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:45,480
People might think you're his girlfriend.

790
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,580
What I mean is...

791
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,630
If this is how you set things up,

792
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:57,750
Yunjae will be so confused when he wakes up.

793
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:59,280
As his friend, I'm concerned—

794
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,370
Technically, it's not a complete lie.

795
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:06,370
What do you mean?

796
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:10,160
Maybe not now,

797
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,300
but someday, it will happen.

798
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:18,300
Just wait a bit longer.

799
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:22,200
I'll share a meal with you as his girlfriend, not as his junior.

800
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,820
S-Sure, anytime. We can have a meal anytime.

801
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:28,820
But excuse me. Are you saying...

802
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:31,510
that Yunjae is seeing someone else?

803
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:35,300
If he hasn't told his parents, it must not be serious.

804
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:36,400
Don't worry.

805
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,840
I'll take good care of him.

806
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,150
It is serious.

807
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,630
They can't live without each other.

808
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,540
Why should I believe you?

809
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:49,800
Believe it.

810
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:54,100
Because I am Park Yunjae's girlfriend!

811
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:20,370

 What is the relationship between you and Kim Jihun?

 Relationship?

 I like you.

 Don't hang out with her. I really don't like her.

 Since you're in this state, can't you just be my boyfriend?

 A prince on a white horse. Who would be more fitting than you?
