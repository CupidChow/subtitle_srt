1
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,130
   

2
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,830
   

3
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,330
   

4
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,560
   

5
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,140
   

6
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,000
Just wait a bit longer.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,400
I'll share a meal with you as his girlfriend, not as his junior.

8
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,200
S-Sure, anytime.

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,360
But excuse me.

10
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,130
Are you saying... Yunjae is seeing someone else?

11
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,000
If he hasn't told his parents, it must not be serious.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,200
Don't worry. I'll take good care of him.

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,320
It is serious.

14
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,360
They can't live without each other.

15
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,700
Why should I believe you?

16
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,100
Believe it.

17
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,840
Because I am Park Yunjae's girlfriend!

18
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,630
What?

19
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,010
Don't you get what's going on here?

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,940


21
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,760
Of course, I do.

22
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,150
You two must have been terrified.

23
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,810
I just wanted to provide some comic relief.

24
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,020
Mom.

25
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,270
- Yunjae! 
 - Oppa!

26
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,230
- Yunjae! Yunjae! 
 - Oppa.

27
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,120
Are you awake?

28
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,550
Yunjae...

29
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,740
What happened?

30
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,000
Oppa, don't you remember?

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,990
You passed out at the restaurant

32
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,020
from acute indigestion.

33
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,530
- Out of the way! 
 - Please move!

34
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,560
Excuse us!

35
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,330
Are you okay?

36
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,320
I'm okay.

37
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,730
Gosh, seriously...

38
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,730
- Thank goodness. 
 - I'm sorry.

39
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,440
You can't just eat anything.

40
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,050
Good job.

41
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,850
It's nothing.

42
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,690
Good.

43
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,360
Thank goodness.

44
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,930
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:48,520
   

46
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,030
Hey, Park Yunjae.

47
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,750
What are you doing here?

48
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,280
What are you doing here?

49
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,330
You're a patient. You shouldn't be here.

50
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,010
They said it's indigestion.

51
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,820
Exactly, so why are you out here?

52
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,200
I'm fine.

53
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,760
What do you mean fine?

54
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,870
Look at your cold sweat.

55
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,880
Follow me.

56
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,560
♫  I see you  ♫

57
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,920
I'm dizzy. Three minutes, please.

58
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,350
Actually, let's just stay like this for a minute.

59
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,060
♫  I hear you  ♫

60
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,360
♫  Eyes don’t lie, oh it's you  ♫

61
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,420
♫  Will you remember?  ♫

62
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,670
♫  I promise you  ♫

63
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:06,990
♫  In every moment, I'll see you  ♫

64
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,870
Yunjae?

65
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,620
What are you two doing here?

66
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,310
Yunjae said he was feeling dizzy.

67
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,480
Of course. He's still a patient.

68
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,120
If you saw him, you should've sent him back in immediately. What are you doing?

69
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,420
I was about to go in.

70
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,250
You guys aren't even kids.

71
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,780
Get home safely.

72
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,390
Let's go inside. Your parents are waiting.

73
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,530
   

74
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,680
Minju.

75
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,270
- Oppa! 
 - Do you have a minute?

76
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,870
Yeah.

77
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,570
Senior.

78
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,640
What's up?

79
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,980
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

80
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,540
Thanks for last time.

81
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,170
I can't believe I fainted from indigestion.

82
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,960
I know. You have no idea how scared I was.

83
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,580
You're not planning to make it up to me with just a cup of coffee, are you?

84
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,930
- Do you have something you want? 
 - Yeah.

85
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,450
Park Yunjae.

86
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,040
What?

87
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,170
There's a new malatang* place near the back gate. 
  (Sichuan Hotpot) 

88
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,710
Treat me tomorrow.

89
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,250
I still have experiments left for today.

90
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,820
Tomorrow?

91
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,810
Well, okay. Sure.

92
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,850
Really? Yay!

93
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,070
Do you like malatang that much?

94
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,670
I like it because I'll be eating it with you.

95
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:36,180
Cheese rice cake, wide noodles, sausages, quail eggs.

96
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,230
Fish balls! We'll order them all.

97
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,450
I'm going to eat with you for a long time.

98
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:45,010
Fine, order them all.

99
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,700
By the way, I have a question.

100
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,500
What is the relationship between you and Kim Jihun?

101
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,370
Relationship? What do you mean?

102
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,000
I mean, even at the ER

103
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,720
and at the club last time.

104
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,280
The way he treats you...

105
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,310
How should I put it?

106
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,030
It doesn't seem like you're just friends.

107
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,000
Jihun is normally very nice.

108
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,540
No matter how nice, a friend chases you to the ER?

109
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,270
How loyal.

110
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:25,090
Hey. You took me to the ER, too.

111
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,020
It's like that.

112
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,370
It shouldn't be like that.

113
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,980
I like you.

114
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,690
Also, Jihun...

115
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,560
He said something strange in the ER.

116
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,990
He said he was your girlfriend.

117
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:48,100
Oh, hey! I'm sorry!

118
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

119
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,380
Oh, it's okay.

120
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,200
Here.

121
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,800
Here, too.

122
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,900
I got some here, too. Here.

123
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,840
I got some here, too.

124
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,760
Also over here.

125
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,110
It also got on me here.

126
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,240
I know, but maybe you should do it.

127
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,830
What's up with you? This is a precious blouse.

128
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,100
Sorry. I'll pay for the dry cleaning.

129
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,200
It's fine. I'm joking.

130
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,470
It happens.

131
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,530
Why are you so flustered?

132
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,130
Park Yunjae!

133
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,460
You were at school?

134
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,610
I sent you a text saying I'll empty my locker.

135
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,640
You did?

136
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,530
You texted...

137
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,210
Why didn't I see it?

138
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,470
Because I didn't send one.

139
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,670
Even if I did, you wouldn't have seen it.

140
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,100
Huh?

141
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,980
I see. You're here to pick up your stuff.

142
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,080
You should have called.

143
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,710
Hi again.

144
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,570
Do you also attend this school?

145
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,750
I'll go with "no comment".

146
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,010
"No comment" just because you don't like the question?

147
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,740
I've felt this since last time,

148
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,170
but are you into seeming mysterious?

149
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,300
What?

150
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,880
I mean, every time I see you,

151
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,220
you don't seem transparent about anything.

152
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:37,190
Did you hear her? I don't seem transparent about anything.

153
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,610
I've never heard that in my life.

154
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,130
You haven't eaten, have you?

155
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:44,250
There's a new malatang place near the back gate. Do you want to go?

156
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,990
That's a place I told you about!

157
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,410
What?

158
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,960
You want us to go somewhere that that girl told you about?

159
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,770
"That girl"? Did you just call me "that girl"?

160
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,380
Yes. Why?

161
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,650
That person, that person. That person, that person.

162
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,710
I call everyone "that."

163
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:03,250
This is why you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.

164
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,960
Are you talking about yourself?

165
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,460
Then, you must think I'm pretty, too.

166
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,380
I think I'm prettier.

167
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,720
What are you guys doing?

168
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,700
- You're both pretty, so— 
 - What?

169
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,850
We're both pretty?

170
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,510
What I mean is...

171
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,810
The pretty people are talking, so stay out of this.

172
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,490
This is so ridiculous.

173
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,770
I find this even more ridiculous.

174
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,890
Stop it. Let's go and get some malatang, okay?

175
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,400
Hey, good luck with the experiment.

176
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,710
If you go with me, the potato noodles are free.

177
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,580
I thought you had experiments left.

178
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,340
I can pull an all-nighter after having some malatang.

179
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,360
Hey, hey. Can you let me go?

180
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,160
- Let's go. 
 - Hey, hey.

181
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,650
Go like this?

182
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,530
Let go!

183
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,100
Hey!

184
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,790
We need to get inside. Let go of him.

185
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,820
You let go first.

186
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,610
Can both of you let go?

187
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,260
What's with him?

188
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,320
You let go.

189
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,320
Hey! One second!

190
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,440
Let's go inside.

191
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,650
What's all this?

192
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,440
What's wrong with you?

193
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,360
Let go!

194
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,040
- Let go! 
 - It's my seat.

195
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,740
I don't like the window seat.

196
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,950
Same for me, the sun will tan my face.

197
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,550
You won't tan with all that makeup on.

198
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,450
What are you saying? I'm pretty much bare-faced.

199
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:49,170
Go sit down. People are staring.

200
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,370
What?

201
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,800
Sit.

202
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,810
- You're trying too hard. 
 - Me?

203
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,720
I'm not.

204
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,880
Now, I feel a tiny little kick.

205
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,940
Really? I'm not so sure.

206
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,670
Yunjae, could you get more fish balls?

207
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,570
The fish balls are good here.

208
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,180
If you want to eat them, go and get them yourself.

209
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,390
Why make Yunjae do it?

210
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,590
Want me to grab them? The fish balls?

211
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,560
I'll go and get them.

212
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,780
Ah, so spicy.

213
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,880
Here.

214
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,420
I knew you were trying too hard.

215
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,940
Don't hang out with her. I really don't like her.

216
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,490
Who said we were hanging out?

217
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:43,150
It seemed like you two were hanging out.

218
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,550
Why did you suggest a malatang place?

219
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,790
And let her follow us?

220
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,710
Seriously, Park Yunjae.

221
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,140
So spicy.

222
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,400
So spicy.

223
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,230
But you saw that I won, right?

224
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,300
I finished off the last bit of broth.

225
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,000
But that was too spicy, Park Yunjae.

226
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,830
I think my lips are all swollen.

227
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,190
 It had been a while 

228
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:32,230
 since you were as you are, 

229
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,910
 and I was as I am. 

230
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:39,770
 You and me, complaining like ordinary lovers. 

231
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,500
I want to kiss you.

232
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,360
What?

233
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,350
What?

234
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,690
What?

235
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,630
What did you just say?

236
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,310
Me?

237
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,730
I don't know. Did I say something?

238
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,160
Hey.

239
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,230
What are you doing?

240
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,860
So what? There's almost no one here.

241
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,060
You should have just told me.

242
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,900
   

243
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,500
Thank you.

244
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,670
I didn't leave this book behind.

245
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:53,770
Really? It was at the table.

246
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,720
 They said if he keeps pushing it and doesn't get hospitalized, 

247
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,530
 it wouldn't be strange if your dad passed away tomorrow. 

248
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,300
 What do we do, Yeongseok? 

249
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,400
I'll take him.

250
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,060
Unless you bring a fiancée, don't come.

251
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,810
 Your father's passing is one thing, 

252
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,230
but I won't watch my son get beaten to death.

253
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,840
Bye.

254
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,400
   

255
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,840
Yes, Jeongja.

256
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,540
I'm sorry. Did you wait long?

257
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,490
But what's going on at this hour?

258
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:01,000
Why do you think I'm here at this hour?

259
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,970
Obviously, I'm here to see you.

260
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,640
Get in.

261
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,580
Take it.

262
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,880
What is this?

263
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,160
If you're curious, open it.

264
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,210
You're giving this to me?

265
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,680
- Why? 
 - Oh, my.

266
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,270
I'm more offended than when I was asked to buy a watch.

267
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,820
What do you mean by "why"?

268
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,200
I'm sorry. What I mean is...

269
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,800
- I don't think I deserve to accept this watch. 
 - You do.

270
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,440
Don't you remember?

271
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,430
You had me wait for 13 minutes when we first met,

272
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:50,240
and 45 minutes at the anglerfish place.

273
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,430
A total of 58 minutes.

274
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,460
I'm sorry.

275
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,690
I can be late, sure.

276
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:59,950
But I hadn’t waited that long for someone in a while.

277
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,350
Consider it a nudge for being naughty.

278
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,470
So take it.

279
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:09,830
I'm sorry. I don't usually make people wait like that.

280
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,760
Actually, that's an excuse.

281
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,910
I'm sorry.

282
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:16,070
Can you stop saying you're sorry?

283
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,210
It's a habit.

284
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,570
I'm sorry.

285
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,990
I-I-I'm not sorry.

286
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,180
That's not it.

287
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,780
Are you serious?

288
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:29,720
Hey, do you have anything else to say besides sorry?

289
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,090
You really are like my dad today.

290
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,380
If you say sorry even one more time,

291
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,410
this Nuna will get very upset with you.

292
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,560
I'm warning you.

293
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:47,980
I-I get scared of loud noises.

294
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,990
I-I'm sorry.

295
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:03,050
I told you I'll get upset with you if you say sorry.

296
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,720
It won't end like this next time.

297
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:22,770
   

298
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,340
Hello. We are number one in our field,

299
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,620
with 700K successful couples matched.

300
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:37,540
I'm Team Leader Kim Ji Hye from Noblesse Lovelige.

301
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,390
Shin Donghun.

302
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,480
Ideal type.

303
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,890
"Graduate from one of the top 3 universities, professional career,

304
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:50,030
a woman who doesn't skimp on self-care."

305
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:53,650
"For our future children, she must be taller than 170cm?"

306
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,150
"No blood type Bs. Reason?"

307
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,160
"My mom is a Type B. When Type Bs meet, they frequently fight each other."

308
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,710
"I don't want conflict between my mom and my wife."

309
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,090
Do you have a cigarette?

310
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,410
Let's go.

311
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,640
Thank you.

312
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,990
   

313
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,460
You like coming to work, don't you?

314
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,380
Cigarettes or alcohol, quit one of the two.

315
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:37,950
This company isn't worth ruining your health for.

316
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,080
Thanks.

317
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,410
You're the only one who cares about me here.

318
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,240
Hey, Team Leader.

319
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,400
I'm quitting.

320
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:57,670
You decided for sure this time?

321
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,320
Before it's too late,

322
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,920
I'm going to look for my true dream and love.

323
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,100
Dream and love, huh?

324
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,970
That's great.

325
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,630
Fighting!

326
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,340
Hello?

327
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,830
Hey, Yunjae.

328
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,530
Hello, Nunim.

329
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,730
Well, I must've surprised you by coming to your workplace.

330
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,900
A little.

331
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,540
But what's up? Is this about Jieun?

332
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,590
Well, of course.

333
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,670
If you want to break up with Kim Jieun but can't tell her,

334
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:52,120
- I— 
 - It's not that.

335
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,040
Even if that were the case,

336
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,930
I'm not pathetic enough to ask for such a favor.

337
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,740
Right?

338
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,450
Yes.

339
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,580
So, why do we need to meet in secret without Jieun's knowledge?

340
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,990
 This is the women's bathroom! 

341
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:26,040
I'm sorry!

342
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,580
 The hardest thing for her? 

343
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,730
 I mean, she was a girl, then became a guy. 

344
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:35,930
 Everything must be awkward and confusing. 

345
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:40,070
Look. Your bra and panties are mismatched again.

346
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,910
Give it back. Also, with that face...

347
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,460
Don't say "bra."

348
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,200
What else would I call it, then?

349
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,260
I got it, so shut up.

350
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,130
What's wrong with her?

351
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:57,600
♫  The way you look at me  ♫

352
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,830
 I'm sure it's not the same with her family, friends, and people around her. 

353
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,640
   

354
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,370
 She must be worried about her future, too. 

355
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,040
 Forget getting a full-time job. 
   

356
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,630
 She can't even get a part-time job. 

357
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:18,410
 There's no way to have any kind of credibility. 

358
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:21,630
   

359
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:24,310
♫  I see you  ♫

360
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:29,740
♫  Always I know, more than I see  ♫

361
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,670
♫  It's not a dream  ♫

362
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:35,180
♫  You become clearer  ♫

363
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:39,180
♫  I hear you  ♫

364
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,240
♫  Eyes don’t lie, oh it's you  ♫

365
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,430
♫  Will you remember?  ♫

366
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,660
♫  I promise you  ♫

367
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,790
♫  In every moment  ♫

368
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,440
Where should we go?

369
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,480
- Yuna. 
 - Let's go, go.

370
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,470
- Where should we go? 
 - Who was that?

371
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,760
- Where? 
 - Don't know.

372
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,640
Yuna.

373
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,780
Yuna!

374
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:06,400
- Y-Yuna, I have something to say— 
 - What?

375
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:16,140
The makeup you said you wanted the last time.

376
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,440
You know you're a bit terrifying right now?

377
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,770
Terrifying?

378
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:22,470
I'm being nice and giving.

379
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,840
How's my kind smile?

380
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,370
You look like a possessed monk.

381
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:29,260
What's going on out of the blue? Huh?

382
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,530
Can I...

383
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:36,790
help you find your 12th-grade identity?

384
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,720
Is it right that you can't spit at a smiling face?

385
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,630
I feel the spit in my mouth.

386
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,180
Dang.

387
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,030
This isn't easy.

388
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,750
Who taught her that?

389
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,230
Kim Jihun. Yeonhui University. Currently on academic leave.

390
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,370
The reason is personal. Hobby is reading.

391
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,700
Military service, army, discharged.

392
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,570
Unit...

393
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,620
Unit...

394
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,970
Yangpyeong. Yangpyeong. That's where I was.

395
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:21,090
Position...

396
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,300
Tank driver.

397
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,450
What's that?

398
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,640
A tank.

399
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,580
Forget it. Just memorize up to Yangpyeong.

400
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,410
I'll cut them off afterward.

401
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:34,920
But, Yunjae,

402
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:39,150
would he really ask about the military in a tutor interview?

403
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:42,410
To my dad, the fact that you served

404
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:45,030
means more than attending Yeonhui University.

405
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:48,540
He was a non-commissioned officer for 30 years,

406
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,660
so you need to be understanding.

407
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,060
Remember it.

408
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,910
Yangpyeong.

409
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,260
Yangpyeong.

410
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,860
Okay.

411
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,480
Yangpyeong.

412
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,560
Yangpyeong.

413
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,260
Say hi.

414
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:11,520
My name is Kim Jihun, attending Yeonhui University, currently on academic leave.

415
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,620
The reason is personal, and reading is my hobby.

416
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,030
My goodness, how much tutoring have you done

417
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,930
that it's coming out of you like you're a machine.

418
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:22,490
Don't be nervous.

419
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,420
We've already met.

420
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,810
He can't help being nervous.

421
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:29,110
He's an accomplice.

422
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,350
Let's sit and eat some fruit.

423
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,150
Come sit.

424
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:51,320
We don't expect too much.

425
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:56,200
What does it matter if she goes from the 25th to 22nd place?

426
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,700
How can you pay for tutoring and dream so small?

427
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,360
She never wanted to study before in her life.

428
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:07,340
But unbelievably, she suddenly wants to get tutored.

429
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,270
But...

430
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:13,250
when I heard handsome Jihun tutors,

431
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,440
I picked up on it right away.

432
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:20,910
My daughter takes after me...

433
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:24,400
and likes good-looking people.

434
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,210
What? Mom!

435
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:30,020
That joke only works on people who haven't seen Dad!

436
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,810
So funny. She's so funny. So funny.

437
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,900
Honey.

438
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:44,970
When was the last time our son brought a friend home?

439
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:48,300
I don't know. Not since middle school.

440
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,680
It's been a while.

441
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,910
Boys are like that.

442
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,100
Blaming Korean men to cover up the fact that you have no friends?

443
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:02,130
Teacher, this is an error of generalization. Right?

444
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,620
Yuna, you're so smart.

445
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,710
Jihun, eat.

446
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,010
But, Jihun,

447
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:16,900
have you done your military service?

448
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,170
Yes! I was honorably discharged from the army!

449
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:22,080
Really?

450
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:26,470
I don't know if you heard about it, but I—

451
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:29,070
Dad, I already told him.

452
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,390
You served our country for 30 years as a non-commissioned officer.

453
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,810
You did.

454
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:34,730
So, where did you serve?

455
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:35,940
What was your position?

456
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,960
Yes! I served in Pyeongyang!

457
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,810
- Up— 
 - I drove a tank and served my country!

458
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,910
Pyeongyang.

459
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,490
Stop laughing.

460
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,390
I wasn't laughing.

461
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,040
Look at me.

462
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:17,380
I won't let you get away with even a tiny mistake.

463
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,740
A tiny mistake?

464
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,810
It was a confession that shook up national security.

465
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,110
Hey!

466
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:26,810
Okay, okay. I'll stop.

467
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:28,730
Pyeongyang.

468
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:31,320
Yeah.

469
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:34,590
Choi Yuri, what's wrong?

470
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,890
Don't cry. Tell me.

471
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,500
Did you drink?

472
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,490
Where are you?

473
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,100
Hey, Choi Yuri!

474
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,720
My best friend!

475
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,210
Oh my. Puppy is here, too.

476
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:55,550
- Puppy? 
 - "I go wherever Kim Jieun goes."

477
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:01,940
♪ My puppy collar bell is ringing! ♪

478
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,070
Are you crazy?

479
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:09,390
You can't even drink a glass of alcohol.

480
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,940
How much has she had?

481
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:13,580
She can't even have a shot of soju.

482
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,460
Just so you know, the bottle is already open, so no refunds.

483
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,320
What?

484
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,370
Looks good.

485
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,580
So good.

486
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,520
Puppy, have a glass.

487
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,390
No thanks.

488
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:34,550
What's going on?

489
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:39,510
I'm a web novelist who writes romances.

490
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:42,330
The fact that I've been single since birth

491
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,560
is so sad.

492
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,270
But that's just who you are.

493
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:47,240
Why are you sad all of a sudden?

494
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,650
So rude!

495
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,910
Puppy, why are you dating her?

496
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,330
Why won't you break up with her?

497
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,800
She's a guy. Not a girl.

498
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,050
Hey! Be quiet.

499
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:01,970
Some girl can turn into a guy and still be loved.

500
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:04,940
My life is sure... something else.

501
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:08,070
Why? Did someone say something?

502
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,890
Being single since birth is a trend these days.

503
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:14,100
It wasn't decided for you. You chose this life.

504
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,280
Be proud.

505
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,470
Right, Yunjae?

506
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,630
Huh?

507
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:22,110
Yeah, right.

508
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,080
Is it a crime to be single since birth?

509
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,680
It's no use destroying your liver and getting hurt over it.

510
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,590
Right, Yunjae?

511
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:34,520
Yeah. Sure.

512
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,530
Why are you asking him?

513
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,800
I went on a blind date today.

514
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,900
Whoa, amazing. Really?

515
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,950
Why are you only mentioning that now?

516
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,590
Who introduced you?

517
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,310
It was Mina.

518
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,350
She's also a web novelist.

519
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:53,200
So? How was it?

520
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,340
 Oppa. 

521
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,660
 Choi Yuri? 

522
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,610
 Who are you? 

523
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:18,230
 Mina introduced me... 

524
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:20,580
 I'm Yang Seongwon. 

525
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,550
 No, please. 

526
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,370
He seemed like 100 years old,

527
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:05,540
but he was only 41.

528
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,700
A twist, right?

529
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:11,320
If we get married, I would have to live with and take care of his parents and grandparents.

530
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,960
So cozy, isn't it?

531
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:16,850
But you know what's even funnier?

532
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,990
This wasn't his first time.

533
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:21,270
A 44-year-old thrice-divorced,

534
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,090
and a hot 23-year-old with bad credit.

535
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:25,870
Even a minister with six older sisters.

536
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,980
But I'm a Buddhist!

537
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:32,990
Hey. Am I that bad?

538
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:36,570
Puppy, am I really that bad?

539
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,780
No.

540
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,840
You're professional and awesome.

541
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,210
But not pretty?

542
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:47,200
Oh, yes.

543
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,780
Huh?

544
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:19,330
 Yuri, how was the blind date today? 

545
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:21,280
 I heard you left because something urgent came up. 

546
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,730
 Gosh, you're so entitled. 

547
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,450
 Don't forget about my birthday party this weekend. 

548
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:30,020
 I invited him, too, so make sure you get dolled up. 

549
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,340
Napkins!

550
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,740
I'll do it.

551
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,900
Okay.

552
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,800
You got some on your pants, too.

553
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,670
 It also got on me here. 

554
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:51,540
 I know, but maybe you should do it. 

555
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,060
That girl...

556
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,770
 Jieun. 

557
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:31,740
 Since you're in this state, can't you just be my boyfriend? 

558
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:35,370
 Hey. I don't think you're drunk. Come down. 

559
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,380
 No! I'm drunk! 

560
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:42,900
 Then, stop talking nonsense and hang on. I'm tired. 

561
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,130
 It's not nonsense. 

562
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,890
 I'll treat you better than Puppy does. 

563
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,450
 I'll love you more. 

564
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:53,370
 You won't even have to lift a finger. 

565
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:56,770
 I'll take such good care of you. 

566
00:36:56,770 --> 00:37:03,460
 I can love you no matter what you look like. 

567
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,000
 Thanks for the kind words, friend. 

568
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,390
 But I have to go back to being a girl and being Yunjae's girlfriend. 

569
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,790
 Don't I, Yunjae? 

570
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,100
 Yeah. 

571
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,650
 You're so heavy. 

572
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,230
 What did you eat? 

573
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,140
 "Titan," the biggest satellite in Saturn's orbit, 

574
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:02,990
 is deviating at a rate faster than the Moon is from Earth. 

575
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:06,120
 A thorough calculation based on the data observed 

576
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,540
 by Cassini, the research spacecraft, 

577
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:14,030
 shows that Titan is moving 11 cm further away from Saturn every year. 

578
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:18,160
 A planet expected to be in place... 

579
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:45,210
 Jieun. 

580
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:49,290
 Since you're in this state, can't you just be my boyfriend? 

581
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:51,880
 I'll treat you better than Puppy does. 

582
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,350
 I'll love you more. 

583
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:55,160
 You won't even have to lift a finger. 

584
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,100
 I'll take such good care of you. 

585
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,390
You're up?

586
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,960
Huh?

587
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,720
- Yeah. 
 - Go wash up. I made kimchi fried rice.

588
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,410
Okay.

589
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,120
Wow, Kim Jieun! Your skills are still there!

590
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,850
Good, right?

591
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,680
It's Jihye.

592
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,000
She wants to know where you slept.

593
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,400
You can see that?

594
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,440
My eyesight is 1.5 and 1.2.

595
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,960
Then, why do you wear glasses? You've always worn them.

596
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,020
You could consider it my identity.

597
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,150
Identity?

598
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:50,440
Wow, crazy.

599
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,740
By the way, why don't you write?

600
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,700
You were the happiest when you wrote.

601
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,810
Why bother now?

602
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:19,140
Not just anyone can write.

603
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,790
 You're not staying until the end? 

604
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,230
 Let's go. 

605
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:31,050
 If your name's not called in the Honorable Mentions, it's done. 

606
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,820
 But there's second place and first place. 

607
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:36,150
 Let's just go and get tteokbokki. 

608
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:39,050
 Hey, you should've told me sooner 

609
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:43,900
 that there was this beautiful way to play hooky legally! 

610
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,500
 This is so nice. 

611
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,050
 Look at those cute college oppas. 

612
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:50,580
 Hey, make sure you bring me along. 

613
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:55,580
 I now want to be a literary girl, too. 

614
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:59,250
 You always doze off in literature class, though. 

615
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,880
 What literary girl? 

616
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:10,300
 Hello? 

617
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,160
 Yes, this is Choi Yuri. 

618
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,770
 What? 

619
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:18,820
 Who is that? 

620
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:23,540
 I got First Place. 

621
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,080
 What? 

622
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,930
   

623
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,600
Hey. You should be thanking me.

624
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,560
If you hadn't followed me to the contest,

625
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,290
you wouldn't have this fame and wealth.

626
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:38,290
I wouldn't have any deadlines either.

627
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:40,050
True.

628
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,530
Kim Jieun.

629
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,240
You know...

630
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,020
there's someone who always makes the top comment on my web novels.

631
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,910
I sometimes...

632
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:57,150
No, I pretty often edit my drafts based on their comments.

633
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:01,260
Sometimes, they even help me decide on the ending.

634
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,770
Really?

635
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:05,330
I see.

636
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:07,890
I'm saying you're talented, Kim Jieun.

637
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:50,050
   

638
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:08,260
   

639
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,910
 Jieun, thanks. 

640
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:15,730
What is this, Choi Yuri?

641
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:19,000
This is why you're always behind on your deadlines.

642
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,820
 I'm saying you're talented, Kim Jieun. 

643
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,260
 Honey. 

644
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:00,790
 Did you wait long? 

645
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,560
Yunjae!

646
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:23,550
It's Jihun!

647
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:32,850
Hyeong, I missed you so much.

648
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:34,640
Let's go.

649
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,590
Come over here.

650
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:44,700
But do you really need him to cheer up Yuri?

651
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:47,880
Yuri normally likes cute guys,

652
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,900
so I thought Minhyeok could be her boyfriend for the day.

653
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:56,490
I am pretty cute, but... she's not my type.

654
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:57,670
Why not?

655
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:58,950
What's wrong with Yuri?

656
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:02,460
If that's the case, you do it, Jihun.

657
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:05,740
A prince on a white horse. Who would be more fitting than you?

658
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,840
Prince on a white horse?

659
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,140
People think the prince on the white horse

660
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:13,520
is there to save the damsel in distress,

661
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,510
but that's not true.

662
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:18,690
He's there to piss off the witch who put the princess

663
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:20,740
in distress.

664
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,680
Look.

665
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:35,670
Who wouldn't be jealous of a princess who has a guy like you?

666
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,120
The witch will totally lose it.

667
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:46,250
Can I?

668
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:49,610
Why do you have to ask Yunjae?

669
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:52,990
If it upsets you, I won't.

670
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,840
She's your friend.

671
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,060
Get her revenge.

672
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,760
Nice...

673
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,160
- What? 
 - Nice...

674
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:28,380
You look like a snapper in season.

675
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:31,150
So shiny.

676
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,190
Look in the mirror.

677
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:37,560
Gosh, dang it.

678
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:44,910
Give it to me.

679
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:46,500
W-What?

680
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,460
Stay still.

681
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,570
I'm sorry I called you a snapper.

682
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,610
Kim Jihye.

683
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:01,550
Open your eyes and look at me.

684
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:04,140
Don't call my name.

685
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:07,350
What? What do you want me to do?

686
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:10,700
Am I that handsome?

687
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:13,620
Yes.

688
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:18,590
♫  Happy birthday, dear Mina!  ♫

689
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:21,870
♫  Happy birthday to you!  ♫

690
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:28,190
Congratulations!

691
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:30,140
Thank you!

692
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:32,440
Should we do cheers?

693
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,860
 Cheers! 

694
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:37,880
Thanks for coming, everyone.

695
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,140
 Happy birthday! 

696
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:45,820
Eonni, happy birthday.

697
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,750
Who is that, Mina?

698
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,210
You know.

699
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:53,160
She's a little sister I adore.

700
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,500
She won the Reader Favorite prize for "The Private Life of a Goddess."

701
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,370
- This is Glass Shoes. 
 - Writer Glass Shoes?

702
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:59,820
Glass Shoes?

703
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:03,400
She's supposed to be anonymous. Did I mess up?

704
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:07,080
I told you she looks like a goddess in real life.

705
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,610
Right?

706
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:11,370
Sure, she does.

707
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:12,760
Hey, Mina!

708
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,030
Oppa!

709
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:15,410
Thanks for coming!

710
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:16,820
Mina, happy birthday.

711
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:19,200
Thanks.

712
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,790
Yuri, hello.

713
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:22,920
Oh, hello.

714
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:27,040
I got stuck in traffic. That's why I'm late.

715
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,700
Why are you...

716
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,760
What?

717
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,210
Didn't you see my text?

718
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:36,010
I told you he was coming.

719
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:39,800
He said he really likes you.

720
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,540
Get married while you have a shot.

721
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:44,690
To have a smart kid, you should give birth at a young age.

722
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:49,000
- Oppa, the two of you can talk. 
 - Sure.

723
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,850
Let's hang out by ourselves.

724
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,140
Yuri.

725
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:58,820
There's an amazing goat stew (Heugyeomso-tang) place around here.

726
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:01,740
I'll treat you to the full course today.

727
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,260
No, I'm okay.

728
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:06,180
No, we'll have goat stew first.

729
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:08,740
There's also a great wine bar around.

730
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,930
- Don't feel pressured. 
 - No, I...

731
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:12,590
It's just goat stew.

732
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:15,790
- Goat stew. 
 - I'm really okay.

733
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:24,100
Yuri.

734
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,270
Hey, what are you...

735
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:30,000
You told me you had plans.

736
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,130
Who are you here to see, all dolled up?

737
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:37,440
- So handsome. 
 - I know.

738
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,760
What's going on?

739
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:44,560
Oh my, hello.

740
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,980
- Who is this? 
 - Well...

741
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,910
this is Mina.

742
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:53,170
The one I told you about.

743
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:55,880
Oh, the writer of "The Clumsy Gynocology Office"?

744
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,420
Oh, yes.

745
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:59,320
I'm a fan.

746
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,810
Oh my! What?

747
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:05,410
Gosh, I see.

748
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:09,150
Who is this?

749
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:10,610
This is my friend—

750
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:12,070
I'm Kim Jihun.

751
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:14,570
Kim Jihun.

752
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,570
I'm Yuri's boyfriend.

753
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,390
W-Wait, boyfriend?

754
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:30,720
Did Yuri not tell you?

755
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,400
This is the first time I'm hearing this.

756
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:36,990
- It's not that... 
 - Choi Yuri.

757
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:39,400
I'm hurt.

758
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:44,090
You went on a blind date when you had a boyfriend?

759
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:47,220
No. That's not it.

760
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:54,130
Oppa, I had no idea she was this kind of girl.

761
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:56,360
Damn!

762
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,910
Oppa!

763
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:04,350
- Hey. 
 - I think there has been a misunderstanding.

764
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:06,550
This is not my boyfriend.

765
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:09,340
I'm actually not her boyfriend.

766
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,700
It's one-sided love.

767
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:16,930
One-sided love?

768
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:19,790
So, you like Yuri?

769
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:21,290
Yes.

770
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:23,390
For the past 10 years.

771
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:30,060
Hey, you can't even drink. What's with the wine?

772
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:32,770
And what's this on your hair?

773
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,480
Also, your skirt is a little short today.

774
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,910
Mina's is shorter.

775
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:05,300
I miss you.

776
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,370
I miss you.

777
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,370
I wonder how they're doing.

778
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:01,210
Why I like her?

779
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:05,870
I don't know. I just like everything about her.

780
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:10,670
Her big eyes, hidden behind the glasses.

781
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:13,870
Her strength, hidden behind humility.

782
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:18,770
Her femininity that even her cuteness cannot hide.

783
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:24,390
You sound scripted.

784
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:28,690
Yuri didn't plan this and hire you, did she?

785
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:31,150
- You didn't pay him for this, did you? 
 - What?

786
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:33,730
Since you're a popular web novelist,

787
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:36,520
your imagination is quite wild.

788
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:40,330
But I see why you're not as popular as Yuri.

789
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:44,030
- What? 
 - Romance is about emotional arcs.

790
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:46,510
You like to set up the game,

791
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:49,430
but you don't understand emotions.

792
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:55,600
Otherwise...

793
00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:00,800
how can you see the way I'm looking at her

794
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:05,050
and think of words like "hire" and "pay"?

795
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:11,620
I sincerely like Choi Yuri.

796
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:26,020
Can I take her away now, if you don't mind?

797
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:31,900
Yeah, sure.

798
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,050
Go ahead.

799
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:35,940
Thank you. Let's go.

800
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:38,500
 Oh my gosh! 

801
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:45,020
So hot.

802
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:49,580
I swear on my decade-long writing career.

803
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:53,250
That's not Choi Yuri's boyfriend.

804
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:57,550
Kim Jihun at Yeonhui University, right?

805
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:05,790
Hey.

806
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:08,570
You should be bowing to me. Where are your manners?

807
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:10,600
Who told you to do this?

808
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:11,960
This?

809
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,340
I avenged you in the name of justice.

810
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:16,500
Didn't you see Mina get pissed and foam at the mouth?

811
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,030
Exactly.

812
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:20,780
Why are you doing my avenging?

813
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,600
Are you looking down on me, too?

814
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,590
Choi Yuri.

815
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:30,660
- That's harsh. 
 - I've been single since birth.

816
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:34,670
What if I fall for you and confess my feelings for you?

817
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:43,830
See? You hesitated.

818
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:46,800
I didn't think that through.

819
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,600
- I was careless. 
 - You should have thought about it.

820
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,040
You...

821
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:58,200
You don't realize how hard I'm trying not to have feelings for you, do you?

822
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:05,470
I keep forgetting what I look like when I'm next to you.

823
00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:07,330
I'm sorry.

824
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:09,620
Don't apologize. Why are you apologizing?

825
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,820
What are you sorry for?

826
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:17,110
You did this for me.

827
00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:22,410
I don't even know why I'm so angry right now.

828
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:24,600
But I am.

829
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:32,490
Let's part ways here tonight.

830
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,470
I'll call you tomorrow.

831
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:57,040
How do I look?

832
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,910
Pretty.

833
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:02,780
- What? 
 - I said you look pretty.

834
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:10,940
I would have come sooner if I knew you would say that.

835
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,200
Hey.

836
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:19,800
I mistook you for someone else when you came in.

837
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:24,600
Even now?

838
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,470
What?

839
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:30,910
Are you still mistaking me for someone else?

840
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,860
No, it's not that.

841
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:36,970
Then we're good.

842
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:38,870
What is?

843
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:40,580
You're no longer mistaken,

844
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:44,920
but you're still looking at me like you did before.

845
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:09,690
♫  A strangely familiar feeling  ♫

846
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:17,090
♫  The same warmth, a steady flutter  ♫

847
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:24,470
♫  Beyond the fading sunset  ♫

848
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:31,680
♫  Your light seeps quietly into me  ♫

849
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:36,500
♫  I see you  ♫

850
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:41,170
♫  Always, I know more than I see  ♫

851
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:42,990
♫  It's not a dream  ♫

852
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:46,430
♫  You're growing clearer  ♫

853
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:51,300
♫  I hear you  ♫

854
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:55,660
♫  Eyes don’t lie, oh it's you  ♫

855
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:57,750
♫  Will you remember?  ♫

856
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:59,990
♫  I promise you  ♫

857
00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:02,400
♫  In every moment  ♫

858
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,410
    
 ♫  I'll see you  ♫

859
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:15,980


860
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,710
 We look like a couple that just fought. 

861
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:34,260
 What? 

862
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:35,540
 Why? 

863
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:37,500
 Why does it seem like that? 

864
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,760
 Because of my expression? 

865
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,700
 - Should we take another one? 
 - No. 

866
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:48,030
 Other couples usually stand close to each other and hold hands. 

867
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:50,920
 They look sweet. 

868
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:56,490
 I-I'm sorry. 

869
00:59:56,490 --> 01:00:00,310
 I've never done s-something like this. 

870
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:03,950
 You don't need to stutter. 

871
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:16,370
 I can hold onto you like this. 

872
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:25,070
♫  You let me stay  ♫

873
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:30,290
♫  In the place where you belong  ♫

874
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:34,430
♫  Facing the night so long  ♫

875
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:39,360
   

876
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,900
♫  Running wild in the days of youth  ♫

877
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:45,470
♫  Running wild in the days of youth  ♫

878
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:49,780
♫  And we'll get even closer  ♫

879
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:52,280
♫  Blessed be the time we shared  ♫

880
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,940
♫  Blessed be the time we shared  ♫

881
01:00:56,050 --> 01:01:00,070
♫  We will build our home someday  ♫

882
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:04,370
♫  In a place full of flowers  ♫

883
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:10,680
   

884
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:13,550
 I stayed up all night, thanks to you.

885
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:15,250
 Hyeong, did you break up with your girlfriend? 

886
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:17,280
 People say he's Yeonhui University's doe-eyed hottie. 

887
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,900
 Isn't he so handsome? 

888
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,930
 This is Writer Glass Shoes' boyfriend. 

889
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:23,190
 Babe, you made it. 

890
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:26,070
 Kiss! Kiss! 

891
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:28,050
 Everyone's talking about Kim Jihun. 

892
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:31,210
 - You two... are serious about each other, right? 
 - Yeah. 

893
01:01:31,210 --> 01:01:32,920
 - Park Yunjae, what about you? 
 - Huh? 

894
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,840
 What? Motel? 

895
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,050
 Is he cheating? 

896
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:39,030
 Jihun, why are you here?
