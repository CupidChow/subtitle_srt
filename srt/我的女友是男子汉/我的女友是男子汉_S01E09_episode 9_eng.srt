1
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,360
   

2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,980
   

3
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,410
   

4
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,780
   

5
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,370
   

6
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:42,190


7
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:44,333
 Nunim, the door is open. 

8
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:47,093
I'll check and let you know.

9
00:00:47,093 --> 00:00:48,723
Okay.

10
00:01:09,813 --> 00:01:11,913
Yunjae.

11
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:16,063
What are you guys doing?

12
00:01:16,063 --> 00:01:17,633
What?

13
00:01:24,173 --> 00:01:25,863
S-So...

14
00:01:25,863 --> 00:01:27,733
Yunjae?

15
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:30,873
Why are you he—

16
00:01:35,243 --> 00:01:39,103
Exactly. Why are you sleeping next to me, Oppa?

17
00:01:39,103 --> 00:01:41,983
Why are you asking me?

18
00:01:41,983 --> 00:01:44,173
Are you pulling my hair right now?

19
00:01:44,173 --> 00:01:45,893
Hey! Won't you let go?

20
00:01:45,893 --> 00:01:47,313
- Let go! 
 - You let go!

21
00:01:47,313 --> 00:01:48,703
You first!

22
00:01:48,703 --> 00:01:50,033
Hey, hey, hey! Guys! Wait!

23
00:01:50,033 --> 00:01:53,593
- Let go! 
 - Wait, guys!

24
00:01:53,593 --> 00:01:55,063
You little skank!

25
00:01:55,063 --> 00:01:56,743
Watch how this skank will kill you!

26
00:01:56,743 --> 00:01:58,533
Stop!

27
00:01:58,533 --> 00:01:59,973
Hey!

28
00:01:59,973 --> 00:02:01,233
Use your words.

29
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:03,433
- This is our apartment. 
 - So why am I asleep here?

30
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:05,113
- What would I do to you? 
 - Stop it!

31
00:02:05,113 --> 00:02:07,323
Why would I make a move on you? Come here!

32
00:02:07,323 --> 00:02:09,033
- What the heck! 
 - You guys!

33
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:11,333
- You guys! 
 - Wait, wait.

34
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,003
- Get over here. 
 - Are you crazy?

35
00:02:13,003 --> 00:02:15,173
- You're dead. Get over here! 
 - It was your fault!

36
00:02:15,173 --> 00:02:17,163
No, no, no! The hair, hair!

37
00:02:17,163 --> 00:02:20,563
Wait, stop! 
    

38
00:02:20,563 --> 00:02:22,133
Use your words.

39
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:23,433
How dare you?

40
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:26,233
- What the heck? 
 - Stop it.

41
00:02:27,963 --> 00:02:30,923
I swear. Nothing happened between us.

42
00:02:30,923 --> 00:02:32,763
You're not misunderstanding this, are you?

43
00:02:32,763 --> 00:02:36,263
I don't go to bed with some random guy and stuff like that.

44
00:02:36,263 --> 00:02:38,443
He was burning with a fever,

45
00:02:38,443 --> 00:02:42,203
so I sat by his side to support and protect him...

46
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:46,193
and then got tired and accidentally fell asleep.

47
00:02:48,183 --> 00:02:51,583
Oppa! You don't have ulterior motives toward me, do you?

48
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:52,903
Me?

49
00:02:52,903 --> 00:02:55,933
I feel like you crossed my boundary in the name of support and protection.

50
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:58,723
I'm extremely flustered right now.

51
00:02:58,723 --> 00:03:01,583
Oppa, you would've croaked if it weren't for me. You know that?

52
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:04,983
I prefer to die in a classical melodrama rather than in a messy crime of passion.

53
00:03:04,983 --> 00:03:06,983
See, see? He said melodrama.

54
00:03:06,983 --> 00:03:08,883
I have no desire to shoot a melodrama with you.

55
00:03:08,883 --> 00:03:10,583
You're not the main character.

56
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,763
Also, stop calling me "Oppa."

57
00:03:12,763 --> 00:03:16,343
You are an "oppa." What else would I call you?

58
00:03:18,493 --> 00:03:20,383
Stop!

59
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:23,593
Leave it if nothing happened.

60
00:03:24,433 --> 00:03:28,133
I'll let Jihye know that you were okay.

61
00:03:29,193 --> 00:03:31,353
- You're leaving? 
 - I should go.

62
00:03:31,353 --> 00:03:33,783
You also need to rest some more.

63
00:03:33,783 --> 00:03:35,753
I had better wash up.

64
00:03:35,753 --> 00:03:38,583
Let's go, Oppa. What time is it?

65
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,703
I'm so offended.

66
00:03:51,563 --> 00:03:54,873
- I'm leaving. Rest. 
 - Okay.

67
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:12,533
You pass. Good night.

68
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,413
You really passed.

69
00:04:29,413 --> 00:04:31,423
Good night for real.

70
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:47,533
Gosh, it hurts. So annoying.

71
00:04:49,993 --> 00:04:51,963
Why are you out here?

72
00:04:51,963 --> 00:04:54,553
- T-To see you off. 
 - Why bother?

73
00:04:54,553 --> 00:04:56,363
Go back inside.

74
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,813
Don't tell me what to do!

75
00:04:57,813 --> 00:05:00,163
Plus, I'll repeat.

76
00:05:00,163 --> 00:05:02,253
I hope you don't misunderstand.

77
00:05:02,253 --> 00:05:04,463
He was passed out on the stairs,

78
00:05:04,463 --> 00:05:05,983
and I couldn't just look away.

79
00:05:05,983 --> 00:05:07,733
I fell asleep nursing him.

80
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:10,803
Whatever happened on the bed was beyond my control.

81
00:05:10,803 --> 00:05:13,683
I got it. I understood.

82
00:05:13,683 --> 00:05:15,333
But...

83
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:19,433
Even then, slapping him was a little too much.

84
00:05:20,203 --> 00:05:22,943
Didn't you see him yank my hair?

85
00:05:22,943 --> 00:05:26,363
He almost ripped all my hair out!

86
00:05:26,363 --> 00:05:28,293
How could a guy grab a girl's hair?

87
00:05:28,293 --> 00:05:31,493
Hey. Whether it's a guy or a girl, if you're attacked first—

88
00:05:31,493 --> 00:05:33,433
Is Jihun a polar bear?

89
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:36,333
- Is he a penguin from the South Pole or so? 
 - Huh?

90
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,173
- Out of the blue? 
 - Listen to you.

91
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:41,883
He's not an endangered species. Why do you protect him so much?

92
00:05:45,523 --> 00:05:48,833
Does your girlfriend know about you two, Oppa?

93
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:53,813
You two might be friends, but I would hate it if I were your girlfriend.

94
00:05:53,813 --> 00:05:55,363
Well...

95
00:05:55,363 --> 00:05:58,093
I guess that could happen.

96
00:05:59,373 --> 00:06:01,603
"I guess that could happen"?

97
00:06:01,603 --> 00:06:04,833
If that's how you feel, just come to me.

98
00:06:07,393 --> 00:06:09,713
Just not today.

99
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,783
Let's not decide this by ourselves.

100
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:24,333
Let us both love him.

101
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:28,193
It could be one of us or neither.

102
00:06:28,193 --> 00:06:30,903
Yeongseok will figure it out.

103
00:06:39,193 --> 00:06:41,443
Did you eat yet?

104
00:06:43,063 --> 00:06:45,573
Is your mother okay?

105
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:48,463
Yes, she's resting.

106
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:52,833
So, do you know each other?

107
00:06:55,213 --> 00:06:57,953
We first met as a client and employee.

108
00:06:57,953 --> 00:07:03,263
Then as eonnie-dongsaeng and now competitors.

109
00:07:03,263 --> 00:07:05,063
What?

110
00:07:05,063 --> 00:07:07,133
What does that mean?

111
00:07:30,373 --> 00:07:32,313
 Yeongseok. 

112
00:07:32,313 --> 00:07:34,003
Yes.

113
00:07:34,003 --> 00:07:36,563
Wait here. Stay.

114
00:07:40,423 --> 00:07:43,183
Thank you so much, Eonni.

115
00:07:43,183 --> 00:07:45,023
Yeah? What for?

116
00:07:45,023 --> 00:07:48,033
For saying it should be fair play.

117
00:07:48,913 --> 00:07:51,823
I'm in.

118
00:07:59,673 --> 00:08:01,003
Take this from me.

119
00:08:01,003 --> 00:08:02,923
Oh, geez.

120
00:08:02,923 --> 00:08:05,173
What's all this?

121
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:08,913
Side dishes and...

122
00:08:10,913 --> 00:08:12,313
braised short ribs.

123
00:08:12,313 --> 00:08:14,833
Your grandpa... no...

124
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:18,573
Your grandma sent them over. Saying it was your favorite.

125
00:08:19,213 --> 00:08:21,573
It is my favorite.

126
00:08:21,573 --> 00:08:23,213
But that's so much.

127
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:26,313
How can Sis and I eat all that?

128
00:08:26,313 --> 00:08:29,543
Making big portions runs in our family.

129
00:08:32,473 --> 00:08:35,783
I wish that were the only thing we passed down to you.

130
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,173
I know.

131
00:08:50,593 --> 00:08:56,533
I won't hide anything from you anymore.

132
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:59,593
Ask me anything you're curious about.

133
00:08:59,593 --> 00:09:03,443
This is so sudden that I'm at a loss for words.

134
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:04,883
But I had a lot of questions.

135
00:09:04,883 --> 00:09:06,933
Take your time.

136
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:10,393
- We'll close the shop today. 
 - The shop?

137
00:09:10,393 --> 00:09:13,923
You should've let me know in advance. I would've written them down.

138
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:23,703
Are you... still afraid?

139
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:28,213
I used to be.

140
00:09:28,213 --> 00:09:34,483
But... it wasn't about me becoming a man again.

141
00:09:34,483 --> 00:09:36,823
I was afraid it would happen to you girls.

142
00:09:36,823 --> 00:09:39,003
I've been constantly worried.

143
00:09:39,003 --> 00:09:41,863
And it happened to me.

144
00:09:43,393 --> 00:09:44,993
Yes.

145
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:50,663
That's why I'm not afraid of anything anymore.

146
00:09:50,663 --> 00:09:53,483
I'm not scared of anything.

147
00:09:53,483 --> 00:09:59,843
My desire to protect my daughter has made me braver.

148
00:10:04,713 --> 00:10:08,133
I could stay like this for the rest of my life, right?

149
00:10:09,553 --> 00:10:11,633
Like Grandma.

150
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:18,223
Yes.

151
00:10:20,873 --> 00:10:28,803
I should tell Yunjae that we should break up, shouldn't I?

152
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:34,123
That's his decision to make.

153
00:10:34,123 --> 00:10:36,533
You should be honest with him, though.

154
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:38,523
You like him.

155
00:10:38,523 --> 00:10:41,853
He might stick it out because he's nice.

156
00:10:43,273 --> 00:10:45,933
Pretending he's okay with it when he's not.

157
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,923
Pretending he's not hurting when he is.

158
00:10:49,923 --> 00:10:52,883
He won't be able to keep that up forever.

159
00:10:53,803 --> 00:10:56,323
I went through it, too.

160
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:14,413
Why is the professor looking for me?

161
00:11:14,413 --> 00:11:16,553
You'll find out soon enough.

162
00:11:22,113 --> 00:11:24,353
Hi. Take a seat.

163
00:11:24,353 --> 00:11:26,653
Mr. Park.

164
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:28,303
- Miss Kang. 
 - Hi.

165
00:11:28,303 --> 00:11:30,483
Nice to see you.

166
00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:33,613
So.

167
00:11:34,963 --> 00:11:37,403
I've got good news for you.

168
00:11:37,403 --> 00:11:41,233
I have a very special proposal for you.

169
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:46,163
How would you like to come study at Corning University?

170
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:49,103
- Of course. 
 - Of course!

171
00:11:49,103 --> 00:11:51,273
Well, there you go.

172
00:11:51,273 --> 00:11:53,473
   

173
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:02,943
Wow. Oppa, this is insane.

174
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:05,453
Are we going to the States?

175
00:12:06,713 --> 00:12:09,013
I can't believe this.

176
00:12:09,013 --> 00:12:10,203
You heard him, right?

177
00:12:10,203 --> 00:12:12,173
He was so impressed with our presentation

178
00:12:12,173 --> 00:12:15,093
that he came all this way.

179
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:17,693
I know, right?

180
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:20,013
I can't believe this is happening.

181
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,093
It's Corning University we're talking about.

182
00:12:23,093 --> 00:12:25,633
Only 20 minutes from the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

183
00:12:25,633 --> 00:12:27,423
It's amazing.

184
00:12:30,503 --> 00:12:35,633
But... I need to think about it.

185
00:12:35,633 --> 00:12:37,923
Are you crazy? You're going to think about it?

186
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,943
Why?

187
00:12:39,943 --> 00:12:42,213
It's not an easy decision to make.

188
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:43,593
Why isn't it?

189
00:12:43,593 --> 00:12:47,443
You have a rare opportunity knocking at your door.

190
00:12:47,443 --> 00:12:51,413
No one is as serious about space as you.

191
00:12:52,613 --> 00:12:54,663
Park Yunjae.

192
00:12:55,513 --> 00:12:59,443
Whatever the reason is, you'd be an idiot to miss this opportunity.

193
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:01,703
Get yourself together.

194
00:13:02,933 --> 00:13:07,033
If you don't go, I'll drag you there.

195
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,940
   

196
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,463
It really is very cool.

197
00:13:26,593 --> 00:13:28,343
Yunjae.

198
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:31,733
- You're here. 
 - Did you wait long?

199
00:13:31,733 --> 00:13:34,453
No. I could've gone to you.

200
00:13:34,453 --> 00:13:37,613
It's been a while, so I wanted to come to campus.

201
00:13:37,613 --> 00:13:38,963
And I have something to tell you.

202
00:13:38,963 --> 00:13:40,493
Something to tell me?

203
00:13:40,493 --> 00:13:42,913
Why don't we take a walk?

204
00:13:42,913 --> 00:13:44,573
Sure.

205
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,093
Instead of holding your finger or linking arms,

206
00:13:57,093 --> 00:13:58,963
let me do this.

207
00:14:00,553 --> 00:14:02,093
Sure.

208
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:18,853
I can do this.

209
00:14:18,853 --> 00:14:20,643
I have to.

210
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:31,023
There's a new café on campus. It's yummy.

211
00:14:31,023 --> 00:14:32,873
Thanks.

212
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:41,203
Yunjae.

213
00:14:41,203 --> 00:14:44,633
I'm getting used to living as a man.

214
00:14:45,933 --> 00:14:49,383
It definitely is more convenient to live as a man than as a woman.

215
00:14:49,383 --> 00:14:51,193
Yeah.

216
00:14:51,193 --> 00:14:55,063
Things that used to be burdensome as a woman are now easier.

217
00:14:55,063 --> 00:14:59,823
And this guy can do stuff that Kim Jieun couldn't do.

218
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:03,683
What did this guy do?

219
00:15:03,683 --> 00:15:06,383
Well, you know.

220
00:15:06,383 --> 00:15:10,643
Things like taking everything out to recycle in one trip.

221
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:14,693
Or being able to wear clothes that I was too short for.

222
00:15:14,693 --> 00:15:18,613
I can even take out plates from the top shelf without a chair.

223
00:15:19,423 --> 00:15:22,453
And put my arm around Park Yunjae.

224
00:15:28,233 --> 00:15:32,433
I think I'll also be able to work up the courage...

225
00:15:33,303 --> 00:15:36,873
and tell you what Kim Jieun could never say.

226
00:15:37,613 --> 00:15:40,743
"What Kim Jieun could never say"?

227
00:15:40,743 --> 00:15:42,613
What's that?

228
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,933
You know, Park Yunjae,

229
00:15:55,773 --> 00:15:57,733
I recently found out about this.

230
00:15:57,733 --> 00:15:59,633
Watch out!

231
00:16:00,853 --> 00:16:02,833
- I'm sorry. 
 - Are you okay?

232
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,453
Did you get hurt?

233
00:16:04,453 --> 00:16:05,873
No.

234
00:16:05,873 --> 00:16:07,423
How about you?

235
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,283
I'm okay.

236
00:16:11,973 --> 00:16:13,783
Yunjae.

237
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:18,553
I have something to tell you.

238
00:16:19,523 --> 00:16:21,743
You're getting a call.

239
00:16:21,743 --> 00:16:25,003
   

240
00:16:25,003 --> 00:16:27,033
I don't need to pick it up.

241
00:16:27,773 --> 00:16:30,313
I might...

242
00:16:30,313 --> 00:16:32,423
never...

243
00:16:33,923 --> 00:16:37,823
   

244
00:16:37,823 --> 00:16:40,603
   

245
00:16:48,313 --> 00:16:50,613
So, Park Yunjae...

246
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:54,623
I might never turn back...

247
00:16:55,883 --> 00:16:58,273
Come on. Didn't I just turn my phone off?

248
00:16:58,273 --> 00:17:00,353
It's mine this time.

249
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:05,293
It's Lee Minhyeok.

250
00:17:10,413 --> 00:17:12,283
Ta-da.

251
00:17:12,283 --> 00:17:14,883
What are you guys doing here? How did you get in?

252
00:17:14,883 --> 00:17:16,803
Why are you asking so many questions?

253
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:18,563
I entered the passcode.

254
00:17:18,563 --> 00:17:22,333
Your mom said we should share the braised beef short ribs with you.

255
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,743
Minhyeok, try it. It's so delicious.

256
00:17:31,613 --> 00:17:35,573
His grandfather is a legendary cook in Pohang.

257
00:17:35,573 --> 00:17:39,093
But when did you two get so friendly?

258
00:17:39,093 --> 00:17:40,963
You didn't know?

259
00:17:40,963 --> 00:17:44,623
We run and sweat together at night.

260
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:51,693
Come on. Run. Running.

261
00:17:51,693 --> 00:17:53,883
Running crew.

262
00:18:02,553 --> 00:18:05,203
Oppa, did you see my earring in your bed?

263
00:18:05,203 --> 00:18:07,423
Why are you looking for it in my bed?

264
00:18:07,423 --> 00:18:11,393
What's wrong with you? Because we slept together.

265
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,863
What in the world?

266
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:18,343
No, right?

267
00:18:18,343 --> 00:18:20,983
Y-You were all here.

268
00:18:23,283 --> 00:18:25,763
Wow. I can join, too, right?

269
00:18:29,673 --> 00:18:31,363
Smells good. 
    

270
00:18:31,363 --> 00:18:33,463
Huh? It's Grandpa. Let me pick up.

271
00:18:33,463 --> 00:18:35,323
Hey, later.

272
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,593
Grandpa! It's Yuri.

273
00:18:37,593 --> 00:18:40,213
 Geez, Yuri! Long time no see! You were all together. 

274
00:18:40,213 --> 00:18:44,203
I came to eat the braised beef short ribs you sent, and... it's so tasty.

275
00:18:44,203 --> 00:18:46,083
 Really? I'm so glad. 

276
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,913
What? Are they dating?

277
00:18:48,913 --> 00:18:52,443
I'm with friends. I'll call you later.

278
00:18:53,413 --> 00:18:54,923
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

279
00:18:54,923 --> 00:18:56,053
Hello.

280
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:57,913
 There are so many of you. 

281
00:18:57,913 --> 00:18:59,213
 Perfect. 

282
00:18:59,213 --> 00:19:02,203
Since you're all eating the meat I sent,

283
00:19:02,203 --> 00:19:04,973
come down this weekend and help out here.

284
00:19:04,973 --> 00:19:07,043
What do you mean? Is something happening?

285
00:19:07,043 --> 00:19:09,583
There's always something happening here.

286
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,333
Come, eat a lot of delicious food,

287
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,613
gaze at the stars, and do some healing!

288
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:17,263
Well then, see you this weekend.

289
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,863
He hung up.

290
00:19:20,863 --> 00:19:23,663
- I have plans this weekend. 
 - I have meetings.

291
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,053
Did he also invite me?

292
00:19:25,053 --> 00:19:26,883
I'll move things around.

293
00:19:26,883 --> 00:19:30,823
No, it's okay. Don't worry. I'll go by myself.

294
00:19:30,823 --> 00:19:33,623
Why don't we start by eating the braised short ribs?

295
00:19:33,623 --> 00:19:36,403
We can't let it cool down. Are you eating, too?

296
00:19:36,403 --> 00:19:38,023
Yes, it smells good.

297
00:19:38,023 --> 00:19:40,383
It's a luxury for a student who lives alone.

298
00:19:40,383 --> 00:19:42,363
- Is there rice? Should I get some? 
 - No.

299
00:19:42,363 --> 00:19:44,283
I saw some rice over there.

300
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:47,333
It's crowded here, so let's head over there.

301
00:19:58,693 --> 00:20:00,833
- Wow, look at this. 
 - Where's rice again?

302
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,383
Eat rice later.

303
00:20:03,383 --> 00:20:05,653
The perilla leaves look good, too.

304
00:20:05,653 --> 00:20:08,043
Who made this?

305
00:20:23,253 --> 00:20:27,443
   

306
00:20:29,003 --> 00:20:32,473
I'll ask him all my questions this time.

307
00:21:00,263 --> 00:21:02,253
- What's with you guys? 
 - What do you mean?

308
00:21:02,253 --> 00:21:04,213
We're workers.

309
00:21:04,213 --> 00:21:05,973
You don't need to do this.

310
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,933
You all said you have plans.

311
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,933
That aside, how could you all—

312
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:12,233
How long have you been here?

313
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:14,193
I started a group chat.

314
00:21:14,193 --> 00:21:16,163
I got intel from Grandpa.

315
00:21:16,163 --> 00:21:19,123
I want to eat lots of tasty food, stargaze, and heal.

316
00:21:19,123 --> 00:21:21,663
I joined because Yunjae said he's going.

317
00:21:24,133 --> 00:21:26,773
Someone couldn't read the room and invited her.

318
00:21:26,773 --> 00:21:30,133
It's because Grandpa invited everyone in the room.

319
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:33,843
Hey, let's go. There's no time for this. We'll miss the bus.

320
00:21:33,843 --> 00:21:35,193
Let's go!

321
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:36,803
Let's go.

322
00:21:38,883 --> 00:21:40,613
Let's go.

323
00:21:49,423 --> 00:21:51,233
Do you see over there?

324
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:53,343
- Here? 
 - Take it.

325
00:21:53,343 --> 00:21:54,923
Looks great.

326
00:21:54,923 --> 00:21:57,363
- Take a picture for us. 
 - Fighting!

327
00:21:57,363 --> 00:21:59,063
Fighting!

328
00:21:59,063 --> 00:22:02,313
One, two, three.

329
00:22:02,313 --> 00:22:04,593
Get it, get it!

330
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:11,993
♫  If I pick up the broken pieces and join them to form one shape ♫

331
00:22:11,993 --> 00:22:16,623
♫  Will that moment come together as one?  ♫

332
00:22:16,623 --> 00:22:18,573
 Fighting! 

333
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:24,743
Rock, paper, scissors.

334
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,353
- You go. 
 - Rock, paper, scissors.

335
00:22:29,133 --> 00:22:31,743
♫  Can't stop, can't stop thinking about  ♫

336
00:22:31,743 --> 00:22:35,213
One, two, shoot!

337
00:22:35,213 --> 00:22:37,433
♫  Will I be able to escape  ♫

338
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:42,083
♫  I wander around you again  ♫

339
00:22:44,183 --> 00:22:47,293
Since it's such a clear day, we'll be able to see lots of stars at night.

340
00:22:47,293 --> 00:22:49,763
Right?

341
00:22:49,763 --> 00:22:53,543
♫  Can't stop, can't stop thinking about you  ♫

342
00:22:53,543 --> 00:22:56,663
- Hey. 
 - Sit here, Yuri.

343
00:22:56,663 --> 00:22:59,243
One! One, two, three!

344
00:22:59,243 --> 00:23:01,733
 Hooray! 

345
00:23:01,733 --> 00:23:06,053
♫  Can't stop, can't stop thinking about you  ♫

346
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,523
All right, come on in.

347
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:20,593
- Look at the view. 
 - It's so beautiful.

348
00:23:21,963 --> 00:23:23,053
All right.

349
00:23:23,053 --> 00:23:25,743
For the next five hours, we'll work at the dock.

350
00:23:25,743 --> 00:23:28,443
The rest will be free time, so let's get to it.

351
00:23:28,443 --> 00:23:30,683
We'll be working for five hours?

352
00:23:30,683 --> 00:23:32,493
Gosh, Grandpa.

353
00:23:32,493 --> 00:23:35,043
I stayed up all night to meet a deadline.

354
00:23:35,043 --> 00:23:36,633
I should've gone to my job.

355
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:40,123
I'll get you all coffee. See you in five minutes.

356
00:23:40,123 --> 00:23:43,643
The first room inside is for the guys. The inner room is the girls' room.

357
00:23:43,643 --> 00:23:46,343
You should feed everyone before making them work.

358
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:48,243
They all got up early and must be hungry.

359
00:23:48,243 --> 00:23:51,213
If you're full, you'll be sleepy and inefficient.

360
00:23:51,213 --> 00:23:52,613
You're totally right.

361
00:23:52,613 --> 00:23:54,533
Yes, got it!

362
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,903
Let's go. Let's go.

363
00:23:56,903 --> 00:23:59,353
Follow me.

364
00:23:59,353 --> 00:24:01,983
Okay, the inner room inside.

365
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:03,423
The first room.

366
00:24:03,423 --> 00:24:05,583
Hurry up, hurry.

367
00:24:08,033 --> 00:24:09,753
You stay in my room.

368
00:24:09,753 --> 00:24:12,043
The host's quarters.

369
00:24:13,033 --> 00:24:14,733
Let's go.

370
00:24:30,073 --> 00:24:32,353
I'm glad you came, Sweetie.

371
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:36,233
We last saw each other at the hair salon like that,

372
00:24:36,233 --> 00:24:37,693
and this is how we meet again?

373
00:24:37,693 --> 00:24:39,993
No consolation, no encouragement, but labor?

374
00:24:39,993 --> 00:24:42,193
It's all love.

375
00:24:44,163 --> 00:24:46,733
I'll go and make coffee. Come on out.

376
00:24:46,733 --> 00:24:50,293
Oh, right. I had better put on sunscreen.

377
00:24:50,293 --> 00:24:52,293
Okay.

378
00:24:55,683 --> 00:24:57,933
Don't forget to put it on, too.

379
00:24:57,933 --> 00:25:01,933
You get more sunburned at the beach.

380
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:21,673
Gosh.

381
00:25:21,673 --> 00:25:23,823
What a cutie-pie.

382
00:26:17,403 --> 00:26:19,993
How did I not know?

383
00:26:36,743 --> 00:26:39,293
So fresh, isn't it?

384
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:06,963
- Hello, sir. 
 - Hey.

385
00:27:06,963 --> 00:27:08,533
 Hello. 

386
00:27:08,533 --> 00:27:14,033
Okay, you'll be sorting fish over here today.

387
00:27:17,203 --> 00:27:19,003
- What? 
 - Pardon?

388
00:27:19,003 --> 00:27:21,343
We don't have to do all this, do we?

389
00:27:21,343 --> 00:27:23,013
Of course, you do.

390
00:27:23,013 --> 00:27:25,873
Mr. Kim will show you how.

391
00:27:25,873 --> 00:27:28,280
- Are you all ready? 
 - No.

392
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,293
- Yes. 
 - No.

393
00:27:29,293 --> 00:27:31,123
Come on. Hurry.

394
00:27:31,123 --> 00:27:33,803
- Fighting! Hurry. 
 - Let's go.

395
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:39,133
Fighting, fighting.

396
00:27:39,133 --> 00:27:41,980
Pass it down.

397
00:27:43,293 --> 00:27:46,640
More is coming.

398
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,703
- It's heavy. 
 - It's okay.

399
00:27:49,703 --> 00:27:51,283
You're doing well.

400
00:27:51,283 --> 00:27:54,423
Let me take it slow. Take it slow.

401
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:58,173
What the heck! What am I supposed to do?

402
00:27:58,173 --> 00:28:00,493
What's this?

403
00:28:02,783 --> 00:28:04,973
Good job.

404
00:28:04,973 --> 00:28:06,110
Got it.

405
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,930
Ah.

406
00:28:18,643 --> 00:28:21,153
You're doing well.

407
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:26,733
- I'll do it. 
 - Thanks.

408
00:28:37,233 --> 00:28:39,963
- Aren't you moving them? 
 - Are you blind?

409
00:28:39,963 --> 00:28:42,643
Help the right person!

410
00:28:45,073 --> 00:28:48,393
Oh, right. He's weaker than he...

411
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,523
He's stronger than you. He used to do Kendo.

412
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:54,103
Hurry up and pick mine up.

413
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:00,963
Wait.

414
00:29:07,843 --> 00:29:10,553
How is it going?

415
00:29:10,553 --> 00:29:13,383
- Doing well. 
 - Boo!

416
00:29:13,383 --> 00:29:14,913
Stop!

417
00:29:14,913 --> 00:29:17,443
Go away!

418
00:29:17,443 --> 00:29:19,943
Why is she so scared of fish?

419
00:29:30,243 --> 00:29:33,113
Gosh, perfect.

420
00:29:33,113 --> 00:29:35,353
Jieun.

421
00:29:35,353 --> 00:29:36,833
Jihun.

422
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:39,583
Kim Jihun.

423
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:41,693
Grandpa, you're getting confused again.

424
00:29:41,693 --> 00:29:45,133
Oh yes, Kim Jihun. When you get old, it happens.

425
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:48,113
Jihun, follow me for a minute.

426
00:29:51,763 --> 00:29:53,713
I'll be right back.

427
00:29:57,863 --> 00:29:59,553
Look.

428
00:30:40,233 --> 00:30:44,933
I'm not sure where to start.

429
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:52,653
Tell me anything you want to say.

430
00:30:52,653 --> 00:30:54,333
I knew you would say that,

431
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:57,403
so I brought a list of questions for you.

432
00:30:58,313 --> 00:31:02,463
Mom said the same thing last time, and I blanked out.

433
00:31:02,463 --> 00:31:03,723
Good job.

434
00:31:03,723 --> 00:31:06,073
You're a smart girl.

435
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:07,333
All right.

436
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:10,573
Let's hear it.

437
00:31:11,263 --> 00:31:14,723
When and where did you become a man?

438
00:31:14,723 --> 00:31:17,203
How many times did you turn back and forth?

439
00:31:17,203 --> 00:31:20,723
How did you make a living once you became a man?

440
00:31:20,723 --> 00:31:23,143
How did your mom take it?

441
00:31:23,143 --> 00:31:25,983
How did you create a new identity?

442
00:31:25,983 --> 00:31:29,023
What do I do when I need an ID?

443
00:31:29,023 --> 00:31:31,493
What was your husband like?

444
00:31:31,493 --> 00:31:33,413
How did things end?

445
00:31:33,413 --> 00:31:38,303
If you could choose now, would you go back to being a woman?

446
00:31:48,393 --> 00:31:50,463
I'm so tired.

447
00:31:52,033 --> 00:31:54,583
Gosh, seriously.

448
00:31:54,583 --> 00:31:56,723
How much longer?

449
00:31:57,763 --> 00:32:00,803
Yunjae, can you move up my sleeve?

450
00:32:06,033 --> 00:32:07,333
- Thank you. 
 - Good?

451
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:09,143
Thanks.

452
00:32:09,923 --> 00:32:12,233
My eye. Something's in my eye. Hurry.

453
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:15,293
Blow into my eyes. My eye.

454
00:32:15,293 --> 00:32:16,323
- Again. 
 - Good?

455
00:32:16,323 --> 00:32:18,793
No.

456
00:32:18,793 --> 00:32:21,893
- One more time. 
 - Open your eyes.

457
00:32:23,133 --> 00:32:25,743
- My cheek. Something's on my cheek, isn't there? 
 - All good?

458
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,633
No.

459
00:32:29,763 --> 00:32:33,543
He left the fish with the cat. Where the hell did she go?

460
00:32:33,543 --> 00:32:36,673
- What? Where's the cat? 
 - I blew.

461
00:32:36,673 --> 00:32:38,693
- Huh? 
 - It's there. What?

462
00:32:38,693 --> 00:32:40,923
A cat? Where?

463
00:32:40,923 --> 00:32:42,833
You said there was one.

464
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:48,033
I became a man at 40 for the first time,

465
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:50,313
and I stayed this way ever since.

466
00:32:50,313 --> 00:32:53,463
Your mom was 19.

467
00:32:55,623 --> 00:32:58,423
That must've been tough for you.

468
00:32:59,663 --> 00:33:02,103
What kind of person was your husband?

469
00:33:02,103 --> 00:33:04,643
M-My husband?

470
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:08,983
That feels so awkward to say now.

471
00:33:11,043 --> 00:33:14,133
He was a good person...

472
00:33:14,133 --> 00:33:17,353
when I used to be a normal woman.

473
00:33:18,143 --> 00:33:19,933
He was a seaman.

474
00:33:19,933 --> 00:33:21,533
He was cool.

475
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:24,693
Tall and kind.

476
00:33:24,693 --> 00:33:28,033
Your mom takes after her dad.

477
00:33:28,033 --> 00:33:32,833
You can imagine how handsome he was, can you?

478
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:34,723
Yeah.

479
00:33:34,723 --> 00:33:37,953
He was such a kind person.

480
00:33:39,753 --> 00:33:41,613
But he left.

481
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:45,843
I don't think I questioned it much.

482
00:33:45,843 --> 00:33:48,593
When I explained the situation,

483
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:53,423
he honestly told me he couldn't live with me.

484
00:33:53,423 --> 00:33:55,563
I understood.

485
00:33:57,433 --> 00:34:03,533
Still, I'm grateful that he left your mom to me.

486
00:34:04,533 --> 00:34:09,233
I'm also grateful to my daughter for staying by my side.

487
00:34:11,393 --> 00:34:12,923
Oh, right.

488
00:34:12,923 --> 00:34:16,153
You asked about my mom.

489
00:34:16,153 --> 00:34:19,353
Have you heard of poems titled "Greeting of Reeds,"

490
00:34:19,353 --> 00:34:21,973
"To Be a Sunset," and "Fast Turtle"?

491
00:34:21,973 --> 00:34:24,163
"Fast Turtle"?

492
00:34:25,513 --> 00:34:27,593
That was on the college entrance exam.

493
00:34:27,593 --> 00:34:30,583
Kim Pilhyun.

494
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:32,733
That's your great-grandmother.

495
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:34,483
What?

496
00:34:34,483 --> 00:34:36,533
No way.

497
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:40,593
My mom lived her life to the fullest, even as a man.

498
00:34:40,593 --> 00:34:42,763
She had all the fun in the world.

499
00:34:42,763 --> 00:34:46,513
She enjoyed her one precious life.

500
00:34:48,033 --> 00:34:51,423
Whether you suffer or enjoy is up to you.

501
00:34:52,433 --> 00:34:58,133
Just so you know, I am trying to enjoy it.

502
00:35:00,703 --> 00:35:03,563
You're so cool, Grandma.

503
00:35:05,143 --> 00:35:07,233
Look at the world around you.

504
00:35:07,233 --> 00:35:12,833
There are too many beautiful things in the world to stay depressed.

505
00:35:43,783 --> 00:35:45,433
Still.

506
00:35:45,433 --> 00:35:50,833
I'm sorry that you were born into our family and have to face a life...

507
00:35:51,823 --> 00:35:53,763
that others can't even imagine.

508
00:35:54,453 --> 00:35:57,233
It's not even your fault, Grandma.

509
00:36:00,393 --> 00:36:02,123
Yeah.

510
00:36:03,113 --> 00:36:07,883
Wait, isn't that your boyfriend?

511
00:36:14,843 --> 00:36:17,773
How did you know he was my boyfriend?

512
00:36:17,773 --> 00:36:20,153
He told me earlier.

513
00:36:25,993 --> 00:36:27,873
 What? Do you need something? 

514
00:36:27,873 --> 00:36:30,273
 No, I just wanted to say hello. 

515
00:36:30,273 --> 00:36:34,523
 We said hello earlier. Why do it again? 

516
00:36:37,693 --> 00:36:42,023
 I'm Jieun's boyfriend, Park Yunjae. 

517
00:36:42,023 --> 00:36:44,633
 J-Jieun's? 

518
00:36:44,633 --> 00:36:46,653
 Boyfriend? 

519
00:36:49,653 --> 00:36:51,403
 So, you know everything. 

520
00:36:51,403 --> 00:36:53,633
 Yes, I know everything. 

521
00:36:53,633 --> 00:36:55,933
 Your family secret. 

522
00:36:55,933 --> 00:36:59,623
 Nice to meet you. Feel free to put me to work. 

523
00:37:00,663 --> 00:37:02,913
He's so handsome.

524
00:37:02,913 --> 00:37:05,203
And very polite.

525
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:14,183
Grandpa.

526
00:37:15,383 --> 00:37:18,313
Can you do me a favor?

527
00:37:31,093 --> 00:37:32,603
What?

528
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:36,553
Grandpa, I'm sorry.

529
00:37:37,433 --> 00:37:42,073
Yunjae, what I wanted to tell you is here.

530
00:37:42,073 --> 00:37:45,323
What I've been trying to tell you...

531
00:37:46,483 --> 00:37:48,643
is that my grandpa...

532
00:37:49,463 --> 00:37:53,983
is actually... my grandma.

533
00:37:55,263 --> 00:37:59,383
I only found out at my mom's shop a few days ago.

534
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:01,093
Huh?

535
00:38:01,093 --> 00:38:04,903
I thought it would be better to see for yourself than to hear about it.

536
00:38:08,013 --> 00:38:09,383
Sorry, Grandpa.

537
00:38:09,383 --> 00:38:13,333
No, I-I'm okay.

538
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:17,333
I'd better give you some space.

539
00:38:17,973 --> 00:38:19,473
I'm sorry.

540
00:38:19,473 --> 00:38:22,413
I had no idea and called you "Grandpa."

541
00:38:22,413 --> 00:38:24,503
But...

542
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:29,023
I should keep calling you "Grandpa" in front of the others. Right?

543
00:38:29,023 --> 00:38:30,543
Huh?

544
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:34,043
Well, I guess.

545
00:38:34,043 --> 00:38:36,083
Hey.

546
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:38,763
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

547
00:38:38,763 --> 00:38:40,323
I understand.

548
00:38:40,323 --> 00:38:42,233
Your grandpa is actually your grandma.

549
00:38:42,233 --> 00:38:45,983
No, don't you get the reason why I'm telling you this?

550
00:38:45,983 --> 00:38:47,733
Reason?

551
00:38:47,733 --> 00:38:49,373
What are you talking about?

552
00:38:49,373 --> 00:38:51,813
Let me take off.

553
00:38:51,813 --> 00:38:53,803
Go ahead and talk.

554
00:39:02,793 --> 00:39:05,793
To sum it up...

555
00:39:05,793 --> 00:39:08,753
what I've been trying to tell you all this time...

556
00:39:09,953 --> 00:39:13,743
is that I could possibly never return to being a woman.

557
00:39:15,733 --> 00:39:18,463
I also had no idea.

558
00:39:18,463 --> 00:39:22,503
I wouldn't have been able to hold on to you so confidently if I did.

559
00:39:27,733 --> 00:39:30,643
I got it, so let's go.

560
00:39:30,643 --> 00:39:33,053
We had better finish up the job.

561
00:39:33,793 --> 00:39:35,613
What do you mean, "I got it, so let's go"?

562
00:39:35,613 --> 00:39:38,523
Work is not what's important right now.

563
00:39:40,973 --> 00:39:46,283
Then... what am I supposed to do here?

564
00:39:47,223 --> 00:39:49,283
What?

565
00:39:49,283 --> 00:39:52,933
- Well, of course... 
 - You want me to break up with you?

566
00:39:56,133 --> 00:39:59,053
- What I'm saying is... 
 - I'm sure you have your reasons,

567
00:39:59,053 --> 00:40:01,553
but I have my reasons, too.

568
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:05,843
Did you think I would break up with you immediately

569
00:40:05,843 --> 00:40:08,383
once you told me that?

570
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:14,083
- No, I... 
 - It is shocking, of course.

571
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:16,263
But I don't want to do anything right now.

572
00:40:16,263 --> 00:40:19,173
I don't know what I'm supposed to do, either.

573
00:40:26,283 --> 00:40:28,603
It must've been tough.

574
00:40:29,513 --> 00:40:32,323
Thanks for telling me the truth.

575
00:40:33,093 --> 00:40:35,973
Let's go. I promised Grandpa...

576
00:40:37,933 --> 00:40:42,893
no, Grandma, that I would work hard.

577
00:40:42,893 --> 00:40:45,533
So, zip it and follow me.

578
00:41:00,543 --> 00:41:03,233
Where did Yunjae and Jihun go?

579
00:41:03,233 --> 00:41:06,763
- I'm sure they went somewhere. 
 - I'll go and look for them.

580
00:41:06,763 --> 00:41:08,953
You're checking out, too? No way.

581
00:41:08,953 --> 00:41:10,713
Why not?

582
00:41:10,713 --> 00:41:12,663
Hyeongs!

583
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:17,553
There's so much to do. Where did you go?

584
00:41:17,553 --> 00:41:20,573
We stepped out to chat for a bit. Sorry.

585
00:41:23,823 --> 00:41:26,173
- It hurts! 
 - Take the glove off.

586
00:41:26,173 --> 00:41:27,533
Take the glove off.

587
00:41:27,533 --> 00:41:29,953
- It hurts. 
 - Are you okay?

588
00:41:30,703 --> 00:41:34,033
Gosh, we had better go to the hospital.

589
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,873
- Are you okay? 
 - No, it hurts.

590
00:41:36,873 --> 00:41:38,453
Let's go in my car.

591
00:41:38,453 --> 00:41:40,473
Someone come with us.

592
00:41:40,473 --> 00:41:43,133
I'll drop you off at the hospital and come pick you up

593
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:44,943
once I'm done with work.

594
00:41:44,943 --> 00:41:47,733
- Oppa, come with me. 
 - Huh?

595
00:41:47,733 --> 00:41:50,193
- I'll go, too. 
 - You don't need to follow along.

596
00:41:50,193 --> 00:41:52,603
Otherwise, we'll never finish this today.

597
00:41:55,033 --> 00:41:57,133
You go with her.

598
00:41:57,133 --> 00:41:59,793
There has to be a guardian.

599
00:41:59,793 --> 00:42:01,643
Go with her.

600
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:06,773
Okay.

601
00:42:07,643 --> 00:42:09,363
- Let's go. 
 - Hurry, let's go.

602
00:42:09,363 --> 00:42:11,453
Let's go.

603
00:42:11,453 --> 00:42:12,633
You should've been careful.

604
00:42:12,633 --> 00:42:16,693
I said I didn't want to handle fish.

605
00:42:18,013 --> 00:42:19,643
Hurry.

606
00:42:33,813 --> 00:42:35,903
It'll sting a little.

607
00:42:38,343 --> 00:42:40,183
It'll be over soon.

608
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:41,733
It hurts.

609
00:42:41,733 --> 00:42:44,013
Count to 100.

610
00:42:44,013 --> 00:42:45,973
One.

611
00:42:45,973 --> 00:42:49,190
Two.

612
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:51,103
Good girl.

613
00:42:53,483 --> 00:42:55,543
It hurts.

614
00:42:59,093 --> 00:43:01,063
Is your hand okay?

615
00:43:01,063 --> 00:43:03,513
It's throbbing.

616
00:43:03,513 --> 00:43:06,303
You should've been careful.

617
00:43:07,353 --> 00:43:10,583
You were only helping Jihun, and it pissed me off.

618
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:11,803
What?

619
00:43:11,803 --> 00:43:14,373
He's much taller and stronger than I am,

620
00:43:14,373 --> 00:43:18,393
but you never help me, and only take care of Jihun.

621
00:43:20,643 --> 00:43:21,953
All right.

622
00:43:21,953 --> 00:43:25,513
Tell me if you need help. I'll help you, too.

623
00:43:28,613 --> 00:43:31,373
Oppa, can't you look my way a little?

624
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:35,313
I know you're not seeing your girlfriend.

625
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:38,763
Whatever the reason, you're not seeing each other right now.

626
00:43:40,593 --> 00:43:43,433
That's not for you and me to discuss.

627
00:43:44,263 --> 00:43:45,723
Fine.

628
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:48,573
Then, I'll talk about myself.

629
00:43:48,573 --> 00:43:50,733
I like you, Oppa.

630
00:43:50,733 --> 00:43:52,353
I've liked you since my freshman year.

631
00:43:52,353 --> 00:43:55,633
Way before you started dating your girlfriend.

632
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:59,123
I was going to confess my feelings after studying abroad.

633
00:43:59,123 --> 00:44:01,403
That was my plan.

634
00:44:02,583 --> 00:44:07,213
I had no idea someone else would be by your side.

635
00:44:11,963 --> 00:44:13,933
You also liked me.

636
00:44:13,933 --> 00:44:16,043
We used to stay up all night and study, eat together,

637
00:44:16,043 --> 00:44:18,493
and go to exhibitions.

638
00:44:18,493 --> 00:44:20,443
Hey, that's because you were my close junior,

639
00:44:20,443 --> 00:44:22,673
and we had similar interests.

640
00:44:22,673 --> 00:44:25,763
So you've never seen me as a woman?

641
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:27,323
Yeah.

642
00:44:28,643 --> 00:44:31,393
- You're lying. 
 - I'm serious.

643
00:44:46,573 --> 00:44:48,523
Let's go.

644
00:45:16,123 --> 00:45:18,393
We're back.

645
00:45:20,313 --> 00:45:22,793
Are you okay? Is it bad?

646
00:45:22,793 --> 00:45:24,173
I'm okay.

647
00:45:24,173 --> 00:45:26,313
Sorry to have scared you all.

648
00:45:26,313 --> 00:45:29,403
I got five stitches. I'm fine.

649
00:45:30,553 --> 00:45:33,193
I'm sorry to worry you, Grandpa.

650
00:45:33,193 --> 00:45:34,603
No need.

651
00:45:34,603 --> 00:45:36,103
Make sure you don't get it wet,

652
00:45:36,103 --> 00:45:38,533
apply the ointment, and be careful so it doesn't scar.

653
00:45:38,533 --> 00:45:40,733
- I'll do that. 
 - Goodness.

654
00:45:40,733 --> 00:45:44,993
Seoul students, you came to Grandpa's, and all you did was hard work.

655
00:45:44,993 --> 00:45:46,533
Thanks for everything.

656
00:45:46,533 --> 00:45:49,413
Yes, sir. I'll get going.

657
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,493
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

658
00:45:52,563 --> 00:45:55,873
By the way, I'm sorry.

659
00:45:55,873 --> 00:45:58,463
For interrupting your kiss.

660
00:46:01,443 --> 00:46:03,363
I'm leaving.

661
00:46:11,133 --> 00:46:14,503
Oh, right. You said you wanted marshmallows, right?

662
00:46:14,503 --> 00:46:17,283
Let me go and get some firewood.

663
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:31,333
You two... kissed?

664
00:46:33,313 --> 00:46:35,883
What? Tell us.

665
00:46:35,883 --> 00:46:38,343
Did you two kiss?

666
00:46:39,773 --> 00:46:40,813
Hey, Park Yunjae.

667
00:46:40,813 --> 00:46:43,343
Why should we tell you that?

668
00:46:43,343 --> 00:46:45,213
"We"?

669
00:46:48,733 --> 00:46:52,373
Sorry. Want to watch the fire together?

670
00:46:52,373 --> 00:46:54,393
It's hot.

671
00:46:55,703 --> 00:46:57,973
I'm hot!

672
00:46:57,973 --> 00:47:00,023
It's hot!

673
00:47:14,743 --> 00:47:16,513
Do you want some help?

674
00:47:16,513 --> 00:47:18,513
I'm okay.

675
00:47:20,783 --> 00:47:22,703
Let's talk.

676
00:47:22,703 --> 00:47:24,853
Sure, talk.

677
00:47:28,453 --> 00:47:30,833
So...

678
00:47:30,833 --> 00:47:34,593
I don't know where to start.

679
00:47:36,093 --> 00:47:38,223
It's not a lie.

680
00:47:38,223 --> 00:47:40,793
We did do it, but...

681
00:47:42,783 --> 00:47:44,163
- So... 
 - If I'm guessing right,

682
00:47:44,163 --> 00:47:47,253
Kang Minju probably ambushed you.

683
00:47:51,823 --> 00:47:54,363
What were you supposed to do?

684
00:47:54,363 --> 00:47:56,083
I understand.

685
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,803
Just get mad at me.

686
00:48:03,803 --> 00:48:06,333
Like Kim Jieun used to.

687
00:48:09,293 --> 00:48:11,003
Please?

688
00:48:15,733 --> 00:48:18,813
Would you be able to if you were me?

689
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:21,143
Do you think you could?

690
00:48:21,963 --> 00:48:25,363
I don't look like Kim Jieun to anyone.

691
00:48:25,363 --> 00:48:27,493
How can I be like Kim Jieun in this state?

692
00:48:27,493 --> 00:48:30,233
Do it. Just do it.

693
00:48:30,233 --> 00:48:32,173
At least, don't be so apprehensive around me.

694
00:48:32,173 --> 00:48:34,383
I feel most apprehensive around you.

695
00:48:37,433 --> 00:48:38,943
What?

696
00:48:39,663 --> 00:48:42,010
I said I'm most apprehensive around you.

697
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:44,680
♫  I see you  ♫

698
00:48:53,893 --> 00:48:57,613
I had no idea I made you feel that way.

699
00:49:00,423 --> 00:49:03,220
♫  I see you  ♫

700
00:49:04,013 --> 00:49:08,333
♫  I'll recognize you anytime  ♫

701
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:12,963
♫  No matter where you are  ♫

702
00:49:12,963 --> 00:49:15,103
♫  I'll recognize you  ♫

703
00:49:15,103 --> 00:49:17,733
♫  I'll see you  ♫

704
00:49:28,013 --> 00:49:31,293
- It's tough, isn't it? 
 - Pardon?

705
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:36,833
An ordinary relationship between a guy and a girl is already a challenge.

706
00:49:38,313 --> 00:49:40,183
You have way more to deal with.

707
00:49:40,183 --> 00:49:43,163
Gosh, that's not the case.

708
00:49:43,163 --> 00:49:46,533
Jieun is going through a lot. I'm okay.

709
00:49:46,533 --> 00:49:49,153
You can't possibly be okay.

710
00:49:51,133 --> 00:49:55,223
You don't need to lie to me.

711
00:49:55,223 --> 00:49:56,983
I'm really...

712
00:50:01,223 --> 00:50:06,033
To be honest... it is a little hard.

713
00:50:07,073 --> 00:50:10,463
I don't know how to help Jieun.

714
00:50:11,223 --> 00:50:13,513
Don't help her at all.

715
00:50:13,513 --> 00:50:16,533
- Be true to your own life. 
 - Pardon?

716
00:50:16,533 --> 00:50:22,623
That's the right thing to do for Jieun and for yourself.

717
00:50:23,543 --> 00:50:28,353
Happiness at someone's sacrifice doesn't last.

718
00:50:30,633 --> 00:50:35,833
You can't sacrifice your life for Jieun.

719
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:42,833
That would make Jieun the reason for all the crises you face in life.

720
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:48,033
And that will make Jieun deeply unhappy.

721
00:50:50,723 --> 00:50:52,583
I see.

722
00:50:53,743 --> 00:50:54,873
All right.

723
00:50:54,873 --> 00:50:58,233
Anyway, thank you.

724
00:50:58,233 --> 00:51:03,433
For being by Jieun's side during this tough time.

725
00:51:31,143 --> 00:51:33,223
There are so many stars!

726
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:35,743
Hey, Park Yunjae! Look at that.

727
00:51:35,743 --> 00:51:38,343
What is that moving star?

728
00:51:39,203 --> 00:51:40,683
It's an airplane.

729
00:51:40,683 --> 00:51:42,413
Oh, it is?

730
00:52:04,173 --> 00:52:05,963
Leave it.

731
00:52:07,273 --> 00:52:08,963
Wear it.

732
00:52:16,043 --> 00:52:18,263
I'll wear it, then.

733
00:52:26,363 --> 00:52:29,063
Guys, look at the stars.

734
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:32,383
Aren't they beautiful? There are so many.

735
00:52:34,433 --> 00:52:38,233
My first love's name was Byeol* ("star").

736
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:45,453
You always say things out of place.

737
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:46,593
Why bring up first love?

738
00:52:46,593 --> 00:52:48,763
What? That was perfectly appropriate.

739
00:52:48,763 --> 00:52:52,033
You're supposed to talk about those things at a campfire.

740
00:52:52,033 --> 00:52:56,533
People bring up their parents at campfires while sobbing.

741
00:52:58,333 --> 00:52:59,423
Oh, right.

742
00:52:59,423 --> 00:53:02,803
You made a decision, right? To go to Corning University.

743
00:53:10,263 --> 00:53:12,133
No.

744
00:53:12,133 --> 00:53:14,153
No?

745
00:53:14,153 --> 00:53:16,143
The astronomy department at Corning University in the US

746
00:53:16,143 --> 00:53:18,033
is a dream for people like us.

747
00:53:18,033 --> 00:53:21,583
- Let's talk later. 
 - What do you mean, "talk later"?

748
00:53:21,583 --> 00:53:23,783
Why don't we ask for everyone's opinion?

749
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:25,243
Jihun.

750
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:28,603
Let's say a famous author reached out to Yuri to collaborate.

751
00:53:28,603 --> 00:53:30,103
For three years.

752
00:53:30,103 --> 00:53:33,743
She can read all kinds of books and have discussions with the masters.

753
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:35,683
You would make her go, wouldn't you?

754
00:53:36,543 --> 00:53:37,673
Huh?

755
00:53:37,673 --> 00:53:40,743
- Why are you asking him about me? 
 - Huh?

756
00:53:41,723 --> 00:53:44,253
Aren't you two dating?

757
00:53:48,033 --> 00:53:52,703
- Didn't I mention that we broke up? 
 - What?

758
00:53:52,703 --> 00:53:55,433
You came here as exes?

759
00:53:55,433 --> 00:53:58,703
Well, we were always close friends.

760
00:53:58,703 --> 00:54:01,273
MZ's these days...

761
00:54:01,273 --> 00:54:04,133
This is what they do. No? Huh?

762
00:54:04,133 --> 00:54:05,653
S-Sure.

763
00:54:06,963 --> 00:54:09,783
She says "MZ" about everything.

764
00:54:12,283 --> 00:54:16,643
I'm sorry, but I'll go to bed first.

765
00:54:23,813 --> 00:54:25,953
I'm tired.

766
00:54:25,953 --> 00:54:28,103
I'll go in first.

767
00:54:31,033 --> 00:54:32,763
Nothing's working out.

768
00:54:32,763 --> 00:54:36,143
Why is everyone acting out on a nice day?

769
00:54:36,143 --> 00:54:37,873
No idea.

770
00:54:37,873 --> 00:54:40,853
I'm going crazy. Going crazy.

771
00:54:41,603 --> 00:54:43,663
Gosh, my eyes hurt.

772
00:54:47,633 --> 00:54:49,403
Are you okay?

773
00:54:51,863 --> 00:54:53,953
Geez.

774
00:54:53,953 --> 00:54:56,113
My eyes sting, Nuna.

775
00:54:56,113 --> 00:54:59,173
- Are you okay? 
 - Blow on them.

776
00:55:35,913 --> 00:55:40,053
 You made a decision, right? To go to Corning University. 

777
00:55:41,573 --> 00:55:43,613
 - No. 
 - No? 

778
00:55:43,613 --> 00:55:45,613
 The astronomy department at Corning University in the US 

779
00:55:45,613 --> 00:55:47,733
 is a dream for people like us. 

780
00:55:47,733 --> 00:55:50,163
 Let's talk later. 

781
00:56:24,343 --> 00:56:26,683
I was starting to miss you,

782
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:28,613
and you came right out.

783
00:56:29,343 --> 00:56:33,033
Minhyeok's snores are intense.

784
00:56:33,033 --> 00:56:34,843
His, too?

785
00:56:35,443 --> 00:56:38,453
It's the same with the girls' room.

786
00:56:38,453 --> 00:56:40,933
I got annoyed and came out, too.

787
00:56:41,823 --> 00:56:44,223
Everyone must be exhausted.

788
00:56:47,503 --> 00:56:50,213
The stars are so beautiful.

789
00:56:50,933 --> 00:56:52,773
Right?

790
00:56:53,723 --> 00:56:56,543
There are so many stars.

791
00:57:03,303 --> 00:57:05,093
Oppa.

792
00:57:06,023 --> 00:57:08,723
Can I ask you why you want to give up on going to the US,

793
00:57:08,723 --> 00:57:11,823
and why you're so conflicted?

794
00:57:17,093 --> 00:57:19,383
You're quiet again.

795
00:57:20,423 --> 00:57:23,983
It's not because of family or livelihood.

796
00:57:24,893 --> 00:57:27,003
Then, my guess...

797
00:57:28,213 --> 00:57:31,753
is that it has to do with your love life.

798
00:57:31,753 --> 00:57:34,273
Does your girlfriend have an incurable disease?

799
00:57:34,273 --> 00:57:35,933
Is she dying?

800
00:57:35,933 --> 00:57:41,433
Or is she so immature that she's weighing your dreams with your love?

801
00:57:42,303 --> 00:57:45,133
Stop making wild guesses.

802
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:54,063
It must be because of your girlfriend.

803
00:57:56,763 --> 00:57:58,613
No.

804
00:58:00,523 --> 00:58:02,623
It's because of me.

805
00:58:08,433 --> 00:58:10,333
Oppa,

806
00:58:10,333 --> 00:58:12,323
when you truly love someone,

807
00:58:12,323 --> 00:58:15,473
you cheer on that person's dreams.

808
00:58:15,473 --> 00:58:18,513
Are you not even getting that level of treatment?

809
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:21,933
Let's stop there.

810
00:58:58,163 --> 00:59:01,353
I can promise one thing.

811
00:59:01,353 --> 00:59:03,823
At least in this very moment,

812
00:59:03,823 --> 00:59:07,273
no one on Earth cares about you more than me.

813
00:59:32,503 --> 00:59:34,473
Who are you?

814
00:59:34,473 --> 00:59:36,183
You.

815
00:59:37,553 --> 00:59:39,413
Hi.

816
00:59:40,303 --> 00:59:42,703
I'm sorry, I'm late.

817
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:58,980


818
01:00:02,233 --> 01:00:06,993
♫  Even when it hurts so much I can't even walk  ♫

819
01:00:06,993 --> 01:00:12,133
♫  Even when the tears cloud my vision  ♫

820
01:00:12,133 --> 01:00:21,133
♫  I'll smile in front of my love, whom I can't have  ♫

821
01:00:21,133 --> 01:00:32,350
♫  The happy memories of us together, even the short ones, I'll treasure them with my heart  ♫

822
01:00:32,350 --> 01:00:36,530
   

823
01:00:36,533 --> 01:00:38,783
 You're Yunjae's girlfriend, right? 
 ~ Preview ~ 

824
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:40,333
 Where's Jihun? 

825
01:00:40,333 --> 01:00:45,613
 What's important is that Park Yunjae's girlfriend, Kim Jieun, is back. 

826
01:00:45,613 --> 01:00:48,233
 Am I the only one who finds this weird? 

827
01:00:48,233 --> 01:00:52,933

01:00:52,933 --> 01:00:55,833
 The final battle is today?

01:00:55,833 --> 01:00:58,083

 Jieun and Jihun. Those two. 

831
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:04,423
 Reveal yourself.

01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:09,533
♫  I'll treasure all of the happy memories with my heart  ♫
