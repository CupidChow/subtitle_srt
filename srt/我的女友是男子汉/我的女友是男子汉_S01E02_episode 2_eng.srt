1
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:10,283
   

2
00:00:12,773 --> 00:00:15,823
   

3
00:00:21,273 --> 00:00:24,373
   

4
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:29,593
   

5
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:36,173
   

6
00:00:36,173 --> 00:00:38,363
  Because the princess was beautiful,  

7
00:00:38,363 --> 00:00:42,373
 the witch was blinded with jealousy. 

8
00:00:42,373 --> 00:00:47,723
 To turn the princess into a prince, she cast a curse. 

9
00:00:47,723 --> 00:00:48,993
 Boom. 

10
00:00:48,993 --> 00:00:51,033
 Jihye and Jieun, 

11
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:54,873
 how would you feel if one day, all of a sudden, 

12
00:00:54,873 --> 00:00:56,723
 you became a boy? 

13
00:00:57,503 --> 00:00:58,573
 I think I would like it. 

14
00:00:58,573 --> 00:01:02,213
 I would be stronger and taller. 

15
00:01:02,213 --> 00:01:03,533
 I wouldn't like it. 

16
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:06,333
 Boys can't wear dresses. 

17
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:11,533
 So, this guy next to Dad is Mom? 

18
00:01:11,533 --> 00:01:13,523
 - Y-Yes. 
 - Mom. 

19
00:01:13,523 --> 00:01:17,623
 I think Dad has been watching too many dramas. He's being weird. 

20
00:01:17,623 --> 00:01:19,303
 This is hereditary. 

21
00:01:19,303 --> 00:01:22,263
 You may or may not go through it. 

22
00:01:22,263 --> 00:01:24,973
 But you should still know about it. 

23
00:01:24,973 --> 00:01:25,803
 How should I put this? 

24
00:01:25,803 --> 00:01:28,503
 Oh, right. It kind of runs in the family. 

25
00:01:28,503 --> 00:01:32,253
 It's a relief that it's not cancer or diabetes. 

26
00:01:34,963 --> 00:01:38,473
 Is it a relief? 

27
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:43,193
 Cute! 

28
00:01:43,193 --> 00:01:44,983
 Right? 

29
00:01:47,283 --> 00:01:49,683
 How can you laugh right now? 

30
00:01:49,683 --> 00:01:52,463
 Look at your belly fat. 

31
00:01:57,203 --> 00:01:58,923
 What's with her? 

32
00:02:01,563 --> 00:02:02,713
What's up?

33
00:02:02,713 --> 00:02:04,053
What brings you here at this hour?

34
00:02:04,053 --> 00:02:05,873
Let's try using it.

35
00:02:05,873 --> 00:02:07,813
The cheat key.

36
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:17,050


37
00:03:37,253 --> 00:03:39,473
She didn't see us, right?

38
00:03:41,553 --> 00:03:43,683
I don't think so.

39
00:03:56,473 --> 00:03:59,973
Good. I did a good job pretending I didn't see that.

40
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:03,733
Wait.

41
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:08,633
Even in that situation, those two are kissing, but I'm...

42
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:10,913
It's fine.

43
00:04:10,913 --> 00:04:14,413
I'm just going to have a drink today, as usual.

44
00:04:57,733 --> 00:05:01,433
No matter how I see it, he's still a guy.

45
00:05:07,743 --> 00:05:11,803
   

46
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:35,243
Why am I so nervous?

47
00:05:35,243 --> 00:05:37,313
Right. Today is not the only day.

48
00:05:37,313 --> 00:05:38,593
Next time.

49
00:05:38,593 --> 00:05:40,643
Let's do it next time.

50
00:05:40,643 --> 00:05:42,873
Excuse me, Young Man.

51
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:45,993
 It's Mom. 

52
00:05:47,703 --> 00:05:50,443
Aren't you here to get your hair done?

53
00:05:50,443 --> 00:05:51,543
Come on in.

54
00:05:51,543 --> 00:05:54,593
A lot of young people come here.

55
00:05:54,593 --> 00:05:58,003
I also do my own daughters' hair.

56
00:06:00,713 --> 00:06:02,293
Right.

57
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,433
It looked like you were busy, so...

58
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:09,503
Honey, the blow-dry is done. Please finish up.

59
00:06:10,563 --> 00:06:12,153
 It's Dad. 

60
00:06:12,153 --> 00:06:13,233
Here to get your hair done?

61
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:14,933
Come on in.

62
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:17,733
Oh, should I get you a glass of plum juice?

63
00:06:21,283 --> 00:06:24,153
I'll come back another time.

64
00:06:43,463 --> 00:06:45,083
 It's okay. 

65
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,543
 Whatever. 

66
00:06:46,543 --> 00:06:48,563
 It's so hot. 

67
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:52,133
   

68
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:55,703
   

69
00:06:55,703 --> 00:06:57,963
I guess I can't take it.

70
00:07:01,373 --> 00:07:02,723
Excuse me.

71
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:04,963
Excuse me?

72
00:07:04,963 --> 00:07:07,493
I'm a casting director.

73
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,653
Have you ever considered becoming an actor?

74
00:07:09,653 --> 00:07:11,423
- No. 
 - Really?

75
00:07:11,423 --> 00:07:15,113
Your looks scream "actor."

76
00:07:15,113 --> 00:07:17,273
Please give me a call.

77
00:07:18,803 --> 00:07:20,483
I'm okay.

78
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:22,593
Please give me a call.

79
00:07:27,023 --> 00:07:28,893
Um...

80
00:07:28,893 --> 00:07:30,833
Oppa.

81
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,643
Oppa!

82
00:07:32,643 --> 00:07:34,633
When you debut, we'll form your fan club.

83
00:07:34,633 --> 00:07:35,833
I'll be the first fan.

84
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,803
- Oppa, what's your name? 
 - You're so good-looking.

85
00:07:37,803 --> 00:07:39,683
So good-looking!

86
00:07:39,683 --> 00:07:41,923
Let's take pictures. Can we take some pictures?

87
00:07:41,923 --> 00:07:44,403
I'm sitting next to him. Oppa, do you have a girlfriend?

88
00:07:44,403 --> 00:07:46,543
- Hey, he's mine. 
 - Fine! Hurry up.

89
00:07:46,543 --> 00:07:48,543
- Look over here. 
 - Oppa, look over there.

90
00:07:48,543 --> 00:07:51,493
One, two, three!

91
00:07:59,873 --> 00:08:01,093
Sure.

92
00:08:01,093 --> 00:08:02,903
Until I return to being a woman,

93
00:08:02,903 --> 00:08:06,303
it could come in handy, so let's take care of it.

94
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,843
   

95
00:08:24,843 --> 00:08:27,543
 I successfully shaved perfectly. 

96
00:08:47,853 --> 00:08:49,993
Whoa.

97
00:08:49,993 --> 00:08:51,103
Huge eyes.

98
00:08:51,103 --> 00:08:52,733
Pale skin.

99
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:55,403
So my type.

100
00:08:55,403 --> 00:08:57,523
I love boyish girls.

101
00:08:57,523 --> 00:08:59,653
Hyeong, introduce me.

102
00:08:59,653 --> 00:09:02,903
I'll get to the bases on my own.

103
00:09:02,903 --> 00:09:06,573
Bases? Bullshit.

104
00:09:06,573 --> 00:09:09,393
Go wipe down the tables.

105
00:09:10,063 --> 00:09:12,503
Put your lips away.

106
00:09:17,663 --> 00:09:19,833
Wait, Hyeong.

107
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,983
Should we install that thing for the boss?

108
00:09:22,983 --> 00:09:24,833
What thing?

109
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,703
Kissok.

110
00:09:26,703 --> 00:09:28,103
Kiosk?

111
00:09:28,103 --> 00:09:29,583
What was it again?

112
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,473
Kissok or kiosk?

113
00:09:31,473 --> 00:09:33,273
Well, you know.

114
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,573
- The machine where you make your order. 
 - Stop.

115
00:09:35,573 --> 00:09:36,743
- Kiss... 
 - Stop.

116
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:37,758
Kiss...

117
00:09:37,758 --> 00:09:39,033
- Stop! 
 - Kiss, kiss?

118
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:41,653
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

119
00:09:42,793 --> 00:09:45,453
Kiss, kiss, kissok.

120
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:48,173
Kiss. Ok.

121
00:09:48,173 --> 00:09:52,433
- Kissok! 
 - Kissok? Kiss-ok?

122
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:54,163
Kiosk.

123
00:09:54,163 --> 00:09:56,223
- Kiss? Kisk— 
 - Hey!

124
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:59,183
It's kiosk, not kissok!

125
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:04,233
Fine! Kissok.

126
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:08,443
I mean... kiosk.

127
00:10:08,443 --> 00:10:10,173
It happens. Why are you mad?

128
00:10:10,173 --> 00:10:12,363
I'm not mad, man—

129
00:10:13,303 --> 00:10:16,203
You're suggesting it when we're not even busy.

130
00:10:16,203 --> 00:10:18,313
I was taken aback.

131
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,923
Why did it suddenly get so hot?

132
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:25,103
I'm stepping out for a second.

133
00:10:40,353 --> 00:10:42,403
This is new.

134
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:48,933
So pretty.

135
00:10:50,703 --> 00:10:52,793
I don't have this one.

136
00:11:05,663 --> 00:11:08,433
   

137
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:11,693
 Bitch, you only care about your own birthday. 

138
00:11:11,693 --> 00:11:13,143
Oh, no!

139
00:11:13,143 --> 00:11:15,573
It's Choi Yuri's birthday!

140
00:11:18,023 --> 00:11:20,453
The birthday party is over already.

141
00:11:20,453 --> 00:11:22,733
I'm late, aren't I?

142
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:24,813
Happy birthday.

143
00:11:37,223 --> 00:11:40,503
Let me explain. Open the door.

144
00:11:40,503 --> 00:11:42,973
What is this? Am I drunk?

145
00:11:42,973 --> 00:11:45,983
I haven't even opened the wine.

146
00:11:46,783 --> 00:11:50,543
Then, the perfect man on the other side of this door...

147
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,403
Who is he?

148
00:11:53,263 --> 00:11:54,973
Calm down, Choi Yuri.

149
00:11:54,973 --> 00:11:56,793
 Yuri! 

150
00:11:56,793 --> 00:11:59,483
He even knows my name?

151
00:12:01,593 --> 00:12:04,643
Wait. This can't be...

152
00:12:09,643 --> 00:12:11,533
 CEO. 

153
00:12:14,343 --> 00:12:17,273
 Are you only going to spectate again today? 

154
00:12:17,273 --> 00:12:20,103
 I'm not going to make a rash move. 

155
00:12:20,103 --> 00:12:23,693
 She shows up here at the same time every day, 

156
00:12:23,693 --> 00:12:26,493
 and will eat four servings of food. 

157
00:12:28,343 --> 00:12:31,003
What if a rich heir has been watching me from afar

158
00:12:31,003 --> 00:12:33,863
and finally decided to confess his feelings?

159
00:12:37,053 --> 00:12:39,323
Or...

160
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:41,083
 So handsome. 

161
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:45,163
 Your naughty confession, "I'll burn cigarettes, not meat," 

162
00:12:45,163 --> 00:12:47,113
  still rattles me today.  

163
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:50,563
Or maybe an old fan who was moved by my book?

164
00:12:59,173 --> 00:13:00,743
 Choi Yuri! 

165
00:13:00,743 --> 00:13:03,063
 Get it together! 

166
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:07,233
How can I help you?

167
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:10,663
What's up with the dress?

168
00:13:10,663 --> 00:13:12,623
Did you do your makeup?

169
00:13:12,623 --> 00:13:15,903
No, I'm barefaced, and this is a simple look.

170
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,463
An eyelash fell.

171
00:13:29,803 --> 00:13:33,613
The pain of creation is terrifying!

172
00:13:35,243 --> 00:13:40,313
I can see what you're looking forward to, but it's not like that.

173
00:13:40,313 --> 00:13:41,783
Take a good look.

174
00:13:41,783 --> 00:13:43,513
The penis fish is coming.

175
00:13:43,513 --> 00:13:45,233
What?

176
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:48,833
P-Penis fish?

177
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:53,593
The password that proves our 15-year-long friendship.

178
00:13:53,593 --> 00:13:56,863
Penis. Fish.

179
00:14:04,263 --> 00:14:07,263
 - So gross. 
 - So cool. 

180
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,883
 - You think it's cool? 
 - Yeah. 

181
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:11,123
 Is that a penis fish? 

182
00:14:11,123 --> 00:14:15,013
 I'm pretty sure my dad said they were cute. 

183
00:14:16,913 --> 00:14:19,043
 They're gross! 

184
00:14:19,043 --> 00:14:22,323
 I'm a bald penis fish! 

185
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,533
 Stop it! 

186
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:27,333
 - Penis fish! Penis fish! 
 - Yuri! 

187
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,283
 - Penis fish! 
 - Penis fish! 

188
00:14:30,283 --> 00:14:32,513
 - Penis fish! 
 - Penis fish! 

189
00:14:32,513 --> 00:14:35,463
 It looks like there is only one way for us 

190
00:14:35,463 --> 00:14:37,883
 to get to the center of the stage. 

191
00:14:40,323 --> 00:14:42,083
 - Penis fish. 
 - Penis fish. 

192
00:14:56,973 --> 00:14:58,723
Penis fish!

193
00:14:58,723 --> 00:15:01,443
Penis fish!

194
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:05,533
Stop it.

195
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:07,603
Stop!

196
00:15:07,603 --> 00:15:10,373
- Stop it! 
 - Penis fish.

197
00:15:11,383 --> 00:15:14,823
   

198
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,383
 The name of the bathhouse that Kim Jieun and Choi Yuri used to go to. 

199
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:26,693
 The Fairy and the Woodcutter. 

200
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:28,483
The Fairy and the Woodcutter?

201
00:15:31,743 --> 00:15:33,883
 Choi Yuri's first love. 

202
00:15:33,883 --> 00:15:35,673
 Gu Jaeyi, your tutor in seventh grade. 

203
00:15:35,673 --> 00:15:37,753
 He's now married with three kids. 

204
00:15:37,753 --> 00:15:39,523
Gu Jaeyi?

205
00:15:45,633 --> 00:15:47,933
- You passed. 
 - Thank you.

206
00:16:04,323 --> 00:16:05,863
Sure, look.

207
00:16:05,863 --> 00:16:07,443
Stare a hole into my head.

208
00:16:07,443 --> 00:16:10,123
My sister did the same as you.

209
00:16:10,123 --> 00:16:12,693
It feels like I'm looking at a pumpkin that turned into a carriage.

210
00:16:12,693 --> 00:16:14,693
I'm so fascinated.

211
00:16:14,693 --> 00:16:16,243
Can I touch you?

212
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:18,613
Don't you dare.

213
00:16:18,613 --> 00:16:20,333
Just bring me some water.

214
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,933
Water? Okay.

215
00:16:22,933 --> 00:16:24,393
Was it in fourth grade?

216
00:16:24,393 --> 00:16:28,593
You told me you might turn into a guy one day.

217
00:16:28,593 --> 00:16:32,233
I thought you were just crazy,

218
00:16:34,443 --> 00:16:36,383
but if you hadn't warned me back then,

219
00:16:36,383 --> 00:16:39,353
this would've been a lot more awkward.

220
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:44,343
What do I do with my life now?

221
00:16:44,343 --> 00:16:47,003
I know you must feel incredulous,

222
00:16:47,003 --> 00:16:49,293
but I don't think this is a disadvantage at all.

223
00:16:49,293 --> 00:16:53,423
Foremost, society will be nice to you because of your looks.

224
00:16:53,423 --> 00:16:55,633
Just look at me.

225
00:16:56,463 --> 00:16:59,113
I can't help but be nice to you.

226
00:17:04,763 --> 00:17:07,283
I can't go to school.

227
00:17:08,393 --> 00:17:10,803
I can't even get a job.

228
00:17:12,523 --> 00:17:14,613
Most of all...

229
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:16,343
Yunjae...

230
00:17:19,453 --> 00:17:22,313
I'm afraid Yunjae...

231
00:17:22,313 --> 00:17:24,533
might want to break up.

232
00:17:26,533 --> 00:17:30,433
If he wants to break up, just date me.

233
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:32,333
I'll take care of you.

234
00:17:33,603 --> 00:17:35,403
Are you okay?

235
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:39,413
I'm Jieun. Kim Jieun!

236
00:17:39,413 --> 00:17:40,883
You're not Jieun.

237
00:17:40,883 --> 00:17:42,103
You won't be.

238
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,603
Can't you just tell me you're not?

239
00:17:44,603 --> 00:17:46,273
What a nutjob.

240
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,633
No, no!

241
00:17:50,073 --> 00:17:51,823
Wow.

242
00:17:51,823 --> 00:17:56,613
I know you're my friend, but you're so hot.

243
00:17:57,873 --> 00:18:00,183
So hot.

244
00:18:00,183 --> 00:18:01,873
Extremely hot.

245
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:08,293
You're sure something.

246
00:18:08,293 --> 00:18:10,393
Aren't you tired?

247
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:16,063
Hyeong, did you leave the lights on in the café?

248
00:18:16,063 --> 00:18:18,213
What do you mean? We cleaned up and turned them off.

249
00:18:18,213 --> 00:18:20,923
But the lights are on.

250
00:18:27,693 --> 00:18:30,333
Is the boss okay?

251
00:18:31,423 --> 00:18:33,933
Don't you think the blind date failed?

252
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:36,973
I know, right?

253
00:18:36,973 --> 00:18:38,933
Did it not go well?

254
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:52,113
 Jeongja, right? 

255
00:18:52,113 --> 00:18:53,043
 I'm sorry. 

256
00:18:53,043 --> 00:18:55,553
 I've never been here before, so I got a little lost. 

257
00:18:55,553 --> 00:18:59,153
 That's okay. It happens. 

258
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,803
 Oh... my goodness. 

259
00:19:04,803 --> 00:19:07,123
 N-Nice to meet you. 

260
00:19:07,123 --> 00:19:11,513
 Just like Yunjae mentioned, you're a beauty. 

261
00:19:12,783 --> 00:19:14,963
 Ah, yes. 

262
00:19:14,963 --> 00:19:19,333
 Like I heard, you're very tall. 

263
00:19:25,473 --> 00:19:27,533
He could be a lottery ticket that hasn't been scratched on yet.

264
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,813
That's right. I can change him.

265
00:19:29,813 --> 00:19:33,823
Did I shave and everything just to meet a guy

266
00:19:33,823 --> 00:19:35,503
who has a class at 9:00 p.m.?

267
00:19:35,503 --> 00:19:36,843
It's good to be hardworking.

268
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,373
He is very tall.

269
00:19:38,373 --> 00:19:39,773
Hardworking.

270
00:19:39,773 --> 00:19:41,953
He's just tall.

271
00:19:42,853 --> 00:19:45,343
Should I fire my part-timer?

272
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:55,053
Can we just leave her like that?

273
00:19:55,053 --> 00:19:57,363
What would going inside do?

274
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,163
Let's go.

275
00:20:00,703 --> 00:20:02,223
We need to do a second round.

276
00:20:02,223 --> 00:20:04,383
You said you would buy fruit punch.

277
00:20:05,553 --> 00:20:07,003
It's too late.

278
00:20:07,003 --> 00:20:09,073
Let's go next time.

279
00:20:09,073 --> 00:20:10,323
Fruit punch.

280
00:20:10,323 --> 00:20:14,063
Fruit punch! Fruit punch! Fruit punch!

281
00:20:17,823 --> 00:20:21,753
If I buy you fruit punch, would you kiss me just once?

282
00:20:23,373 --> 00:20:26,053
If you buy me a house, I'll think about it.

283
00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:32,323
If I do it once with you, it might be easier the next time.

284
00:20:35,543 --> 00:20:37,033
Close your eyes.

285
00:20:37,033 --> 00:20:40,993
Help me use the cheat key you told me about.

286
00:20:41,693 --> 00:20:44,103
So, you'll buy me a house? Gangnam, at least 33 pyeong.

287
00:20:44,103 --> 00:20:47,273
Facing south. Two-minute walk to Gangnam Station. No, one minute.

288
00:20:47,273 --> 00:20:49,513
45 pyeong! 63 pyeong! Let me go!

289
00:20:49,513 --> 00:20:52,543
I'm going to cuss you out! I will!

290
00:20:55,703 --> 00:20:57,633
As expected, I can't do it with a guy.

291
00:20:57,633 --> 00:21:01,733
Come on. Why are you saying what I should be saying?

292
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:22,630
   

293
00:21:23,743 --> 00:21:26,103
 I couldn't answer. 

294
00:21:26,103 --> 00:21:28,453
 Because if I had heard his voice, 

295
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,013
 I think I would’ve asked to break up. 

296
00:21:31,013 --> 00:21:36,353
♫  Beyond the fading sunset  ♫

297
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,760
   

298
00:21:45,633 --> 00:21:51,003
♫  The way you look at me  ♫

299
00:21:53,003 --> 00:21:55,973
♫  Touches memories that feel familiar  ♫

300
00:21:55,973 --> 00:21:57,883
 I couldn't even call her out. 

301
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:01,363
 Because if I had seen his face, I think I would’ve asked to break up. 

302
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:05,913
 That's definitely my Jieun, 

303
00:22:05,913 --> 00:22:08,733
 but he's not my Jieun. 

304
00:22:08,733 --> 00:22:11,783
 He's definitely not my Jieun, 

305
00:22:12,713 --> 00:22:14,253
 but that is my Jieun. 

306
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,800
♫  I see you  ♫

307
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:22,333
♫  Always, I know more than I see  ♫

308
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,603
 Good night, Yunjae. 

309
00:22:26,133 --> 00:22:29,733
 The cosmos... and even love... 

310
00:22:30,613 --> 00:22:32,553
 I don't know. 

311
00:22:32,553 --> 00:22:36,823
♫  Eyes don’t lie, oh it's you  ♫

312
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:41,180
♫  Will you remember? I promise you  ♫

313
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,603
♫  In every moment  ♫

314
00:22:42,603 --> 00:22:46,733
    
 ♫  I'll see you  ♫

315
00:22:50,563 --> 00:22:52,343
 Can I see you tomorrow? 

316
00:22:52,343 --> 00:22:54,493
 I'll go over to your place. 

317
00:23:08,603 --> 00:23:09,803
Hey.

318
00:23:09,803 --> 00:23:12,653
I must've had too much sashimi in Busan.

319
00:23:12,653 --> 00:23:14,213
I feel nauseous.

320
00:23:14,213 --> 00:23:17,403
Do you want to order some tteokbokki?

321
00:23:21,473 --> 00:23:23,433
What's wrong?

322
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:25,363
Sleeping already?

323
00:23:28,203 --> 00:23:30,923
Are you crying?

324
00:23:30,923 --> 00:23:33,373
 No. It's just sinusitis. 

325
00:23:33,373 --> 00:23:35,163
 Get out. 

326
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:37,093
My gosh.

327
00:23:37,843 --> 00:23:42,403
Only your gender has changed. You still act like Kim Jieun.

328
00:23:43,533 --> 00:23:45,663
If it's bad, don't just suck it up.

329
00:23:45,663 --> 00:23:47,543
Take some medicine.

330
00:24:21,443 --> 00:24:23,573
I'm sorry about last time.

331
00:24:23,573 --> 00:24:27,173
I shouldn't have come to you like that.

332
00:24:27,173 --> 00:24:29,673
You don't have to apologize.

333
00:24:29,673 --> 00:24:31,923
It might have been different for you,

334
00:24:31,923 --> 00:24:34,143
but it wasn't for me.

335
00:24:34,143 --> 00:24:37,323
It's something that could happen between lovers.

336
00:24:44,293 --> 00:24:47,613
I gave it some thought.

337
00:24:50,693 --> 00:24:54,423
I'm trying to understand it with my head,

338
00:24:56,283 --> 00:24:59,233
but when I see you in your male form... how do I put this?

339
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:01,643
It's a bit confusing,

340
00:25:01,643 --> 00:25:07,603
and honestly... I don't think we can keep going like we did before.

341
00:25:07,603 --> 00:25:09,363
Yunjae.

342
00:25:11,313 --> 00:25:13,773
I also gave it some thought.

343
00:25:14,553 --> 00:25:17,793
How about we just be friends for a bit?

344
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:22,303
- Friends? 
 - Yeah, friends.

345
00:25:23,233 --> 00:25:28,603
Until I'm back to being a woman again, let's be friends.

346
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:33,763
What's this?

347
00:25:34,483 --> 00:25:37,113
What's with the fast plot development?

348
00:25:38,443 --> 00:25:42,573
Don't guys normally come here to play games together?

349
00:25:43,343 --> 00:25:45,163
Aren't you adjusting too quickly?

350
00:25:45,163 --> 00:25:47,383
I tend to do that.

351
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,963
Have you ever played this game before?

352
00:25:51,963 --> 00:25:54,083
- It's a really hard one. 
 - Yeah.

353
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:56,003
I did it with my sister a while back.

354
00:25:56,003 --> 00:25:57,960
My ID was...

355
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,293
Oh, I found it!

356
00:26:05,213 --> 00:26:08,313
♫  Wake up and make up  ♫

357
00:26:08,313 --> 00:26:11,233
♫  Without being able to bridge it  ♫

358
00:26:11,233 --> 00:26:16,130
♫  I once again stand at the gaps the of the day's beginnings  ♫

359
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,913
I'm here. Get in the car quickly.

360
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:22,263
Wait.

361
00:26:22,263 --> 00:26:24,343
Someone is shooting me.

362
00:26:24,343 --> 00:26:25,973
♫  Will I  ♫

363
00:26:25,973 --> 00:26:28,463
♫  From the space that is you  ♫

364
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:30,193
I'm down.

365
00:26:30,193 --> 00:26:31,333
Again?

366
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:33,943
How many times can you die in one round?

367
00:26:33,943 --> 00:26:36,410
Wait. Let me save you.

368
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,793
I died.

369
00:26:42,203 --> 00:26:43,473
Wait.

370
00:26:43,473 --> 00:26:46,043
I'll kill them all.

371
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:57,533
♫  Can't stop, can't stop thinking about you  ♫

372
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:06,533
♫  Can't stop, can't stop thinking about you  ♫

373
00:27:07,533 --> 00:27:10,203
You don't have to go this far.

374
00:27:10,203 --> 00:27:13,513
I've wanted to walk you home, too.

375
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:21,653
So, moving forward, how many do you have left?

376
00:27:21,653 --> 00:27:23,413
Of what?

377
00:27:23,413 --> 00:27:25,033
Since we decided to be friends,

378
00:27:25,033 --> 00:27:28,233
it seems like you have a lot of things you want to do.

379
00:27:28,233 --> 00:27:30,633
Of course I do.

380
00:27:30,633 --> 00:27:35,533
I've always had the most fun when I hung out with you.

381
00:27:46,723 --> 00:27:48,053
I...

382
00:27:48,053 --> 00:27:53,013
always have the most fun when I hang out with you.

383
00:28:01,553 --> 00:28:03,563
Anyway, go on in.

384
00:28:08,133 --> 00:28:09,733
Yeah.

385
00:28:09,733 --> 00:28:12,713
If something comes up,

386
00:28:12,713 --> 00:28:15,413
- call me right away. 
 - Okay.

387
00:28:24,533 --> 00:28:28,533
I forgot to give this to you at your place.

388
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:38,533
What is this?

389
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:40,183
It's an electric shaver.

390
00:28:40,183 --> 00:28:42,433
It's less risky than a razor

391
00:28:42,433 --> 00:28:44,583
and should be comfortable to use.

392
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:49,933
You really bought this for me?

393
00:28:49,933 --> 00:28:53,533
Who else would I have bought it for?

394
00:28:57,643 --> 00:28:59,563
Thanks.

395
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:10,103
Oppa?

396
00:29:10,103 --> 00:29:12,853
What are you doing outside?

397
00:29:12,853 --> 00:29:14,513
Who is this?

398
00:29:15,243 --> 00:29:17,223
Hey, little sister.

399
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:18,803
Hi.

400
00:29:19,683 --> 00:29:21,233
All right, buddy.

401
00:29:21,233 --> 00:29:23,333
- Bye. 
 - Huh?

402
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:25,103
A friend?

403
00:29:44,643 --> 00:29:46,153
Hello.

404
00:29:46,153 --> 00:29:49,493
I'm Yunjae's friend, Kim Ji...

405
00:29:50,243 --> 00:29:52,913
hun.

406
00:30:00,433 --> 00:30:03,803
- Oppa. 
 - I swear I'm getting a lock for my door.

407
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:05,043
Here.

408
00:30:05,043 --> 00:30:08,213
Write down what you know and give it back by tomorrow.

409
00:30:10,113 --> 00:30:13,923
You're handing me your homework?

410
00:30:14,573 --> 00:30:17,033
Hey. You're now a senior.

411
00:30:17,033 --> 00:30:19,533
- Aren't you going to study? 
 - Mind your own business.

412
00:30:19,533 --> 00:30:24,133
Anyways, complete it all or you'll regret it otherwise.

413
00:30:30,313 --> 00:30:33,153
What nonsense. 
    

414
00:30:37,183 --> 00:30:39,143
Favorite pastry?

415
00:30:39,143 --> 00:30:42,163
   

416
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,503
Thanks.

417
00:30:49,873 --> 00:30:51,963
A profile?

418
00:30:54,283 --> 00:30:56,033
Well...

419
00:30:56,033 --> 00:30:58,833
You have to live as a guy for the time being.

420
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:03,253
Why don't we write a profile for a guy named Kim Ji... hun...

421
00:31:03,253 --> 00:31:05,803
so you can discover yourself?

422
00:31:05,803 --> 00:31:08,103
Was that the urgent thing?

423
00:31:08,103 --> 00:31:11,053
I thought it was something really urgent.

424
00:31:11,053 --> 00:31:12,523
It is urgent.

425
00:31:12,523 --> 00:31:15,743
The freedom of fallen birds lies in your hands.

426
00:31:16,913 --> 00:31:20,673
You're making no sense.

427
00:31:20,673 --> 00:31:21,793
Anyway, let me try.

428
00:31:21,793 --> 00:31:23,513
How do we do it?

429
00:31:23,513 --> 00:31:25,143
Oh. That...

430
00:31:25,143 --> 00:31:26,803
Give me a second.

431
00:31:27,533 --> 00:31:30,033
To make it simple,

432
00:31:30,033 --> 00:31:32,513
I prepared this.

433
00:31:34,803 --> 00:31:35,823
   

434
00:31:35,823 --> 00:31:39,693
Tell me about Kim Jihun. 100 Q&amp;As?

435
00:31:45,373 --> 00:31:47,173
This looks like a Q&amp;A an innocent teenage girl

436
00:31:47,173 --> 00:31:51,603
would make for the crush she wants to get to know.

437
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,420
(Park Yuna.)

438
00:32:00,563 --> 00:32:06,853
 Jihun... is someone you'll never get. 

439
00:32:06,853 --> 00:32:08,393
 Never. 

440
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:10,193
 Wake up. 

441
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:15,213
 - Oppa. 
 - What's with you? 

442
00:32:15,213 --> 00:32:16,533
 Remember this laptop? 

443
00:32:16,533 --> 00:32:19,603
 You gave it to me two years ago. 

444
00:32:19,603 --> 00:32:22,683
 To be exact, you stole it from me. 

445
00:32:22,683 --> 00:32:25,673
 I had no idea you liked birds so much. 
 (Folders where people hide porn) 

446
00:32:25,673 --> 00:32:28,543
 Brown-eared Bulbuls, Little Grebes, 

447
00:32:28,543 --> 00:32:31,203
 Ashy Minivet, Japanese Cormorant, Quail, 

448
00:32:31,203 --> 00:32:33,113
 Hawk, Buzzard, 

449
00:32:33,113 --> 00:32:35,233
 Oriental Turtle Dove, Vinous-throated Parrotbill, 

450
00:32:35,233 --> 00:32:37,603
 - Great Tit, Water Bat! 
 - H-Hey... 

451
00:32:37,603 --> 00:32:39,703
 S-Stop it. 

452
00:32:39,703 --> 00:32:41,523
 Did you really... 

453
00:32:42,533 --> 00:32:45,103
 - look at everything? 
 - Listen up, Oppa. 

454
00:32:45,103 --> 00:32:47,773
 If you just fill out this piece of paper, 

455
00:32:47,773 --> 00:32:49,303
 this bird encyclopedia 

456
00:32:49,303 --> 00:32:52,973
 will be deleted from the hard drive and my memory. 

457
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:54,873
 But if you don't? 

458
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:57,833
 I, Park Yuna, 

459
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:02,753
 will tell the world about these poor birds. 

460
00:33:02,753 --> 00:33:04,333
 Got it? 

461
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:06,763
 Favorite singer. 

462
00:33:06,763 --> 00:33:09,243
 Favorite actor. 

463
00:33:10,233 --> 00:33:13,233
 "If the world ended tomorrow, what would you... 

464
00:33:13,233 --> 00:33:15,563
 want to do?" 

465
00:33:17,573 --> 00:33:19,323
 Huh... 

466
00:33:25,433 --> 00:33:28,333
You can just half-ass it.

467
00:33:29,433 --> 00:33:34,543
 I could have made it up on my own, but I got curious. 

468
00:33:34,543 --> 00:33:38,273
Now that I'm doing it, my focus is great, and I'm having fun.

469
00:33:38,273 --> 00:33:42,813
 If the world ended tomorrow, what would Jieun want to do? 

470
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:45,543
Favorite food?

471
00:33:45,543 --> 00:33:48,103
I have too many.

472
00:33:49,633 --> 00:33:53,023
Beef tripe, grilled pork tripe...

473
00:33:53,023 --> 00:33:54,913
and...

474
00:33:54,913 --> 00:33:56,583
penis fish.

475
00:33:57,871 --> 00:34:00,404
- You can eat penis fish? 
 - Yeah.

476
00:34:00,404 --> 00:34:03,213
I thought tteokbokki was your favorite.

477
00:34:03,213 --> 00:34:06,343
That's right, I like tteokbokki.

478
00:34:07,183 --> 00:34:09,973
Do I really need to pick one?

479
00:34:11,423 --> 00:34:15,153
 How much do I know about Jieun? 

480
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:18,533
What does the first snow remind me of?

481
00:34:19,813 --> 00:34:22,063
 And... 

482
00:34:22,063 --> 00:34:28,213
 how can I trust... that this guy next to me is Jieun? 

483
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:36,133
♫  The mornings I greet with you every day will  ♫

484
00:34:36,133 --> 00:34:41,033
♫  The mornings I greet with you every day will  ♫

485
00:34:41,033 --> 00:34:43,443
What am I good at cooking?

486
00:34:43,443 --> 00:34:49,463
♫  We'll hold on to what we know is near  ♫

489
00:34:58,233 --> 00:35:01,413
Favorite animal? Puppies.

490
00:35:02,903 --> 00:35:04,783
My nickname...

491
00:35:20,633 --> 00:35:27,293
   

492
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:29,003
Yes!

493
00:35:31,703 --> 00:35:33,523
Here.

494
00:35:34,543 --> 00:35:36,863
Great.

495
00:35:36,863 --> 00:35:39,703
    

496
00:35:42,883 --> 00:35:44,483
What?

497
00:35:45,103 --> 00:35:47,003
This isn't the original.

498
00:35:48,283 --> 00:35:49,803
Well...

499
00:35:49,803 --> 00:35:54,153
We were too busy to meet up, so we emailed.

500
00:35:56,283 --> 00:36:02,003
Seriously... I didn't see you that way.

501
00:36:04,713 --> 00:36:08,843
You must have been really afraid that your bird encyclopedia would be released to the world.

502
00:36:10,033 --> 00:36:14,533
- Yeah. 
 - I didn't know you would work so hard on this.

503
00:36:17,213 --> 00:36:19,403
But wasn't erasing it from your memory

504
00:36:19,403 --> 00:36:22,363
also part of the deal?

505
00:36:23,413 --> 00:36:25,933
- By the way, little sis... 
 - Yeah?

506
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:30,453
Jihun has a girlfriend whom he loves to death.

507
00:36:30,453 --> 00:36:32,503
I only heard about her recently.

508
00:36:32,503 --> 00:36:34,453
She's supposedly really great.

509
00:36:34,453 --> 00:36:37,073
So, forget about Jihun...

510
00:36:37,073 --> 00:36:38,933
and go to bed.

511
00:36:42,673 --> 00:36:44,353
Hey!

512
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:52,503
 Hey, Park Yunjae! Open the door! 

513
00:36:52,503 --> 00:36:55,343
You think you're bullshitting me, so I'll give up, aren't you?

514
00:36:55,343 --> 00:36:57,563
Argh! You're so annoying!

515
00:36:57,563 --> 00:36:59,263
- Hey, Yuna! 
 - Open the door!

516
00:36:59,263 --> 00:37:00,393
Hey, Yuna.

517
00:37:00,393 --> 00:37:03,153
Don't say "bullshit" to your brother.

518
00:37:03,153 --> 00:37:05,833
 - You don't get it, Mom! 
 - Why are you yelling at me? 

519
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:08,093
 You're dead to me! 

520
00:37:08,853 --> 00:37:11,533
 Hey! I said open the door! 

521
00:37:11,533 --> 00:37:13,333
    

522
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:15,633
I'll never show this to her.

523
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:18,233
 Hey! Open the door while I'm being nice! 

524
00:37:18,233 --> 00:37:22,733
  I said open the door! 
   

525
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:32,123
   

526
00:37:34,433 --> 00:37:36,463
What is all this?

527
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:39,503
What do you mean? They're my treasures.

528
00:37:39,503 --> 00:37:42,653
For the beautiful love between you and your boyfriend,

529
00:37:42,653 --> 00:37:44,903
I'm generously lending them to you,

530
00:37:44,903 --> 00:37:47,643
so use them as a reference.

531
00:37:47,643 --> 00:37:50,013
Hey, we're not like this.

532
00:37:50,013 --> 00:37:53,783
We decided to get along as good friends for a bit.

533
00:37:53,783 --> 00:37:57,203
The person who posted on the message board yesterday.

534
00:37:58,343 --> 00:38:00,063
That was you, wasn't it?

535
00:38:00,063 --> 00:38:02,493
 First, this is not made up. 

536
00:38:02,493 --> 00:38:05,443
 I was an average twenty-something college student 

537
00:38:05,443 --> 00:38:07,163
 in a sweet relationship with my boyfriend. 

538
00:38:07,163 --> 00:38:08,610
 It might be hard to believe, 

539
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:11,393
 but I became a guy overnight. 

540
00:38:11,393 --> 00:38:14,053
 My boyfriend is being understanding, but... 

541
00:38:14,053 --> 00:38:17,253
 I don't know when I'll be a woman again. 

542
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,353
 Is there a way for me 

543
00:38:19,353 --> 00:38:24,503
 to make my boyfriend like me even in my current state? 

544
00:38:25,263 --> 00:38:27,683
What are you talking about? That wasn't me.

545
00:38:27,683 --> 00:38:29,923
Sure, PF1004.

546
00:38:29,923 --> 00:38:34,003
Penis Fish Angel, I enjoyed your post. 
  (1004 sounds like the word angel) 

547
00:38:35,183 --> 00:38:38,763
Let me teach you a thing or two.

548
00:38:41,003 --> 00:38:42,433
Strategy number one.

549
00:38:42,433 --> 00:38:47,133
Take a shower and portray a natural kind of sexiness.

550
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:49,653
This is insane!

551
00:38:49,653 --> 00:38:51,803
Stop it!

552
00:39:03,503 --> 00:39:05,113
You're here.

553
00:39:05,113 --> 00:39:06,447
Yeah.

554
00:39:06,447 --> 00:39:08,207
Come on in.

555
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,123
Okay.

556
00:39:19,743 --> 00:39:23,173
Did you just wash up?

557
00:39:24,673 --> 00:39:27,553
I broke a sweat while working out...

558
00:39:28,553 --> 00:39:32,393
and got... so hot.

559
00:39:33,813 --> 00:39:36,523
At this rate, you might catch a cold.

560
00:39:36,523 --> 00:39:37,913
Go and get dressed.

561
00:39:37,913 --> 00:39:40,793
You need to dry off some more.

562
00:39:42,533 --> 00:39:45,933
Okay, I'll go change.

563
00:39:49,103 --> 00:39:51,533
 Strategy number two. 

564
00:39:51,533 --> 00:39:57,633
 Appeal to him with gentle charisma and drive. 

565
00:39:59,073 --> 00:40:00,943
 Appeal! 

566
00:40:06,223 --> 00:40:07,873
 Appeal! 

567
00:40:09,733 --> 00:40:11,843
 - Appeal! 
 - Appeal! 

568
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:14,573
 - Appeal! 
 - Appeal! 

569
00:40:14,573 --> 00:40:16,483
 Appeal! 

570
00:40:21,343 --> 00:40:24,233
- Move over. I'll do it. 
 - Huh?

571
00:40:24,233 --> 00:40:27,133
I can do it.

572
00:40:28,713 --> 00:40:29,963
It's dangerous.

573
00:40:29,963 --> 00:40:32,193
I said, move over.

574
00:40:45,063 --> 00:40:46,733
Are you okay?

575
00:40:46,733 --> 00:40:49,333
Hey. Where's the first-aid kit?

576
00:40:53,093 --> 00:40:55,333
I'll do everything from now on,

577
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:57,383
so just sit back.

578
00:40:57,383 --> 00:40:58,903
Okay.

579
00:41:01,863 --> 00:41:04,243
 Strategy number three. 

580
00:41:04,243 --> 00:41:06,733
 Shoot your shot 

581
00:41:06,733 --> 00:41:10,433
 with subtle touches and a gentle gaze. 

582
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,633
 Also...  
 ♫  'Cause I love you  ♫

583
00:41:13,633 --> 00:41:17,063
♫  I'll say it to you  ♫

584
00:41:17,063 --> 00:41:21,483
♫  I'll express my fluttering heart  ♫

585
00:41:21,483 --> 00:41:25,123
♫  I keep smiling for no reason  ♫

586
00:41:25,123 --> 00:41:27,453
Wow, this looks so good.

587
00:41:28,343 --> 00:41:30,243
Thank you for the food.

588
00:41:31,013 --> 00:41:33,953
♫  Can you hear my heart  ♫

589
00:41:33,953 --> 00:41:36,313
♫  It's beating towards you  ♫

590
00:41:36,313 --> 00:41:39,593
♫  Love is you, my heart is pounding  ♫

591
00:41:39,593 --> 00:41:40,793
Does your eye hurt?

592
00:41:40,793 --> 00:41:43,803
♫  I'm imagining sweet fantasies  ♫

593
00:41:43,803 --> 00:41:46,743
- No. 
 - You keep blinking.

594
00:41:46,743 --> 00:41:48,713
Go ahead and eat.

595
00:41:48,713 --> 00:41:50,333
Okay.

596
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:55,453
♫  ’Cause I love you, I'm curious about you (curious about you)  ♫

597
00:41:55,453 --> 00:41:59,583
♫  If you're still watching (still watching)  ♫

598
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,333
 Lastly... 

599
00:42:03,173 --> 00:42:05,103
 the ultimate card. 

600
00:42:05,103 --> 00:42:09,443
♫  I think my heart has gone crazy  ♫

601
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:16,033
♫  This feeling, this fluttering, I like it all  ♫

602
00:42:16,933 --> 00:42:20,113
It's 10:00 p.m. already. I have to go.

603
00:42:20,113 --> 00:42:22,803
What? You're leaving already?

604
00:42:25,433 --> 00:42:29,333
Since it has come to this... and it's late...

605
00:42:31,243 --> 00:42:33,373
Want to stay over?

606
00:42:33,373 --> 00:42:35,573
My sister isn't home.

607
00:42:38,603 --> 00:42:41,933
In my household, you have to get permission if you sleep somewhere else.

608
00:42:41,933 --> 00:42:46,743
You're dead if you let them know on the day of it. No one is excused.

609
00:42:46,743 --> 00:42:48,893
Right.

610
00:42:48,893 --> 00:42:52,463
Saving your life is more important than a sleepover.

611
00:43:06,553 --> 00:43:08,773
You're driving me crazy, Kim Jieun.

612
00:43:08,773 --> 00:43:12,233
What kind of concept was she going for?

613
00:43:18,643 --> 00:43:20,923
Oh, no.

614
00:43:20,923 --> 00:43:24,053
You scared me. What? What's wrong?

615
00:43:24,053 --> 00:43:26,783
Seunghun has a girlfriend.

616
00:43:26,783 --> 00:43:28,843
He can't go to the group date tonight,

617
00:43:28,843 --> 00:43:30,873
so he wants me to bring someone else.

618
00:43:30,873 --> 00:43:33,733
Geez. Just bring anyone.

619
00:43:33,733 --> 00:43:36,383
Don't you know anyone?

620
00:43:36,383 --> 00:43:39,163
Want to go? You have a cute face,

621
00:43:39,163 --> 00:43:42,643
so if I fix up your hair, it might work.

622
00:43:42,643 --> 00:43:45,713
I am cute, but no.

623
00:43:45,713 --> 00:43:47,973
- Plus, I told you I have a girlfriend. 
 - If that's the case,

624
00:43:47,973 --> 00:43:50,003
do you know anyone decent?

625
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:52,893
Please, it doesn't matter if they're a complete stranger.

626
00:43:52,893 --> 00:43:55,493
I told her I was bringing someone super handsome.

627
00:43:55,493 --> 00:43:57,453
Hyeong! Please!

628
00:43:57,453 --> 00:43:59,553
- What's up with you? 
 - Please save me.

629
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,453
Why do I need to save you?

630
00:44:01,453 --> 00:44:05,423
Hey! Just wipe the glass so we can go home.

631
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:20,573
Welcome.

632
00:44:21,803 --> 00:44:23,433
Yunjae.

633
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:27,233
- What brings you here? 
 - Oh, um...

634
00:44:27,233 --> 00:44:29,273
Hyeong, do you know him?

635
00:44:29,273 --> 00:44:31,563
Yeah. He's my...

636
00:44:33,193 --> 00:44:35,543
friend.

637
00:44:35,543 --> 00:44:37,263
- A f-friend. 
 - Hello.

638
00:44:37,263 --> 00:44:42,263
I'm Yunjae's best friend, Lee Minhyeok.

639
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:46,603
I told you about him a while ago. We work together.

640
00:44:46,603 --> 00:44:49,003
Hello, I attend the same school as Yunjae.

641
00:44:49,003 --> 00:44:50,623
This is great.

642
00:44:50,623 --> 00:44:54,803
Hyeongnim, by any chance, do you have a girlfriend?

643
00:44:56,133 --> 00:44:58,243
- N-No. 
 - If that's the case,

644
00:44:58,243 --> 00:45:00,763
could you help me out this one time?

645
00:45:03,553 --> 00:45:05,363
I don't know.

646
00:45:10,563 --> 00:45:11,870
I don't think I can.

647
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:13,813
Sorry.

648
00:45:13,813 --> 00:45:16,033
Then, I have no choice.

649
00:45:16,033 --> 00:45:19,263
Yunjae, give me an hour of your time today.

650
00:45:19,263 --> 00:45:20,833
Me?

651
00:45:22,133 --> 00:45:25,033
- I said I'm not doing it. 
 - Hyeong, your ideal type is Han Jimin.

652
00:45:25,033 --> 00:45:28,653
One of them looks exactly like Han Jimin.

653
00:45:31,323 --> 00:45:36,353
So, your ideal type wasn't Jieun, but Jimin.

654
00:45:36,353 --> 00:45:39,653
No... No, that's a lie.

655
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,123
He saw her drama when he was six

656
00:45:41,123 --> 00:45:44,783
and he still remembers how pretty Han Jimin was.

657
00:45:46,233 --> 00:45:49,363
You knew she was pretty at the age of six?

658
00:45:50,383 --> 00:45:52,783
I thought rhinoceros beetles and stag beetles were pretty, too.

659
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:55,093
Giant Asian Mantises, too.

660
00:45:55,093 --> 00:45:57,163
And cockroaches?

661
00:45:59,973 --> 00:46:01,483
You know what...

662
00:46:01,483 --> 00:46:03,583
I'll do it. The group date.

663
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:06,083
I'll go instead of Yunjae.

664
00:46:07,143 --> 00:46:08,493
Really?

665
00:46:08,493 --> 00:46:10,143
Hyeongnim, you will?

666
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:11,363
Just an hour, right?

667
00:46:11,363 --> 00:46:13,363
Yes, thank you so much.

668
00:46:13,363 --> 00:46:14,813
Let's exchange numbers.

669
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:17,263
I'll send you the location right away.

670
00:46:24,053 --> 00:46:26,263
Cockroaches?

671
00:46:30,233 --> 00:46:32,643
I told him I would, so I'll just go for an hour.

672
00:46:32,643 --> 00:46:35,293
 You didn't have to do that. 

673
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:37,743
If I didn't go, you would have had to.

674
00:46:37,743 --> 00:46:40,033
I don't want that.

675
00:46:41,033 --> 00:46:44,803
You're not upset about it, right?

676
00:46:44,803 --> 00:46:47,043
Me?

677
00:46:47,043 --> 00:46:48,833
Not at all.

678
00:46:48,833 --> 00:46:52,823
Have fun and make sure Minhyeok treats you to something tasty.

679
00:46:52,823 --> 00:46:55,603
Look at you acting chill.

680
00:46:55,603 --> 00:46:59,213
I mean, it's a girl meeting a girl, so...

681
00:46:59,213 --> 00:47:00,813
Hyeongnim!

682
00:47:00,813 --> 00:47:03,963
Yunjae, Minhyeok is here. I'll call you later.

683
00:47:07,773 --> 00:47:09,413
Let's go.

684
00:47:29,803 --> 00:47:32,323
I'll be here for an hour and then I'm off.

685
00:47:32,323 --> 00:47:34,633
Hyeongnim, don't be so sure.

686
00:47:34,633 --> 00:47:36,373
I'm telling you, they're gorgeous.

687
00:47:36,373 --> 00:47:38,723
It's 6:10 p.m. right now.

688
00:47:38,723 --> 00:47:41,493
I'll leave at 7:10 p.m.

689
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:47,273
Hey, Yesol.

690
00:47:47,273 --> 00:47:49,603
We're here already.

691
00:47:49,603 --> 00:47:53,283
I brought a guy who's a total ten.

692
00:47:56,343 --> 00:47:57,843
What?

693
00:47:59,973 --> 00:48:03,493
Minhyeok must be really upset that our plans got canceled.

694
00:48:03,493 --> 00:48:06,243
He asked me to get a drink with him.

695
00:48:06,243 --> 00:48:08,263
You're okay with that, right?

696
00:48:08,263 --> 00:48:10,943
Of course. I'm okay with it.

697
00:48:10,943 --> 00:48:14,713
It's fine. Just call me when you're done.

698
00:48:14,713 --> 00:48:17,593
You don't have to. Do as you wish.

699
00:48:17,593 --> 00:48:19,413
Okay.

700
00:48:30,023 --> 00:48:31,913
 You're warm. 

701
00:48:34,943 --> 00:48:38,533
 My face normally gets warm when I drink. 

702
00:48:38,533 --> 00:48:41,573
 I get cold when I drink. 

703
00:48:46,443 --> 00:48:48,363
 Come here. 

704
00:49:25,923 --> 00:49:28,913
Here's the chicken stew you ordered.

705
00:49:28,913 --> 00:49:31,413
Wow, it looks delicious.

706
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:34,453
Eat up, Hyeongnim.

707
00:49:37,153 --> 00:49:38,973
Here you go.

708
00:49:46,043 --> 00:49:48,783
Wow. It's so good.

709
00:49:50,493 --> 00:49:54,073
There are so many tasty main ingredients here,

710
00:49:54,073 --> 00:49:57,593
but you like the B-list items.

711
00:49:57,593 --> 00:49:59,213
How did you know?

712
00:49:59,213 --> 00:50:00,793
I'm usually like that.

713
00:50:00,793 --> 00:50:04,623
Even at a sashimi place, I prefer the side dishes like the penis fish more than the sashimi.

714
00:50:04,623 --> 00:50:06,383
I prefer the fish cakes in tteokbokki,

715
00:50:06,383 --> 00:50:09,373
and in a drama, the supporting characters over the main cast.

716
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:14,983
You're such an interesting person.

717
00:50:14,983 --> 00:50:16,903
Should we toast?

718
00:50:30,563 --> 00:50:35,293
Hyeongnim, this is so wrong.

719
00:50:35,293 --> 00:50:39,693
How can she cancel our plans on the day of?

720
00:50:39,693 --> 00:50:42,063
I bought this shirt

721
00:50:42,063 --> 00:50:44,923
and even got my hair done this morning.

722
00:50:47,233 --> 00:50:50,083
Don't waste your feelings on someone

723
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:51,533
that doesn't respect the promises you make to each other.

724
00:50:51,533 --> 00:50:55,633
Especially if you don't know them that well.

725
00:50:57,133 --> 00:51:02,333
I'm sure you have a lot more people around you than you think who care about you.

726
00:51:06,133 --> 00:51:07,418
It's my first time.

727
00:51:07,418 --> 00:51:09,369
Huh? What is?

728
00:51:09,369 --> 00:51:13,841
Someone who genuinely comforts me like an adult.

729
00:51:13,841 --> 00:51:16,951
Hyeong, can I speak informally?

730
00:51:18,733 --> 00:51:21,123
Yeah. Sure.

731
00:51:21,123 --> 00:51:23,903
But, Hyeong, with a face like that...

732
00:51:23,903 --> 00:51:27,533
and your body... why don't you have a girlfriend?

733
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:32,023
I have someone I'm seeing.

734
00:51:32,023 --> 00:51:33,803
I knew it.

735
00:51:33,803 --> 00:51:35,333
Do you have a picture?

736
00:51:35,333 --> 00:51:37,083
One second.

737
00:51:40,353 --> 00:51:42,483
I guess I can't...

738
00:51:44,563 --> 00:51:48,453
- Hey, I'm going to the restroom. 
 - Okay.

739
00:51:57,143 --> 00:51:59,973
 This is the ladies room! 

740
00:51:59,973 --> 00:52:01,503
    

741
00:52:01,503 --> 00:52:04,733
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

742
00:52:04,733 --> 00:52:08,833
    

743
00:52:11,633 --> 00:52:14,533
     

744
00:52:23,753 --> 00:52:27,573
Hyeong! What took you so long?

745
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:33,223
What's up with your face?

746
00:52:33,223 --> 00:52:35,493
Did something happen?

747
00:52:54,323 --> 00:52:55,753
What?

748
00:52:55,753 --> 00:52:57,773
Where are you?

749
00:52:57,773 --> 00:52:59,993
Y-You, just wait.

750
00:52:59,993 --> 00:53:01,403
Oppa, let me ask you one last thing!

751
00:53:01,403 --> 00:53:04,533
Can you give this to Oppa Jihun? Please?

752
00:53:06,263 --> 00:53:08,343
He ignored me again.

753
00:53:08,343 --> 00:53:10,583
So annoying.

754
00:53:11,473 --> 00:53:13,393
Darn it.

755
00:53:14,553 --> 00:53:16,813
He did get it!

756
00:53:18,053 --> 00:53:19,943
Great.

757
00:53:28,943 --> 00:53:31,083
Wait a second.

758
00:53:41,133 --> 00:53:42,533
Hey!

759
00:53:42,533 --> 00:53:45,063
You bastard. Hey, what are you doing?

760
00:53:45,063 --> 00:53:47,353
Where's Jieun? Huh?

761
00:53:51,913 --> 00:53:54,603
Hyeong, what were you imagining?

762
00:53:54,603 --> 00:53:57,253
I'm so hurt.

763
00:53:57,253 --> 00:54:00,093
You shouldn't have let him drink so much.

764
00:54:00,093 --> 00:54:02,133
I mean, he suddenly went to the restroom

765
00:54:02,133 --> 00:54:05,183
and kept drinking himself drunk.

766
00:54:10,683 --> 00:54:15,073
Anyway, I'll take Jihun home,

767
00:54:15,073 --> 00:54:17,413
so you can get some rest now.

768
00:54:17,413 --> 00:54:19,013
Just let him sleep here tonight.

769
00:54:19,013 --> 00:54:21,053
It's just us guys here. What's the big deal?

770
00:54:21,053 --> 00:54:25,403
Guy or girl... he should sleep at home!

771
00:54:28,193 --> 00:54:31,743
Hyeong, you'll never carry him alone.

772
00:54:31,743 --> 00:54:36,023
The taxi driver, security guard, and I. The three of us barely got him here.

773
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:39,373
Hey. We are not the same.

774
00:54:39,373 --> 00:54:43,473
Don't you know I work out these days?

775
00:54:51,023 --> 00:54:52,403
Hyeong, are you asleep?

776
00:54:52,403 --> 00:54:54,313
Yeah, I am.

777
00:54:57,353 --> 00:55:00,653
Jihun seems to really care about you.

778
00:55:04,393 --> 00:55:07,003
What are you talking about out of the blue?

779
00:55:07,903 --> 00:55:09,813
Once he got drunk,

780
00:55:09,813 --> 00:55:13,403
he kept calling your name every minute.

781
00:55:14,133 --> 00:55:15,833
"Yunjae..."

782
00:55:15,833 --> 00:55:17,863
"Yunjae..."

783
00:55:17,863 --> 00:55:20,033
Like that.

784
00:55:20,033 --> 00:55:24,473
He said he was sorry. Then thankful.

785
00:55:25,463 --> 00:55:28,093
And that he loves you.

786
00:55:28,093 --> 00:55:29,963
He did?

787
00:55:30,673 --> 00:55:34,593
Usually, when guys do that, it's gross.

788
00:55:34,593 --> 00:55:37,773
But it didn't seem that way coming from Jihun.

789
00:55:38,643 --> 00:55:41,113
I just met Jihun today,

790
00:55:41,113 --> 00:55:44,113
but he seems like such a sweet and good person.

791
00:55:45,163 --> 00:55:46,903
Aren't I right?

792
00:55:50,533 --> 00:55:53,683
Go to sleep. I'm going to sleep.

793
00:56:44,093 --> 00:56:46,983
What do I do about this brother?

794
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:36,950


795
00:57:53,923 --> 00:57:57,493
   

796
00:57:59,683 --> 00:58:05,443
Do you know... why I've never been dumped by a guy?

797
00:58:09,203 --> 00:58:11,343
You know the game of reading the air, right?

798
00:58:11,343 --> 00:58:15,203
To win, you have to say it before the other person does.

799
00:58:15,203 --> 00:58:19,013
Since it looks like Yunjae is going to dump me,

800
00:58:19,013 --> 00:58:21,843
are you telling me I should break up with him first?

801
00:58:21,843 --> 00:58:24,333
Can you live without Yunjae?

802
00:58:25,213 --> 00:58:26,273
No.

803
00:58:26,273 --> 00:58:29,843
That's why you should do it before he acts, and say, "Let's be friends."

804
00:58:29,843 --> 00:58:32,003
If Yunjae only wants to break up,

805
00:58:32,003 --> 00:58:34,803
you'll be forever strangers.

806
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:37,383
But if you say "let's be friends,"

807
00:58:37,383 --> 00:58:40,403
you'll be able to remain as friends.

808
00:58:44,253 --> 00:58:45,943
Yunjae,

809
00:58:47,163 --> 00:58:49,423
I also gave it some thought.

810
00:58:49,423 --> 00:58:52,853
How about we just be friends for a bit?

811
00:58:52,853 --> 00:58:54,333
Friends?

812
00:58:54,333 --> 00:58:56,933
Yeah, friends.

813
00:58:56,933 --> 00:59:00,723
♫  This unbelievable familiarity  ♫

814
00:59:00,723 --> 00:59:04,163
Until I'm back to being a woman again,

815
00:59:04,163 --> 00:59:09,550
let's be friends.

816
00:59:11,733 --> 00:59:17,170
♫  Beyond the fading sunset  ♫

817
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:24,160
♫  Your light seeps quietly into me  ♫

818
00:59:25,533 --> 00:59:28,170
♫  I see you  ♫

819
00:59:29,113 --> 00:59:33,743
♫  Always, I know more than I see  ♫

820
00:59:33,743 --> 00:59:39,120
♫  It's not a dream, you're growing clearer  ♫

821
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:43,863
♫  I hear you  ♫

822
00:59:43,863 --> 00:59:48,283
♫  Eyes don’t lie, oh it's you  ♫

823
00:59:48,283 --> 00:59:52,533
♫  Will you remember? I promise you  ♫

824
00:59:52,533 --> 00:59:55,913
♫  In every moment, I'll see you  ♫

825
00:59:55,913 --> 00:59:59,963

00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:01,863
 You're a girl again!

01:00:01,863 --> 01:00:04,003
 Why aren't you honest and tell our parents? 

828
01:00:04,003 --> 01:00:07,153
 I'm not telling them because I turned back. 

829
01:00:07,153 --> 01:00:10,113
 A jaded man and woman in their mid-30s cross paths again. 

830
01:00:10,113 --> 01:00:12,133
 Are you... It's you. My deskmate Kim Jihye. 

831
01:00:12,133 --> 01:00:13,423
 You miss me? 

832
01:00:13,423 --> 01:00:17,773
 As long as a player is by his side, you can't trust your boyfriend. 

833
01:00:17,773 --> 01:00:20,523
 Come on, no way. He was your first love! 

834
01:00:20,523 --> 01:00:21,743
 Is that how it is? 

835
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:23,203
 I have a weak heart. 

836
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:24,293
 Be gentle. 

837
01:00:24,293 --> 01:00:25,543
 A club? 

838
01:00:25,543 --> 01:00:27,953
 So, something really is going on. 

839
01:00:29,213 --> 01:00:32,633
♫  Like a star in the sky that escaped its orbit  ♫
