1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,370
   

2
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,000
   

3
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,550
   

4
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,790
   

5
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,430
   

6
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:44,980


7
00:00:46,257 --> 00:00:48,397
You've aged so much.

8
00:00:48,397 --> 00:00:50,487
My grandpa.

9
00:00:52,287 --> 00:00:54,517
I mean, my grandma.

10
00:01:13,257 --> 00:01:15,377
 It must be because of your girlfriend. 

11
00:01:15,377 --> 00:01:17,197
 No. 

12
00:01:17,197 --> 00:01:18,767
 It's because of me. 

13
00:01:18,767 --> 00:01:21,567
 Oppa, when you truly love someone, 

14
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:23,857
 you cheer on that person's dreams. 

15
00:01:23,857 --> 00:01:26,057
 Are you not even getting that level of treatment? 

16
00:01:26,057 --> 00:01:28,287
 Let's stop there. 

17
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,697
I can promise one thing.

18
00:01:47,697 --> 00:01:50,157
At least in this very moment,

19
00:01:50,157 --> 00:01:53,627
no one on Earth cares about you more than me.

20
00:02:09,177 --> 00:02:10,507
Who are you?

21
00:02:10,507 --> 00:02:11,907
You.

22
00:02:11,907 --> 00:02:13,547
Hi.

23
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:17,077
I'm sorry, I'm late.

24
00:02:25,377 --> 00:02:28,027
W-Well...

25
00:02:28,027 --> 00:02:30,967
What happened was...

26
00:02:32,457 --> 00:02:34,057
You don't need to explain.

27
00:02:34,057 --> 00:02:35,707
Let's go.

28
00:02:39,207 --> 00:02:41,947
You're Yunjae's girlfriend, right?

29
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:46,267
- How did you know to come here? 
 - We can talk later.

30
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,847
Let's go.

31
00:02:54,617 --> 00:02:58,107
Yes, you're right. I'm Yunjae's girlfriend.

32
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:03,767
I'm also close to Jihun's grandfather.

33
00:03:07,397 --> 00:03:09,847
And you came dressed like that?

34
00:03:13,487 --> 00:03:15,097
Yes.

35
00:03:15,097 --> 00:03:16,807
Why?

36
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:21,047
Where's Jihun?

37
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:24,457
Jihun...

38
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:30,410
Jihun is...

39
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,807
Oh! Jihun!

40
00:03:32,807 --> 00:03:35,627
He went to Seoul.

41
00:03:36,457 --> 00:03:38,227
He went to Seoul?

42
00:03:38,227 --> 00:03:39,537
When?

43
00:03:39,537 --> 00:03:41,417
Earlier.

44
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:45,847
He said something urgent came up.

45
00:03:45,847 --> 00:03:47,547
Yeah.

46
00:03:57,117 --> 00:04:00,017
Aren't these Jihun's shoes?

47
00:04:02,817 --> 00:04:05,697
Oh, that's right.

48
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:13,117
Since it's late, maybe he got mixed up

49
00:04:13,117 --> 00:04:15,347
- and wore the wrong shoes. 
 - What?

50
00:04:15,347 --> 00:04:17,567
Y-Yeah.

51
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:20,047
I guess so.

52
00:04:20,047 --> 00:04:22,877
Am I the only one who finds this weird?

53
00:04:22,877 --> 00:04:25,337
What's with this eonnie popping out of nowhere?

54
00:04:25,337 --> 00:04:27,667
And what's with Jihun disappearing on us?

55
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:31,767
In life, all kinds of strange things happen.

56
00:04:48,897 --> 00:04:51,327
What's important is...

57
00:04:52,107 --> 00:04:54,967
that Park Yunjae's girlfriend,

58
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:57,937
Kim Jieun, is back.

59
00:05:07,357 --> 00:05:09,617
I missed you,

60
00:05:10,547 --> 00:05:12,137
Yunjae.

61
00:05:12,137 --> 00:05:16,657
♫  Always, I know more than I see  ♫

62
00:05:16,657 --> 00:05:18,477
♫  It's not a dream  ♫

63
00:05:18,477 --> 00:05:22,327
I'm sorry I kept you waiting for so long.

64
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:26,827
♫  I hear you  ♫

65
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:31,197
♫  Eyes don’t lie, oh it's you  ♫

66
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:34,037
♫  Will you remember? I promise you  ♫

67
00:05:34,037 --> 00:05:37,947
   

68
00:05:37,947 --> 00:05:40,757
♫  I'll see you  ♫

69
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,777
Here.

70
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:45,267
This is a fruit tea syrup I made.

71
00:05:45,267 --> 00:05:48,227
When it's chilly, a warm cup of this will be nice.

72
00:05:48,227 --> 00:05:50,857
Grandpa, why is there so much?

73
00:05:50,857 --> 00:05:54,527
Perilla kimchi, mustard greens kimchi, sweet potato stem kimchi.

74
00:05:54,527 --> 00:05:58,267
I put in all the stuff you guys go crazy for.

75
00:05:58,267 --> 00:06:02,027
By the way, are you really Yunjae's girlfriend?

76
00:06:04,607 --> 00:06:06,757
Yes.

77
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:08,377
I told you before.

78
00:06:08,377 --> 00:06:11,037
This is my part-time co-worker, Minhyeok.

79
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,747
Yeah.

80
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:16,507
I heard a lot about you. It's nice to meet you.

81
00:06:16,507 --> 00:06:19,377
Grandpa, what happened to Jihun?

82
00:06:19,377 --> 00:06:22,467
What was so urgent that he'd leave us behind and go to Seoul?

83
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:24,327
Oh, that...

84
00:06:24,327 --> 00:06:27,167
Gosh, what did he say?

85
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:31,107
Gosh. He told me, but I forgot right away.

86
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:34,827
Gosh. This is why you should just die when you get old.

87
00:06:37,677 --> 00:06:41,317
 The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to the voicemail. 

88
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,907
Jihun's phone is off.

89
00:06:43,907 --> 00:06:45,427
I hope nothing happened.

90
00:06:45,427 --> 00:06:47,547
It almost slipped my mind.

91
00:06:47,547 --> 00:06:50,237
He's not transparent about a lot of things.

92
00:06:50,237 --> 00:06:52,747
I think you've misunderstood.

93
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:56,197
My boy is so honest and kind.

94
00:06:56,197 --> 00:06:58,387
Did he say anything to you?

95
00:06:58,387 --> 00:07:00,127
Not really.

96
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:03,237
Don't ask so many questions.

97
00:07:03,237 --> 00:07:05,197
He must have a reason.

98
00:07:05,197 --> 00:07:06,467
Let's go.

99
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:09,117
You guys... go ahead.

100
00:07:09,117 --> 00:07:11,867
I have some things left to do here.

101
00:07:11,867 --> 00:07:13,787
S-Same here.

102
00:07:13,787 --> 00:07:15,087
What things?

103
00:07:15,087 --> 00:07:16,967
Why do you need to know?

104
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:18,767
Let's go.

105
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:20,267
What is wrong with you?

106
00:07:20,267 --> 00:07:22,367
- What are you doing, Eonni? 
 - I'll call you.

107
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,767
- Bye, kids. 
 - I'll call you.

108
00:07:23,767 --> 00:07:25,367
Let go of me!

109
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:27,397
What's with you?

110
00:07:32,657 --> 00:07:34,907
Geez.

111
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:38,167
Don't worry.

112
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:42,967
The average person would never imagine such a thing.

113
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:51,007
You must have been so surprised.

114
00:07:51,007 --> 00:07:52,537
No.

115
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:57,587
You must have been surprised.

116
00:07:59,727 --> 00:08:02,347
I have some experience, so I'm okay.

117
00:08:02,347 --> 00:08:04,927
Experience?

118
00:08:05,787 --> 00:08:09,207
This guy is sure cute.

119
00:08:09,207 --> 00:08:10,907
I'm going to use the bathroom.

120
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,597
Sure.

121
00:08:22,287 --> 00:08:24,507
Gosh.

122
00:08:24,507 --> 00:08:26,827
How pretty.

123
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:30,417
When I look at you,

124
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:33,887
I think of your mom when she was younger.

125
00:08:34,867 --> 00:08:37,297
- Grandma. 
 - But, Jieun,

126
00:08:37,297 --> 00:08:40,807
you were also amazing yesterday.

127
00:08:44,307 --> 00:08:46,767
Yuri also mentioned it.

128
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:50,437
That, apart from me turning into a guy, everything else is the same.

129
00:08:50,437 --> 00:08:53,737
There's no "apart." It's all you.

130
00:08:53,737 --> 00:08:55,267
Jieun,

131
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:59,017
even if you become a guy again, don't hate yourself so much.

132
00:08:59,017 --> 00:09:01,367
If you don't love yourself,

133
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:05,527
you can't expect others to recognize you.

134
00:09:05,527 --> 00:09:08,947
That's true for everyone.

135
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:15,357
- I'll try my best. 
 - All right.

136
00:09:17,607 --> 00:09:19,487
Geez.

137
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:37,457
Jihun!

138
00:09:39,227 --> 00:09:41,447
Jihun!

139
00:09:51,147 --> 00:09:53,157
What did Grandpa put in here?

140
00:09:53,157 --> 00:09:54,907
Nuna, is this really kimchi?

141
00:09:54,907 --> 00:09:56,927
Leave it right there.

142
00:09:58,997 --> 00:10:00,697
Thanks.

143
00:10:00,697 --> 00:10:03,717
Grandpa's kimchi is the best.

144
00:10:03,717 --> 00:10:05,987
Would you like to stay for ramen?

145
00:10:09,267 --> 00:10:11,157
Well...

146
00:10:11,157 --> 00:10:13,257
Sure, I guess.

147
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:20,297
- Your apartment is so nice. 
 - Wait, wait, wait!

148
00:10:20,297 --> 00:10:23,837
Can you please give me a moment to prepare?

149
00:10:23,837 --> 00:10:27,177
Don't turn around. Stay still.

150
00:10:28,297 --> 00:10:31,627
We're having ramen. Prepare what?

151
00:10:34,327 --> 00:10:35,857
You crazy...

152
00:10:35,857 --> 00:10:37,917
What's going on?

153
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:44,657
I don't think this is going to work. I think you should go for today.

154
00:10:44,657 --> 00:10:46,497
I'll invite you over next time.

155
00:10:46,497 --> 00:10:49,817
I mean, we're having ramen. What do you need to prepare?

156
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:51,147
You don't have ramen? Should I buy some?

157
00:10:51,147 --> 00:10:53,577
No, no. I have a lot of ramen.

158
00:10:53,577 --> 00:10:54,597
Sorry.

159
00:10:54,597 --> 00:10:57,857
I'll formally invite you after preparing next time.

160
00:11:32,357 --> 00:11:34,027
I can go by myself from here.

161
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,867
Why? I don't want that.

162
00:11:35,867 --> 00:11:37,137
I'll take you.

163
00:11:37,137 --> 00:11:40,197
Did you forget who my neighbor is?

164
00:11:44,127 --> 00:11:46,297
So what? Who cares?

165
00:11:46,297 --> 00:11:48,317
What do you mean?

166
00:11:48,317 --> 00:11:50,177
What will you tell her?

167
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:54,467
Can you just...

168
00:11:54,467 --> 00:11:57,467
say you're cousins? How about that?

169
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,907
Because of some circumstances, he stayed for a bit.

170
00:12:00,907 --> 00:12:02,837
Jihun...

171
00:12:02,837 --> 00:12:04,847
went back to his original home.

172
00:12:04,847 --> 00:12:07,197
The further the better, so...

173
00:12:08,067 --> 00:12:10,567
- To the US? 
 - No way.

174
00:12:10,567 --> 00:12:12,947
That's too unpremeditated.

175
00:12:12,947 --> 00:12:16,257
We should set it up properly from the start.

176
00:12:16,257 --> 00:12:18,427
The last thing I want

177
00:12:18,427 --> 00:12:22,017
is to be clumsy or weasel out of it... especially with Kang Minju.

178
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:02,147
Y-You didn't see my text?

179
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:05,667
I'm seeing you again.

180
00:13:06,517 --> 00:13:08,357
W-Why are you here?

181
00:13:08,357 --> 00:13:10,867
Shouldn't I be the one asking you?

182
00:13:13,017 --> 00:13:16,037
To start, take a seat.

183
00:13:16,037 --> 00:13:19,107
Sis, can you leave?

184
00:13:19,107 --> 00:13:20,797
Sis?

185
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:25,667
- Can I? 
 - Yes.

186
00:13:40,117 --> 00:13:42,727
Why do we keep seeing each other

187
00:13:42,727 --> 00:13:47,167
in situations where we can't— no, shouldn't be meeting each other?

188
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:51,467
Why are you in this apartment?

189
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:55,567
I... live here now.

190
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:57,307
Jihun...

191
00:13:58,227 --> 00:13:59,627
is my cousin.

192
00:13:59,627 --> 00:14:03,187
He stayed here for a bit due to some circumstances.

193
00:14:03,187 --> 00:14:05,427
You two are cousins?

194
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:09,727
You expect me to believe that?

195
00:14:09,727 --> 00:14:13,287
Whether you believe it or not, that's your problem.

196
00:14:14,907 --> 00:14:18,017
So where is Jihun right now?

197
00:14:18,017 --> 00:14:19,987
Well...

198
00:14:19,987 --> 00:14:22,927
He must've gone back to his place.

199
00:14:24,177 --> 00:14:27,197
Just so you know, he lives in the US.

200
00:14:27,197 --> 00:14:30,517
He gives off oversea vibes, doesn't he?

201
00:14:39,967 --> 00:14:44,167
Does Yunjae know about this whole situation?

202
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:45,837
Yes.

203
00:14:45,837 --> 00:14:49,747
Just now, Yunjae was the one who walked me home.

204
00:14:53,717 --> 00:14:55,677
Can you leave now?

205
00:14:55,677 --> 00:14:57,937
I'm kind of tired.

206
00:15:07,717 --> 00:15:10,067
Hey! You can't...

207
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:16,077
He left all his stuff here?

208
00:15:17,187 --> 00:15:19,157
Well...

209
00:15:19,157 --> 00:15:22,957
He must've left them here because he could.

210
00:15:23,897 --> 00:15:27,577
I'm sure he took the important stuff.

211
00:15:45,797 --> 00:15:47,957
You did well, Kim Jieun.

212
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:07,407
I need to organize again.

213
00:16:13,977 --> 00:16:16,157
 Even if you were leaving, you should've said goodbye. 

214
00:16:16,157 --> 00:16:18,977
 I'm disappointed. I want to know how you're doing. 

215
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:21,477
 Text me when you get this. 

216
00:16:21,477 --> 00:16:22,837
What's this?

217
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:27,867
It wasn't competitiveness but concern?

218
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:34,067
Kim Jieun, get it together.

219
00:16:36,807 --> 00:16:38,567
Seriously.

220
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:46,310
   

221
00:17:01,947 --> 00:17:04,227
Knock!

222
00:17:06,867 --> 00:17:09,767
- Here. A gift. 
 - What is this?

223
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:11,747
Socks.

224
00:17:11,747 --> 00:17:13,257
So you can do a couple look with Jihun.

225
00:17:13,257 --> 00:17:15,507
It'll be hard to do with other things.

226
00:17:15,507 --> 00:17:18,487
Hey, where would you find a sister like me?

227
00:17:19,427 --> 00:17:20,527
Oh, right.

228
00:17:20,527 --> 00:17:22,677
Jihun isn't tutoring you anymore. Actually, he can't.

229
00:17:22,677 --> 00:17:24,567
What? Why?

230
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:26,717
You don't need to know details.

231
00:17:26,717 --> 00:17:29,247
I'll tell Mom so just stay put.

232
00:17:29,247 --> 00:17:30,537
Something is off.

233
00:17:30,537 --> 00:17:32,897
- Did you two fight? 
 - What do you mean by off?

234
00:17:32,897 --> 00:17:35,667
- Hey. Get out. 
 - What is that?

235
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:38,467
- Let me see. 
 - Nothing. Get out!

236
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:41,667
- Damn it. 
 - Hey, by the way...

237
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:44,067
- Please knock. 
 - I don't want to.

238
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:54,927
   

239
00:18:09,737 --> 00:18:11,447
Oh my.

240
00:18:17,787 --> 00:18:19,427
 I'll show you, 

241
00:18:19,427 --> 00:18:21,767
 so don't talk and stay still. 

242
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:25,067
 - Got it. 
 - I told you not to talk. 

243
00:18:28,167 --> 00:18:32,267
 Diagonally, from top to bottom. Slowly. 

244
00:18:56,317 --> 00:18:59,907
It wasn't all bad memories to you.

245
00:19:12,927 --> 00:19:15,997
   

246
00:19:15,997 --> 00:19:18,317
 Yunjae, could you get more fish balls? 

247
00:19:18,317 --> 00:19:21,077
 The fish balls are good here. 

248
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,957
Fish ball?

249
00:19:30,267 --> 00:19:33,277
- What do you want? 
 - Your food is in front of your door.

250
00:19:33,277 --> 00:19:34,767
By the way, is Jihun back?

251
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:37,147
I told you he's not coming.

252
00:19:42,267 --> 00:19:44,507
I wasn't curious, either.

253
00:19:58,067 --> 00:19:59,947
You're nuts.

254
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:08,077
- Mom. 
 - Oh, you made it.

255
00:20:08,077 --> 00:20:10,987
Such nice weather.

256
00:20:10,987 --> 00:20:12,757
What's this? Aren't you cold?

257
00:20:12,757 --> 00:20:15,027
Geez, I'm fine.

258
00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:17,237
Have you eaten?

259
00:20:17,237 --> 00:20:20,307
I ate with your aunt.

260
00:20:20,307 --> 00:20:21,577
What about you?

261
00:20:21,577 --> 00:20:23,597
Are you taking care of your meals while studying?

262
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,337
Of course.

263
00:20:26,237 --> 00:20:28,997
The exams are coming up soon, aren't they?

264
00:20:28,997 --> 00:20:31,037
Don't put so much pressure on yourself.

265
00:20:31,037 --> 00:20:34,667
Just work hard enough not to have regrets.

266
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,537
Geez.

267
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:42,067
Gosh. Now that I've seen my son's face, I should go.

268
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:44,697
- You're leaving already? 
 - I already got train tickets.

269
00:20:44,697 --> 00:20:45,967
Go back in and study.

270
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:48,897
- I'll take you to the station. 
 - Oh no, forget about it.

271
00:20:48,897 --> 00:20:53,837
Once you're done with the exam, come down with my daughter-in-law.

272
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:55,697
Daughter-in-law.

273
00:20:55,697 --> 00:20:58,977
Gosh, I miss my daughter-in-law.

274
00:21:45,467 --> 00:21:47,787
In Seonghui.

275
00:21:48,647 --> 00:21:51,467
I guess that was Grandma's name.

276
00:21:53,597 --> 00:21:55,447
All right.

277
00:21:56,287 --> 00:21:58,357
   

278
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:18,787
Grandma was pretty.

279
00:22:27,477 --> 00:22:32,747
"No matter how difficult, those who have dreams must keep going.

280
00:22:32,747 --> 00:22:34,587
Like I did.

281
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:38,037
Though I’m still dreaming,

282
00:22:38,037 --> 00:22:42,317
I dare say my life was a glorious blessing.

283
00:22:43,147 --> 00:22:45,457
Kim Pilhyun."

284
00:22:47,357 --> 00:22:50,417
Hello, Great-grandma.

285
00:22:54,327 --> 00:22:56,207
Dreams.

286
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,077
Dreams?

287
00:23:00,077 --> 00:23:03,567
 You made a decision, right? To go to Corning University. 

288
00:23:05,067 --> 00:23:07,477
 - No. 
 - No? 

289
00:23:07,477 --> 00:23:10,117
 The astronomy department at Corning University in the US 

290
00:23:10,117 --> 00:23:12,467
 is a dream for people like us. 

291
00:23:21,557 --> 00:23:24,967
   

292
00:23:26,837 --> 00:23:31,157
   

293
00:23:31,967 --> 00:23:34,747
Thank you so much for coming... for my father.

294
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,067
From beginning to end.

295
00:23:36,067 --> 00:23:39,567
I don't like hearing you say the word "end."

296
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:44,767
But there's no one in here. Is that okay?

297
00:23:44,767 --> 00:23:46,607
We're closed today.

298
00:23:46,607 --> 00:23:49,937
Even though it's not much different when we're not.

299
00:23:49,937 --> 00:23:53,457
Is today some kind of special day?

300
00:23:53,457 --> 00:23:56,677
You look great. So sexy.

301
00:23:56,677 --> 00:23:59,067
Oh, really?

302
00:23:59,067 --> 00:24:01,557
I-I'm glad.

303
00:24:01,557 --> 00:24:03,687
To repay you for everything,

304
00:24:03,687 --> 00:24:06,107
I wanted to treat you to something delicious.

305
00:24:06,107 --> 00:24:09,167
Is there anything you're craving?

306
00:24:10,207 --> 00:24:12,067
Maybe meat?

307
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:13,547
Meat.

308
00:24:13,547 --> 00:24:15,377
If that's the case, get ready and come out.

309
00:24:15,377 --> 00:24:17,877
I'll be waiting outside.

310
00:24:21,197 --> 00:24:23,427
Oh, that.

311
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:25,437
You're right.

312
00:24:25,437 --> 00:24:28,127
It's the orchid your father was tending.

313
00:24:28,127 --> 00:24:29,777
Why do you have it?

314
00:24:29,777 --> 00:24:31,567
I heard from your mother

315
00:24:31,567 --> 00:24:35,197
that he prayed for your success

316
00:24:35,197 --> 00:24:37,097
while he diligently took care of it.

317
00:24:37,097 --> 00:24:39,367
So I asked her for it.

318
00:24:39,367 --> 00:24:43,467
I wanted to share his sentiments and take care of it.

319
00:24:45,267 --> 00:24:49,667
I might not look like it, but I have a green thumb.

320
00:24:55,257 --> 00:24:58,037
   

321
00:25:04,617 --> 00:25:07,827
   

322
00:25:09,127 --> 00:25:12,807
"A great day to win the love of your life.

323
00:25:12,807 --> 00:25:16,287
If you have courage and two feet, go to your destination immediately.

324
00:25:16,287 --> 00:25:19,437
The flag of victory is yours."

325
00:25:20,297 --> 00:25:21,327
What is this?

326
00:25:21,327 --> 00:25:24,487
The final battle is today?

327
00:25:55,567 --> 00:25:58,767
 What's this? Can you explain it to me? 

328
00:26:07,737 --> 00:26:12,187
 Oppa, Halley's Comet is seen about every 76 years. 

329
00:26:12,187 --> 00:26:14,837
When is the next time it will approach Earth?

330
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:19,887
The last time it came within Earth's vicinity was in 1986, so...

331
00:26:37,507 --> 00:26:39,347
So cold.

332
00:26:41,487 --> 00:26:43,257
- All done? 
 - Hi.

333
00:26:43,257 --> 00:26:46,227
- Not yet. 
 - You're still working?

334
00:26:49,247 --> 00:26:50,527
Can you tell me?

335
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:52,547
Oh, guys. I have to go.

336
00:26:52,547 --> 00:26:55,567
- Sorry, sorry! 
 - Where are you going?

337
00:26:55,567 --> 00:26:58,997
Jieun, when did you get here?

338
00:26:58,997 --> 00:27:01,507
You should’ve let me know when you got here.

339
00:27:03,717 --> 00:27:05,517
Did I miss your text?

340
00:27:05,517 --> 00:27:07,637
Hi, there!

341
00:27:09,967 --> 00:27:13,867
What's with the formalities all of a sudden? Just be like you were last time.

342
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:17,527
Oh my. Eonni, don't be so scary.

343
00:27:19,967 --> 00:27:22,767
Jieun, let's go.

344
00:27:26,327 --> 00:27:27,367
Okay.

345
00:27:27,367 --> 00:27:32,347
Yunjae, let's have a really fun date today.

346
00:27:33,107 --> 00:27:34,627
Let's do that.

347
00:27:34,627 --> 00:27:37,057
Email me the rest. I'll take a look.

348
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:38,597
Let's go.

349
00:27:47,467 --> 00:27:49,467
- This one. 
 - Oh, this one.

350
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:50,867
Looks tasty, doesn't it?

351
00:27:50,867 --> 00:27:53,287
- It's so big. 
 - Can we get one of these?

352
00:27:53,287 --> 00:27:54,367
Got it.

353
00:27:54,367 --> 00:27:56,357
I wanted to try this with you so badly.

354
00:27:56,357 --> 00:27:59,067
You should have mentioned it earlier.

355
00:27:59,067 --> 00:28:01,667
- Say, "Ah." 
 - Ah.

356
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:03,577
I dropped some.

357
00:28:04,657 --> 00:28:06,927
How is it?

358
00:28:06,927 --> 00:28:08,937
We didn't take a picture.

359
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,747
What should we listen to?

360
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:12,437
- This one. 
 - This one?

361
00:28:12,437 --> 00:28:13,837
Yeah.

362
00:28:13,837 --> 00:28:16,067
♫  Can you hear my heart  ♫

363
00:28:16,067 --> 00:28:17,787
- Have you heard it before? 
 - No, it's my first time.

364
00:28:17,787 --> 00:28:19,967
- It's your first time? 
 - Should we play it here?

365
00:28:22,857 --> 00:28:25,397
Wow, it's working.

366
00:28:25,397 --> 00:28:28,067
Put this... here.

367
00:28:28,067 --> 00:28:31,227
Press this to turn on.

368
00:28:33,327 --> 00:28:35,247
Let's go over there.

369
00:28:37,497 --> 00:28:39,447
Come here.

370
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:43,777
I hear it.

371
00:28:46,067 --> 00:28:47,817
Wow, so nice.

372
00:28:47,817 --> 00:28:52,500
♫  I think my heart has gone crazy  ♫

373
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:58,017
♫  This feeling, this fluttering, I like it all  ♫

374
00:28:58,017 --> 00:29:01,080
♫  I like it because it's you  ♫

375
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:05,507
♫  I'm so lonely, without you  ♫

376
00:29:05,507 --> 00:29:06,867
I'm happy.

377
00:29:06,867 --> 00:29:11,267
♫  It's strange all day  ♫

378
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:16,437
♫  All I see is you  ♫

379
00:29:16,437 --> 00:29:20,817
♫  Since when did this start  ♫

380
00:29:20,817 --> 00:29:23,577
♫  Can you hear my heart  ♫

381
00:29:23,577 --> 00:29:26,267
♫  It's beating towards you  ♫

382
00:29:26,267 --> 00:29:28,317
- Hey! 
 - What?

383
00:29:28,317 --> 00:29:30,667
What are you doing?

384
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:35,247
♫  I'm imagining sweet things because I'm thinking of you  ♫

385
00:29:35,247 --> 00:29:40,087
♫  I'm reminded again, I must've fallen for you  ♫

386
00:29:40,087 --> 00:29:42,857
♫  'Cause I love you, all I need you  ♫

387
00:29:42,857 --> 00:29:45,357
♫  Don't you know how I feel?  ♫

388
00:29:45,357 --> 00:29:49,727
♫  I hope it's not all a dream tonight (dream tonight)  ♫

389
00:29:49,727 --> 00:29:55,727
♫  Following those stars in the night sky, feels like I'm heading over to you  ♫

390
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:58,997
♫  So heart-fluttering (Ah-ah)  ♫

391
00:30:00,487 --> 00:30:03,687
♫  I like it because it's you  ♫

392
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:13,767
Lights on the ground, stars in the sky.

393
00:30:13,767 --> 00:30:16,507
It's a perfect ending.

394
00:30:17,887 --> 00:30:19,807
I'm so happy today.

395
00:30:19,807 --> 00:30:21,367
Me too.

396
00:30:23,737 --> 00:30:25,767
I looked it up.

397
00:30:25,767 --> 00:30:29,867
The astronomy department at Corning University is an amazing place.

398
00:30:29,867 --> 00:30:33,967
It would be really cool if you did research there.

399
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:36,737
I heard NASA is 30 minutes away.

400
00:30:38,507 --> 00:30:40,307
Jieun.

401
00:30:42,547 --> 00:30:45,297
My grandma sent this to me.

402
00:30:45,297 --> 00:30:47,917
It's my grandma's mom.

403
00:30:48,927 --> 00:30:51,337
"Slow Turtle."

404
00:30:51,337 --> 00:30:53,747
You know Kim Pilhyun, right?

405
00:30:56,717 --> 00:30:58,817
That was my great-grandmother.

406
00:30:58,817 --> 00:31:01,737
This is a picture of her when she was young.

407
00:31:03,297 --> 00:31:08,747
When she lived as a woman, she was an ordinary housewife.

408
00:31:08,747 --> 00:31:13,567
When she turned into a man, she apparently wrote like a maniac.

409
00:31:14,587 --> 00:31:19,677
That... really gave me courage.

410
00:31:20,567 --> 00:31:25,267
While I was Jihun, I prepared for a writing contest.

411
00:31:25,267 --> 00:31:28,437
- A writing contest? 
 - Yeah.

412
00:31:28,437 --> 00:31:34,037
I actually... wanted to be a writer like Yuri.

413
00:31:34,777 --> 00:31:36,967
Even though I don't have the talent.

414
00:31:37,767 --> 00:31:42,617
But when there was nothing else I could do,

415
00:31:42,617 --> 00:31:45,517
the dream I had given up on began to blossom.

416
00:31:45,517 --> 00:31:47,667
You can start now.

417
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:51,287
That's right. That's what I plan to do.

418
00:31:52,107 --> 00:31:54,317
So, Yunjae,

419
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,867
make sure you go to the US.

420
00:32:10,867 --> 00:32:16,117
Even if I don't go to the US, I can study here.

421
00:32:16,117 --> 00:32:19,807
Of course, you could.

422
00:32:20,877 --> 00:32:23,907
But what you want to study...

423
00:32:25,737 --> 00:32:28,417
is the space out there.

424
00:32:29,967 --> 00:32:35,067
You’ll be much closer to space there than you are here.

425
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,637
We can contact each other every day.

426
00:32:43,637 --> 00:32:45,937
I can even visit.

427
00:32:49,187 --> 00:32:51,817
As long as I don't turn into a guy.

428
00:32:51,817 --> 00:32:57,087
There's not much I can do if I turn into Kim Jihun.

429
00:33:01,587 --> 00:33:05,037
I really don't want that to happen.

430
00:33:05,037 --> 00:33:06,687
Why not?

431
00:33:06,687 --> 00:33:11,027
I think I’ll think about Jihun from time to time.

432
00:33:11,027 --> 00:33:12,517
What?

433
00:33:12,517 --> 00:33:17,367
Jihun... was a cool friend.

434
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:25,667
Even in difficult situations, he always tried to smile.

435
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:28,007
He was brave.

436
00:33:28,847 --> 00:33:34,077
I know I'm late saying this, but he was a real man.

437
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:43,737
I felt bad that we parted while fighting at Grandma's place.

438
00:33:43,737 --> 00:33:46,287
I didn't get to say sorry.

439
00:33:46,287 --> 00:33:48,667
I think you miss me already.

440
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:52,367
No, no. That's not it.

441
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:59,467
Anyway, you have to go to the US.

442
00:34:00,567 --> 00:34:05,750
♫  Beyond the fading sunset  ♫

443
00:34:06,927 --> 00:34:13,137
♫  Your light seeps quietly into me  ♫

444
00:34:15,257 --> 00:34:20,507
♫  The way you look at me  ♫

445
00:34:22,617 --> 00:34:27,767
♫  Touches memories that feel familiar  ♫

446
00:34:30,017 --> 00:34:35,117
♫  In the spreading stains of tears  ♫

447
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:42,517
♫  I finally recognized you  ♫

448
00:34:42,517 --> 00:34:46,757
When we went to Chuncheon, I told you I'd pick out a star for you.

449
00:34:46,757 --> 00:34:50,167
I was going to give it to you then, but now I finally get to.

450
00:34:51,717 --> 00:34:53,997
It's so pretty.

451
00:34:53,997 --> 00:34:56,917
Even when we're apart,

452
00:34:56,917 --> 00:34:58,690
I'll look at this and think of you.

453
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:03,020
♫  I hear you, eyes don’t lie  ♫

454
00:35:03,027 --> 00:35:05,377
Thank you, Yunjae.

455
00:35:06,567 --> 00:35:10,667
♫  Will you remember? I promise you  ♫

456
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:15,867
♫  In every moment, I'll see you  ♫

457
00:35:26,967 --> 00:35:30,097
I wanted to buy you something expensive in a place with a nice ambiance.

458
00:35:30,097 --> 00:35:32,977
I like this kind of vibe.

459
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:40,457
Could you give me a glass?

460
00:35:40,457 --> 00:35:44,167
You don't drink, though.

461
00:35:44,167 --> 00:35:50,067
I feel like I should gather up some courage with the help of alcohol tonight.

462
00:36:05,807 --> 00:36:07,797
You're not drinking?

463
00:36:07,797 --> 00:36:10,067
I'm going to take my time.

464
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:16,067
For some reason, I feel like it's going to be an unforgettable night.

465
00:36:24,117 --> 00:36:26,297
Jeongja,

466
00:36:26,297 --> 00:36:30,127
there's something I need to say tonight.

467
00:36:30,127 --> 00:36:32,807
Go ahead, whatever it is.

468
00:36:33,967 --> 00:36:37,687
Before I do, I want to say

469
00:36:37,687 --> 00:36:40,067
thank you for what you did for my father.

470
00:36:40,067 --> 00:36:44,577
Besides that, I have so much to thank you for.

471
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:47,117
The issue, though,

472
00:36:47,117 --> 00:36:50,457
is that now I don't only feel thankful.

473
00:36:51,867 --> 00:36:54,857
What do you mean?

474
00:36:57,217 --> 00:36:59,267
Jeongja,

475
00:36:59,267 --> 00:37:04,867
it's time for me to go back to my original spot.

476
00:37:05,967 --> 00:37:10,167
To Yeongseok, the eight-time Noryangjin student preparing for the civil service exam.

477
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:14,077
I'm sorry.

478
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:20,567
You don't want to see me anymore?

479
00:37:42,707 --> 00:37:45,907
Corning University?

480
00:37:45,907 --> 00:37:49,367
This will be way more accurate than Park Yunjae.

481
00:37:50,787 --> 00:37:52,567
Here.

482
00:37:54,107 --> 00:37:56,917
"I am sincerely hoping that you will

483
00:37:56,917 --> 00:38:01,117
come to Corning University to conduct research with me.

484
00:38:01,117 --> 00:38:02,977
If we get to work together,

485
00:38:02,977 --> 00:38:05,257
you will receive a year-long scholarship

486
00:38:05,257 --> 00:38:08,657
and some assistance with living expenses as well."

487
00:38:08,657 --> 00:38:10,327
Wow!

488
00:38:11,297 --> 00:38:12,887
Oh my gosh!

489
00:38:12,887 --> 00:38:14,457
Honey, Honey... did you hear that?

490
00:38:14,457 --> 00:38:16,287
I heard it. I did.

491
00:38:16,287 --> 00:38:17,347
Unbelievable!

492
00:38:17,347 --> 00:38:19,837
My goodness! My goodness!

493
00:38:19,837 --> 00:38:22,037
That hurts!

494
00:38:24,967 --> 00:38:27,207
- Oh my. 
 - What's all this noise?

495
00:38:27,207 --> 00:38:28,577
My son.

496
00:38:28,577 --> 00:38:30,527
My son!

497
00:38:30,527 --> 00:38:33,367
- What? 
 - Gosh!

498
00:38:33,367 --> 00:38:37,867
I heard you got into Corning University!

499
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:40,147
Oh my, my genius son!

500
00:38:40,147 --> 00:38:41,737
Geez, so smart!

501
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:44,167
How did you find out?

502
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:45,727
Good job, good job.

503
00:38:45,727 --> 00:38:49,457
I'm so proud of you! Hooray, Park Yunjae!

504
00:38:49,457 --> 00:38:50,907
- Brother! 
 - What?

505
00:38:50,907 --> 00:38:54,267
Take me with you! Take me with you!

506
00:38:54,267 --> 00:38:56,397
- Let go! 
 - Come on!

507
00:38:56,397 --> 00:38:59,587
- Good job. 
 - Let's go together!

508
00:39:04,347 --> 00:39:07,677
   

509
00:39:35,347 --> 00:39:37,347
Kim Jihye.

510
00:39:37,347 --> 00:39:39,777
Oh, hi.

511
00:39:41,057 --> 00:39:44,597
Wow, you look so good today.

512
00:39:44,597 --> 00:39:46,457
What are you doing here?

513
00:39:46,457 --> 00:39:47,947
Huh?

514
00:39:47,947 --> 00:39:50,667
- I was waiting for you. 
 - Me?

515
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:53,467
- Why? 
 - To confess my feelings.

516
00:39:53,467 --> 00:39:56,767
- What? To what? 
 - Confess.

517
00:39:58,137 --> 00:40:00,067
Yeongseok,

518
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:05,197
I like you.

519
00:40:05,197 --> 00:40:08,907
Ever since I saw you during my freshman year of high school till now.

520
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:12,427
I've never forgotten about you.

521
00:40:15,467 --> 00:40:19,337
- Hey, Kim Jihye. 
 - I'm not asking you to accept my confession.

522
00:40:19,337 --> 00:40:23,377
I'm just doing it because I heard today would be a good day to do it.

523
00:40:24,467 --> 00:40:28,167
- What are you saying? 
 - I don't know, either.

524
00:40:28,167 --> 00:40:33,667
But rather than regretting it forever like I did before for not confessing,

525
00:40:33,667 --> 00:40:37,537
I now understand that confessing and getting rejected is still progress.

526
00:40:37,537 --> 00:40:40,897
I think getting rejected is an improvement.

527
00:40:43,377 --> 00:40:45,487
Are you drunk?

528
00:40:46,627 --> 00:40:48,237
Can you smell it?

529
00:40:49,217 --> 00:40:52,427
I was so nervous, so I just had one can.

530
00:40:52,427 --> 00:40:54,877
But this isn't the alcohol talking.

531
00:40:55,997 --> 00:40:58,277
Could the flowers be for me?

532
00:40:58,277 --> 00:41:00,047
Oh, yes.

533
00:41:06,127 --> 00:41:07,867
They're pretty.

534
00:41:08,907 --> 00:41:10,967
Flowers in a tiny study room.

535
00:41:12,067 --> 00:41:14,097
Resembles me and you.

536
00:41:18,447 --> 00:41:21,297
I'm so sorry, though, Jihye.

537
00:41:21,297 --> 00:41:23,737
I can't accept this confession.

538
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:34,617
Hey, it's okay!

539
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:37,447
If I have another chance later...

540
00:41:38,257 --> 00:41:39,967
Jihye,

541
00:41:39,967 --> 00:41:43,467
being able to think of a friend like you

542
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:47,767
during difficult times, has given me a great deal of strength.

543
00:41:47,767 --> 00:41:52,397
Because of you, I was able to smile through events when I once couldn’t.

544
00:41:52,397 --> 00:41:55,207
If I ever find myself unable to smile again,

545
00:41:55,207 --> 00:41:58,237
I’ll retreat to those high school days

546
00:41:58,237 --> 00:42:00,767
when I used to sit beside you.

547
00:42:00,767 --> 00:42:05,467
I'm sincerely thankful that I am friends with you.

548
00:42:10,287 --> 00:42:12,497
I'm also...

549
00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:15,477
going to do my best to live a life...

550
00:42:16,757 --> 00:42:18,797
that makes me a friend you can lean on.

551
00:42:24,967 --> 00:42:28,467
You already are.

552
00:42:31,667 --> 00:42:35,187
Wow, you look like a soccer player right now.

553
00:42:35,187 --> 00:42:37,037
A soccer player?

554
00:42:40,167 --> 00:42:42,407
Hey, you dropped something.

555
00:42:43,467 --> 00:42:46,117
I wasn't exactly good at soccer.

556
00:42:46,117 --> 00:42:47,947
I know.

557
00:42:47,947 --> 00:42:49,207
- Let's go. 
 - Yeah, let's go.

558
00:42:49,207 --> 00:42:50,087
The flowers are pretty.

559
00:42:50,087 --> 00:42:53,567
If you dry them, you can keep them for a while.

560
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:57,387
Really? I don't want them to go to waste. They're real, right?

561
00:42:57,387 --> 00:43:02,967

562
00:43:02,967 --> 00:43:11,517

564
00:43:20,697 --> 00:43:22,337
You.

565
00:43:22,337 --> 00:43:25,167
I can’t drink with you.

566
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:27,697
- I'm not allowed to talk to you. 
 - You've had a lot to drink.

567
00:43:27,697 --> 00:43:30,607
I don't feel like talking to you, either.

568
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:32,657
Let's just do our own thing.

571
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:47,767
Thank you.

572
00:43:48,977 --> 00:43:51,127
What? You're a singer, aren't you?

573
00:43:51,127 --> 00:43:54,257
Eonni, you, too.

574
00:43:56,547 --> 00:43:58,557
- Eonni. 
 - Yeah?

575
00:43:59,397 --> 00:44:03,287
What's up with Kim Jieun and Kim Jihun?

576
00:44:04,557 --> 00:44:06,107
Jieun and Jihun are cousins.

577
00:44:06,107 --> 00:44:08,687
Jihun lives in the States, and Jieun is working on herself.

578
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,107
Jieun and Jihun are cousins.

579
00:44:10,107 --> 00:44:13,397
Jihun lives in the States, and Jieun is working on herself.

580
00:44:13,397 --> 00:44:16,267
Are you rapping or something?

581
00:44:16,267 --> 00:44:19,957
Jihye was rejected.

582
00:44:21,007 --> 00:44:23,157
Minju,

583
00:44:23,157 --> 00:44:28,497
for the first time in my life, I confessed to a guy.

584
00:44:28,497 --> 00:44:30,737
I got rejected.

585
00:44:32,777 --> 00:44:35,067
Eonni!

586
00:44:35,067 --> 00:44:41,267
I get rejected by Park Yunjae every time I even say something.

587
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,560
I see.

588
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,027
Let's be strong.

589
00:44:45,027 --> 00:44:46,837
Yeah.

590
00:44:48,987 --> 00:44:51,107
Hey.

591
00:44:51,107 --> 00:44:53,047
Park Yunjae!

592
00:44:53,047 --> 00:44:56,617
Those two can't be separated.

593
00:44:56,617 --> 00:44:58,837
Why not?

594
00:45:01,637 --> 00:45:03,527
Well.

595
00:45:06,067 --> 00:45:10,537
You know, this is...

596
00:45:10,537 --> 00:45:12,717
something I'm only saying to you.

597
00:45:12,717 --> 00:45:15,747
Can you keep a secret?

598
00:45:17,067 --> 00:45:23,597
Eonni, the heaviest part of my body...

599
00:45:23,597 --> 00:45:26,777
is my mouth. What is it?

600
00:45:26,777 --> 00:45:28,367
Tell me!

601
00:45:28,367 --> 00:45:31,467
You know, it's about...

602
00:45:33,367 --> 00:45:35,767
Jieun...

603
00:45:35,767 --> 00:45:37,867
and Jihun.

604
00:45:37,867 --> 00:45:39,667
Those two.

605
00:45:39,667 --> 00:45:42,767
They're the same person.

606
00:45:45,467 --> 00:45:49,207
What I'm saying is that they're the same.

607
00:45:49,207 --> 00:45:51,067
Same-same.

608
00:45:53,447 --> 00:45:56,577
This eonni is really wasted.

609
00:45:57,527 --> 00:46:00,497
What are you talking about?

610
00:46:01,367 --> 00:46:05,087
It runs in our family to turn into a guy.

611
00:46:05,087 --> 00:46:07,437
Generation after generation.

612
00:46:07,437 --> 00:46:11,237
Although, luckily, I didn't turn.

613
00:46:16,667 --> 00:46:21,967
Hey! You're really— You're really the only person I'm telling it.

614
00:46:21,967 --> 00:46:23,117
This is really a secret.

615
00:46:23,117 --> 00:46:27,377
Minju, it'll be a disaster if you go around telling anyone.

616
00:46:27,377 --> 00:46:31,077
- I got it. 
 - You can't even tell your mom.

617
00:46:31,077 --> 00:46:33,177
I got it.

618
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:38,757
It smells.

619
00:46:38,757 --> 00:46:42,057
Park Yunjae!

620
00:46:43,657 --> 00:46:46,177
Park Yunjae.

621
00:46:53,217 --> 00:46:54,567
My goodness.

622
00:46:54,567 --> 00:46:57,817
Sis! Wake up. Sis!

623
00:46:58,637 --> 00:47:00,377
My goodness.

624
00:47:00,377 --> 00:47:03,107
You guys drank all of this?

625
00:47:05,957 --> 00:47:08,397
Are you also drunk?

626
00:47:09,907 --> 00:47:11,727
Of course.

627
00:47:12,597 --> 00:47:14,357
Hey! Kim Jihye!

628
00:47:14,357 --> 00:47:16,147
Wake up! Kim Jihye!

629
00:47:16,147 --> 00:47:19,067
Hey! Get it together!

630
00:47:21,507 --> 00:47:24,607
My sister!

631
00:47:24,607 --> 00:47:27,667
Let's see, are you Jieun or Jihun?

632
00:47:27,667 --> 00:47:31,047
Stop it, Kim Jihye.

633
00:47:31,047 --> 00:47:34,967
Hurry and go inside. What's with you? What's wrong with you?

634
00:47:34,967 --> 00:47:38,067
It hurts.

635
00:47:55,757 --> 00:47:57,997
 What's this? 

636
00:47:57,997 --> 00:47:59,767
 Believe it. 

637
00:47:59,767 --> 00:48:04,267
 I am Park Yunjae's girlfriend! 

638
00:48:08,547 --> 00:48:10,267
 Hi. 

639
00:48:11,117 --> 00:48:13,657
 I'm sorry, I'm late. 

640
00:48:15,157 --> 00:48:16,657
No way.

641
00:48:16,657 --> 00:48:19,047
That makes no sense.

642
00:48:22,467 --> 00:48:24,137
But...

643
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,117
if that's not it...

644
00:48:28,367 --> 00:48:30,817
it's even more nonsensical.

645
00:48:47,067 --> 00:48:48,677
Thanks to you...

646
00:48:49,507 --> 00:48:53,227
She was already very drunk before I even got there.

647
00:48:53,227 --> 00:48:54,507
Hey.

648
00:48:54,507 --> 00:48:56,347
Pick a lane.

649
00:48:56,347 --> 00:48:58,827
Stop flipping between formal and casual language.

650
00:48:58,827 --> 00:49:02,587
You pick a lane, Eonni.

651
00:49:02,587 --> 00:49:06,227
Are you Kim Jieun? Or Kim Jihun?

652
00:49:07,567 --> 00:49:10,667
What are you talking about?

653
00:49:11,977 --> 00:49:15,917
Is it because of what my sister said when she was drunk?

654
00:49:15,917 --> 00:49:18,267
I thought that was the case,

655
00:49:18,267 --> 00:49:21,167
but when I applied her weird rambling to this confusing situation,

656
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:23,867
the answer became clear.

657
00:49:25,567 --> 00:49:27,587
Who are you?

658
00:49:28,587 --> 00:49:32,097
Who are you to make my life and Yunjae's so icky?

659
00:49:32,097 --> 00:49:34,447
Reveal yourself.

660
00:49:44,117 --> 00:49:45,967
Who do you think you are?

661
00:49:45,967 --> 00:49:48,137
- What? 
 - Icky?

662
00:49:48,137 --> 00:49:49,667
Hey.

663
00:49:49,667 --> 00:49:52,107
Yunjae kept telling you that he has a girlfriend,

664
00:49:52,107 --> 00:49:53,817
yet you keep throwing yourself at him.

665
00:49:53,817 --> 00:49:56,137
Icky sounds better than that. Don't you think?

666
00:49:56,137 --> 00:50:00,137
Do you want to figure out who's the weirder one here?

667
00:50:02,407 --> 00:50:03,847
Same at the ER.

668
00:50:03,847 --> 00:50:07,327
How dare you pose as Yunjae's girlfriend in front of his parents?

669
00:50:07,327 --> 00:50:10,467
What? You'll go grab a meal as Park Yunjae's girlfriend?

670
00:50:10,467 --> 00:50:13,107
Gosh, unbelievable.

671
00:50:13,107 --> 00:50:15,787
How do you know that?

672
00:50:20,637 --> 00:50:23,757
Jihun told me that. Jihun.

673
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:27,417
Also, at the malatang place!

674
00:50:27,417 --> 00:50:31,647
How dare you order my boyfriend to get the fish balls?

675
00:50:31,647 --> 00:50:36,097
The only people who get to order Park Yunjae around are his parents and me.

676
00:50:36,097 --> 00:50:41,380
Also, that day. You know you lost the spicy game big time, right?

677
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,760
How do you know that?

678
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:48,377
Jihun mentioned it. Jihun.

679
00:50:48,377 --> 00:50:52,297
Same at Grandpa's place. It was unpleasant that you senselessly tagged along.

680
00:50:52,297 --> 00:50:54,867
How dare you kiss Park Yunjae?

681
00:50:54,867 --> 00:50:57,720
- Did Jihun also tell you that? 
 - No.

682
00:50:58,297 --> 00:51:00,730
Yunjae told me that.

683
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,167
- Who are you? 
 - Lastly,

684
00:51:05,167 --> 00:51:09,360
the confidence you have to go to the States with Yunjae and do something with him...

685
00:51:11,757 --> 00:51:15,817
Don't even dream about it. It will never happen.

686
00:51:15,817 --> 00:51:19,927
- Hey, are you an idiot? 
 - That's right! I'll be an idiot!

687
00:51:19,927 --> 00:51:22,397
But one thing's for certain.

688
00:51:22,397 --> 00:51:27,807
I am better than someone who is so messy and desperate...

689
00:51:28,467 --> 00:51:30,497
to steal a taken guy.

690
00:51:30,497 --> 00:51:32,597
Are you being serious?

691
00:51:33,597 --> 00:51:35,937
You. Won't you let go?

692
00:51:35,937 --> 00:51:37,867
I liked Park Yunjae first.

693
00:51:37,867 --> 00:51:41,467
- Seriously, let go. 
 - You let go!

694
00:51:41,467 --> 00:51:43,237
Let go! Let go!

695
00:51:43,237 --> 00:51:44,707
Hey, I liked Park Yunjae first!

696
00:51:44,707 --> 00:51:47,117
Unbelievable.

697
00:51:47,117 --> 00:51:48,467
Let go!

698
00:51:48,467 --> 00:51:51,327
Let go, I said! Hey!

699
00:51:52,207 --> 00:51:55,317
You're dead tonight.

700
00:51:55,317 --> 00:51:57,667
What's wrong with you!

701
00:51:57,667 --> 00:52:00,857
One, two, three!

702
00:52:00,857 --> 00:52:04,257
- Hey! 
 - You're crazy!

703
00:52:04,257 --> 00:52:07,157
Hey! What will you do with Park Yunjae?

704
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:10,147
- Let go! 
 - Is this the police?

705
00:52:10,147 --> 00:52:14,767
Neighborhood dogs are fighting over here.

706
00:52:15,477 --> 00:52:19,077
Watch these neighborhood dogs go!

707
00:52:19,077 --> 00:52:21,317
Hey!

708
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:28,577
- Are you crazy? 
 - Let go!

709
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:34,847
Oppa.

710
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,520
What's up?

711
00:52:38,137 --> 00:52:39,437
Why are you in this state?

712
00:52:39,437 --> 00:52:42,537
Your girlfriend is totally insane.

713
00:52:42,537 --> 00:52:43,987
What?

714
00:52:43,987 --> 00:52:47,167
I'm not seducing you anymore. I'm rescuing you.

715
00:52:47,167 --> 00:52:50,267
Hey, did something happen between you and Jieun again?

716
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:52,487
- Yes! That girl— 
 - Forget it.

717
00:52:52,487 --> 00:52:54,807
I'll figure it out with Jieun.

718
00:53:08,217 --> 00:53:09,747
He's not coming.

719
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:15,097
What's this on your face?

720
00:53:15,097 --> 00:53:17,750
What did you guys do?

721
00:53:18,677 --> 00:53:20,777
Gosh, it must have hurt.

722
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:27,377
It's between us girls.

723
00:53:27,377 --> 00:53:30,480
So, who told you to be so handsome?

724
00:53:36,667 --> 00:53:40,467
Still, I feel good that I've said everything I wanted to.

725
00:53:42,507 --> 00:53:45,057
How can I go to the US and leave you behind?

726
00:53:45,057 --> 00:53:47,217
Don't worry and go.

727
00:53:47,217 --> 00:53:49,537
The ultimate boss of enemies is a romantic rival.

728
00:53:49,537 --> 00:53:52,020
I'm going head-to-head with the ultimate boss now.

729
00:53:58,217 --> 00:54:00,207
Don't you have work today?

730
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:02,977
It's already four. Go on.

731
00:54:02,977 --> 00:54:04,397
I don't want to.

732
00:54:04,397 --> 00:54:07,517
Why not? You should go.

733
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:13,660
I'm charging.

734
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:22,167
Hurry on. I'll walk you to the bus stop.

735
00:54:22,167 --> 00:54:24,667
- Okay! Let's go. 
 - Okay!

736
00:54:27,187 --> 00:54:28,517
Minju.

737
00:54:28,517 --> 00:54:30,167
Why are you here again?

738
00:54:30,167 --> 00:54:33,917
I told you not to come looking for me again. This is stalking!

739
00:54:33,917 --> 00:54:35,387
I didn't want to be like this, either,

740
00:54:35,387 --> 00:54:39,277
but you won't answer my calls or reply to my texts.

741
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:40,720
Go.

742
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,437
Are you going to the US with Park Yunjae?

743
00:54:44,437 --> 00:54:47,817
- Yes. 
 - No, don't go with him.

744
00:54:47,817 --> 00:54:49,077
You already know.

745
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:53,207
It's ridiculous that he has a girlfriend and is getting ready to go abroad with you.

746
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:55,767
Keep Park Yunjae's name out of your mouth.

747
00:54:55,767 --> 00:54:59,427
Okay. But please think it over.

748
00:54:59,427 --> 00:55:02,467
Why do you have to suffer because of a guy like him?

749
00:55:02,467 --> 00:55:05,667
Who said that? That I'm suffering.

750
00:55:05,667 --> 00:55:08,977
The person making me suffer is not Park Yunjae, but you.

751
00:55:08,977 --> 00:55:11,737
Could you please get lost? Let go.

752
00:55:11,737 --> 00:55:14,967
Damn it! What do you like so much about Park Yunjae?

753
00:55:14,967 --> 00:55:16,647
Are you crazy?

754
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:19,107
Let go! Let go!

755
00:55:43,697 --> 00:55:45,657
If you’ve experienced this before, you should have learned to avoid it.

756
00:55:45,657 --> 00:55:47,720
Why are you just standing there?

757
00:55:51,977 --> 00:55:53,267
Go in!

758
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:57,567
- We're not done talking. 
 - She says she doesn't want to! She said no!

759
00:55:57,567 --> 00:55:59,317
It's you again?

760
00:56:00,167 --> 00:56:04,060
Try showing up in this neighborhood again.

761
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,987
You're Min Dongi, right?

762
00:56:25,987 --> 00:56:27,757
Who are you?

763
00:56:27,757 --> 00:56:31,267
Who else do you think? I'm carrying out justice.

764
00:56:31,957 --> 00:56:34,537
Are you Park Yunjae's girlfriend?

765
00:56:34,537 --> 00:56:36,287
So you do know me.

766
00:56:36,287 --> 00:56:38,717
I'm telling you since you seem to know me.

767
00:56:38,717 --> 00:56:42,207
If I hear Park Yunjae's name ever come out of your mouth again,

768
00:56:42,207 --> 00:56:44,577
I'm not letting you off easy.

769
00:56:44,577 --> 00:56:46,407
I'm not letting you off.

770
00:56:47,307 --> 00:56:49,157
Won't you go?

771
00:56:54,427 --> 00:56:55,967
Let's go.

772
00:56:57,117 --> 00:56:59,267
Stay here for a bit before you go.

773
00:56:59,267 --> 00:57:02,497
It's not that I'm worried or care about you.

774
00:57:02,497 --> 00:57:05,877
That guy is just insane.

775
00:57:05,877 --> 00:57:08,457
Well, go home if you want.

776
00:57:12,767 --> 00:57:18,807
I told myself again and again that it makes no sense.

777
00:57:18,807 --> 00:57:22,570
But only Jihun and I know about what happened just now.

778
00:57:24,937 --> 00:57:27,250
How do you know about Min Dongi?

779
00:57:36,477 --> 00:57:41,157
I helped you because I felt bad for you. Now you're just rambling.

780
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:43,410
It's time for you to go.

781
00:57:45,517 --> 00:57:48,087
   

782
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:05,852

00:58:05,852 --> 00:58:10,867
 The call is not going through. You'll be directed to the voicemail.

00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:32,187
 The call is not going through. You'll be directed to the voicemail.

Kim Jihun.

791
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:13,680
Yes. It's me.

 How long will you hold onto Yunjae for your own benefit? 

803
01:00:17,567 --> 01:00:20,767
 I hope you don't tell other people. 

804
01:00:20,767 --> 01:00:23,607
 Do you two really have that kind of relationship? 

805

 I think we underestimated everything. 

806

 I need you to do me a favor.

 Break up with me.

 Yes.
