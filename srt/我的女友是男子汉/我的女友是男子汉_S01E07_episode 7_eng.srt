2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,960
   

3
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,620
   

4
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,030
   

5
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,620

 Timing and Subtitles by the 
 "(S)he is the one" team @Viki.com 

7
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,540
Park Yunjae.

8
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,940
What brings you here so early?

9
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,740
What's with that on your head?

10
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,420
What is this?

11
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,010
Want to try it together?

12
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,080
Lift your leg like this.

13
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,550
Lift your leg and kick.

14
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,680
Lift it up and straighten.

15
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,720
Spin.

16
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,580
Spin, spin.

17
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,540
 One, two. 

18
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,010
What are you two doing here so early?

19
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,070
Minju, what about you?

20
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,000
What brings you here so early?

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,250
Me? I'm moving in.

22
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,770
Moving in?

23
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,450
Where?

24
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,150
Here.

25
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,910
Here?

26
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,200
This building?

27
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,700
Yes. Second floor, unit 202.

28
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,900
What's wrong?

29
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,710
Am I not supposed to be here?

30
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,460
- Yeah. 
 - Yeah.

31
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,640
But what are you two doing here?

32
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,340
That's...

33
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,670
So, what's going on is...

34
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,800
- I also— 
 - Young lady.

35
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,940
I mentioned it when we started loading, but you have more luggage than expected,

36
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,950
so I'll need to leave once I carry them upstairs.

37
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,210
I see. Okay, got it.

38
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,780
Okay.

39
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,800
Oppas, want to eat black bean noodles at my place?

40
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,950
   

41
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,700
Go home.

42
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,000
- I'll just roughly do it and leave. 
 - I hate that even more.

43
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,400
Don't worry.

44
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,120
I have no intention of exerting myself for her.

45
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,520
Yunjae, help me move this to the other room?

46
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,930
Okay.

47
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,480
Two, three.

48
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,510
- This is very heavy. 
 - No, it's not.

49
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,710
Where should I move this to?

50
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,840
Over there.

51
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,570
Yunjae.

52
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,200
- Minju. 
 - Yeah?

53
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,360
- Where should I put this? 
 - Just there.

54
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,640
Oppa, help me with this. It's too high.

55
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,430
Yunjae, help me!

56
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,410
You're way more hardworking than you come across.

57
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,190
What am I doing?

58
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,810
I can't believe I'm doing all this over jealousy.

59
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,110
Should I just go home?

60
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,650
 - Yunjae! Please help me! 
 - Okay! 

61
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,070
 Yunjae. 

62
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,100
 Yunjae! 

63
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,560
You don't need the manual for this.

64
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,590
Leave it to me.

65
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,100
Here.

66
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,200
What is this supposed to be?

67
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,960
A chair.

68
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,990
A chair?

69
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,870
Almost done.

70
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,290
- This is the last step, right? 
 - Yes.

71
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,810
It's perfect.

72
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,240
- Here. 
 - Okay.

73
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,350
All done.

74
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:08,090
Wow, so sturdy.

75
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,040
It's all set.

76
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,950
 I'll. Kill. U. 

77
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,120
Why are you sweating so much?

78
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,680
Huh?

79
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,830
Oh, it's a little warm.

80
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:27,510
Gosh, I must've worked you too hard.

81
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,380
It's okay.

82
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,160
Just a moment.

83
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,910
At the very least, have some water.

84
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,790
Thanks.

85
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,770
Now that you mention it, I'm feeling a little warm, too.

86
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,240
Are you okay, Oppa?

87
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,440
The black bean noodles are here.

88
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,530
I'll go and get it.

89
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,130
I asked them to put in utensils, but they didn't.

90
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,680
Don't you have any to use at home?

91
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,700
No, I don't keep such things.

92
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,610
That's nothing to be proud of.

93
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,810
- Sorry? 
 - Nothing.

94
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,570
I'll go and get some from home.

95
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,660
Where do you live that you'll go and get them from home?

96
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,700
Didn't I tell you earlier?

97
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,180
I live in this neighborhood.

98
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,110
Oh, really?

99
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,390
Where do you live?

100
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:29,640
Might be faster to grab some at a nearby convenience store.

101
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,760
Jihun's place will be faster.

102
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,330
It's that close?

103
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,700
Where is it?

104
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,110
- Unit 201. 
 - Unit 201?

105
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,380
Where's unit 201?

106
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,500
Huh?

107
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,120
What? Next door?

108
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,240
Whoa!

109
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,190
 But that was my first kiss. 

110
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,940
 Is it a problem that it was your first? 

111
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,100
What was that?

112
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,900
 Of course! The first one is so important. 

113
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,880
 This is not love. This is fandom. 

114
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,370
What is this?

115
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,900
What is this memory?

116
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,410
No way.

117
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,100
M-Me with Lee Minhyeok?

118
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:35,160
"My kiss with her was like raindrops falling on a rock."

119
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,200
 Do you know what life and soju have in common? 

120
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,800
 What is it? 

121
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,400
 The common point is that... 

122
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,690
 they both have two syllables! 

123
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,840
Does she use AI to write?

124
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,880
You can fool me once, but not twice.

125
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,380
Every time you open your mouth, it's just lies, lies, lies.

126
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,160
How I live is none of your business.

127
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,760
We're over.

128
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,500
Did you fight with your personal trainer again?

129
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,160
What happened this time?

130
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,500
He called it "Stairway to Heaven" but sent me to hell.

131
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,400
- What is this? 
 - It was delivered to you just now.

132
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,580
That old man is at it again.

133
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,440
Look at his huge eyes.

134
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,480
So cute.

135
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,390
I'm dying.

136
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,560
If someone asks,

137
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,290
say I'm a nightmare customer, not the owner.

138
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,950
I'm sure no one is coming,

139
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:51,080
but no one will think you're the owner.

140
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,290
Excuse me.

141
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,620
Hello.

142
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,400
Could I see the owner of this place?

143
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,340
Well... the owner is not in right now.

144
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,520
If you leave a message, I'll pass it on.

145
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,400
Oh, I see.

146
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,740
In that case, please give this to her.

147
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,880
What's your name?

148
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,000
Tell her Hong Yeongseok's mom was here.

149
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,620
Thank you in advance.

150
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,810
Mother!

151
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,490
Gosh, I thought I had missed you.

152
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,150
I just got back from working out.

153
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,400
Take a seat here.

154
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,000
Thank you.

155
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,770
Gosh, what a nice café.

156
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:44,870
Wow. This is my son.

157
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,000
These days, people take candid photos of dates like these.

158
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,590
Aigoo.

159
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,160
Order, please.

160
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,290
Mother, would you like tea?

161
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,350
Take a look at the menu over there.

162
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,680
I'll just take some ice water.

163
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,820
You heard, right?

164
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,590
Ice water

165
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,690
and one of every dessert.

166
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,600
Gosh, he should be taking you to nicer spots.

167
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,110
My son is so clueless. I hope you understand.

168
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,200
It was very delicious.

169
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,020
But, Mother, what brings you all the way here?

170
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,670
Gosh, I completely forgot.

171
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:31,120
I brought some ginseng wine.

172
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,540
I made it from scratch.

173
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,370
My goodness.

174
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,310
Such a valuable thing.

175
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,360
Not much I can do as an old country lady.

176
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,120
I asked my son what you like to eat,

177
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,920
and he said you like to drink.

178
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,310
Oh my.

179
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,230
He definitely has no filter.

180
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,030
A total civil servant; pure and upright.

181
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:56,010
The liquor they sell at the store is full of chemicals,

182
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,310
but this is medicine.

183
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,500
Let me know when you run out.

184
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,950
Whether it's mulberry, plum, or ginseng wine,

185
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,800
I'll make it for you any time.

186
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,010
Mother, thank you.

187
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,920
I should thank you.

188
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,300
Good job.

189
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,530
- I'm exhausted. 
 - Help me with this.

190
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:36,970
Let me rest a little.

191
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,800
Oppa, here.

192
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,790
Oppa.

193
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:50,110
Thank you! 
    

194
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,630
Done.

195
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,980
Why is this here?

196
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,750
Oh, right. This...

197
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,090
Why is this here?

198
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,420
He dropped it on the day we had malatang.

199
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,310
Yunjae, this is yours. Right?

200
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,400
Yeah.

201
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,770
Your girlfriend is much prettier in photos.

202
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,120
What? She looks the same.

203
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,660
What? She doesn't look like this in person.

204
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,460
What was she like in person?

205
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,430
She was exceedingly average.

206
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,530
She looks cute in the photo. What a scam.

207
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,310
I've also seen her in person.

208
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,100
She looks better in person.

209
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,670
Huh? You're way prettier.

210
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,700
How come guys have such bad taste?

211
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,470
- So frustrating. 
 - Do you not have good taste?

212
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,700
Huh?

213
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,000
Of course I do. I have two eyes*. 
  (*Same word, different meanings) 

214
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,870
What the? So immature.

215
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:01,720
Hurry. Let's keep organizing, Oppa. Come on.

216
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,700
See you.

217
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:45,720
I had no idea you would be living here.

218
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:50,390
Thank you so much for today and let's get along...

219
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,760
well.

220
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,080
This is nice.

221
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,330
   

222
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,980
What was that?

223
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,340
Did she copy me?

224
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,040
Nah...

225
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,010
Maybe...

226
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,610
Gosh. No way.

227
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,230
Why?

228
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,150
For what reason?

229
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,160
Park Yunjae.

230
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,680
To shake him up?

231
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,730
I'm home.

232
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,130
Dad, what are you doing?

233
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,930
Can't you tell? Household chores.

234
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,300
This late?

235
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,620
It's past 10:00 p.m. Do it later.

236
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,270
Better to do it when it's quiet, so it gets noticed.

237
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,260
Gosh!

238
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,430
Gosh.

239
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,980
Gosh, my back hurts.

240
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,790
I'm glad I got through organizing the cabinets, though.

241
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,360
I feel refreshed.

242
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,960
I better go to sleep now,

243
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,830
and clean the veranda tomorrow morning.

244
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,510
Gosh.

245
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,920
Gosh.

246
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,020
Gosh!

247
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,860
Goodness. Goodness!

248
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,210
Sleeping here?

249
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:19,770
Turn off the light before you go in.

250
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,000
Is it because you're scared of Mom? Sleep in my room.

251
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,290
If I sleep in your room, I won't get noticed.

252
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:31,360
What are you talking about? Get noticed for what?

253
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,100
I messed up big time,

254
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,560
so I'm trying to show with my entire body that I'm regretful.

255
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,390
How did your mom do this day after day?

256
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,750
Look at you, taking Mom's side at the end.

257
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,100
Did I?

258
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,960
At the end of the day,

259
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,600
I'm such a tragic figure.

260
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,600
Go to sleep.

261
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,230
How is it going with your girlfriend?

262
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,380
My girlfriend?

263
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,610
It's not easy.

264
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:32,160
All women are difficult.

265
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,500
If it's a woman you love, it's even more difficult.

266
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:40,500
But as things get more difficult, don't avoid it and face it head-on.

267
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,990
Eat together.

268
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,070
Watch movies together.

269
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,750
Talk about random stuff.

270
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,160
Hold hands.

271
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,630
Kiss.

272
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,330
 You sure are teaching him a great lesson! 

273
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,780
No kissing!

274
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,110
I'm going to sleep.

275
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,050
Good night.

276
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,570
Don't avoid it and face it head-on.

277
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,370
I also want to face it head-on... with Kim Jieun.

278

♫  The wind shakes the window  ♫

 "You don't need to know how much I like you. 

281
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,900
 My feelings for you are solely mine. 

282
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:14,820
 My longing for you overflows, even when it's just mine alone. 

283
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:18,630
 Now, I can like you even without you. 

284
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,740
 "I can like you even without you"? 

285
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,400
 Park Yunjae, can you like me even if I'm not here?

 One, two, three. 

294

 What should we do now? 

295
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,960
 - Like this? 
 - Oh, yeah. 

296

 I think I could.

Jihun.

- Jihun! 
 - Gosh, you scared me!

310
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,120
Hi.

311
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,670
Looking pretty.

312
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:56,320
I'm sick of hearing you say that.

313
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,000
Oh my. A patch?

314
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,980
Is it from helping me yesterday?

315
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,800
No, it's none of your business.

316
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:10,070
I felt it last time. I think you're the tsundere type.

317
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,590
Right?

318
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,420
I've never had a neighborhood friend in my life.

319
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:21,810
I can't believe you live right next door. So cool.

320
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,590
Why do you keep following me?

321
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:28,800
Wow, they say birds of a feather. You have a similar vibe to Yunjae.

322
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,780
You don't listen to other people, do you?

323
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,320
So...

324
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,340
what vibe?

325
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,970
Innocent and cute?

326
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:48,060
Of course not as much as our puppy, Park Yunjae.

327
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,600
Woof, woof!

328
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,180
I miss Park Yunjae.

329
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,130
Park Yunjae.

330
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,410
What the?

331
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,110
Fill it up.

332
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,400
What's this? 
    

333
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:12,390
What's his deal?

334
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,180
Hey.

335
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,910
Sure.

336
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,820
No one's here?

337
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,260
Oh, they'll be here soon.

338
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,390
Why are we having a group project meeting here?

339
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:35,420
Hey, Minju.

340
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,600
How do I look today?

341
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,690
Are you going somewhere nice?

342
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,390
Here.

343
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:45,230
A group project meeting? How is this nice?

344
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,160
Wait.

345
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,370
Are you sure the others are coming?

346
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,350
- I'm leaving. 
 - Minju, just a moment.

347
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,520
It's my birthday today.

348
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:06,820
Could you please share a meal with me?

349
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,550
Welcome.

350
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:16,100
What do you think?

351
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,200
- Huh? 
 - Do you like it?

352
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:22,050
Yes, I love it.

353
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:25,250
- I'll take this. 
 - It's 10,000 won.

354
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,550
Here you go.

355
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,290
Here.

356
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,680
Is it my birthday present?

357
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,050
Let's say that.

358
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,260
Thank you so much, Minju.

359
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,430
I don't buy gifts like this for a man I'm interested in,

360
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:44,400
or have the slightest possibility of being interested in.

361
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,750
I mull it over and over, and think it through,

362
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:51,950
as if the gift I'm giving is for myself.

363
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,310
Do you get what I'm saying?

364
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,560
I hope you don't create any more uncomfortable situations.

365
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,690
Happy birthday, though.

366
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:24,450
 The one with a crown must bear its weight. 

367
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,410
Sit down.

368
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,420
Touch.

369
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,120
There. A little more. A little more.

370
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,480
It hurts! It hurts, Mom!

371
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,680
No, no! Stop, stop.

372
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,700
It hurts!

373
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,950
Let's wrap up. Relax.

374
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,320
What are we doing so early in the morning?

375
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,540
When did you learn yoga, Mom?

376
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,970
When I became a man like you.

377
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:57,704
Do you think it was easy for me?

378
00:28:57,704 --> 00:29:01,300
That's when I first learned meditation and yoga.

379
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,760
It'll be helpful for you.

380
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,780
It has also been a while for me, so I feel like I can fly.

381
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,000
You might be able to fly.

382
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,290
Look at my body. Does it look like I'll be able to fly with some yoga?

383
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:14,530
I'm over 70 kg.

384
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:18,430
There are rocks in my arms.

385
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:21,970
I was over 100 kg.

386
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,180
Whoa.

387
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,000
Yoga is great when you feel lost.

388
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,100
- Make it a habit. 
 - Okay.

389
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,800
Feel free to hate me and blame me.

390
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:54,070
I feel guilty towards you, but I can't just sit in my guilt.

391
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:56,630
I'll teach you and help you like today.

392
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:59,680
I don't hate you. Nor blame you.

393
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,370
Love is hard, but hate is easy.

394
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,800
Your life is already abnormal.

395
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,150
Take it easy. I'm okay.

396
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,940
I said I don't hate you.

397
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,820
Why do you keep saying that? It's annoying.

398
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:18,240
My sweet daughter, Jieun.

399
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,580
I'll go now.

400
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,220
Call me if anything happens.

401
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:56,600
   

402
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:05,350
   

403
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:16,200
   

404
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,230
   

405
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,510
This is the best-selling book on writing techniques.

406
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:29,030
There's always a reason why it's best-selling.

407
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,050
Huh?

408
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:34,690
Oh, I work in this industry. You can trust me.

409
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,680
Do you know Book Basket Publications?

410
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,450
Yes, I know it very well.

411
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:42,700
 Of all the books you read by our publishing house, 

412
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:47,140
 you noted "The Birth and Extinction of the Cosmos" as your favorite. 

413
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,120
 I first learned about the novel, 

414
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,010
 "The Birth and Extinction of the Cosmos," 

415
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:55,470
 when my boyfriend, an astronomy major, recommended it to me. 

416
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:02,220
How come you seem so familiar?

417
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,420
Wait a second. It's you, right?

418
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:10,540
- You can tell who I am? 
 - Of course, I can tell.

419
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:15,400
You're Glass Shoes' boyfriend. The doe-eyed hottie. Right?

420
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:20,660
I'm a huge fan of Glass Shoes.

421
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:24,130
I watched the video of you kissing so many times.

422
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:26,030
Oh, I see.

423
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:29,830
Are you a writer, too?

424
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,540
No, I'm not.

425
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,860
Gosh, I can tell you're fibbing.

426
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:40,200
Oh, our company is hosting a web novel contest next month.

427
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,920
Why don't you enter? 
    

428
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,430
Oh, it's just a hobby.

429
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,410
Hobbies become expertise, and expertise leads to a career.

430
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:52,440
Glass Shoes followed a friend and joined a contest, for which she was chosen,

431
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,160
and entered this path.

432
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,120
 I'm that friend. 

433
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,350
I'm sorry, I yapped too much when we just met.

434
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,820
I'll let you go.

435
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,100
Don't give up.

436
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:14,360
You know that famous saying from a director that the most personal things

437
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,580
are the most creative?

438
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,990
Try starting with your own story.

439
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,870
Okay. Thank you, Team Leader.

440
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,460
Bye now.

441
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,820
Wait.

442
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:36,420
Did I tell him I'm a team leader?

443
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,240
Hello.

444
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,760
- It's 28,800 won. 
 - Okay.

445
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,960
- Would you like a bag for 100 won? 
 - No, thanks.

446
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,110
- Do you need parking validation? 
 - Yes.

447
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,020
Who is this?

448
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:02,820
Hello?

449
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:07,310
   

450
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:02,480
They're definitely paying, right?

451
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:15,800
Young Master, please hug the maiden.

452
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,390
Good job.

453
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,500
- You're so difficult. 
 - Minju.

454
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,680
I love the chemistry between you two. Keep going like this.

455
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,820
Part 2 starts in 30 minutes, so be on standby.

456
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:53,020
Please try to be more realistically fond of each other.

457
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,390
Since many couples will come.

458
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,310
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

459
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,530
You did well for your first time.

460
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:03,070
Of course, your face did all the hard work.

461
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,800
How did you get my number?

462
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,200
- Lee Minhyeok. 
 - Oh, Minhyeok.

463
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,120
But what's the occasion? Why did you call me instead of Yunjae for this?

464
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,850
Capitalism is unforgiving.

465
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:21,940
The guy who dropped out was a model with chiseled-features.

466
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:26,390
What? Are you saying Yunjae is not chiseled?

467
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:31,210
I know he's a friend of ours, but I wouldn't say he's chiseled.

468
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,100
That's true.

469
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,480
Yunjae is more like white tofu than chiseled.

470
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,860
Oh my, you also think that?

471
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,650
I guess it wasn't just me.

472
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:43,940
You're right. Yunjae is like white

473
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,400
and squishy soft tofu.

474
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,040
Soft and squishy.

475
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,140
Is his left cheek softer? Or the right?

476
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,900
Gosh, I just want to take a bite out of him.

477
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:58,300
- Must be so soft. 
 - You can try and go to jail, then.

478
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,860
When did you start working here, though?

479
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,590
It looked like it had been more than a few times.

480
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,840
I might look demure,

481
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,530
but I've done every part-time gig in the book.

482
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,700
You can trust me.

483
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,170
Well...

484
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:16,550
I also asked them to pay in cash.

485
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,540
200,000 won.

486
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,880
- 200,000 won? 
 - Yeah.

487
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,240
Wow, amazing.

488
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,000
Hey, thank you.

489
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,420
Call me often. I'll do my best.

490
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,510
Oppa,

491
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,770
I was wondering...

492
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,430
- Just a second. 
  - I'm almost there. 

493
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:41,260
 I just need to go inside, right? 

494
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,610
Yunjae's almost here.

495
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,280
He said he wasn't coming...

496
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,940
I'm glad I told him I was with you.

497
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,890
Y-Yunjae?

498
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:53,930
- Yunjae is coming here? 
 - Yeah.

499
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:56,380
Why? You called him?

500
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,180
Yes. I thought it would be fun to hang out afterwards. Why?

501
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:02,580
Come on. You called Park Yunjae when I look like this?

502
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,160
What's wrong? You look the best now.

503
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,170
A manly and studious young master.

504
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:09,670
That's why. I'm totally a young master right now.

505
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,340
Hey.

506
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,060
I'm leaving.

507
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,010
Where are you going? Part two starts soon.

508
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:18,480
I can't appear onstage like this right now.

509
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,870
You need the money. 200,000 won.

510
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,710
I still can't.

511
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,410
Oppa!

512
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:29,810
Seriously.

513
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,400
Oppa.

514
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,640
Oppa!

515
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,230
He's gone mad.

516
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:51,570
What do I do?

517
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,420
Minju. Where's Jihun?

518
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,610
Did you lend him money or something?

519
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,200
What are you talking about?

520
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,810
I don't know. He ran away when I said you were coming.

521
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:05,420
Look at this. Is he Cinderella? What the heck?

522
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,570
I just don't get him at all.

523
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:10,990
Why did he run off?

524
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:14,570
We were having fun until I told him you were coming.

525
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,910
 Let's do that later. 

526
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:22,500
 It's on my bucket list. 

527
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,150
 Why later? Let's do it right now. 

528
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:27,770
 - Let's go. 
 - No. 

529
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:30,610
 I didn't even put makeup on today. 

530
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:35,240
 - You still look pretty without it. 
 - No, I don't. 

531
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,610
 I want to properly get ready 

532
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,440
 and go on a date with you, 

533
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,180
 and snap lots of photos. 

534
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,780
 And pick out a pretty hanbok. 

535
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,040
 Okay. 

536
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,910
 Let's do that. 

537
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:54,220
 Don't you think I would look great in a hanbok? 

538
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,860
 You'll be surprised. 

539
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:01,410
 You look the best when you're with me. 

540
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,850
You guys fought, huh?

541
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:15,020
Minju, we're back in ten minutes. Get ready.

542
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,800
What?

543
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,900
Gosh, what do I do...

544
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,580
We have no choice. You do it.

545
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,800
Do what?

546
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,010
We don't have time.

547
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,890
   

548
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,380
   

549
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,440
 Young Master, please hug the maiden. 

550
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:28,380
 Since this is the final show, 

551
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,980
 please give a light kiss on the maiden's lips. 

552
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,420
 I'll pay you more. 

553
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,920
 In just ten seconds. 

554
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:56,160
♫  A strangely familiar feeling  ♫

555
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:03,390
♫  The same warmth, a steady flutter  ♫

556
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:10,760
♫  Beyond the fading sunset  ♫

557
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:17,980
♫  Your light seeps quietly into me  ♫

558
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:25,580
♫  The way you look at me  ♫

559
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:32,020
 Ten, nine, eight, seven, 

560
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:35,520
 six, five, four, 

561
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,810
 three, two, one. 

562
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,260
Stop this!

563
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,840
What?

564
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,940
Young Master!

565
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,480
You were alive.

566
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:22,800
You bastard!

567
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:27,100
You vile scoundrel.

568
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:31,670
How dare you go after the maiden while I was away?

569
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:47,410
Young Master, I knew you would come to save me.

570
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,080
I'm sorry, Maiden.

571
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,610
I came too late.

572
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:57,630
I'm glad you're back alive.

573
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:59,830
Now that I'm back here alive,

574
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:02,130
I will...

575
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:06,000
What should I do?

576
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:11,900
Kill him.

577
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,460
That will end it.

578
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,380
K-Kill him?

579
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,070
You bastard.

580
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:28,100
Die!

581
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:43,020
Oh my god!

582
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,560
- Die. 
 - So scary.

583
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,370
Die now!

584
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,600
- Die? 
 - What are you doing?

585
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,510
Die.

586
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:56,110
I said die.

587
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:39,210
All right.

588
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:41,540
Here's your udon.

589
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,200
Enjoy.

590
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,400
- Check, please. 
 - Just a moment.

591
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,100
Enjoy.

592
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:58,990
- Would you like your receipt? 
 - No.

593
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:01,020
Here you go. Thank you.

594
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,040
Come again.

595
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:15,300
You're working too hard in exchange for a bowl of udon.

596
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,350
It's okay. I'll have another bowl later.

597
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:20,710
Another bowl?

598
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:39,200
   

599
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,330
Why? No response yet?

600
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:46,060
Gosh, that bastard.

601
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:49,580
Let me see. What did you say? Sit.

602
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:57,920
Oh my god.

603
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,590
That's why you didn't get a reply.

604
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:02,840
Listen carefully.

605
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:06,200
To move Hong Yeongseok, the eighth-year Noryangjin student,

606
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,700
you need to make him worry, not cheer him on.

607
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,340
W-W-Worry?

608
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:14,510
Okay! Make him worry.

609
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:17,230
When he first became a student

610
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:19,220
and failed the first few years,

611
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:21,380
I cheered him on with all my might.

612
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,470
I even made him chicken stew many times.

613
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:28,409
- But he stopped coming here at some point. 
 - Why?

614
00:47:28,409 --> 00:47:31,770
He felt burdened that I did that.

615
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:34,660
He felt bad that he kept failing.

616
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,770
I kept telling him to come, but he wouldn't.

617
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:38,820
You know what made him come back?

618
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:40,600
No, what was it?

619
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,390
I had back surgery.

620
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:46,090
He heard about the news and came over.

621
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:48,440
He cleaned for me, moved stuff around,

622
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,080
and even helped me make kimchi.

623
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,000
That's when I realized it.

624
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,390
I learned something.

625
00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:59,210
If I want to feed him a warm meal,

626
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,510
I'd better worry him.

627
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:03,970
Do you know what I mean?

628
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:05,140
Understand?

629
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:06,920
Understand.

630
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:22,370
Was I too obvious?

631
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:26,720
He sounded down when we talked on the phone earlier.

632
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,080
Should I text him and say I'm okay?

633
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,490
Or should I tell him the lady tipped me off?

634
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:36,000
Gosh, that makes me sound so pathetic.

635
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,030
 Hey, Kim Jihye! 

636
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:42,510
W-What happened? Are you okay?

637
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,700
I think I sprained my leg walking fast.

638
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:53,340
Hey, sit. Sit here.

639
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,710
Where's the guy who was following you?

640
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:58,950
He passed by me. I must've seen wrong.

641
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:02,000
I'm sorry.

642
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,340
I know you're busy studying.

643
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:06,900
You're the only person I know in Noryangjin.

644
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:10,440
Of course, you should call me. Don't be sorry.

645
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:13,440
Can you walk?

646
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:18,500
Yeah. It's not so bad that I can't walk.

647
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,930
Wait a minute.

648
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:23,520
I think hospitals are closed by now.

649
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,330
Oh, i-it's okay.

650
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:29,880
Just walk me to the bus station.

651
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:32,660
Will you be okay?

652
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,630
Okay, give me your bag.

653
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:38,380
Hold my hand.

654
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:41,230
- One, two, three. 
 - There we go.

655
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:43,430
- Careful, careful. 
 - Ouch.

656
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:45,140
Watch your step.

657
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:47,850
Just like that. Watch the threshold.

658
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:49,820
Gently.

659
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:56,100
Be sure to go to the hospital tomorrow.

660
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,740
You always fell when we were in school.

661
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:02,990
You remember?

662
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:05,100
What I remember from our school days

663
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:08,200
are my good looks and your humor.

664
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,200
Just those two things.

665
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,210
You're still good-looking.

666
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:16,400
I remember you not wearing glasses despite your poor vision.

667
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:20,230
After the procedure,

668
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:22,760
I realized the world looked much more beautiful before.

669
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,860
- Because I couldn't see as well. 
 - Is that why you liked me?

670
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:28,310
Hey, you were my desk buddy.

671
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:30,760
I saw you up close every day.

672
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:34,430
You took such good care of me.

673
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,930
Be careful.

674
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:39,400
- Ow, ow. 
 - Oh no.

675
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,000
- Does it hurt a lot? 
 - A little.

676
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,400
Be careful. Let's walk slowly.

677
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:51,200
What bus are you taking?

678
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,340
Number 129.

679
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:55,300
129? It's coming soon.

680
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,920
It's coming so soon.

681
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,200
Go to the hospital tomorrow.

682
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,810
Okay.

683
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:03,400
Here.

684
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:06,420
See you.

685
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:08,400
Bye.

686
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,940
Let's take a cab. I'll take you home.

687
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:26,900
N-No, I'm okay.

688
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:34,570
I don't think I can focus on studying if I send you off alone.

689
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:44,050
It'll be a problem if you can't focus on your studies.

690
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,190
Is that so funny?

691
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:00,540
Isn't it?

692
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:02,800
You cut Park Yunjae's neck with your hands.

693
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,770
It wasn't his neck.

694
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:07,830
Kang Minju or whatever, she's a crazy one.

695
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:10,370
How did she think to call you there?

696
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:14,150
I'm sure she can't even imagine that I'm Park Yunjae's girlfriend.

697
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:16,040
She acts like we're really close.

698
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,110
She's happy that she has a neighborhood friend.

699
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:22,340
What if she asks you to help her get together with Park Yunjae?

700
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,500
No way. She knows he has a girlfriend.

701
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,110
Is she pretty?

702
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:31,300
- She's not ugly. 
 - I see. She must be very pretty.

703
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,910
Hey.

704
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:38,900
Since you're my one and only friend,

705
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,850
we should not have any secrets.

706
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:48,160
I have something to confess to you.

707
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:54,890
Hey, no. I thought we cleared all that up.

708
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:57,990
What are you saying? It's not you this time.

709
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:03,250
You have someone else already?

710
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:05,910
Why? Jealous?

711
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:08,990
Who is it?

712
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:10,720
Well...

713
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,950
You also know this person.

714
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:17,200
I also know this person?

715
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:23,710
Hey, could it be Yunjae?

716
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:27,460
Did I press your button?

717
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:30,250
You keep talking about Yunjae, Yunjae, Yunjae.

718
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,680
You think I would like Park Yunjae?

719
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:36,010
My one and only best friend's boyfriend?

720
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:40,030
Then, who else do you and I both know?

721
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:44,420
Could it be Minhyeok?

722
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:49,160
Whoa. They say birds of a feather and whatnot.

723
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,670
So, are you two dating?

724
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:53,190
No.

725
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:55,300
But we did kiss.

726
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,050
What?

727
00:53:57,050 --> 00:54:00,200
I can't stop thinking about it.

728
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,320
That moment.

729
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:17,600
Anyway, help me out without making it so obvious. Okay?

730
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:24,110
What did you do when I told you I'm dating Yunjae?

731
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:27,040
I'm sure I was so happy for you.

732
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,550
 You guys got off on the wrong foot. 

733
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:33,330
 You know how it'll end. 

734
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:36,000
 In a disaster. Break up. 

735
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,560
 Hey, that's harsh. Disaster? 

736
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,830
 I mean, you two were set up with different people. 

737
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:44,030
 You two basically had an affair. 

738
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:45,750
 Affair? 

739
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:48,510
 We called it off while introducing ourselves. 

740
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:52,470
 - What affair? 
 - Regardless, still no. Break up. 

741
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:56,600
 I'm watching "Fly Me to the Moon 3" with Yunjae this evening. 

742
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,210
 What? 

743
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:00,260
 You watched 1 and 2 with me, 

744
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:02,760
 and you're watching 3 with him? 

745
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:07,530
 Seriously, you really can't do this if you're human. 

746
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:10,410
 Break up with him right now. 

747
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:13,350
I said that?

748
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:15,730
I don't remember.

749
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:18,360
Anyway, I got it. Congrats. I'll pray for you.

750
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,420
I'm off.

751
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,330
Bye.

752
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:27,140
Watch out for the vixen next door.

753
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:33,840
- What's this? 
 - A gift that comes with the book.

754
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,440
Hey, readers are sophisticated these days.

755
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,000
Aren't these too childish?

756
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:46,240
What are you doing?

757
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,960
Why are you doing that here?

758
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:51,460
- Go now. 
 - Okay, okay.

759
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:53,140
I heard you. I'm leaving.

760
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:54,900
Bye.

Dongi?

766
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,370
Why are you here?

767
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:25,860
How did you come here?

768
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:28,310
You haven't been picking up my calls.

769
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:30,750
I was waiting, just in case.

770
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:32,770
How do I look?

771
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:35,810
I bought some clothes to match the cap you got me yesterday.

772
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:38,880
I never told you I live here.

773
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,300
Did you follow me?

774
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:43,480
N-No, no, I didn't follow you.

775
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:47,340
Actually, I was worried when I sent you off alone at night last time, so I followed you.

776
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:50,020
So, you did follow me.

777
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:53,450
I'm really offended and annoyed right now.

778
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:55,190
Leave.

779
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:58,430
- Let's watch a movie this weekend. 
 - I have plans.

780
00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:00,780
Even if I didn't, I don't want to.

781
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,100
W-Why?

782
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:09,530
Think carefully as to why I might not want to.

783
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:12,100
You probably know, but I like you.

784
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:15,200
It was love at first sight, and I have set my eyes on you ever since.

785
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,850
That's your problem.

786
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,630
I'll treat you well.

787
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:20,740
I'll treat you way better than that bastard, Park Yunjae.

788
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:22,570
Why are you bringing up Yunjae?

789
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:25,070
I have a better GPA and a brighter future than he does.

790
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:27,960
I told you my parents run a golf course.

791
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:31,440
Oppa.

792
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,530
If you say anything else,

793
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:37,880
I don't think I'll ever want to see you again.

794
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,750
Want to keep going?

795
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:45,420
If you want to maintain the distance we're currently at,

796
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,610
leave.

797
00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:50,850
I've never thought of you as a man,

798
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:54,910
and there's no chance I ever will.

799
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:59,590
Then, what should I do to make you see me as a man?

800
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:02,870
Be born again.

801
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:05,480
I'll think about it then.

802
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:09,870
Step aside.

803
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:11,900
Minju, please give me a chance.

804
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:14,620
Won't you step aside? I'll scream.

805
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,820
Help!

806
00:58:19,110 --> 00:58:21,120
H-Help!

807
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:55,720
   

808
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:04,670

810

 - Our office has great coffee, don't we? 
 - Yes. 

811
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:22,800
 Where did you end up? 

812
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,300
 Sorry? 

813
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:29,500
 You must've liked another company more than ours since you didn't join us. 

814
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,960
 Oh, it's not that. 

815
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:35,410
 It's okay. I'm not the owner of this company. 

816
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:37,330
 I just... 

817
00:59:37,330 --> 00:59:41,000
 wanted to work with you, Jieun. 

818
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:43,580
 Me too. 

819
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,870
 I really wanted to work here, too. 

820
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:49,930
 Did something happen? 

821
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:52,160
 Well... 

822
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:55,600
 My body was acting up a bit. 

823
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,500
 Oh, I'm sorry. I had no idea. 

824
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:01,150
 Are you okay now? 

825
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:03,400
 Yes, I'm all better now. 

826
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,190
 I'll come back here for sure. 

827
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:07,740
 Even if it's just for the coffee. 

828
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:09,550
 Please. 

829
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:11,560
 - Enjoy. 
 - Thanks.

01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:27,160
♫  Your pleasant laughter  ♫

832
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:30,090
♫  A love like a fairy tale  ♫

833
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:33,810
♫  The world spins for me now  ♫

834
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:39,070
♫  The warmth that still lingers  ♫

835
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:42,010
♫  Your heart, always felt  ♫

836
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:45,070
♫  Never disappears  ♫

837
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:48,770
♫  I am calling out to you  ♫

838
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:51,610
♫  Open your eyes  ♫

839
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,180
♫  This moment I dreamed about  ♫

840
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:57,960
   

841
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,380
 My parents are on a trip. I wanted to hang out with you.

842
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:02,020
 What will you two do at home alone? 

843
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:03,530
 What's your type? 

844
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:06,320
 I'll consider that in the matchmaking. 

845
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,400
 I already found someone I like. 

846
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,580
 I also have someone I like. My first love. 

847
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:13,720
 How come you're here? 

848
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:16,520
 I'm getting used to living as a man. 

849
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,420
 Oh, this is yours. 

850
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:20,380
 What do we do with her? 

851
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:23,140
 You don't have feelings for me, do you? 

852
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:26,180
 What are you guys doing?
