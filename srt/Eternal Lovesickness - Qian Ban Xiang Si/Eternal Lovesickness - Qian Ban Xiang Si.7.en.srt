1
00:00:18,248 --> 00:00:19,687
The one I love

2
00:00:20,048 --> 00:00:22,007
is completely unmoved

3
00:00:23,608 --> 00:00:24,967
If he truly isn't moved

4
00:00:24,968 --> 00:00:27,207
why does he take such good care of you

5
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,287
If he is truly moved

6
00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:31,407
why does he always find excuses to leave

7
00:00:32,648 --> 00:00:34,367
What you say makes some sense

8
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:38,007
It seems besides allure

9
00:00:38,608 --> 00:00:40,647
I need to teach you something else

10
00:00:41,848 --> 00:00:42,847
Qingcheng

11
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:44,487
What else will you teach me

12
00:00:44,808 --> 00:00:46,247
The art of incense

13
00:00:47,968 --> 00:00:50,567
The art of incense, what's that

14
00:00:51,568 --> 00:00:54,367
Naturally, it's used for arousing passion

15
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,447
and enhancing pleasure

16
00:01:16,968 --> 00:01:18,327
Someone tampered with the incense in the room

17
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,207
Mr. Pei

18
00:01:24,088 --> 00:01:25,727


19
00:01:33,608 --> 00:01:35,727
It seems my skills are still lacking

20
00:01:35,968 --> 00:01:37,287
I have to rely on aphrodisiac incense

21
00:01:42,048 --> 00:01:42,887
You...

22
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,607
Your knowledge of the art of incense is still insufficient

23
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:51,047
When the dosage of calming incense and the aphrodisiac incense

24
00:01:51,048 --> 00:01:52,407
is excessive

25
00:01:53,008 --> 00:01:54,367
they will counteract each other

26
00:01:55,008 --> 00:01:56,047
making it ineffective

27
00:01:56,888 --> 00:01:58,167
There's such a saying

28
00:01:58,168 --> 00:01:59,327
I didn't know that

29
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:01,047
There's a lot you don't know

30
00:02:02,808 --> 00:02:04,647
Why can't I learn anything well

31
00:02:06,768 --> 00:02:07,967
If you want to learn incense

32
00:02:08,648 --> 00:02:09,727
You don't need anyone else

33
00:02:10,528 --> 00:02:11,727
I can teach you

34
00:02:20,888 --> 00:02:21,367


35
00:02:32,768 --> 00:02:34,247


36
00:04:16,848 --> 00:04:17,927
You may leave if you're done

37
00:04:27,448 --> 00:04:28,807
Mr. Pei

38
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:40,247
You are...

39
00:04:40,808 --> 00:04:41,927
I'm...

40
00:04:43,728 --> 00:04:44,807
so hot

41
00:04:46,808 --> 00:04:48,287
What did you put in the incense

42
00:04:49,848 --> 00:04:53,007
Just a few of your calming incenses

43
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,047
You added them all?

44
00:05:06,088 --> 00:05:07,327
So hot

45
00:05:11,928 --> 00:05:13,567
It contains union incense

46
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:15,807
If the amount is increased

47
00:05:16,488 --> 00:05:17,847
it has an aphrodisiac effect

48
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:30,447
Then I'll go back to my room and reflect

49
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,847
The union incense's effect hasn't worn off

50
00:05:37,368 --> 00:05:38,807
I can't let you go back

51
00:05:49,288 --> 00:05:50,127


52
00:05:50,168 --> 00:05:51,127


53
00:05:51,248 --> 00:05:52,007
Stand firm

54
00:05:53,928 --> 00:05:55,287
Maintain your balance

55
00:05:58,288 --> 00:05:59,647
So heavy

56
00:06:00,608 --> 00:06:01,887
From now on

57
00:06:02,248 --> 00:06:03,727
we practice Qigong

58
00:06:04,408 --> 00:06:06,327
Next, there's also sword

59
00:06:06,328 --> 00:06:07,247
archery

60
00:06:07,248 --> 00:06:08,167
poison

61
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:08,967
heart

62
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:10,367
Heart?

63
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:12,927
What is heart

64
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,807
You will naturally know in the future

65
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:18,167
Now, do five hundred squats

66
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:21,527
Remember, use your Dantian

67
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:24,887
Alright

68
00:06:27,808 --> 00:06:29,327
One

69
00:06:30,328 --> 00:06:30,967
Keep going

70
00:06:30,968 --> 00:06:31,967
Two

71
00:06:36,808 --> 00:06:38,727
Get up, you haven't finished yet

72
00:06:39,368 --> 00:06:41,447
Sister, let me.....

73
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,927
Rest... Rest a little more

74
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,407
Rest a little more

75
00:06:46,408 --> 00:06:49,047


76
00:06:53,608 --> 00:06:55,087
Let's stop here for today

77
00:06:55,088 --> 00:06:55,967
Hurry up and go

78
00:06:57,048 --> 00:06:57,927
What's wrong

79
00:06:58,328 --> 00:06:59,727
Don't ask, just go quickly

80
00:07:06,488 --> 00:07:07,607


81
00:07:22,128 --> 00:07:22,607


82
00:07:45,128 --> 00:07:45,887


83
00:08:04,808 --> 00:08:05,727
Please

84
00:08:13,848 --> 00:08:15,247
Tea reflects its maker

85
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:16,767
Refreshingly fragrant

86
00:08:18,728 --> 00:08:19,807
}Your Highness

87
00:08:20,648 --> 00:08:22,247
What brings you here today

88
00:08:30,368 --> 00:08:31,647
Leave no one

89
00:08:32,088 --> 00:08:33,647
on the list

90
00:08:34,808 --> 00:08:35,967
Pei Qianyu

91
00:08:37,248 --> 00:08:39,167
Since he shows no mercy

92
00:08:39,968 --> 00:08:41,727
Don't blame me

93
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:43,847
for being ruthless

94
00:08:45,928 --> 00:08:48,847
Aren't these newly appointed officials by the court

95
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:50,567
Why kill them

96
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:52,847
No harm in telling you

97
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:56,167
None of these people are mine

98
00:08:56,648 --> 00:08:58,327
What I decide

99
00:08:59,168 --> 00:09:00,967
no one can stop

100
00:09:02,968 --> 00:09:04,087
In the end

101
00:09:04,288 --> 00:09:05,447
these positions

102
00:09:05,768 --> 00:09:07,967
will be vacant for me

103
00:09:17,168 --> 00:09:18,207
You're back

104
00:09:18,568 --> 00:09:19,847
What did you bring

105
00:09:22,968 --> 00:09:24,327
So many delicious things

106
00:09:27,368 --> 00:09:28,167
What's wrong

107
00:09:29,728 --> 00:09:30,647
It's nothing, nothing

108
00:09:30,808 --> 00:09:32,527
I just twisted my ankle while practicing swordsmanship

109
00:09:32,528 --> 00:09:33,727
I just need to rest

110
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:05,927
Your shoulder is dislocated

111
00:10:06,368 --> 00:10:07,567
I'll set it for you

112
00:10:08,048 --> 00:10:09,207
Let the servants

113
00:10:09,528 --> 00:10:10,527
do the heavy work

114
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,407
I can take care of myself

115
00:10:13,928 --> 00:10:15,487
It seems I was overthinking

116
00:10:15,808 --> 00:10:16,767
These pastries

117
00:10:17,328 --> 00:10:18,327
I’ll take them

118
00:10:19,048 --> 00:10:20,167
No, no, no

119
00:10:20,168 --> 00:10:21,527
I'll eat, I'll eat

120
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,047
This is donkey rolls, the Qi's specialty

121
00:10:29,408 --> 00:10:30,967
This is Grand Zhou's special pastry

122
00:10:31,488 --> 00:10:33,207
This is rice cakes,the Jiang's specialty

123
00:10:33,728 --> 00:10:35,647
This is almond cookies,the Beiyuan's specialty

124
00:10:36,768 --> 00:10:38,327
These are all tributes from various countries

125
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,247
The imperial chef insisted on giving them to me

126
00:10:40,768 --> 00:10:42,087
I brought them back for you

127
00:10:57,928 --> 00:10:59,047
What

128
00:10:59,048 --> 00:11:00,047
Not good?

129
00:11:01,488 --> 00:11:02,327
Delicious
