1
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:19,899
Foolish ruler

2
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,619
He's a foolish ruler

3
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,419
Uncle

4
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,419
What happened

5
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,899
Why are you in such a hurry

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,339
The hounds are killed for food

7
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,539
once all the hares are bagged

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,459
He wants to kill me

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,299
Kill...

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,379
Kill you?

11
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,619
Now he has no use for me

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,299
His Majesty

13
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,899
He took away my military power

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,899
If he's so heartless

15
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,299
then don't blame me for being ruthless

16
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,459
This

17
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,779
must be Mr. Pei's idea

18
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,259
He secretly hates us

19
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,579
Plan ahead

20
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,619
We've raised three hundred elite soldiers

21
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,979
It's time for them to come out

22
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,579
Then we will attack the capital directly

23
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,379
and seize the throne

24
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,739
Pei Qianyu

25
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,619
is just a turtle

26
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,419
in a jar

27
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,859
If our silver had not been confiscated before

28
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,699
We could mobilize more troops now

29
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,819
With the current manpower

30
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,939
We need to

31
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,419
plan this carefully

32
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,059
Don't be hasty

33
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:39,899
Uncle

34
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,659
It's your turn.

35
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,419
The date is set?

36
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,179
It's best not to ask about things you shouldn't know

37
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,139
Your Highness, you don't trust me?

38
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,059
You just need to lure Mr. Pei

39
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,739
out of the palace

40
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,179
When I ascend the throne

41
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,579
I'll help you

42
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,819
kill him

43
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,979
I have already broken with him

44
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,939
I don't know if he'll agree to see me

45
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,939
That's your problem

46
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,179
Maybe if he sees this handkerchief

47
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,259
he will come out

48
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,939
It's for you

49
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,259
She arranged to meet you tomorrow at noon

50
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,739
at Ten Mile Slope

51
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,739
How did you avoid the guards

52
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,259
Of course

53
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,459
I used the charm techniques of Buddha Pavilion

54
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,619
Be sure to take Miss Jiang

55
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,579
to Ten Mile Slope

56
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:14,939
Yes

57
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,499
Go to Ten Mile Slope

58
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,659
Yes

59
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,499
Your Highness

60
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,459
Something's wrong here

61
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,579
Retreat

62
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,819
There's a trick in the palace

63
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,219
Don't retreat

64
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,139
I'm just one step

65
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,859
away from the throne

66
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,379
You traitor

67
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,059
How dare you rebel

68
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,299
Chief Eunuch

69
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,819
Take him down

70
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,979
Chief Eunuch?

71
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,179
I'm afraid your Chief Eunuch

72
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,059
has long been cut to pieces by my ambushed swordsmen

73
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,859
And that Princess Jiang

74
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,859
a stupid woman who thought she was clever

75
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,899
should have gone to hell with him by now

76
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,499
Father

77
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,179
Accept your fate

78
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,739
Who said that

79
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,499
I'm alive and well

80
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,179
Impossible

81
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,859
You should have been...

82
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,219
I will never trust you again

83
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,859
What are you doing

84
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,059
Listen

85
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:45,939
Lee

86
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,339
I would never lie to you

87
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,939
The reason I didn't let you assassinate Emperor Zhou

88
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,499
is because he is still useful to me

89
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,539
Back then, the Pei family had great military merits

90
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,339
which made Emperor Zhou jealous

91
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,179
So even though he knew the Pei family was innocent

92
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,499
he still falsely accused them of treason

93
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,019
and executed the entire family

94
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,379
The Pei family had extensive connections in the court

95
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,019
If it weren't for the pleas of many ministers

96
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,779
I wouldn't have been spared at fourteen

97
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,019
and sent to the palace to serve

98
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,379
Lee

99
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,819
If the Pei family's case isn't overturned

100
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,259
I can't face my ancestors

101
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,339
But...

102
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,259
But if Emperor Zhou dies

103
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,579
Wouldn't the new emperor overturn the case just the same

104
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,819
No, it wouldn’t

105
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,579
The Crown Prince is involved in this matter.

106
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,899
If he ascends the throne

107
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,619
Pei's family will never be able to retract the case

108
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,139
If the Third Prince is crowned

109
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,699
I'm already on good terms with him

110
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,379
People will criticize

111
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,059
the new emperor is just paving the way for his loyal subjects

112
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,859
Then even if the Pei family is innocent

113
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,019
It will seem less innocent

114
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,899
because of this connection

115
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,899
That's why I've been cautious over the years

116
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,819
to get close to Emperor Zhou

117
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,019
and plan slowly

118
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,459
Does it hurt

119
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,219
Yes

120
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,859
But it

121
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,659
makes me feel alive

122
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,059
Lee

123
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,659
Before you came into my life

124
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,859
I only had one mission

125
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,299
to overturn the Pei family's case

126
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,259
Since you appeared

127
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,939
I realized that my life that no one cared about

128
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,299
is cherished by someone

129
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,219
My insignificant emotions are valued

130
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,419
My trivial experiences

131
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,939
are esteemed

132
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,179
Don't say it

133
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,619
You're not that cheap

134
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,899
And I'm not that good either

135
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,179
Lee

136
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,259
The most important thing now is

137
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,419
Zhou Xuanhe is as war like as the Emperor Zhou

138
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,339
He's just as murderous as Prince North

139
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,339
Only by placing a benevolent ruler like the Third Prince on the throne

140
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,059
can we end the wars

141
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,179
Otherwise, what happened to Jiang

142
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,819
could happen to any other country

143
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,339
Only by stopping the wars

144
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,259
can the people of the world

145
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,579
enjoy lasting peace

146
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,539
But how can you make me let go of

147
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,539
the hatred of destroying my country?

148
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,139
I know this pain

149
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,899
I promise you

150
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,499
I will make Emperor Zhou pay the price

151
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,819
Only then

152
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,419
can you get close to Zhou Xuanhe

153
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,539
We'll be able to reap the benefits

154
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,619
when they turn against each other

155
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,979
I'll kill you

156
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,659
It's uncertain who will kill whom
