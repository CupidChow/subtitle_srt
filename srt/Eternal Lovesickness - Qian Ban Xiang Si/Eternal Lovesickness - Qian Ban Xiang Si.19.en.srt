1
00:00:16,572 --> 00:00:17,571
Father

2
00:00:17,572 --> 00:00:18,811
I was wrong before

3
00:00:18,812 --> 00:00:20,171
I regret it deeply

4
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,331
Thank you for forgiving me

5
00:00:33,012 --> 00:00:34,251
To know one's mistakes and correct them

6
00:00:34,372 --> 00:00:35,571
is a great virtue

7
00:00:36,652 --> 00:00:37,491
Sit down

8
00:00:41,772 --> 00:00:43,971
Today it's just you and your brother

9
00:00:45,052 --> 00:00:47,691
I hope you can open your hearts

10
00:00:49,292 --> 00:00:50,091
The third

11
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:52,691
You should also offer a toast to your brother

12
00:00:53,372 --> 00:00:55,851
He's suffered a lot this time

13
00:00:58,452 --> 00:00:59,211
Yes

14
00:01:01,772 --> 00:01:02,731
Brother

15
00:01:04,052 --> 00:01:05,131
you've suffered a lot

16
00:01:06,972 --> 00:01:07,971
We are all family

17
00:01:08,492 --> 00:01:09,651
No need to be so distant

18
00:01:15,452 --> 00:01:16,651
Everything

19
00:01:17,092 --> 00:01:19,051
depends on tonight

20
00:01:21,052 --> 00:01:22,491
Sit down

21
00:01:25,812 --> 00:01:26,611
The third

22
00:01:27,292 --> 00:01:28,491
This is your favorite food

23
00:01:30,492 --> 00:01:31,491
Here

24
00:01:38,852 --> 00:01:39,571
Father

25
00:01:40,492 --> 00:01:41,611
Is it your old ailment acting up again

26
00:01:42,692 --> 00:01:43,611
It's nothing serious

27
00:01:44,612 --> 00:01:46,891
Light a stick of the Chief Eunuch's incense

28
00:02:03,212 --> 00:02:03,811
Chief Eunuch

29
00:02:04,652 --> 00:02:05,811
Someone from the palace just came

30
00:02:05,812 --> 00:02:07,051
asking you to attend to the Emperor

31
00:02:11,772 --> 00:02:12,451
Okay

32
00:02:13,052 --> 00:02:13,611
You may leave

33
00:02:58,932 --> 00:03:00,171
Protect the Emperor

34
00:03:08,292 --> 00:03:09,051
Catch the assassin

35
00:03:09,212 --> 00:03:10,051
Don't let her escape

36
00:03:10,052 --> 00:03:10,651
Go quickly

37
00:03:10,652 --> 00:03:11,731
Catch her

38
00:03:16,852 --> 00:03:18,291
Mr. Pei, where is the assassin

39
00:03:19,452 --> 00:03:20,131
She ran that way

40
00:03:20,452 --> 00:03:21,011
Chase her

41
00:03:21,652 --> 00:03:22,171
Chase

42
00:03:45,132 --> 00:03:47,131
You've been lying to me all along

43
00:03:48,652 --> 00:03:49,771
This is very dangerous

44
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:51,731
You knew from the beginning

45
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,371
that I am the Princess of Jiang

46
00:03:56,372 --> 00:03:57,891
You've been using me

47
00:03:59,652 --> 00:04:01,691
and watching me all this time

48
00:04:02,932 --> 00:04:03,691
You go first

49
00:04:04,172 --> 00:04:05,331
The Imperial Guards are coming

50
00:04:06,252 --> 00:04:07,371
I'll explain when I get back

51
00:04:11,172 --> 00:04:12,251
So it's all true

52
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:17,731
The destruction of Jiang really involved you

53
00:04:20,452 --> 00:04:20,971
Sir

54
00:04:22,932 --> 00:04:23,771
How long did I sleep

55
00:04:24,452 --> 00:04:25,851
A full twelve hours

56
00:04:26,092 --> 00:04:27,491
It's midnight again

57
00:04:30,492 --> 00:04:31,851
Lee hasn't come back yet?

58
00:04:43,052 --> 00:04:43,651
Sir

59
00:04:43,652 --> 00:04:44,731
The medicine

60
00:05:27,492 --> 00:05:28,331
Lee

61
00:05:28,892 --> 00:05:30,371
I couldn't kill you last night

62
00:05:31,172 --> 00:05:32,411
How dare you come here?

63
00:05:33,212 --> 00:05:35,091
It's not what you think

64
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:37,251
Come back with me

65
00:05:37,972 --> 00:05:38,851
I'll explain

66
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:40,011
Explain what

67
00:05:41,492 --> 00:05:42,611
Explain your status

68
00:05:43,172 --> 00:05:45,211
as the Chief Eunuch of the Directorate of Protocol

69
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:46,811
second only to the Emperor

70
00:05:47,412 --> 00:05:48,691
Or explain that three years ago

71
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:51,011
you went to Jiang to investigate the terrain

72
00:05:52,092 --> 00:05:53,371
I really did not expect it

73
00:05:55,492 --> 00:05:56,211
Pei Qianyu

74
00:05:58,212 --> 00:06:00,451
Since I stepped into Zhou

75
00:06:01,052 --> 00:06:03,011
Since the moment you saved me

76
00:06:05,252 --> 00:06:06,691
All of them were your scheme

77
00:06:08,092 --> 00:06:08,651
Lee

78
00:06:10,092 --> 00:06:10,971
Listen to me

79
00:06:12,612 --> 00:06:14,411
I never meant to deceive you

80
00:06:15,572 --> 00:06:16,891
I really have my reasons

81
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:20,651
From the moment you saved me three years ago

82
00:06:22,172 --> 00:06:24,131
I fell deeply in love with you

83
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:27,851
Even though I couldn't reveal

84
00:06:27,852 --> 00:06:29,131
my true identity all these years

85
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:32,051
Everything I've done

86
00:06:33,132 --> 00:06:35,891
has been genuine and sincere

87
00:06:39,572 --> 00:06:41,491
I will never trust you again

88
00:06:53,132 --> 00:06:54,091
My name is Pei Qianyu

89
00:06:54,612 --> 00:06:56,371
I am just a lowly palace guard

90
00:06:57,012 --> 00:06:58,091
The person I've decided on

91
00:06:58,612 --> 00:06:59,891
It's for life

92
00:07:00,812 --> 00:07:02,331
Even if I have to prison you

93
00:07:02,852 --> 00:07:04,691
I will keep you by my side

94
00:07:05,412 --> 00:07:06,731
In this life

95
00:07:07,692 --> 00:07:09,051
I am yours alone

96
00:07:09,692 --> 00:07:10,931
I like you

97
00:07:11,812 --> 00:07:13,371
I will take responsibility

98
00:07:44,012 --> 00:07:44,931
Chief Eunuch

99
00:07:46,212 --> 00:07:48,491
Who sent the assassin

100
00:07:51,092 --> 00:07:52,091
It concerns the royal family

101
00:07:52,892 --> 00:07:54,011
I dare not speak recklessly

102
00:07:54,812 --> 00:07:56,011
I permit you to speak

103
00:07:57,652 --> 00:07:58,411
It's simple

104
00:07:59,652 --> 00:08:00,771
Who benefits the most

105
00:08:01,652 --> 00:08:02,971
is the one behind it

106
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:14,491
It's that traitor Xuanhe

107
00:08:16,812 --> 00:08:17,731
I am guilty

108
00:08:18,412 --> 00:08:19,331
Stand up

109
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:21,171
I permitted you to speak

110
00:08:22,292 --> 00:08:22,931
Yes

111
00:08:24,612 --> 00:08:28,491
I thought his disposition changed after his demotion

112
00:08:29,052 --> 00:08:30,611
I lifted his confinement specially

113
00:08:31,412 --> 00:08:32,651
I didn't expect...

114
00:08:33,252 --> 00:08:34,811
This is just my speculation

115
00:08:35,852 --> 00:08:37,331
If the former crown prince truly has ambition

116
00:08:38,812 --> 00:08:40,491
We must be cautious of the third prince as well

117
00:08:41,612 --> 00:08:43,251
After all, he is highly regarded in court

118
00:08:44,052 --> 00:08:45,611
If the former crown prince seeks power

119
00:08:47,052 --> 00:08:48,451
he might eliminate him

120
00:09:07,372 --> 00:09:08,131
So

121
00:09:08,812 --> 00:09:09,931
Did I lie to you?

122
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:13,971
I want to kill him

123
00:09:16,212 --> 00:09:18,371
You're not his match right now

124
00:09:19,772 --> 00:09:20,931
Even now I am not

125
00:09:23,372 --> 00:09:24,851
his match, either

126
00:09:26,612 --> 00:09:27,411
However

127
00:09:30,252 --> 00:09:31,771
If you help me

128
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,611
When I ascend to the throne

129
00:09:34,972 --> 00:09:35,771
then

130
00:09:36,212 --> 00:09:37,611
he won't be able to escape

131
00:09:39,972 --> 00:09:40,851
I'll help you

132
00:09:42,132 --> 00:09:43,451
What do you need me to do

133
00:09:44,132 --> 00:09:47,371
First kill Pei Qianyu's close allies

134
00:09:47,492 --> 00:09:48,891
the third prince

135
00:09:49,612 --> 00:09:53,491
He must have played a significant role in my downfall

136
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:56,331
I want him to pay now
