1
00:00:15,969 --> 00:00:17,528
I made a fish today

2
00:00:18,209 --> 00:00:19,208
But a cat snatched it away

3
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:20,928
While chasing it, I found out

4
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:22,728
Someone had cut off this cat's tail

5
00:00:23,049 --> 00:00:24,008
Cut it off?

6
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:31,768
It's okay, Jin

7
00:00:32,649 --> 00:00:33,448
don't eat fish

8
00:00:33,569 --> 00:00:34,648
You can go now

9
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:40,168
I eat crabs

10
00:00:40,169 --> 00:00:41,608
I love crabs

11
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:51,568
Wait

12
00:00:51,569 --> 00:00:52,808
Are you capable?

13
00:00:56,009 --> 00:00:57,088
Oh no

14
00:00:57,089 --> 00:00:59,008
He must mind people saying he's not capable

15
00:01:11,249 --> 00:01:12,448
Do you think I'm capable?

16
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:18,608
You're so impressive

17
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:19,688
How are you so amazing?

18
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:20,808
Absolutely capable

19
00:01:30,249 --> 00:01:32,408
Too bad you're a eunuch

20
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:34,248
Are you going to eat or not?

21
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:35,768
Eat

22
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:36,768
I'll eat

23
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:39,448
Delicious

24
00:01:39,449 --> 00:01:40,448
You eat too

25
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:41,968
Don't be too sad

26
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:43,728
If you don't have it, you don't have it

27
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:46,128
Even if you have it, it doesn't mean it works

28
00:01:46,129 --> 00:01:47,568
You're just fine as you are now

29
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:49,248
There's no need to chase perfection

30
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:51,368
Let the past be the past

31
00:01:51,489 --> 00:01:52,888
The most important thing is

32
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:54,488
What will come next

33
00:02:00,169 --> 00:02:02,168
What are you rambling about?

34
00:02:03,449 --> 00:02:05,208
He might be even more upset now

35
00:02:05,249 --> 00:02:06,968
I can't be so blunt

36
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:11,808
Eat happily

37
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:14,328
This is very whole

38
00:02:22,529 --> 00:02:23,248
Come

39
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:25,288
This rice cake is especially delicious

40
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:26,368
Try some

41
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:32,768
Never lose confidence

42
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:34,608
Come

43
00:02:34,609 --> 00:02:35,368
Take a bite

44
00:02:46,929 --> 00:02:48,328
111

45
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:52,408
So handsome

46
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:54,168
Yet, a eunuch

47
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:12,168
He's clearly a eunuch

48
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:13,648
But why am I still so nervous?

49
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:21,928
Why am I avoiding him?

50
00:03:31,369 --> 00:03:32,928
|What's been going on with you lately?

51
00:03:33,249 --> 00:03:34,568
You look depressed

52
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:36,928
Sister Qingcheng

53
00:03:37,809 --> 00:03:38,928
Do you have

54
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:41,328
that kind of medicine?

55
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:44,168
What kind of medicine?

56
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:55,928
Since he's already a eunuch

57
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:58,048
No medicine can help

58
00:03:59,809 --> 00:04:00,808
Besides

59
00:04:00,809 --> 00:04:02,768
You, an unmarried girl

60
00:04:03,929 --> 00:04:05,408
What do you need that medicine for?

61
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:08,008
If you don't have it, that's fine

62
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:09,728
Then Sister Qingcheng

63
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,248
Do you have any medicine for external injuries?

64
00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:13,488
Are you hurt?

65
00:04:14,089 --> 00:04:15,128
No, no

66
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:18,368
It's for a friend

67
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:42,528
How's the progress of getting close to Zhou Xuantong?

68
00:04:43,929 --> 00:04:45,008
Very smooth

69
00:04:45,929 --> 00:04:48,168
I've played the pipa for him a few times

70
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:49,928
And did a few favors

71
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:52,128
He now believes I have feelings for him

72
00:04:52,489 --> 00:04:53,728
He trusts me a lot

73
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:13,808
Greetings, Your Highness

74
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:31,168
Please sit

75
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:33,368
Thank you, Your Highness

76
00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:00,288
He really has fallen for you, hasn't he?

77
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:10,648
Tell me

78
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:12,808
Who is the woman in Pei Qianyu's residence?

79
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:14,448
Your Highness

80
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:15,768
You're hurting me

81
00:06:18,049 --> 00:06:18,848
She

82
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:21,288
She is the Princess of Jiang

83
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:22,728
Jiang Sili

84
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:24,528
What?

85
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:26,568
The Princess of Jiang?

86
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:33,568
She is actually still alive?

87
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:36,368
If I hand her over to my father

88
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:38,768
Wouldn't that be a great achievement?

89
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:42,248
This would surely make him favor me more

90
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:44,488
Wouldn't it?

91
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:48,728
Your Highness

92
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:50,128
Jiang has fallen

93
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:52,048
What's the point of this achievement?

94
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:54,728
Moreover, who can prove

95
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:56,448
That she is the Princess of Jiang?

96
00:06:57,569 --> 00:06:59,728
Since Pei Qianyu dares to keep her

97
00:07:00,329 --> 00:07:02,568
He must have made full preparations

98
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:04,968
Keeping her

99
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:07,168
could be of greater use to us

100
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:08,928
Moreover

101
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:11,928
She is now completely under my control

102
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:15,528
Using her to hold back Pei Qianyu

103
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,328
I've already checked

104
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:19,608
She is indeed Mr. Pei's beloved

105
00:07:19,929 --> 00:07:20,808
Otherwise

106
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:23,128
Why would she be living in his residence?

107
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:29,848
It's actually quite funny

108
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:33,168
A eunuch

109
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:37,328
falling for a princess of a fallen kingdom

110
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:40,648
Interesting

111
00:07:41,049 --> 00:07:42,968
Really interesting

112
00:08:01,609 --> 00:08:02,608
What are you doing?

113
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:09,208
Aren't you supposed to be on duty at the palace?

114
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,528
Why are you back?

115
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:14,408
I might as well tell you

116
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:17,208
Investigating a case

117
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:19,888
How can you, a mere eun...

118
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:23,768
a guard, investigate a case?

119
00:08:24,049 --> 00:08:25,128
A case of embezzlement

120
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:26,808
It's an order from our superior

121
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:30,088
The Emperor ordered us to solve the case within a month

122
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:31,808
But now

123
00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:33,608
We still have no leads

124
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:35,168
How much money was embezzled?

125
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:36,768
Over five million taels

126
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:38,608
Five million?

127
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:40,328
If I had that much money

128
00:08:40,329 --> 00:08:42,008
I wouldn't even know where to hide it

129
00:08:44,249 --> 00:08:45,208
Exactly

130
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:47,328
The accounts are easy to hide

131
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:50,008
But not the silver

132
00:08:56,689 --> 00:08:58,048
Here we go again

133
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:01,128
I need to step out for a bit

134
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:04,128
Alright, be careful

135
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:19,408
He just smiled at me

136
00:09:21,489 --> 00:09:23,408
Stay calm, Jiang Sili

137
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:26,048
You must not fall for him

138
00:09:36,249 --> 00:09:37,208
Issue the orders

139
00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:38,328
Starting today

140
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:40,528
Closely monitor all the Crown Prince's properties

141
00:09:40,689 --> 00:09:41,968
Including his every move

142
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:44,888
Yes
