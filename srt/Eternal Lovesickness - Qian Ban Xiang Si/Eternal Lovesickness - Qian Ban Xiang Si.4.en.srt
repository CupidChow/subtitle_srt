1
00:00:33,168 --> 00:00:33,967
Wearing this

2
00:00:34,288 --> 00:00:35,047
It's definitely gonna work

3
00:00:47,568 --> 00:00:49,727
Mr. Pei

4
00:00:53,648 --> 00:00:54,407
Mr. Pei

5
00:00:56,448 --> 00:00:57,247
Lee

6
00:00:58,808 --> 00:00:59,567
Mr. Pei

7
00:01:27,048 --> 00:01:27,847
What are you doing here?

8
00:01:30,088 --> 00:01:31,527
Mr. Pei

9
00:01:32,528 --> 00:01:34,247
Iwas just afraid

10
00:01:34,568 --> 00:01:35,167
Afraid of what?

11
00:01:35,168 --> 00:01:38,007
Seeing you fully submerged in water

12
00:01:38,328 --> 00:01:38,927
Just in case

13
00:01:43,088 --> 00:01:44,487
Then I'll be leaving

14
00:01:51,128 --> 00:01:52,727
You said you would offer yourself before

15
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:54,967
Seems that was just an excuse

16
00:01:55,488 --> 00:01:56,527
To stay here

17
00:01:57,888 --> 00:01:59,887
I do want to stay by your side

18
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,527
Do whatever you want, sir

19
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:15,527
Lee

20
00:02:16,848 --> 00:02:17,607
I don't need a woman

21
00:02:21,488 --> 00:02:23,207
The capital is no ordinary place

22
00:02:23,888 --> 00:02:25,287
It's extremely dangerous here

23
00:02:26,928 --> 00:02:27,567
You should go

24
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,647
I will ensure your safety

25
00:02:32,048 --> 00:02:33,287
I want to stay in the capital

26
00:02:56,928 --> 00:02:58,727
How is the preparation going?

27
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,487
The documents were sent out a few days ago

28
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:02,807
I assume

29
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,167
They won't just let it go

30
00:03:05,488 --> 00:03:07,487
That's exactly what I want

31
00:03:09,488 --> 00:03:10,087
By the way

32
00:03:10,808 --> 00:03:11,807
Miss Lee

33
00:03:11,808 --> 00:03:12,887
Went to the Buddha Pavilion

34
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:16,687
Buddha Pavilion?

35
00:03:18,888 --> 00:03:19,887
As far as I know

36
00:03:20,808 --> 00:03:22,607
The Pavilion Master, Ji Qingcheng

37
00:03:22,608 --> 00:03:23,807
Though she's from Jiang Country

38
00:03:24,168 --> 00:03:26,047
She has always worked for the Crown Prince

39
00:03:28,728 --> 00:03:30,047
Keep a close eye on her

40
00:03:30,608 --> 00:03:31,567
Every move she makes

41
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:33,087
Report to me at any time

42
00:03:33,888 --> 00:03:34,567
Yes

43
00:03:52,888 --> 00:03:54,807
I know you are here for revenge

44
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,207
But this path

45
00:03:57,808 --> 00:03:59,207
Is not easy

46
00:04:00,888 --> 00:04:02,327
I'm already deeply mired

47
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:05,647
I hope you don't end up the same

48
00:04:07,368 --> 00:04:08,367
Pei Qianyu

49
00:04:09,008 --> 00:04:10,767
You've got some nerve

50
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,407
What brings Your Highness to my place today?

51
00:04:32,968 --> 00:04:33,767
Pei Qianyu

52
00:04:34,488 --> 00:04:35,807
Don't play dumb with me

53
00:04:36,808 --> 00:04:39,567
You rejected all the people I arranged

54
00:04:40,288 --> 00:04:41,407
What do you mean by that?

55
00:04:43,848 --> 00:04:44,687
Nothing much

56
00:04:45,768 --> 00:04:47,407
Just thought they weren't capable enough

57
00:04:48,448 --> 00:04:50,607
If Your Highness is dissatisfied with my arrangements

58
00:04:51,688 --> 00:04:53,487
Feel free to complain to His Majesty

59
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:55,487
You think

60
00:04:56,568 --> 00:04:58,167
I wouldn't dare?

61
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:02,247
Please, feel free

62
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:12,887
Pei Qianyu

63
00:05:13,728 --> 00:05:15,487
Just you wait

64
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,167
Your dance skills

65
00:06:32,288 --> 00:06:34,087
Really are getting better

66
00:06:40,688 --> 00:06:43,687
If Your Highness really cares about me

67
00:06:44,688 --> 00:06:46,807
Why not give me the antidote

68
00:06:48,168 --> 00:06:49,007
to Strychnine?

69
00:06:51,088 --> 00:06:53,327
Stay at the Buddha Pavilion

70
00:06:54,048 --> 00:06:55,647
And work for me

71
00:06:56,728 --> 00:06:57,647
The antidote

72
00:06:58,448 --> 00:07:00,087
Will naturally be given to you

73
00:07:01,248 --> 00:07:02,367
Buddha Pavilion

74
00:07:02,928 --> 00:07:05,447
Is a mere assassin organization

75
00:07:06,248 --> 00:07:07,247
And I

76
00:07:07,847 --> 00:07:10,327
Am merely your killing tool

77
00:07:11,128 --> 00:07:13,846
You naturally don't care about me

78
00:07:16,288 --> 00:07:17,247
This Strychnine

79
00:07:18,768 --> 00:07:19,927
Is extremely poisonous

80
00:07:21,168 --> 00:07:22,047
No cure

81
00:07:24,008 --> 00:07:25,567
Can only use monthly medicine

82
00:07:26,808 --> 00:07:28,687
To delay the onset

83
00:07:34,728 --> 00:07:36,767
You were originally a spy from Jiang Country

84
00:07:37,128 --> 00:07:39,367
Sent to Zhou

85
00:07:40,608 --> 00:07:42,647
When I discovered you five years ago

86
00:07:43,408 --> 00:07:45,687
You should have been killed

87
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:48,447
But

88
00:07:48,888 --> 00:07:50,127
I kept you because you were useful

89
00:07:51,328 --> 00:07:53,767
Had to poison you with Strychnine

90
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:57,007
Now that Jiang has submitted to Zhou

91
00:07:57,968 --> 00:07:59,807
Don't even think about going back

92
00:08:00,168 --> 00:08:02,287
Stay and serve me well

93
00:08:03,368 --> 00:08:05,807
I know what to do

94
00:08:06,928 --> 00:08:08,287
It's just that this Strychnine

95
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:09,327
Is too toxic

96
00:08:11,048 --> 00:08:12,967
I need some time to recuperate

97
00:08:13,288 --> 00:08:15,207
To serve you better

98
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,327
I can't wait too long for you

99
00:08:23,248 --> 00:08:23,967
Here you go

100
00:08:29,088 --> 00:08:31,607
Inside is Chief Eunuch Pei Qianyu

101
00:08:32,808 --> 00:08:35,207
Are these to kill or to keep?
