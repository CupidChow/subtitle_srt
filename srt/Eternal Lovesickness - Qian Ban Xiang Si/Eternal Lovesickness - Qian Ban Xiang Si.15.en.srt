1
00:00:55,207 --> 00:00:56,406
You're awake

2
00:01:07,847 --> 00:01:09,046
Feeling any better?

3
00:01:14,327 --> 00:01:15,526
You need to take your medicine on time

4
00:01:15,927 --> 00:01:17,206
Only then can you heal

5
00:01:17,487 --> 00:01:18,326
Here

6
00:01:18,807 --> 00:01:19,606
Be good

7
00:01:37,607 --> 00:01:39,406
Why didn't you ask me

8
00:01:39,407 --> 00:01:41,286
Why I was at Xu's residence?

9
00:01:43,967 --> 00:01:45,126
When you're ready to talk

10
00:01:46,087 --> 00:01:47,406
you'll naturally tell me

11
00:01:48,687 --> 00:01:49,886
Why would I ask?

12
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,446
Why would a eunuch have stubble?

13
00:02:05,327 --> 00:02:06,246
What's wrong?

14
00:02:07,807 --> 00:02:09,006
Nothing

15
00:02:17,527 --> 00:02:18,566
Sir

16
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:20,566
This is an urgent letter from the Third Prince

17
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,326
Chief Eunuch Pei:

18
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:35,886
There have been changes in the palace

19
00:02:35,887 --> 00:02:37,406
The Crown Prince has already reported to the Emperor

20
00:02:37,687 --> 00:02:38,566
Father is furious

21
00:02:38,687 --> 00:02:40,366
Please come to assist

22
00:02:42,607 --> 00:02:44,246
I must hurry to the palace

23
00:02:49,487 --> 00:02:50,366
Your Majesty

24
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:53,165
In the corruption and the official murder cases

25
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,126
I have found a key witness

26
00:02:57,687 --> 00:02:59,046
"Where is this witness?

27
00:03:19,007 --> 00:03:20,606
Greetings, Your Majesty

28
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:23,926
Who are you?

29
00:03:24,527 --> 00:03:27,366
What is your connection to these matters?

30
00:03:30,887 --> 00:03:33,126
I previously sent you to see the Third Prince

31
00:03:33,887 --> 00:03:35,886
To gain his trust

32
00:03:38,487 --> 00:03:40,206
You did well

33
00:03:43,087 --> 00:03:45,286
Now, go to the Third Prince

34
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,486
Tell him

35
00:03:47,487 --> 00:03:50,406
you have evidence of my corruption

36
00:03:50,887 --> 00:03:52,086
Report me

37
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:55,486
Let them take it to Father

38
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:58,486
then you turn the tables

39
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:01,966
Claim they tortured you

40
00:04:02,327 --> 00:04:04,126
into slandering me

41
00:04:07,207 --> 00:04:08,766
This time

42
00:04:08,767 --> 00:04:11,206
I plan to frame them

43
00:04:12,447 --> 00:04:14,766
for slandering the Crown Prince

44
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:19,726
If you fail

45
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,606
don't expect any more antidote

46
00:04:33,327 --> 00:04:36,006
I was originally a songstress at the Buddha Pavilion

47
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:39,006
The Crown Prince often visited

48
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:40,926
and thus became my patron

49
00:04:42,727 --> 00:04:43,686
Later

50
00:04:45,007 --> 00:04:47,566
he instructed me to get close to the Third Prince

51
00:04:48,367 --> 00:04:50,886
And falsely accuse him

52
00:04:52,327 --> 00:04:53,966
after gaining his trust

53
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:01,206
Princess

54
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:02,686
The Crown Prince of Zhou

55
00:05:02,687 --> 00:05:04,366
already knows your identity

56
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:07,286
He's taken the bait

57
00:05:08,247 --> 00:05:09,926
Then we'll proceed as planned

58
00:05:10,447 --> 00:05:11,646
Collaborate with the Third Prince

59
00:05:11,887 --> 00:05:13,446
and completely bring him down

60
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:14,806
Let's gamble

61
00:05:15,727 --> 00:05:17,606
Bet on the Third Prince's character

62
00:05:18,447 --> 00:05:19,926
Bet on

63
00:05:21,207 --> 00:05:22,686
Pei Qianyu's feelings for you

64
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:29,646
I'm willing to take that gamble with you

65
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:36,126
I was originally a songstress at the Buddha Pavilion

66
00:05:36,687 --> 00:05:38,806
The Crown Prince often visited

67
00:05:39,127 --> 00:05:40,806
and thus became my patron

68
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:42,726
The Crown Prince

69
00:05:42,727 --> 00:05:44,326
instructed me to get close to you

70
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:45,926
and then

71
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:47,166
falsely accuse you

72
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:54,446
How outrageous!

73
00:05:54,927 --> 00:05:56,486
He's the Crown Prince

74
00:05:56,727 --> 00:05:59,206
yet engages in such heartless deeds

75
00:06:03,127 --> 00:06:04,286
Father

76
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,526
I'm innocent

77
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:09,526
The witness is right here

78
00:06:10,127 --> 00:06:11,286
Crown Prince

79
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:12,966
How can you claim innocence?

80
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:18,886
I found 5.3 million taels of silver

81
00:06:19,447 --> 00:06:21,686
in the Crown Prince's villa

82
00:06:22,727 --> 00:06:24,606
Stop slandering me

83
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:26,966
Father

84
00:06:26,967 --> 00:06:28,686
I never did such a thing

85
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:30,086
Whether you did or not

86
00:06:30,487 --> 00:06:31,806
will soon be clear

87
00:07:03,487 --> 00:07:04,286
Your Majesty

88
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,566
I just mentioned finding the silver

89
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:07,726
as a bluff

90
00:07:08,527 --> 00:07:09,566
But just now

91
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:12,006
Li Sui followed the Crown Prince's trusted aide

92
00:07:12,407 --> 00:07:14,646
and found the reallocation of the hidden silver

93
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:17,966
Father

94
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:19,966
I was misled

95
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:21,966
in a moment of folly

96
00:07:22,487 --> 00:07:23,566
Please forgive me

97
00:07:24,247 --> 00:07:25,206
Father

98
00:07:25,207 --> 00:07:27,166
My loyalty to you is unwavering

99
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,206
Effective immediately

100
00:07:35,127 --> 00:07:37,286
The Crown Prince is stripped of his title

101
00:07:38,607 --> 00:07:40,046
Confined to his residence

102
00:07:41,807 --> 00:07:43,286
Without my command

103
00:07:43,607 --> 00:07:45,086
he is not to leave

104
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,366
What are you doing?

105
00:08:24,407 --> 00:08:25,966
I thought

106
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:27,366
In a few more days

107
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:28,766
you'll need to take these medicines

108
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,206
I'm drying them

109
00:08:44,247 --> 00:08:45,126
I'm stepping out

110
00:08:45,487 --> 00:08:46,446
Okay

111
00:08:46,447 --> 00:08:47,486
I'll wait for your return

112
00:08:56,127 --> 00:08:57,686
Not only did he take care of me

113
00:08:58,087 --> 00:08:59,806
but he also took an arrow for me

114
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:03,446
He's been through hell and back

115
00:09:05,407 --> 00:09:07,206
Other than making medicine for him

116
00:09:07,807 --> 00:09:09,726
what else can I do?

117
00:09:12,007 --> 00:09:12,806
Right

118
00:09:13,407 --> 00:09:15,766
Medicine only treats the symptoms, not the cause

119
00:09:16,007 --> 00:09:18,366
I need to figure out why he needs the medicine

120
00:09:19,127 --> 00:09:20,566
And how to cure him completely
