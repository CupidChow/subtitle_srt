1
00:00:18,408 --> 00:00:20,201
Where is the princess from Jiang Country

2
00:00:20,528 --> 00:00:21,747
sent for the marriage alliance?

3
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,329
Even if I have to search every cell

4
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,129
I will find you

5
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,809
It was my incompetence

6
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,889
Fearing an attack from the Zhou Country's army

7
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,609
That made you travel the long distance to a foreign land

8
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,849
I've heard that Zhou is wealthy and strong

9
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,809
And the man I'm to marry

10
00:00:58,810 --> 00:00:59,769
Is the future ruler

11
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,009
You really shouldn't worry

12
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,569
Father

13
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,009
Zhou is untrustworthy

14
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,649
You mistakenly trusted them

15
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:32,889
Greetings, Chief Eunuch

16
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,449
The Directorate of the Protocol is handling this case

17
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,249
This woman

18
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,289
I'm taking her with me

19
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,969
She is from Jiang

20
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,249
The Crown Prince said

21
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,249
With the two nations at war, spies might infiltrate

22
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,609
If you take her

23
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,169
That might be inappropriate

24
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:50,729
Since when does the Ministry of Justice

25
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,449
Dare to question the Directorate of the Protocol?

26
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,489
I dare not

27
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,209
Water

28
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,049
Princess

29
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,769
Your meal is ready

30
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,169
It's time to go back

31
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,569
You saved me three years ago

32
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,809
Now we meet again

33
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,529
But you are covered in wounds

34
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:02,689
This time

35
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,009
It's my turn to protect you

36
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,169
Qianyu

37
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,489
Qianyu

38
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,729
My father sent a letter

39
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:24,489
Come near

40
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,409
Stay away

41
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:33,849
I didn't expect that

42
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,209
Our Chief Eunuch has a hidden beauty

43
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,089
We grew up together

44
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,369
And you didn't tell me?

45
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:41,529
Don't talk nonsense

46
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,769
She's just a maid of mine

47
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,609
She was startled today

48
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:49,929
Your Highness

49
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,489
Is there something you need?

50
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:53,849
My father sent a letter

51
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:55,929
It says Jiang has been defeated

52
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:57,049
Soon

53
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,769
He will return to the capital with the Prince North

54
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:00,809
I was wondering

55
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,009
Should I tell my father

56
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,929
About the missing Jiang princess?

57
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,129
Should I tell my father

58
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,289
About the missing Jiang princess?

59
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,849
With His Majesty’s recent victory over Jiang

60
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,729
He'll surely be in high spirits

61
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,449
Just a princess from Jiang

62
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,249
If she's lost, she's lost

63
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,889
No one will really care

64
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,809
Using a false marriage alliance to take down Jiang

65
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,369
Truly shames our Zhou

66
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,089
Since our ancestors

67
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,809
When have we ever done such

68
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,009
Despicable things?

69
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:56,849
Lower your voice

70
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,609
Walls have ears

71
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:15,609
Father

72
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,849
Zhou is beyond the pale

73
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,849
One day

74
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,049
I will kill that freaking emperor

75
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,369
And avenge you all

76
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:25,769
Before that

77
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,489
My true identity

78
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,249
Must not be discovered
