1
00:00:18,413 --> 00:00:19,212
I'm ready

2
00:00:22,813 --> 00:00:24,452
Women beautify themselves for those they like

3
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:26,772
You are naturally beautiful

4
00:00:27,253 --> 00:00:29,892
But you are too lively and not soft enough

5
00:00:31,013 --> 00:00:32,492
I'm afraid

6
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:34,812
this would scare men away

7
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,172
What

8
00:00:36,493 --> 00:00:37,492
What do you mean

9
00:00:37,973 --> 00:00:40,252
Isn't the most important thing for an assassin to practice martial arts

10
00:00:44,653 --> 00:00:46,052
Martial arts are important

11
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:49,012
But for us women

12
00:00:49,813 --> 00:00:51,492
our inherent advantage

13
00:00:52,013 --> 00:00:53,132
is our beauty

14
00:00:54,173 --> 00:00:56,292
If you want to be the top assassin

15
00:00:57,013 --> 00:00:58,452
you can't make them fear you

16
00:00:59,413 --> 00:01:01,092
but make them like you

17
00:01:02,493 --> 00:01:03,852
The more they like you

18
00:01:04,373 --> 00:01:06,052
the easier it is for us to succeed

19
00:01:07,213 --> 00:01:08,132
What

20
00:01:08,493 --> 00:01:09,652
I am a princess

21
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:12,212
You ask me to learn the ways of a courtesan

22
00:01:12,533 --> 00:01:13,732
and sell my charms

23
00:01:18,653 --> 00:01:19,732
If you look down on it

24
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:20,652
then don't come here

25
00:01:21,653 --> 00:01:22,532
My Buddha Pavilion

26
00:01:23,093 --> 00:01:24,532
is only capable of these petty tricks

27
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:25,772
If you look down on it

28
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:27,092
Go back to Jiang

29
00:01:28,413 --> 00:01:30,212
to see that ruined city

30
00:01:30,493 --> 00:01:32,372
and the countless wronged souls

31
00:01:36,613 --> 00:01:37,972
If I don't avenge my country's destruction

32
00:01:39,013 --> 00:01:40,532
How can I go back to Jiang?

33
00:01:43,013 --> 00:01:43,652
Fine

34
00:01:44,613 --> 00:01:45,492
I'll learn

35
00:01:49,453 --> 00:01:50,372
There you go.

36
00:01:52,773 --> 00:01:54,012
Even they cannot help loving you upon seeing you

37
00:01:54,653 --> 00:01:55,852
Delicate yet deadly

38
00:01:56,693 --> 00:01:57,212
This

39
00:01:57,933 --> 00:01:59,532
is the real weapon

40
00:02:11,813 --> 00:02:12,292
Come on

41
00:02:12,573 --> 00:02:13,252
Put this on

42
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,612
Qingcheng

43
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:37,252
This outfit seems a bit...

44
00:02:37,373 --> 00:02:38,812
Too revealing

45
00:02:39,853 --> 00:02:41,132
Lower your hands

46
00:02:44,013 --> 00:02:45,212
Straighten your back

47
00:02:47,013 --> 00:02:48,612
Relax your shoulders

48
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:53,772
Tuck in your chin slightly

49
00:02:57,933 --> 00:02:59,572
A woman should always

50
00:02:59,573 --> 00:03:01,052
be elegant and poised

51
00:03:01,613 --> 00:03:02,932
Stretch fully

52
00:03:03,453 --> 00:03:04,332
Turn

53
00:03:17,973 --> 00:03:18,692
Watch me

54
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:29,412
So beautiful

55
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:33,732
Center your movement on your feet

56
00:03:34,133 --> 00:03:35,132
Stretch fully

57
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:40,692
Show off

58
00:03:43,053 --> 00:03:44,212
a woman's grace

59
00:04:00,213 --> 00:04:01,412
The most important thing is

60
00:04:02,013 --> 00:04:03,132
your expression

61
00:04:03,453 --> 00:04:04,572
and your eyes

62
00:04:06,173 --> 00:04:07,212
A smile

63
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:08,932
alluring but not vulgar

64
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:11,132
Eyes

65
00:04:12,813 --> 00:04:14,412
filled with charm

66
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:20,732
Have a try

67
00:04:35,773 --> 00:04:36,572
It hurts

68
00:04:36,773 --> 00:04:37,452
Sister

69
00:04:39,853 --> 00:04:41,412
Haste makes waste

70
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:43,652
You can't learn martial arts from me

71
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,812
until you master allure

72
00:04:47,173 --> 00:04:48,492
This is much harder than martial arts

73
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:50,492
Go back and practice more

74
00:04:51,653 --> 00:04:52,172
Remember

75
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:53,812
If you want to kill a man

76
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:56,692
you must first understand him

77
00:04:58,133 --> 00:04:59,372
The destruction of Jiang

78
00:04:59,613 --> 00:05:00,692
involved not only Emperor Zhou

79
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:02,692
but a group of martial generals

80
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,772
Those rough men

81
00:05:08,773 --> 00:05:10,132
How could they resist

82
00:05:10,773 --> 00:05:12,372
the allure of a beauty's lap

83
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:20,772
Alright

84
00:05:21,173 --> 00:05:22,972
I will use Pei Qianyu for my training

85
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,652
Mr. Pei

86
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:34,732
It's late

87
00:05:35,053 --> 00:05:37,252
Why didn't you call for me

88
00:05:37,773 --> 00:05:40,132
So I could help you change clothes

89
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:42,812
No, that's not necessary

90
00:05:44,573 --> 00:05:46,972
Do you think I'm not serving you well

91
00:05:48,653 --> 00:05:50,372
I'm not used to being served by others

92
00:05:51,053 --> 00:05:52,132
You just need to

93
00:05:52,413 --> 00:05:53,852
take care of the house

94
00:05:57,013 --> 00:05:58,732
Then I'll pour you some tea

95
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:03,852
This tea is so hot

96
00:06:05,293 --> 00:06:07,212
You are holding tea

97
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:08,492
not pouring it

98
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,532
Catch it quickly

99
00:06:19,573 --> 00:06:21,532
I'm asking you to catch me

100
00:06:21,853 --> 00:06:22,892
Men and women should not touch

101
00:06:25,173 --> 00:06:26,132
Anything else

102
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,852
Are you hungry, Sir

103
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,932
I can make you something to eat

104
00:06:46,413 --> 00:06:48,372
I didn't do well today

105
00:06:48,653 --> 00:06:49,332
Next time

106
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,132
I'll make you a feast

107
00:06:53,453 --> 00:06:54,172
What is this

108
00:06:54,653 --> 00:06:55,732
Your cooking skills

109
00:06:56,853 --> 00:06:57,772
This is...

110
00:06:58,013 --> 00:06:58,692
Roast...

111
00:06:58,693 --> 00:07:00,052
This is roast chicken

112
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:01,412
Roast chicken

113
00:07:01,973 --> 00:07:03,652
It may not look good

114
00:07:03,653 --> 00:07:04,452
But it tastes

115
00:07:04,453 --> 00:07:05,532
really delicious

116
00:07:06,013 --> 00:07:06,812
Are you sure

117
00:07:09,093 --> 00:07:09,892
is edible?

118
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:11,572
Of course

119
00:07:12,013 --> 00:07:12,732
If you don't believe me

120
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:13,932
I'll taste it for you

121
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:26,652
I'll go back to the kitchen and add some seasoning

122
00:07:26,853 --> 00:07:28,252
It'll be very delicious

123
00:07:28,453 --> 00:07:29,132
Forget it

124
00:07:30,373 --> 00:07:31,652
I'll buy two maidservants tomorrow

125
00:07:33,093 --> 00:07:34,652
You don't seem to be good at taking care of people

126
00:07:34,653 --> 00:07:36,012
I can take care of people

127
00:07:36,013 --> 00:07:37,372
I can learn anything

128
00:07:42,053 --> 00:07:43,172
I'm not sending you away

129
00:07:43,893 --> 00:07:46,012
Just buying two maidservants to help you

130
00:07:46,573 --> 00:07:47,492
It's decided then

131
00:07:48,373 --> 00:07:49,132
Really

132
00:07:49,453 --> 00:07:50,612
Thank you, Mr. Pei

133
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,532
Let me massage your back

134
00:07:52,853 --> 00:07:53,532
I... you...

135
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:54,332
What do you like

136
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,332
I can massage your shoulders

137
00:07:55,613 --> 00:07:56,492
If you like music

138
00:07:56,653 --> 00:07:57,812
I can sing for you

139
00:07:58,133 --> 00:08:00,452
Whatever you want me to learn, I can learn it for you

140
00:08:01,173 --> 00:08:01,852
Mr. Pei

141
00:08:09,693 --> 00:08:11,812
Seducing a man is really too difficult

142
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,492
When can I be like Sister Qingcheng

143
00:08:15,093 --> 00:08:16,812
When can I get my revenge

144
00:08:23,933 --> 00:08:26,132
What exactly are they teaching at Buddha Pavilion

145
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:56,692
What are you doing again

146
00:08:57,485 --> 00:08:58,604
Dancing

147
00:09:03,933 --> 00:09:06,132
Sir, what a coincidence

148
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:07,852
You live here too

149
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:11,092
Shall we have breakfast together

150
00:09:12,413 --> 00:09:14,932
I think you need to have medicine

151
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:23,132
Don't catch a cold

152
00:09:28,893 --> 00:09:30,252
I can't even seduce him

153
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:32,732
Slow and vulgar, no sense of charm

154
00:09:34,773 --> 00:09:37,172
But he's quite a gentleman

155
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:39,892
I've learnt for so long

156
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,012
I don't believe I can't seduce you, Pei Qianyu
