1
00:00:22,092 --> 00:00:24,611
Tonight, someone will attempt to assassinate me

2
00:00:25,572 --> 00:00:29,131
The real motive lies elsewhere

3
00:00:30,972 --> 00:00:33,011
Since Pei Qianyu found the extremely rare precious herbs

4
00:00:33,012 --> 00:00:34,651
for my father three years ago

5
00:00:34,852 --> 00:00:37,531
And coincidentally saved him several times

6
00:00:38,132 --> 00:00:41,051
Father has increasingly valued him

7
00:00:43,212 --> 00:00:45,411
If he wants to clear the Pei family's name

8
00:00:46,052 --> 00:00:49,331
The Emperor is well aware of the matter of that year

9
00:00:50,372 --> 00:00:51,651
Overturning the case

10
00:00:52,492 --> 00:00:54,211
Isn't that easy

11
00:00:55,692 --> 00:00:57,411
But his power

12
00:00:58,092 --> 00:00:59,931
Is indeed quite significant

13
00:01:02,612 --> 00:01:04,291
Then why don't we

14
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,891
just crush him this time?

15
00:01:28,332 --> 00:01:29,291
Sir

16
00:01:29,292 --> 00:01:30,451
We've thoroughly investigated

17
00:01:30,932 --> 00:01:32,251
The Crown Prince's properties

18
00:01:32,252 --> 00:01:35,011
amount to 132 places, all have been staffed

19
00:01:35,532 --> 00:01:37,051
A few places are suspicious

20
00:01:38,212 --> 00:01:39,211
Keep watch

21
00:01:40,092 --> 00:01:42,011
We can't let any clues slip by

22
00:01:42,612 --> 00:01:43,411
Yes

23
00:01:45,652 --> 00:01:46,651
By the way

24
00:01:46,852 --> 00:01:47,811
I heard

25
00:01:47,812 --> 00:01:48,771
The Prince North's residence

26
00:01:48,772 --> 00:01:50,131
Has increased its guards tonight

27
00:01:50,772 --> 00:01:52,131
Should we investigate?

28
00:01:55,172 --> 00:01:55,811
Yeah

29
00:02:00,492 --> 00:02:01,531
But still focus primarily on

30
00:02:02,212 --> 00:02:03,491
The Crown Prince's side

31
00:02:04,612 --> 00:02:05,411
Yes

32
00:02:15,012 --> 00:02:15,931
[Assassinate Xu Chongzi tonight]

33
00:02:18,132 --> 00:02:19,131
Sister Qingcheng

34
00:02:19,132 --> 00:02:20,651
What did you call me here for today?

35
00:02:21,572 --> 00:02:22,451
Tonight

36
00:02:23,252 --> 00:02:25,211
You are to assassinate Zhou's top general

37
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:28,011
Prince North, Xu Chongzi

38
00:02:28,852 --> 00:02:30,811
The one who broke into my Jiang Kingdom

39
00:02:31,012 --> 00:02:33,051
And slaughtered countless lives, Xu Chongzi?

40
00:02:33,292 --> 00:02:34,131
Exactly

41
00:02:34,852 --> 00:02:35,931
Are you afraid?

42
00:02:36,452 --> 00:02:37,211
Afraid?

43
00:02:37,212 --> 00:02:38,491
I'm not afraid of him

44
00:02:39,612 --> 00:02:40,851
I wish I could eat his flesh

45
00:02:40,852 --> 00:02:41,931
And drink his blood

46
00:02:45,652 --> 00:02:47,411
Xu Chongzi has survived until now

47
00:02:48,012 --> 00:02:49,891
He does have some martial skills

48
00:02:50,812 --> 00:02:52,651
I'll accompany you

49
00:02:52,892 --> 00:02:54,291
And support you from the side

50
00:02:57,452 --> 00:02:58,651
But Sister Qingcheng

51
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:00,691
Didn't you say just a while ago

52
00:03:00,892 --> 00:03:03,211
To let me lie low for some time?

53
00:03:03,532 --> 00:03:05,051
I did think so

54
00:03:05,692 --> 00:03:06,771
But

55
00:03:07,172 --> 00:03:09,291
now an opportunity has presented itself

56
00:03:10,092 --> 00:03:11,811
We shouldn't waste it

57
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:15,731
However

58
00:03:15,972 --> 00:03:18,051
If you encounter any trouble

59
00:03:18,652 --> 00:03:19,611
Do not engage

60
00:03:19,932 --> 00:03:21,011
Retreat immediately

61
00:03:22,212 --> 00:03:23,011
Alright

62
00:03:33,732 --> 00:03:34,531
Sir

63
00:03:35,092 --> 00:03:35,891
Where is Miss?

64
00:03:36,052 --> 00:03:37,771
Someone just came to report

65
00:03:37,772 --> 00:03:39,451
She is at Prince North's residence

66
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:40,811
And asked me to inform you

67
00:03:40,892 --> 00:03:42,011
Prince North?

68
00:03:42,452 --> 00:03:43,291
The general?

69
00:03:43,612 --> 00:03:44,931
Yes

70
00:03:47,732 --> 00:03:49,851
The Prince North's residence has increased its guards tonight

71
00:03:50,812 --> 00:03:51,651
Should we investigate?

72
00:03:53,452 --> 00:03:55,451
Prince North led troops and slaughtered the entire city of Jiang

73
00:03:55,812 --> 00:03:58,211
Lee must be going to assassinate Prince North for revenge

74
00:03:58,732 --> 00:03:59,891
Who brought the message?

75
00:04:00,412 --> 00:04:02,011
Someone from Prince North's residence

76
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,851
This play

77
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:05,251
Is targeted at me

78
00:04:05,932 --> 00:04:07,171
They must already know

79
00:04:07,172 --> 00:04:08,411
Lee's identity

80
00:04:08,652 --> 00:04:09,651
So

81
00:04:16,812 --> 00:04:17,731
I disagree

82
00:04:18,252 --> 00:04:19,251
The Crown Prince already knows

83
00:04:19,252 --> 00:04:20,651
that the princess of Jiang is in your residence

84
00:04:20,852 --> 00:04:22,331
He'll definitely use this to create trouble

85
00:04:22,652 --> 00:04:24,451
It's clear he's setting a trap

86
00:04:24,492 --> 00:04:26,011
Just waiting for you to walk right into it

87
00:04:26,612 --> 00:04:27,891
Your best choice right now

88
00:04:28,052 --> 00:04:30,011
is to erase all traces of her from your residence

89
00:04:30,612 --> 00:04:31,491
That way

90
00:04:31,852 --> 00:04:33,611
even if he complains to father

91
00:04:33,932 --> 00:04:35,051
you just have to deny everything

92
00:04:35,252 --> 00:04:36,491
He can't do anything to you

93
00:04:38,852 --> 00:04:40,051
But if that happens

94
00:04:41,172 --> 00:04:42,371
she'll surely die

95
00:04:43,892 --> 00:04:45,131
Your vengeance will remain unfulfilled

96
00:04:45,292 --> 00:04:46,331
One wrong move

97
00:04:46,812 --> 00:04:47,771
and all these years of effort

98
00:04:47,772 --> 00:04:49,291
will be wasted

99
00:04:50,572 --> 00:04:52,411
If it weren't for her saving me back then

100
00:04:52,412 --> 00:04:54,451
I would have died three years ago

101
00:04:54,452 --> 00:04:56,011
And there would be no talk of revenge

102
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:00,691
Although I can be ruthless for revenge

103
00:05:01,332 --> 00:05:03,371
If it means being ungrateful

104
00:05:03,372 --> 00:05:05,011
and disregarding her life

105
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,051
How am I any different from those

106
00:05:08,412 --> 00:05:09,811
who killed my family back then?

107
00:05:11,252 --> 00:05:11,891
But

108
00:05:11,892 --> 00:05:12,891
I have a good idea

109
00:05:13,492 --> 00:05:14,851
If you're willing to help me

110
00:05:15,252 --> 00:05:16,691
we can solve this

111
00:05:22,252 --> 00:05:23,291
Tell me

112
00:05:23,452 --> 00:05:25,011
How can I help you?

113
00:06:04,212 --> 00:06:05,011
Drink

114
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:35,451
Delightful

115
00:07:16,652 --> 00:07:17,411
Sister

116
00:07:17,532 --> 00:07:18,211
You better run

117
00:07:18,252 --> 00:07:19,411
We leave together

118
00:07:19,892 --> 00:07:20,691
Hurry up

119
00:07:32,412 --> 00:07:33,531
Where's Pei Qianyu?

120
00:07:40,332 --> 00:07:41,971
The Third Prince is outside to support us

121
00:07:42,692 --> 00:07:43,171
Let's go

122
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:47,931
The Third Prince has brought his men

123
00:07:49,932 --> 00:07:50,811
Useless

124
00:07:51,452 --> 00:07:52,571
Chase them

125
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:53,811
If we chase them now

126
00:07:53,892 --> 00:07:55,651
we might alert the Emperor

127
00:07:57,652 --> 00:07:58,451
Bitch!

128
00:07:59,092 --> 00:08:00,811
Why didn't you help me just now?

129
00:08:02,052 --> 00:08:02,851
That's unjust

130
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,691
I have always been following your orders

131
00:08:06,012 --> 00:08:07,211
Fully cooperating with you

132
00:08:08,772 --> 00:08:09,811
Please

133
00:08:11,372 --> 00:08:13,611
Pei Qianyu has escaped

134
00:08:14,372 --> 00:08:15,171
Your Highness

135
00:08:16,252 --> 00:08:17,571
At this point

136
00:08:18,012 --> 00:08:20,491
we need to think of another plan

137
00:08:41,972 --> 00:08:43,651
I'll go find a doctor

138
00:08:43,652 --> 00:08:44,411
No

139
00:08:46,012 --> 00:08:48,131
We can't let others know I'm injured

140
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:49,331
But

141
00:08:49,492 --> 00:08:50,371
This blood

142
00:08:50,692 --> 00:08:52,571
It won't stop flowing

143
00:08:54,012 --> 00:08:55,891
I can't stop it

144
00:08:56,852 --> 00:08:57,651
It's fine

145
00:08:58,612 --> 00:08:59,891
I'm tough

146
00:09:00,132 --> 00:09:01,091
What are you afraid of?

147
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:07,571
I'm sorry

148
00:09:09,692 --> 00:09:11,211
Don't cry

149
00:09:11,492 --> 00:09:13,131
Crying ruins your beauty

150
00:09:13,812 --> 00:09:14,771
Smile for me

151
00:09:15,212 --> 00:09:16,611
I love seeing you smile

152
00:09:18,772 --> 00:09:20,771
At a time like this

153
00:09:21,372 --> 00:09:22,971
you're still joking?

154
00:09:25,492 --> 00:09:27,211
Did I hurt you?

155
00:09:30,812 --> 00:09:31,731
Really

156
00:09:32,852 --> 00:09:34,691
Smile for me and I'll go to sleep

157
00:09:43,212 --> 00:09:45,611
That smile is uglier than your crying

158
00:09:49,572 --> 00:09:53,571
Why did you suddenly come to save me?

159
00:09:58,212 --> 00:09:59,211
I was also

160
00:09:59,972 --> 00:10:01,651
called to the banquet

161
00:10:02,212 --> 00:10:03,331
In a moment of urgency

162
00:10:04,132 --> 00:10:05,131
I had no choice

163
00:10:09,892 --> 00:10:11,411
From now on, you must be

164
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:13,491
Extremely cautious
