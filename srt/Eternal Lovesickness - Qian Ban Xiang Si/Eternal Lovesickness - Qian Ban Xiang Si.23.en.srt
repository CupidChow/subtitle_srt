1
00:00:31,091 --> 00:00:32,290
What are you doing here

2
00:00:33,011 --> 00:00:34,090
Where are the others

3
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,290
Guards

4
00:00:35,971 --> 00:00:36,850
No need to shout, Your Majesty

5
00:00:37,851 --> 00:00:38,970
It's just you and me

6
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:40,770
in this bedchamber

7
00:00:48,371 --> 00:00:49,890
What exactly do you want

8
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:52,970
I just want to ask you

9
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:54,930
Do you seek life

10
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:57,010
or death

11
00:00:57,451 --> 00:00:59,450
What do you mean

12
00:01:01,091 --> 00:01:03,530
I've spent years studying spices

13
00:01:04,451 --> 00:01:06,850
and discovered many interesting things

14
00:01:07,851 --> 00:01:10,530
Some spices can kill invisibly

15
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:14,210
Some can save lives

16
00:01:14,211 --> 00:01:15,450
Some toxic spices

17
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:17,490
"have different effects

18
00:01:18,451 --> 00:01:20,890
when mixed with other spice's

19
00:01:21,451 --> 00:01:22,690
Don't you think

20
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:24,690
it's interesting

21
00:01:25,331 --> 00:01:26,930
What are you trying to say

22
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:31,650
Your Majesty, you have been using

23
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:33,570
the incense I prepared for years

24
00:01:35,331 --> 00:01:38,850
Haven't you had any doubts

25
00:01:45,211 --> 00:01:47,530
What did you put in the incense

26
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:48,490
It's nothing

27
00:01:50,011 --> 00:01:51,210
Just some Gelsemium

28
00:01:53,651 --> 00:01:55,250
a chronic poison

29
00:01:55,251 --> 00:01:56,010
Impossible

30
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,290
The imperial doctors check my pulse daily

31
00:01:58,531 --> 00:01:59,970
They would have noticed

32
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:10,570
This is a special concoction I made for you

33
00:02:11,811 --> 00:02:13,090
You've been using

34
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:14,970
the sub-poison for years

35
00:02:16,211 --> 00:02:17,450
which is harmless

36
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:20,210
But it accumulates in your organs

37
00:02:20,811 --> 00:02:22,410
making you more irritable

38
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:24,650
more suspicious

39
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:26,770
and more easily influenced

40
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:30,490
Once I light this main poison

41
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:34,090
the sub-poison in your body will explode

42
00:02:34,851 --> 00:02:36,210
At that point, Your Majesty

43
00:02:36,651 --> 00:02:38,330
you won't have long to live

44
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:45,450
You traitor

45
00:02:45,651 --> 00:02:47,530
None of the Pei family are good people

46
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:49,610
I'll kill you

47
00:02:51,411 --> 00:02:52,890
When the incense burns out

48
00:02:53,811 --> 00:02:54,810
Your Majesty

49
00:02:55,451 --> 00:02:57,410
you will die of the poison

50
00:02:58,491 --> 00:02:59,770
If I die

51
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:02,770
Do you think you can live

52
00:03:03,211 --> 00:03:05,690
I have no face to live

53
00:03:06,411 --> 00:03:08,450
having failed to clear the Pei family's name

54
00:03:08,851 --> 00:03:10,730
I will follow the Pei family

55
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:13,410
Even in the afterlife

56
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:15,970
I will find you

57
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,770
What exactly do you want

58
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:20,930
I want you to clear the Pei family's name

59
00:03:21,571 --> 00:03:24,250
to stop investigating Jiang Sili's identity

60
00:03:24,651 --> 00:03:26,210
and to step aside

61
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:28,530
Let the Third Prince take over

62
00:03:32,091 --> 00:03:33,010
Do you think

63
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:35,450
he will be a good emperor

64
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:38,370
and he will spare you?

65
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:40,970
The Third Prince is benevolent and wise

66
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:42,650
of exceptional temperament

67
00:03:43,131 --> 00:03:45,250
supported by both civil and military officials

68
00:03:45,771 --> 00:03:48,450
Why can't he be a good emperor

69
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:03,810
By the mandate of heaven

70
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:06,130
The Emperor decrees

71
00:04:06,691 --> 00:04:08,570
The case against the former General

72
00:04:09,451 --> 00:04:10,130
Pei Zhong

73
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:14,450
falsely accused by Xu Chongzi and Cao Duo

74
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:16,010
with forged letters

75
00:04:16,011 --> 00:04:18,450
for treason and collusion

76
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:21,610
is a fabrication

77
00:04:21,811 --> 00:04:23,410
It's a frame-up

78
00:04:24,571 --> 00:04:25,730
and has been proven baseless

79
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,930
Pei Zhong's rank is restored

80
00:04:28,411 --> 00:04:30,650
and posthumously titled Prince of Weiwu

81
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:34,810
Xu Zhongzi and others are guilty

82
00:04:35,131 --> 00:04:36,370
of severe crimes

83
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:39,930
They will be executed in three days

84
00:04:41,131 --> 00:04:42,250
Henceforth

85
00:04:56,211 --> 00:04:58,170
I ascend the throne today

86
00:04:58,971 --> 00:05:00,810
I will practice filial piety

87
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:02,850
For years

88
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:05,010
The world has been at war

89
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,330
People have suffered endlessly

90
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:10,210
I am determined that during my reign

91
00:05:10,651 --> 00:05:13,010
I will never initiate war

92
00:05:14,371 --> 00:05:16,770
So that the people may enjoy peace

93
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:19,730
And the world may know

94
00:05:20,491 --> 00:05:22,450
harmony and prosperity

95
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:05,970
Father

96
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:08,170
Mother

97
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:11,130
The Pei family's name

98
00:06:12,611 --> 00:06:13,970
has been cleared

99
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:21,370
After years of patience

100
00:06:23,011 --> 00:06:24,610
I have finally achieved it

101
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:30,570
Finally cleared the Pei family's injustice

102
00:06:31,931 --> 00:06:33,450
Now, a new emperor reigns

103
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:35,530
He is merciful

104
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:38,130
I believe

105
00:06:39,451 --> 00:06:41,250
you can

106
00:06:42,851 --> 00:06:44,210
rest in peace.

107
00:07:01,411 --> 00:07:02,130
Father

108
00:07:02,491 --> 00:07:03,290
Mother

109
00:07:04,331 --> 00:07:05,130
This is Lee

110
00:07:06,731 --> 00:07:08,010
I'm in touch with her

111
00:07:09,251 --> 00:07:10,530
After informing the new emperor

112
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:12,730
I will marry her

113
00:07:13,731 --> 00:07:15,090
Lee is pure and kind

114
00:07:17,611 --> 00:07:18,770
I believe

115
00:07:18,931 --> 00:07:21,010
you would love her

116
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:52,370
You're alive

117
00:08:10,851 --> 00:08:11,450
Look at this

118
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:12,450
It's beautiful

119
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:14,370
This one

120
00:08:15,211 --> 00:08:16,290
Isn't it cute

121
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:20,810
Pei Qianyu

122
00:08:21,091 --> 00:08:22,170
Can you be serious

123
00:08:22,531 --> 00:08:23,650
Today is our first

124
00:08:23,651 --> 00:08:24,770
official date

125
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:35,810
It looks really like you

126
00:08:41,411 --> 00:08:42,010
Why...

127
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:43,690
Why didn't you dodge

128
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:44,970
Did it hurt

129
00:08:46,571 --> 00:08:47,530
I know it did

130
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:50,650
Why should I dodge

131
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:52,130
Even if you hit me once

132
00:08:52,691 --> 00:08:54,090
or ten times

133
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:54,930
a hundred times

134
00:08:55,491 --> 00:08:56,570
I'm willing to do it

135
00:09:03,371 --> 00:09:04,410
All I want

136
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,490
is for you to be by my side

137
00:09:18,371 --> 00:09:20,930
Gentlemen, do you want to buy it or not?

138
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,890
Keep the change

139
00:09:27,451 --> 00:09:28,810
Thank you, sir

140
00:09:29,211 --> 00:09:30,690
May you both have a happy marriage

141
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:32,290
Who's as ugly as it

142
00:09:32,691 --> 00:09:33,770
No

143
00:09:33,971 --> 00:09:34,810
It's very cute

144
00:09:36,131 --> 00:09:37,410
Who do you think is cuter

145
00:09:39,451 --> 00:09:40,210
It's it, of course

146
00:09:41,411 --> 00:09:43,610
I'll give you one more chance to change your mind
