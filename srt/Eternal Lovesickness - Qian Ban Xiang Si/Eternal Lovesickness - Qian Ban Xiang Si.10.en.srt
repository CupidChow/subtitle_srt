1
00:00:20,384 --> 00:00:21,783
You're awake?

2
00:00:24,104 --> 00:00:26,263
How long did you think your drug could keep me out?

3
00:00:28,984 --> 00:00:29,623
So

4
00:00:30,304 --> 00:00:31,703
You knew all along?

5
00:00:32,264 --> 00:00:33,063
Knew what?

6
00:00:34,064 --> 00:00:35,263
Was drugging me fun for you?

7
00:00:36,664 --> 00:00:37,583
Where did you go?

8
00:00:39,944 --> 00:00:41,623
Just for a walk

9
00:00:42,944 --> 00:00:44,503
The palace is already alerted

10
00:00:45,144 --> 00:00:46,143
You really thought with the token

11
00:00:46,664 --> 00:00:48,183
You can break into the palace for revenge?

12
00:00:48,784 --> 00:00:49,583
How reckless

13
00:00:49,624 --> 00:00:51,543
Sir, I know I was wrong

14
00:00:51,544 --> 00:00:53,063
I won't be so impulsive

15
00:00:54,984 --> 00:00:56,143
What are you doing?

16
00:01:00,904 --> 00:01:01,703
Scared?

17
00:01:04,024 --> 00:01:05,383
Not at all

18
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:08,903
Then that must be what's on your mind

19
00:01:11,624 --> 00:01:13,663
Sir, you should get some rest

20
00:01:13,664 --> 00:01:15,143
I won't bother you anymore

21
00:01:30,384 --> 00:01:32,423
Why was I so nervous?

22
00:01:45,224 --> 00:01:47,983
Mr. Pei, you really know how to enjoy yourself

23
00:02:01,184 --> 00:02:02,183
Your Highness is here

24
00:02:02,864 --> 00:02:03,783
Sorry for

25
00:02:04,304 --> 00:02:05,463
not welcoming you sooner

26
00:02:06,104 --> 00:02:07,503
No need to blame them

27
00:02:07,864 --> 00:02:09,903
I didn't let them inform you

28
00:02:11,144 --> 00:02:12,543
This is your private residence

29
00:02:12,944 --> 00:02:13,783
We don't need to

30
00:02:14,344 --> 00:02:15,943
stand on ceremony here

31
00:02:22,144 --> 00:02:23,703
It's rare for me to have a day off

32
00:02:24,424 --> 00:02:25,463
Would Your Highness like to join?

33
00:02:26,384 --> 00:02:28,463
I've heard that your incense making is second to none

34
00:02:29,424 --> 00:02:31,503
I've been eager to see it for myself

35
00:02:32,304 --> 00:02:33,303
However

36
00:02:33,944 --> 00:02:35,903
I have official duties today

37
00:02:36,424 --> 00:02:38,223
Perhaps another day for that lesson

38
00:02:39,504 --> 00:02:40,743
Your Highness conducts official business

39
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,383
Even at my residence?

40
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,023
Last night, an assassin broke into the palace

41
00:02:47,664 --> 00:02:49,543
I led people to track the assassin here

42
00:02:50,624 --> 00:02:51,943
Then the assassin disappeared

43
00:02:54,144 --> 00:02:54,823
I wonder

44
00:02:55,424 --> 00:02:57,303
What do you make of that, Mr. Pei?

45
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:04,103
Miss

46
00:03:04,624 --> 00:03:06,463
The master said you can't go out today

47
00:03:06,784 --> 00:03:08,903
I need some air, it's stuffy inside

48
00:03:09,824 --> 00:03:10,943
That's not allowed either

49
00:03:11,904 --> 00:03:12,743
Traitor

50
00:03:13,544 --> 00:03:15,623
Whoever pays, I'll listen to

51
00:03:16,784 --> 00:03:18,503
So mercenary

52
00:03:25,784 --> 00:03:26,823
You want to search the house?

53
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:30,183
I hope you will understand

54
00:03:33,344 --> 00:03:34,623
You can search

55
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:36,703
But

56
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:39,583
I have a few questions for Your Highness

57
00:03:41,824 --> 00:03:44,183
Did Your Highness see the assassin's face?

58
00:03:46,504 --> 00:03:47,463
Not really

59
00:03:47,624 --> 00:03:49,103
Was the assassin injured?

60
00:03:51,384 --> 00:03:52,263
Not that I'm aware of

61
00:03:52,504 --> 00:03:53,783
According to Your Highness then

62
00:03:54,704 --> 00:03:56,983
Even if you find someone suspicious

63
00:03:57,584 --> 00:03:59,703
How can you be sure they are the assassin?

64
00:04:01,624 --> 00:04:02,463
Well

65
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:04,983
But

66
00:04:05,544 --> 00:04:07,503
Your Highness works for His Majesty

67
00:04:08,104 --> 00:04:10,663
Although this private residence is granted by His Majesty

68
00:04:11,344 --> 00:04:12,983
In order to capture the assassin

69
00:04:13,104 --> 00:04:14,623
It should be treated no differently

70
00:04:15,304 --> 00:04:16,983
Feel free to search as you wish

71
00:04:18,184 --> 00:04:19,663
If His Majesty asks

72
00:04:20,064 --> 00:04:21,423
I'll explain myself

73
00:04:29,384 --> 00:04:31,663
No need to disturb your peace

74
00:04:33,504 --> 00:04:34,703
I'll take more men

75
00:04:35,184 --> 00:04:37,663
And search outside

76
00:04:39,944 --> 00:04:41,143
That would be best

77
00:04:43,504 --> 00:04:44,703
Thank you, Your Highness

78
00:04:49,384 --> 00:04:50,463
No

79
00:04:50,464 --> 00:04:51,543
I have to go out

80
00:04:52,264 --> 00:04:54,303
-The imperial guards have been searching outside

81
00:04:54,744 --> 00:04:57,663
And they've surrounded this Residence

82
00:04:59,224 --> 00:05:00,623
I can't implicate everyone

83
00:05:02,984 --> 00:05:05,743
Miss, you can't go out, miss

84
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:07,263
Where are you going?

85
00:05:08,104 --> 00:05:08,983
I need to get out

86
00:05:12,904 --> 00:05:13,823
I'm not a criminal

87
00:05:13,824 --> 00:05:15,183
Why are you holding me here?

88
00:05:15,624 --> 00:05:17,183
How severe the situation outside is now

89
00:05:17,864 --> 00:05:19,863
When will you ever grasp the gravity of things?

90
00:05:22,824 --> 00:05:24,623
Don't you trust me at all?

91
00:05:25,104 --> 00:05:28,583
You'd rather risk it alone than open up to me?

92
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:32,543
What are you doing?

93
00:05:32,664 --> 00:05:33,743
Put me down!

94
00:05:34,704 --> 00:05:35,743
Pei Qianyu!

95
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:40,463
Put me down!

96
00:05:40,664 --> 00:05:41,983
What are you doing?

97
00:05:42,224 --> 00:05:43,703
Put me down!

98
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:47,663
Pei Qianyu, let go of me!

99
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:51,023
Let me go!

100
00:05:52,304 --> 00:05:53,503
Put me down!

101
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:56,063
What are you trying to do?

102
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:00,463
Don't mess around!

103
00:06:04,984 --> 00:06:06,303
Scared now?

104
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:07,783
Too late

105
00:06:10,624 --> 00:06:11,343
You

106
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:13,183
Don't go too far!

107
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,023
I intend to go too far

108
00:06:15,544 --> 00:06:16,783
What can you do about it?

109
00:06:22,384 --> 00:06:24,223
You want to imprison me?

110
00:06:27,464 --> 00:06:28,383
What do you think?

111
00:06:33,104 --> 00:06:35,223
You're just trying to scare me, right?

112
00:06:35,304 --> 00:06:38,063
After all, I haven't done anything wrong, right?

113
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:42,983
Still not admitting your mistake?

114
00:06:43,624 --> 00:06:45,143
Just reflect on it here

115
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,263
When you admit your mistake

116
00:06:47,264 --> 00:06:48,423
Then we'll talk

117
00:06:50,704 --> 00:06:52,503
Pei Qianyu, Pei Qianyu

118
00:06:54,104 --> 00:06:55,743
Pei Qianyu, let me out!

119
00:06:55,744 --> 00:06:57,383
You're really locking me in here?

120
00:06:57,744 --> 00:06:59,983
Pei Qianyu, you bastard

121
00:07:00,264 --> 00:07:03,263
Let me out!

122
00:07:04,184 --> 00:07:06,343
You, let me out!

123
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:07,023
Let

124
00:07:21,824 --> 00:07:23,023
Your Highness, you've worked hard

125
00:07:23,464 --> 00:07:24,543
To catch an assassin

126
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:25,983
You've gone to such lengths

127
00:07:26,424 --> 00:07:29,423
You've surrounded my residence so tightly

128
00:07:30,344 --> 00:07:32,383
To those who know, it looks like you're after an assassin

129
00:07:33,344 --> 00:07:34,343
To those who don't

130
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:36,143
It seems like you're after me

131
00:07:37,784 --> 00:07:39,183
Chief Eunuch, that's a bit harsh

132
00:07:39,984 --> 00:07:41,783
Ever since I took over the Ministry of Military

133
00:07:42,064 --> 00:07:43,863
The defense of the capital

134
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,263
has fallen on me

135
00:07:46,944 --> 00:07:49,623
Naturally, I can't overlook any suspicions

136
00:07:50,544 --> 00:07:51,423
If

137
00:07:51,424 --> 00:07:53,543
you find anything inappropriate

138
00:07:54,184 --> 00:07:55,503
I can withdraw immediately

139
00:07:56,064 --> 00:07:58,023
Your Highness, with such dedication

140
00:07:58,464 --> 00:08:00,423
Of course, I find nothing inappropriate

141
00:08:01,624 --> 00:08:02,423
Please, feel free

142
00:08:16,224 --> 00:08:17,543
Why the arrogance?

143
00:08:18,824 --> 00:08:22,023
No matter how high your position or favored by the Emperor

144
00:08:22,304 --> 00:08:24,743
You're still just a eunuch

145
00:08:26,704 --> 00:08:28,303
When I ascend to the throne

146
00:08:28,864 --> 00:08:31,703
I'll have you kneeling before me day and night

147
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:33,943
Begging for mercy

148
00:09:05,304 --> 00:09:06,383
What about the Crown Prince?

149
00:09:08,704 --> 00:09:09,983
Keep an eye on the Crown Prince

150
00:09:11,424 --> 00:09:12,623
Continue investigating the corruption case

151
00:09:20,304 --> 00:09:21,263
I'm leaving now

152
00:09:27,144 --> 00:09:28,583
What's gotten into sir lately?

153
00:09:29,344 --> 00:09:30,543
Leaving at this hour?

154
00:09:31,664 --> 00:09:33,383
It's not like him at all

155
00:09:34,304 --> 00:09:35,263
It's as if

156
00:09:35,264 --> 00:09:37,383
Something is pulling at his heartstrings

157
00:09:47,464 --> 00:09:48,823
Let me out!

158
00:09:49,224 --> 00:09:52,983
Let me out!

159
00:09:54,224 --> 00:09:55,223
Do you realize your mistake now?

160
00:09:56,144 --> 00:09:57,143
I did nothing wrong!

161
00:09:57,144 --> 00:09:58,583
Just let me out!

162
00:09:59,704 --> 00:10:00,703
No!

163
00:10:05,384 --> 00:10:06,743
Please, sir

164
00:10:07,424 --> 00:10:09,063
Just let me out
