1
00:00:28,132 --> 00:00:29,051
What's going on here?

2
00:00:29,052 --> 00:00:30,211
Why is there so much food?

3
00:00:30,732 --> 00:00:32,691
From now on, Xiu, will handle the cooking

4
00:00:33,132 --> 00:00:35,171
Jin will be your personal maid

5
00:00:35,972 --> 00:00:37,051
Greetings, Miss

6
00:00:37,172 --> 00:00:38,051
No need for formalities

7
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:40,691
I hope you can look after me from now on

8
00:00:40,932 --> 00:00:41,771
Miss, please sit

9
00:00:41,772 --> 00:00:42,771
Try these dishes

10
00:00:43,052 --> 00:00:44,291
How's the taste?!

11
00:00:55,132 --> 00:00:57,731
So delicious, really good

12
00:00:58,972 --> 00:01:01,251
She doesn't eat duck meat, nor onions and ginger

13
00:01:01,332 --> 00:01:02,211
She likes spicy food

14
00:01:02,452 --> 00:01:03,211
Remember these

15
00:01:04,212 --> 00:01:05,411
I've noted it down

16
00:01:05,852 --> 00:01:06,651
You may leave

17
00:01:07,252 --> 00:01:08,051
Yes

18
00:01:15,012 --> 00:01:17,011
But why are you so good to me?

19
00:01:18,772 --> 00:01:20,171
To my future wife

20
00:01:20,852 --> 00:01:22,251
Of course, I should be

21
00:01:23,372 --> 00:01:24,931
Nonsense!

22
00:01:24,932 --> 00:01:26,051
I never agreed to that

23
00:01:28,932 --> 00:01:31,131
Whether you agree or not doesn't matter

24
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,371
I've decided

25
00:01:33,532 --> 00:01:34,171
You

26
00:01:34,812 --> 00:01:36,291
You're not going to force me, are you?

27
00:01:40,052 --> 00:01:41,011
Of course not

28
00:01:41,892 --> 00:01:42,891
One day

29
00:01:43,652 --> 00:01:45,291
You will be willing

30
00:01:46,492 --> 00:01:47,291
By the way

31
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:48,811
I've been quite busy lately

32
00:01:49,172 --> 00:01:50,371
His Majesty just returned to the palace

33
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,971
There's a lot to deal with

34
00:01:52,372 --> 00:01:53,691
With them taking care of you

35
00:01:54,172 --> 00:01:55,131
I'll be at ease

36
00:02:03,572 --> 00:02:05,451
His Majesty has just returned to the palace?

37
00:02:10,372 --> 00:02:11,171
Your Majesty

38
00:02:11,492 --> 00:02:13,011
The corruption case you assigned before you left

39
00:02:13,012 --> 00:02:14,131
It's quite extensive

40
00:02:14,572 --> 00:02:16,411
From police captains to senior officials

41
00:02:16,732 --> 00:02:17,931
Even reaching the ministers

42
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:19,451
We've found out

43
00:02:19,452 --> 00:02:21,931
Over 53 million taels of embezzled silver

44
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,371
Investigate!

45
00:02:27,092 --> 00:02:28,291
Get to the bottom of it

46
00:02:29,452 --> 00:02:31,771
Root out these parasites

47
00:02:32,892 --> 00:02:33,971
Father, please calm down

48
00:02:34,852 --> 00:02:36,251
You've traveled a long way

49
00:02:36,452 --> 00:02:38,211
Why bother over such trivial matters?

50
00:02:39,452 --> 00:02:41,811
The Chief Eunuch also has his hands full

51
00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:43,531
It's been half a year

52
00:02:44,092 --> 00:02:45,651
of paperwork for him

53
00:02:46,652 --> 00:02:47,291
Why not

54
00:02:47,412 --> 00:02:48,971
Let me handle it?

55
00:02:49,092 --> 00:02:50,851
I can certainly bring everything to light

56
00:02:51,092 --> 00:02:52,811
Thank you for your concern, Your Highness

57
00:02:53,772 --> 00:02:56,371
But serving His Majesty is my honor

58
00:02:56,652 --> 00:02:58,211
There's no talk of being tired

59
00:02:59,732 --> 00:03:00,211
Your Majesty

60
00:03:00,812 --> 00:03:02,491
I will give my utmost

61
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,331
No matter how high their position may be

62
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:06,811
I will

63
00:03:07,172 --> 00:03:08,291
Investigate thoroughly

64
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:10,531
Alright

65
00:03:12,812 --> 00:03:13,851
This matter

66
00:03:14,892 --> 00:03:16,011
Will still be handled by the Chief Eunuch

67
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:17,331
And the Third Prince

68
00:03:17,772 --> 00:03:18,411
Father

69
00:03:18,452 --> 00:03:19,011
I...

70
00:03:19,012 --> 00:03:19,691
Enough

71
00:03:20,572 --> 00:03:22,451
Just got back and it's all a mess

72
00:03:22,732 --> 00:03:23,611
The Ministry of Military

73
00:03:24,132 --> 00:03:25,851
Is the foundation of the court

74
00:03:26,572 --> 00:03:27,891
Starting tomorrow

75
00:03:28,172 --> 00:03:29,891
You go to the Ministry of Military to gain experience

76
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,971
You are the future heir

77
00:03:32,652 --> 00:03:34,731
You must learn the essentials of military affairs

78
00:03:34,972 --> 00:03:35,691
Understand?

79
00:03:37,292 --> 00:03:38,291
I obey

80
00:04:02,132 --> 00:04:03,211
We've been set up

81
00:04:09,252 --> 00:04:10,771
I trusted you

82
00:04:11,132 --> 00:04:13,651
So I let you handle this matter

83
00:04:14,652 --> 00:04:17,131
Never thought you'd be foxes guarding the hen house

84
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:19,371
Cao Duo's suicide note

85
00:04:19,372 --> 00:04:20,851
The handwriting is correct

86
00:04:21,372 --> 00:04:22,411
The letter says

87
00:04:22,412 --> 00:04:24,171
He was coerced by you

88
00:04:24,572 --> 00:04:26,571
And committed suicide out of guilt

89
00:04:29,332 --> 00:04:30,731
What do you have to say?

90
00:04:32,692 --> 00:04:33,851
Father, it's a misunderstanding

91
00:04:34,132 --> 00:04:35,331
I have always been frugal

92
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:37,891
Never dared to be extravagant

93
00:04:38,372 --> 00:04:40,051
I am willing to open my residence for investigation

94
00:04:40,492 --> 00:04:43,051
Besides, I never had personal dealings with Cao Duo

95
00:04:43,772 --> 00:04:44,811
How could I coerce him?

96
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:46,331
Your Majesty, please calm down

97
00:04:46,652 --> 00:04:48,571
I've examined Cao Duo's body

98
00:04:49,092 --> 00:04:50,691
There are two bruises on his neck

99
00:04:52,132 --> 00:04:53,651
Clearly, he was strangled

100
00:04:53,772 --> 00:04:54,731
and then staged as a suicide

101
00:04:56,292 --> 00:04:57,651
This suicide note

102
00:04:59,772 --> 00:05:01,171
Is indeed in Cao Duo's handwriting

103
00:05:02,172 --> 00:05:03,251
But the writing is sloppy

104
00:05:03,812 --> 00:05:05,691
It seems it was written under duress

105
00:05:06,772 --> 00:05:07,571
I hope Your Majesty

106
00:05:08,092 --> 00:05:09,851
Won't be misled by these villains

107
00:05:11,292 --> 00:05:14,451
That 100,000 taels of silver can't be faked

108
00:05:14,452 --> 00:05:16,051
This is exactly the villain's vicious trick

109
00:05:16,492 --> 00:05:19,651
Trying to use this silver to evade investigation

110
00:05:20,052 --> 00:05:21,131
And clear their names

111
00:05:22,452 --> 00:05:23,651
What Mr. Pei said

112
00:05:24,092 --> 00:05:25,371
Also makes sense

113
00:05:26,852 --> 00:05:28,131
I am willing to make a pledge

114
00:05:28,452 --> 00:05:30,291
If I don't thoroughly investigate this case within a month

115
00:05:30,492 --> 00:05:32,251
And retrieve 5.3 million taels of silver

116
00:05:33,932 --> 00:05:34,971
Am willing to be punished

117
00:05:35,692 --> 00:05:36,531
Alright

118
00:05:37,332 --> 00:05:38,371
As you wish

119
00:05:39,732 --> 00:05:40,531
But

120
00:05:41,052 --> 00:05:42,771
I see you've been working hard these days

121
00:05:43,172 --> 00:05:44,851
Let's postpone the wedding for now

122
00:05:45,772 --> 00:05:47,171
Focus on the case first

123
00:05:48,052 --> 00:05:49,051
I accept the order

124
00:05:51,052 --> 00:05:51,851
Son

125
00:05:52,772 --> 00:05:53,851
You too

126
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:56,211
Stay in the mansion for now, cultivate your character

127
00:05:57,332 --> 00:05:58,891
I obey the decree

128
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:04,931
First they killed Our appointed officials

129
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:06,051
Now

130
00:06:06,292 --> 00:06:08,011
They accuse us of corruption and bribery

131
00:06:08,652 --> 00:06:10,051
High officials in the court

132
00:06:10,052 --> 00:06:11,491
Are just tools for their misdeeds

133
00:06:11,492 --> 00:06:13,131
It's a disgrace he's the Crown Prince

134
00:06:14,012 --> 00:06:15,451
Selling offices and titles

135
00:06:15,572 --> 00:06:16,811
Exploiting and oppressing

136
00:06:16,852 --> 00:06:19,571
What place does he leave for the people?

137
00:06:22,892 --> 00:06:24,011
Anger is useless

138
00:06:24,532 --> 00:06:26,131
We still have no evidence

139
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:27,971
Let him be smug for now

140
00:06:29,412 --> 00:06:31,131
The more reckless he is

141
00:06:31,372 --> 00:06:32,771
The more he'll slip up

142
00:06:33,172 --> 00:06:35,771
And the more opportunities we'll have

143
00:07:06,412 --> 00:07:07,211
What's this all about?

144
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,731
I see your face darkened

145
00:07:09,812 --> 00:07:10,771
And your brows furrowed

146
00:07:11,172 --> 00:07:12,651
You must be troubled

147
00:07:13,092 --> 00:07:14,851
Sighing over books adds to the sorrow

148
00:07:15,332 --> 00:07:17,251
Why don't I join you for a few drinks

149
00:07:17,252 --> 00:07:19,171
Let's dissipate these troubles

150
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:20,771
Cheers

151
00:07:30,172 --> 00:07:31,331
I didn't realize

152
00:07:31,572 --> 00:07:33,651
you can really hold your liquor

153
00:07:45,972 --> 00:07:47,051
Come, continue

154
00:07:48,732 --> 00:07:49,451
No more drinking

155
00:07:49,452 --> 00:07:50,771
Fine

156
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:52,971
Three

157
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:55,051
Two

158
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:57,171
One

159
00:07:57,172 --> 00:07:58,051
You

160
00:08:03,052 --> 00:08:04,491
Knew to be cautious

161
00:08:04,612 --> 00:08:05,891
Good thing I was prepared

162
00:08:06,332 --> 00:08:08,851
Just one drink and you'd be down

163
00:08:11,412 --> 00:08:12,211
Wake up

164
00:08:12,652 --> 00:08:14,371
Wake up, let's keep drinking

165
00:08:16,932 --> 00:08:18,291
Qingcheng's medicine

166
00:08:18,972 --> 00:08:20,131
Really is potent

167
00:08:22,532 --> 00:08:24,131
Sorry, Mr. Pei

168
00:08:33,572 --> 00:08:34,451
Forgive me

169
00:08:34,452 --> 00:08:35,531
Just borrowing this for a moment

170
00:08:42,012 --> 00:08:45,291
Catch the assassin, there's an assassin!

171
00:08:56,892 --> 00:08:58,651
What a waste of a trip to the palace

172
00:08:58,892 --> 00:09:00,931
I forgot to take a map of the palace

173
00:09:04,652 --> 00:09:06,211
Better send it back first

174
00:09:15,332 --> 00:09:16,691
Your Highness, what do you need?

175
00:09:17,372 --> 00:09:18,691
Get your master out here

176
00:09:27,372 --> 00:09:28,691
My master got drunk tonight

177
00:09:28,852 --> 00:09:29,731
He has already gone to bed

178
00:09:39,892 --> 00:09:42,251
It's inappropriate to barge into the Chief Eunuch's residence

179
00:09:43,852 --> 00:09:46,251
This residence was bestowed by my father

180
00:09:47,572 --> 00:09:49,011
Since he's already asleep

181
00:09:50,052 --> 00:09:50,971
Then I

182
00:09:51,252 --> 00:09:52,851
Naturally shouldn't disturb him

183
00:09:54,452 --> 00:09:57,051
Surround the whole courtyard

184
00:09:57,452 --> 00:09:59,051
I don't believe

185
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:01,691
She can escape

186
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:02,691
Yes, sir
