1
00:00:22,928 --> 00:00:23,727
Sir

2
00:00:23,928 --> 00:00:24,687
The two officials from the Ministry of Justice

3
00:00:24,688 --> 00:00:26,327
Who privately took bribes

4
00:00:26,448 --> 00:00:27,247
Are all here

5
00:00:44,448 --> 00:00:46,967
I don't have time to waste with you two

6
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:48,527
This crime

7
00:00:49,328 --> 00:00:50,407
Will you confess

8
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:52,567
Or not?

9
00:00:53,048 --> 00:00:53,887
Mr. Pei

10
00:00:54,168 --> 00:00:56,367
We are from the Ministry of Justice after all

11
00:00:57,368 --> 00:00:58,447
You have no right

12
00:00:58,648 --> 00:00:59,887
to interrogate us privately

13
00:01:00,568 --> 00:01:01,327
Exactly

14
00:01:01,808 --> 00:01:03,127
Whether we're guilty

15
00:01:03,568 --> 00:01:05,327
should be determined by the Ministry of Justice

16
00:01:05,768 --> 00:01:07,847
You think just because His Majesty is away

17
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:09,647
you can do whatever you want?

18
00:01:09,768 --> 00:01:11,767
I'm used to having my way

19
00:01:13,368 --> 00:01:14,967
If you two have any complaints

20
00:01:15,768 --> 00:01:17,447
feel free to report me to the Crown Prince

21
00:01:18,608 --> 00:01:19,607
Of course

22
00:01:30,168 --> 00:01:32,607
that's if you two can leave alive

23
00:01:37,648 --> 00:01:39,367
We confess, we confess

24
00:01:39,368 --> 00:01:40,407
Please, Mr. Pei

25
00:01:40,408 --> 00:01:41,127
Spare our lives

26
00:01:41,128 --> 00:01:42,007
Yes, yes

27
00:01:42,008 --> 00:01:43,607
Please spare our lives, Mr. Pei

28
00:01:54,168 --> 00:01:56,927
[Confession]

29
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,807
He managed to rescue me from the prison

30
00:02:22,128 --> 00:02:23,647
His status must be extraordinary

31
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:27,127
Perhaps

32
00:02:28,008 --> 00:02:29,887
I should start with him

33
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:42,447
You're awake

34
00:02:49,048 --> 00:02:49,847
Are you hungry?

35
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:56,327
I am Pei Qianyu

36
00:02:56,808 --> 00:02:58,647
Just a mere palace guard

37
00:02:59,128 --> 00:03:00,487
Those from Jiang nation who were imprisoned

38
00:03:00,488 --> 00:03:01,367
have all been assigned

39
00:03:01,368 --> 00:03:02,767
to various officials' households as servants

40
00:03:03,448 --> 00:03:05,087
Miss, you were assigned to me

41
00:03:06,048 --> 00:03:07,367
I don't need servants

42
00:03:07,928 --> 00:03:09,007
Once you've recovered

43
00:03:09,608 --> 00:03:10,527
I'll send you home

44
00:03:11,768 --> 00:03:12,807
I have no home

45
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,927
I'm just a beggar

46
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,367
I was mistakenly captured

47
00:03:16,368 --> 00:03:17,607
By the officers yesterday

48
00:03:19,488 --> 00:03:20,567
Aren't you from Jiang?

49
00:03:21,408 --> 00:03:22,647
I can send you home

50
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,807
My name is Lee

51
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:28,207
Sir, you saved me yesterday

52
00:03:28,328 --> 00:03:29,447
I have nothing to repay you with

53
00:03:29,448 --> 00:03:30,407
I wish to offer myself in marriage to you

54
00:03:30,808 --> 00:03:33,207
Please let me stay in your mansion

55
00:03:37,768 --> 00:03:39,767
Sir, please let me stay

56
00:03:39,768 --> 00:03:42,367
I don't want to be a beggar anymore

57
00:03:42,928 --> 00:03:44,367
I have nowhere to go

58
00:03:44,368 --> 00:03:45,767
Sir, your mansion is so big

59
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:47,327
Please, keep me

60
00:03:47,368 --> 00:03:49,847
I will work diligently to repay you

61
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:52,327
Sir

62
00:04:31,448 --> 00:04:33,567
I beg you to let me stay

63
00:04:46,648 --> 00:04:47,127


64
00:04:49,408 --> 00:04:50,407


65
00:04:54,848 --> 00:04:56,167
Only by staying

66
00:04:56,568 --> 00:04:58,167
will I have a chance to seek revenge

67
00:05:00,368 --> 00:05:01,487
Marrying him

68
00:05:02,088 --> 00:05:03,527
not only covers my identity

69
00:05:04,968 --> 00:05:06,887
but also provides a place to stay

70
00:05:09,888 --> 00:05:11,967
Besides, he seems to be a decent man

71
00:05:34,728 --> 00:05:35,647
Over ten years ago

72
00:05:35,928 --> 00:05:37,727
Jiang sent a group of people to Zhou

73
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,247
They settled there

74
00:05:39,688 --> 00:05:40,887
established the Buddha Pavilion

75
00:05:41,088 --> 00:05:41,847
and secretly trained spies

76
00:05:42,648 --> 00:05:44,087
to pass messages for our Jiang

77
00:05:45,168 --> 00:05:46,007
But five years ago

78
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,207
the messages suddenly stopped

79
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:48,167
For unknown reasons

80
00:05:49,008 --> 00:05:50,447
If you have time

81
00:05:50,648 --> 00:05:51,727
take this jade pendant

82
00:05:52,008 --> 00:05:53,607
go find the Pavilion Master

83
00:05:54,408 --> 00:05:55,327
If she's still there

84
00:05:55,968 --> 00:05:57,367
She will definitely help you

85
00:05:59,168 --> 00:06:00,327
Buddha Pavilion

86
00:06:17,088 --> 00:06:19,087
Lee, where are you going?

87
00:06:19,808 --> 00:06:21,687
I...My body hasn't fully recovered yet

88
00:06:21,888 --> 00:06:23,327
I need to go out and buy so some medicine

89
00:06:23,328 --> 00:06:23,807
But

90
00:06:24,488 --> 00:06:25,647
Without the master's permission

91
00:06:25,648 --> 00:06:26,687
You cannot leave the mansion

92
00:06:27,608 --> 00:06:28,807
Don't worry about the medicine

93
00:06:28,808 --> 00:06:30,007
Just wait a moment, okay?

94
00:06:30,168 --> 00:06:30,887
What are you up to?

95
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:31,927
You'll see in a moment

96
00:06:53,848 --> 00:06:55,847
What are all these?

97
00:06:57,008 --> 00:06:58,087
Ginseng

98
00:06:58,408 --> 00:06:59,287
Angelica

99
00:06:59,488 --> 00:07:00,247
Deer antler

100
00:07:00,408 --> 00:07:01,407
Polygonum multiflorum

101
00:07:02,408 --> 00:07:03,967
Cordyceps, and Ganoderma

102
00:07:07,088 --> 00:07:09,167
Where did all these come from?

103
00:07:09,568 --> 00:07:11,647
These are the herbs the master prepared for you

104
00:07:13,048 --> 00:07:14,487
All of these are for me?

105
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:15,887
Yes

106
00:07:17,008 --> 00:07:19,127
Lee, you are really lucky

107
00:07:19,408 --> 00:07:20,927
I've been here over a year

108
00:07:20,928 --> 00:07:22,367
and the master has never favored me like this

109
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:23,287
You've just arrived

110
00:07:23,288 --> 00:07:24,407
and the master is so kind to you

111
00:07:24,608 --> 00:07:25,327
I think

112
00:07:25,328 --> 00:07:27,007
It must be the good karma from your past life

113
00:07:28,408 --> 00:07:30,127
I'd rather you had that

114
00:07:30,608 --> 00:07:32,567
All I want now is freedom

115
00:07:32,568 --> 00:07:34,007
That lets me leave the mansion

116
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,047
I think the master is quite reasonable

117
00:07:37,608 --> 00:07:39,167
Why not ask him?

118
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:41,247
He might just let you go

119
00:07:42,648 --> 00:07:44,487
Alright, I will order...

120
00:07:45,408 --> 00:07:48,807
I will graciously ask him

121
00:07:59,008 --> 00:07:59,607
Here comes the medicine

122
00:08:04,968 --> 00:08:06,287
After drinking this

123
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,447
Tonight might be tough

124
00:08:09,408 --> 00:08:10,927
Godfather swapped you back then

125
00:08:11,368 --> 00:08:12,367
And didn't castrate you

126
00:08:13,168 --> 00:08:14,567
to preserve a lineage for the Pei family

127
00:08:15,768 --> 00:08:17,127
Before he passed away, he instructed me

128
00:08:17,648 --> 00:08:19,167
to protect you at all costs

129
00:08:20,248 --> 00:08:22,287
You must take this medicine on time

130
00:08:22,888 --> 00:08:24,007
to keep your disguise secret

131
00:08:24,008 --> 00:08:25,287
as a fake eunuch

132
00:08:26,528 --> 00:08:27,487
I understand

133
00:08:47,368 --> 00:08:48,287
This medicine is harmful

134
00:08:48,808 --> 00:08:50,887
If it acts up, it might be hard to endure

135
00:08:51,808 --> 00:08:53,607
You should go back for today, sir

136
00:09:20,288 --> 00:09:21,247
Mr. Pei

137
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:22,327
Mr. Pei

138
00:09:33,968 --> 00:09:34,927
Mr. Pei

139
00:09:35,728 --> 00:09:36,967
What are you doing here?

140
00:09:38,568 --> 00:09:39,287
What happened to you?

141
00:09:40,488 --> 00:09:41,007
Cold

142
00:09:41,368 --> 00:09:42,167
Cold

143
00:09:42,488 --> 00:09:44,407
It's midsummer

144
00:09:45,088 --> 00:09:46,127
So cold

145
00:09:50,008 --> 00:09:52,447
Looks like you're having a chill

146
00:09:52,808 --> 00:09:53,807
Being this cold

147
00:09:54,408 --> 00:09:55,527
must be so painful

148
00:09:56,048 --> 00:09:57,607
I'll go get you a blanket

149
00:10:04,288 --> 00:10:05,087
Don't leave
