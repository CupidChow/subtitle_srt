1
00:00:17,088 --> 00:00:19,527
Of course, they must be killed

2
00:00:22,848 --> 00:00:24,287
This Pei Qianyu

3
00:00:25,128 --> 00:00:26,047
Back then

4
00:00:26,288 --> 00:00:28,327
He risked his life to go to Jiang Country

5
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,127
to get the snow lotus for my father

6
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:32,887
That's how he got to his current position

7
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:34,687
My father values him

8
00:00:36,008 --> 00:00:37,607
I cannot keep this hidden danger

9
00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:41,567
You go and get rid of him

10
00:00:44,168 --> 00:00:45,247
I suppose

11
00:00:46,288 --> 00:00:48,327
the Pei family in the underworld

12
00:00:48,328 --> 00:00:50,247
has been waiting for him for a long time

13
00:00:51,728 --> 00:00:52,607
When the time comes

14
00:00:53,808 --> 00:00:55,807
I will send him off

15
00:00:57,528 --> 00:01:00,207
Just like I sent off his whole family back then

16
00:01:18,008 --> 00:01:18,807
Lee

17
00:01:20,488 --> 00:01:21,807
What are you doing here

18
00:01:21,968 --> 00:01:24,807
I am making a cover for the warmer for Mr. Pei

19
00:01:28,408 --> 00:01:30,207
Your hands are all pricked

20
00:01:30,888 --> 00:01:32,247
It's nothing, it's nothing

21
00:01:32,568 --> 00:01:33,847
I'm not very good at it

22
00:01:35,848 --> 00:01:36,367
It's okay

23
00:01:36,368 --> 00:01:37,047
Lee

24
00:01:37,728 --> 00:01:39,087
You are so good to Mr. Pei

25
00:01:40,808 --> 00:01:42,727
Mr. Pei once saved my life

26
00:01:43,008 --> 00:01:44,367
I don't want to owe him

27
00:01:45,568 --> 00:01:46,647
I see that Mr. Pei

28
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:49,647
treats you differently from the other maids

29
00:01:50,168 --> 00:01:51,367
Could it be...

30
00:01:51,368 --> 00:01:52,687
Do you...

31
00:01:52,808 --> 00:01:54,527
No, absolutely not

32
00:01:55,488 --> 00:01:57,887
My feelings for Mr. Pei are just gratitude

33
00:01:57,888 --> 00:01:59,687
There are no romantic feelings at all

34
00:02:04,168 --> 00:02:05,207
Be careful

35
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,967
I asked if you think Mr. Pei is nice

36
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,007
No, absolutely not

37
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,327
My feelings for Mr. Pei are just gratitude

38
00:02:30,328 --> 00:02:31,607
There are no romantic feelings at all

39
00:02:34,048 --> 00:02:35,367
Now that I'm a eunuch

40
00:02:36,728 --> 00:02:38,087
What can I give her anyway

41
00:02:38,368 --> 00:02:40,327
Mr. Pei, are you asleep

42
00:02:45,368 --> 00:02:46,127
Yes

43
00:02:52,328 --> 00:02:53,767
Didn't I tell you I'm asleep

44
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,247
I saw the light in your room still on

45
00:03:04,488 --> 00:03:06,207
So I knew you definitely weren't asleep

46
00:03:07,048 --> 00:03:08,607
Whether I sleep or not, what's it to you

47
00:03:09,608 --> 00:03:10,567
Looks like

48
00:03:10,808 --> 00:03:13,527
you're really not in a good mood today

49
00:03:18,968 --> 00:03:20,887
How about now, is this any better

50
00:03:23,968 --> 00:03:25,087
You don't care about me

51
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,567
Why bother doing all this

52
00:03:27,768 --> 00:03:29,367
How could I not care

53
00:03:29,568 --> 00:03:31,407
To make this warmer cover

54
00:03:31,688 --> 00:03:33,407
my hands got pricked by needles countless times

55
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:34,327
Look

56
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:35,887
Look

57
00:03:43,328 --> 00:03:44,007
You...

58
00:03:45,488 --> 00:03:46,727
Why go to such lengths

59
00:03:48,048 --> 00:03:50,247
You always help and take care of me

60
00:03:50,808 --> 00:03:52,687
I have no way to repay your kindness

61
00:03:52,808 --> 00:03:54,047
So I want to

62
00:03:54,048 --> 00:03:56,287
do something within my ability to repay you

63
00:03:57,848 --> 00:04:00,007
I never expect anything in return from you

64
00:04:00,848 --> 00:04:01,447
I just want...

65
00:04:01,448 --> 00:04:02,447
I know

66
00:04:02,768 --> 00:04:04,327
You want me to leave here

67
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:05,927
So

68
00:04:06,368 --> 00:04:07,647
before I leave

69
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,447
I give you this item

70
00:04:10,648 --> 00:04:13,007
I hope it can help you stay warm

71
00:04:13,008 --> 00:04:15,687
when your cold syndrome acts up

72
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:21,927
I have

73
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,967
very important things to do in the Capital

74
00:04:26,288 --> 00:04:27,447
I can't predict

75
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,087
if I could live or die

76
00:04:37,088 --> 00:04:38,687
I like it very much

77
00:04:39,408 --> 00:04:40,327
I will keep it for now

78
00:04:43,528 --> 00:04:44,487
Really

79
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:52,687
Lee

80
00:04:54,568 --> 00:04:56,287
I will definitely protect you

81
00:05:17,648 --> 00:05:19,647
This Pei Qianyu is really formidable

82
00:05:20,288 --> 00:05:21,607
I couldn't defeat him

83
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,607
I didn't expect the person the princess mentioned to be Pei Qianyu

84
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,727
You are the top expert of the Buddha Pavilion

85
00:05:53,808 --> 00:05:55,687
and you couldn't defeat him either

86
00:05:57,728 --> 00:05:59,207
Originally, we should be evenly matched

87
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:01,167
But in recent years

88
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:02,807
I've been poisoned by Strychnine

89
00:06:03,728 --> 00:06:05,207
My martial arts have regressed instead of improved

90
00:06:06,248 --> 00:06:07,727
Naturally, I can't defeat him

91
00:06:09,448 --> 00:06:10,647
In that case

92
00:06:11,368 --> 00:06:12,767
we can only hope

93
00:06:13,368 --> 00:06:15,807
he won't become my enemy in the future

94
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:56,527
This woman

95
00:06:57,888 --> 00:06:58,607
I'm taking her away

96
00:07:01,768 --> 00:07:04,967
This time, it's my turn to protect you

97
00:07:39,928 --> 00:07:42,887
I'm sure Lee will like this incense

98
00:07:49,648 --> 00:07:50,447
I'm ready

99
00:07:53,928 --> 00:07:55,687
Women beautify themselves for those they like

100
00:07:56,168 --> 00:07:58,007
You are naturally beautiful

101
00:07:58,408 --> 00:07:59,807
But you are too lively

102
00:07:59,808 --> 00:08:01,127
and not soft enough

103
00:08:02,088 --> 00:08:03,687
I'm afraid

104
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:05,967
this would scare men away

105
00:08:06,408 --> 00:08:07,167
What

106
00:08:07,648 --> 00:08:08,607
What do you mean

107
00:08:09,008 --> 00:08:11,487
Isn't the most important thing for an assassin to practice martial arts

108
00:08:15,768 --> 00:08:17,167
Martial arts are important

109
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,247
But for us women

110
00:08:20,888 --> 00:08:22,647
our inherent advantage

111
00:08:23,048 --> 00:08:24,367
is our beauty

112
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,407
If you want to be the top assassin

113
00:08:28,088 --> 00:08:29,687
you can't make them fear you

114
00:08:30,488 --> 00:08:32,407
but make them like you

115
00:08:33,568 --> 00:08:34,967
The more they like you

116
00:08:35,408 --> 00:08:37,287
the easier it is for us to succeed

117
00:08:38,288 --> 00:08:39,167
What

118
00:08:39,448 --> 00:08:40,807
I am a princess

119
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:43,367
You ask me to learn the ways of a courtesan

120
00:08:43,568 --> 00:08:44,967
and sell my charms

121
00:08:49,968 --> 00:08:50,967
If you look down on it

122
00:08:51,128 --> 00:08:52,047
then don't come here

123
00:08:52,648 --> 00:08:53,687
My Buddha Pavilion

124
00:08:54,168 --> 00:08:55,727
is only capable of these petty tricks

125
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:56,887
If you look down on it

126
00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:58,207
Go back to Jiang

127
00:08:59,488 --> 00:09:01,407
to see that ruined city

128
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,567
and the countless wronged souls

129
00:09:07,528 --> 00:09:08,967
If I don't avenge my country's destruction

130
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,727
How can I go back to Jiang?

131
00:09:14,248 --> 00:09:14,887
Fine

132
00:09:15,728 --> 00:09:16,607
I'll learn
