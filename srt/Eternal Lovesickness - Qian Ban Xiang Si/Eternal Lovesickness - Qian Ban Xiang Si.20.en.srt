1
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:24,018
Pei Qianyu

2
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:28,218
Since I stepped into Zhou

3
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:30,738
Since the moment you saved me

4
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:34,458
All of them were your scheme

5
00:01:04,139 --> 00:01:04,818
What's wrong

6
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:06,458
In all these years

7
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:09,378
this is the first time I've seen the incense line in your hand break

8
00:01:11,059 --> 00:01:12,418
Did you send someone

9
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:14,178
to the third prince

10
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:15,978
I passed on the Emperor's order

11
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:17,538
Telling the third prince

12
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:18,858
not to go out without reason

13
00:01:22,179 --> 00:01:23,178
Pack up

14
00:01:23,779 --> 00:01:24,338
You may leave

15
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:25,458
Yes

16
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:49,938
My name is Lee

17
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:51,498
You saved me yesterday

18
00:01:51,499 --> 00:01:52,458
I have no way to repay you

19
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:53,778
So I'm willing to give myself to you

20
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:56,298
Just please let me stay in the mansion

21
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:01,818
I see your forehead is dark and your brows are furrowed

22
00:02:02,419 --> 00:02:03,498
You must have worries

23
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:05,698
Reading brings more sorrow

24
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:07,898
How about I keep you company with a few drinks

25
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:09,858
Let's let our troubles disappear

26
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,458
Would you lie to me

27
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:15,938
You treat me so well

28
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:17,938
you wouldn't lie to me

29
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:19,738
right

30
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:29,098
You don't care about me

31
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:31,018
Why bother doing all this

32
00:02:31,179 --> 00:02:32,658
How could I not care

33
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,858
To make this warmer cover

34
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:36,658
my hands got pricked by needles countless times

35
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:37,938
Look

36
00:03:21,179 --> 00:03:22,418
Why can't I go out

37
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:26,658
It's His Majesty's order

38
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:28,538
Please don't make it difficult for me

39
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:36,618
Stop

40
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:46,818
Get out

41
00:03:47,619 --> 00:03:48,698
You don't want to see me either

42
00:03:49,899 --> 00:03:50,858
Why are you here

43
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:23,138
Call the Chief Eunuch

44
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:40,338
Your Majesty

45
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:42,938
The third prince was assassinated

46
00:04:44,299 --> 00:04:45,378
He passed away tragically

47
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:54,458
That traitor

48
00:04:55,539 --> 00:04:57,338
He really killed his own brother

49
00:04:58,059 --> 00:05:00,418
It seems he won't rest

50
00:05:00,859 --> 00:05:02,538
until he has killed me too

51
00:05:03,739 --> 00:05:06,498
Prince North is that traitor's uncle

52
00:05:08,179 --> 00:05:09,338
You must keep a close watch on him

53
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:11,538
If he makes any move

54
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:13,338
inform me immediately

55
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:16,178
Yes

56
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:17,698
What

57
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:20,018
Do you have any other ideas

58
00:05:22,299 --> 00:05:24,218
Prince North has been building his forces for a long time

59
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:26,778
If he insists on rebelling

60
00:05:27,739 --> 00:05:28,378
I'm afraid...

61
00:05:29,859 --> 00:05:32,618
Then I will strip him of his military power first

62
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:34,738
Lately

63
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:37,498
I often wake up from nightmares

64
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:40,698
Why do those people massacred by Prince North

65
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:43,618
seek revenge from me

66
00:05:44,299 --> 00:05:46,018
I'm not a bloodthirsty person

67
00:05:46,219 --> 00:05:47,498
Those orders for massacre

68
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:49,738
were all given by Prince North

69
00:05:51,859 --> 00:05:53,578
He is cruel and murderous

70
00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:55,418
He has committed many sins

71
00:05:56,179 --> 00:05:57,418
I will issue a decree

72
00:05:58,219 --> 00:05:59,418
for him to surrender his military power

73
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:01,618
and sincerely worship Buddha

74
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:04,018
to atone for his sins

75
00:06:04,619 --> 00:06:05,978
The priority now

76
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,458
is not to alert the enemy

77
00:06:08,859 --> 00:06:10,858
If they become desperate

78
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:12,338
it will be worse

79
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:13,498
Yes

80
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:18,338
Increase the number of Imperial Guards

81
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:20,378
in the palace by thirty percent

82
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:23,978
Yes

83
00:06:55,059 --> 00:06:58,578
You've done a very good job on this matter

84
00:06:59,739 --> 00:07:01,698
When can we kill Pei Qianyu

85
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:05,898
Be patient

86
00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:07,498
Soon

87
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:09,338
Soon

88
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:13,978
I can't wait

89
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:17,418
to grind his bones to dust immediately

90
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:20,018
When I ascend to the throne

91
00:07:20,859 --> 00:07:21,858
Very soon

92
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:23,938
Very soon

93
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:01,058
Who's there

94
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:05,378
Your Majesty

95
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:07,418
Chief Eunuch

96
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:08,578
Rebel

97
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:10,058
He wants to rebel

98
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,698
Prince North has been consolidating his forces for a long time

99
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:17,818
I had hoped to hand over power to him in a few days

100
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:18,858
But now

101
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,018
We can't wait any longer

102
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:23,978
We can't wait

103
00:08:24,859 --> 00:08:25,978
We can't wait

104
00:08:40,739 --> 00:08:41,658
Mr. Pei

105
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:42,818
Someone

106
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,418
Disarm Prince North

107
00:08:46,219 --> 00:08:47,018
Yes

108
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:51,658
Wait

109
00:08:53,979 --> 00:08:56,138
Is it His Majesty's order

110
00:08:56,739 --> 00:08:58,698
His Majesty said you have worked hard

111
00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:00,058
and you're getting old

112
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:03,098
You are no longer fit to fight

113
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:04,738
He permits you

114
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:06,738
to retire at home
