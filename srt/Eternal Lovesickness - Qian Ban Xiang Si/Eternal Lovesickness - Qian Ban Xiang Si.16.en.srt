1
00:00:22,743 --> 00:00:24,022
Why are you here?

2
00:00:25,223 --> 00:00:26,902
To mock me?

3
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,422
You're no longer the Crown Prince

4
00:00:30,903 --> 00:00:32,422
Don't talk so arrogantly

5
00:00:33,343 --> 00:00:35,022
It's a serious disrespect

6
00:00:35,223 --> 00:00:37,022
No matter how down I am

7
00:00:37,023 --> 00:00:39,582
I'm still more noble than a mere eunuch like you

8
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:43,302
If you came here just to mock me

9
00:00:43,623 --> 00:00:44,822
I advise you

10
00:00:44,823 --> 00:00:46,382
Better get lost

11
00:00:51,023 --> 00:00:52,262
What do you want to do?

12
00:00:52,903 --> 00:00:54,742
This isn't your turf

13
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,502
I'm just here to ask a few questions

14
00:00:58,663 --> 00:01:00,142
If you confess honestly

15
00:01:01,143 --> 00:01:02,702
You won't suffer

16
00:01:03,223 --> 00:01:04,982
Guards!

17
00:01:08,703 --> 00:01:09,902
No need to shout

18
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:12,302
Everyone outside is already knocked out

19
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,462
Confess everything you did

20
00:01:17,903 --> 00:01:19,662
to the Pei family back then

21
00:01:20,263 --> 00:01:21,102
Or else

22
00:01:22,183 --> 00:01:23,822
I wouldn't mind

23
00:01:23,823 --> 00:01:25,622
Killing you right now

24
00:01:27,223 --> 00:01:28,702
Despicable wretch

25
00:01:29,183 --> 00:01:31,342
Treat gentlemen with gentlemanly ways

26
00:01:31,343 --> 00:01:32,742
And scoundrels

27
00:01:33,903 --> 00:01:35,982
with scoundrelly ways

28
00:01:36,143 --> 00:01:37,462
If you don't confess

29
00:01:38,183 --> 00:01:40,862
I have even more despicable tactics up my sleeve

30
00:02:08,343 --> 00:02:10,542
Back then, my uncle, in his efforts to ascend me to power

31
00:02:11,463 --> 00:02:14,062
specifically led me to propose marriage to your Pei family

32
00:02:14,703 --> 00:02:15,782
Who would have known

33
00:02:16,623 --> 00:02:18,222
Your Pei family

34
00:02:18,223 --> 00:02:20,262
looking down on us

35
00:02:20,703 --> 00:02:22,582
dared to refuse

36
00:02:23,383 --> 00:02:24,582
Soon after

37
00:02:25,463 --> 00:02:27,382
when Father was preparing to attack Qi Country

38
00:02:28,183 --> 00:02:29,862
the Pei family submitted a petition

39
00:02:31,303 --> 00:02:34,262
saying it wasn't a good time for war

40
00:02:34,743 --> 00:02:35,942
My uncle then

41
00:02:36,183 --> 00:02:39,582
conspired with Cao Duo and other ministers

42
00:02:40,023 --> 00:02:41,302
to accuse the Pei family

43
00:02:41,743 --> 00:02:43,822
of colluding with the enemy

44
00:02:44,303 --> 00:02:46,102
and refusing to deploy troops

45
00:02:47,423 --> 00:02:49,582
Such vile tactics

46
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,382
How could His Majesty easily believe them?

47
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:01,462
The Pei family has been amassing power for years

48
00:03:01,823 --> 00:03:03,662
Father has long been dissatisfied

49
00:03:05,263 --> 00:03:07,462
He was just waiting for a chance

50
00:03:07,463 --> 00:03:09,702
to seize the military power from the Pei family

51
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:13,782
The timing of these charges was perfect

52
00:03:14,463 --> 00:03:15,462
The Pei family

53
00:03:16,143 --> 00:03:18,222
was almost exterminated

54
00:03:19,983 --> 00:03:23,902
If it weren't for countless court officials pleading with Father

55
00:03:24,343 --> 00:03:25,702
do you think

56
00:03:26,103 --> 00:03:28,382
he would have spared you?

57
00:03:31,063 --> 00:03:32,542
Leaving you alive

58
00:03:33,623 --> 00:03:36,222
Is almost the same as eliminating you

59
00:03:37,063 --> 00:03:38,862
I just didn't expect

60
00:03:40,223 --> 00:03:42,662
You'd become the Chief Eunuch

61
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,502
But so what?

62
00:03:46,023 --> 00:03:48,102
Now that you know the truth

63
00:03:48,503 --> 00:03:50,182
what can you do about it?

64
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:56,062
I am of royal blood

65
00:03:56,943 --> 00:03:58,822
I will rise again

66
00:03:59,063 --> 00:04:00,622
What can you do to me?

67
00:04:01,303 --> 00:04:03,062
If you dare kill me now

68
00:04:03,463 --> 00:04:05,302
would Father let you off?

69
00:04:25,343 --> 00:04:27,542
An elephant doesn't need to bite an ant

70
00:04:28,223 --> 00:04:30,862
It just needs to step on it

71
00:04:32,983 --> 00:04:34,822
I'll be waiting for you

72
00:04:35,983 --> 00:04:38,022
to walk right into my trap

73
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:00,342
Sir

74
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:02,262
Should we enter the palace or...

75
00:05:05,303 --> 00:05:06,622
Let's go to the palace

76
00:05:24,703 --> 00:05:25,662
You go back first

77
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,182
If someone looks for me

78
00:05:27,463 --> 00:05:28,542
Be flexible

79
00:05:29,103 --> 00:05:30,142
Hold on a minute

80
00:06:05,863 --> 00:06:06,782
What happened to you?

81
00:06:08,823 --> 00:06:10,382
How can I help you?

82
00:06:10,863 --> 00:06:11,822
Your Highness

83
00:06:11,823 --> 00:06:13,382
You can't help me

84
00:06:13,863 --> 00:06:15,942
Only the Crown Prince has the antidote

85
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,182
that suppresses the toxicity of Strychnine

86
00:06:18,863 --> 00:06:19,982
Since that's the case

87
00:06:21,103 --> 00:06:22,662
Why help me?

88
00:06:23,703 --> 00:06:24,782
The Crown Prince

89
00:06:25,423 --> 00:06:26,462
has used this drug

90
00:06:27,023 --> 00:06:28,822
to control me for five years

91
00:06:29,943 --> 00:06:31,182
Turning me into

92
00:06:31,863 --> 00:06:34,302
an inhuman monster

93
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,022
Bringing him down this time

94
00:06:37,423 --> 00:06:39,062
makes it all worth it

95
00:06:42,823 --> 00:06:45,262
I've arranged for guards at the Buddha Pavilion

96
00:06:45,663 --> 00:06:47,462
He won't dare bother you anymore

97
00:07:05,943 --> 00:07:07,742
I will find the antidote for you

98
00:07:08,063 --> 00:07:09,582
promise

99
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:36,382
Sorry

100
00:07:36,383 --> 00:07:37,782
I was too rash

101
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,542
Are you alright, miss?

102
00:07:38,543 --> 00:07:39,342
I'm fine

103
00:07:40,023 --> 00:07:40,822
Here, take this

104
00:07:41,063 --> 00:07:41,902
Thank you

105
00:07:42,223 --> 00:07:43,022
It's nothing

106
00:07:51,503 --> 00:07:52,382
+What's wrong?

107
00:07:52,503 --> 00:07:53,822
You look upset

108
00:07:54,143 --> 00:07:55,222
You like her?

109
00:08:02,263 --> 00:08:03,062
I do

110
00:08:04,103 --> 00:08:04,902
And her?

111
00:08:06,783 --> 00:08:08,102
Maybe

112
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:09,822
Possibly

113
00:08:11,343 --> 00:08:12,462
Probably

114
00:08:13,623 --> 00:08:14,702
likes me a bit

115
00:08:19,263 --> 00:08:20,182
What's wrong?

116
00:08:20,423 --> 00:08:22,822
Why suddenly interested in my love life?

117
00:08:22,823 --> 00:08:24,022
I have someone I like

118
00:08:24,263 --> 00:08:25,422
Are you upset?

119
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:47,462
You like her?

120
00:08:48,023 --> 00:08:49,062
I do

121
00:08:57,263 --> 00:08:58,022
I heard

122
00:08:58,023 --> 00:08:59,582
this is the most popular wine in the capital

123
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,182
I had Jin buy a few jars

124
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,662
Let's drink together

125
00:09:03,223 --> 00:09:04,822
I must find out

126
00:09:06,383 --> 00:09:07,942
her true feelings today

127
00:09:09,823 --> 00:09:11,662
I'm gonna drink you under the table

128
00:09:15,023 --> 00:09:16,182
Here

129
00:09:20,623 --> 00:09:21,422
Another one

130
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,262
Come on

131
00:09:34,503 --> 00:09:35,262
Cheers
