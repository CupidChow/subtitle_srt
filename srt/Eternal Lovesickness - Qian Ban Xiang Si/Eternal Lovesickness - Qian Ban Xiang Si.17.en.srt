1
00:00:19,093 --> 00:00:20,612
Why aren't you drinking

2
00:00:22,413 --> 00:00:23,412
You're drunk

3
00:00:24,773 --> 00:00:26,412
No, I'm not

4
00:00:26,413 --> 00:00:27,572
I want...

5
00:00:27,893 --> 00:00:30,532
I want to get you drunk

6
00:00:31,613 --> 00:00:32,932
Get me drunk?

7
00:00:34,253 --> 00:00:35,652
What do you want to do

8
00:00:36,013 --> 00:00:36,972
when you get me drunk

9
00:00:41,773 --> 00:00:42,772
I want...

10
00:00:43,813 --> 00:00:45,372
I want to see...

11
00:00:45,373 --> 00:00:46,892
I want to see

12
00:00:46,893 --> 00:00:48,772
are you a eunuch

13
00:00:49,213 --> 00:00:51,092
or a man

14
00:00:53,013 --> 00:00:54,212
How do you want to see

15
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,012
I...

16
00:00:56,013 --> 00:00:57,692
I want to

17
00:00:57,693 --> 00:00:58,772
see

18
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:00,372
see

19
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:14,732
What are you doing

20
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:16,692
I also want to know what you're doing

21
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:18,332
You like the Third Prince

22
00:01:20,093 --> 00:01:22,252
Who's the Third Prince

23
00:01:23,453 --> 00:01:25,532
The person you bumped into today

24
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:28,132
I don't even know him

25
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:29,772
Why would I like him

26
00:01:30,973 --> 00:01:32,452
Then why did you go there

27
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:36,932
I went to get help from Sister Qingcheng for your illness

28
00:01:50,613 --> 00:01:51,932
Strange

29
00:01:52,453 --> 00:01:53,532
Qingcheng

30
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:56,092
What is this medicine for

31
00:01:56,173 --> 00:01:57,572
Does it work

32
00:01:58,813 --> 00:02:01,412
Does the patient feel cold when he drinks it?

33
00:02:01,493 --> 00:02:02,812
Yes, yes, yes

34
00:02:04,013 --> 00:02:07,252
This medicine suppresses male physiological conditions

35
00:02:07,453 --> 00:02:08,932
Few people use it

36
00:02:09,413 --> 00:02:10,452
After all

37
00:02:10,453 --> 00:02:13,212
People take pride in masculinity

38
00:02:14,413 --> 00:02:15,732
What man

39
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:17,372
would really drink this

40
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:19,852
Who's the patient

41
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:23,972
Secret

42
00:02:27,493 --> 00:02:29,012
He's a eunuch

43
00:02:29,613 --> 00:02:31,412
Why would he drink this medicine

44
00:02:32,293 --> 00:02:34,172
Is that...

45
00:02:36,493 --> 00:02:37,612
No wonder

46
00:02:39,653 --> 00:02:40,652
What else

47
00:02:41,093 --> 00:02:44,812
I want to know why your illness hasn't improved

48
00:02:45,013 --> 00:02:46,572
I also wonder...

49
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:47,892
Wonder what...

50
00:02:51,853 --> 00:02:53,212
I wonder

51
00:02:53,453 --> 00:02:55,612
if you are really a man

52
00:03:10,813 --> 00:03:12,692
I'll let you know now

53
00:03:13,253 --> 00:03:14,692
if I'm a man

54
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:05,492
Uncle

55
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:06,692
Uncle

56
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:08,452
You must help me

57
00:04:09,253 --> 00:04:12,172
Pei Qianyu has found out the truth of that year

58
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:14,372
He won't let us go

59
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:19,572
Why panic

60
00:04:20,853 --> 00:04:21,932
Sit down

61
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:25,572
He hasn't made a move for so many years

62
00:04:26,373 --> 00:04:28,212
And you lose your nerve

63
00:04:29,213 --> 00:04:30,212
Look at yourself

64
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:32,372
You're the crown prince

65
00:04:32,453 --> 00:04:33,932
How disgraceful

66
00:04:36,093 --> 00:04:36,852
I'm...

67
00:04:38,173 --> 00:04:39,932
I'm no longer the crown prince

68
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:41,732
Father doesn't favor me

69
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:42,852
Even if not

70
00:04:42,853 --> 00:04:44,772
you are still a royal prince

71
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:48,412
You have a noble status

72
00:04:48,973 --> 00:04:51,332
How can you be scared by a mere eunuch

73
00:04:57,653 --> 00:04:58,652
Listen to me

74
00:04:59,453 --> 00:05:00,772
I assure you

75
00:05:00,773 --> 00:05:01,812
The Emperor

76
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,012
will lift your confinement soon

77
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,452
I'll listen to you, Uncle

78
00:05:24,213 --> 00:05:24,892
Come

79
00:05:25,573 --> 00:05:26,492
Let's do this

80
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:27,972
First

81
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:55,292
What did I do

82
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:57,132
last night

83
00:05:58,093 --> 00:06:00,652
He won't think I'm a frivolous woman, right

84
00:06:02,213 --> 00:06:04,412
Should I leave first

85
00:06:33,813 --> 00:06:35,852
Skin soft as white jade draped in a translucent robe.

86
00:06:37,853 --> 00:06:39,772
A silk fan gently shields the dainty cherry lips

87
00:06:41,173 --> 00:06:42,972
Lost in a midday dream of thousands of mountains and rivers

88
00:06:44,893 --> 00:06:46,852
Yet in reality, the moon's shadow by the window shifts but briefly

89
00:06:49,093 --> 00:06:50,492
What are you talking about

90
00:06:52,653 --> 00:06:53,932
Nothing

91
00:06:54,853 --> 00:06:56,852
Just remembering some past events

92
00:06:58,373 --> 00:06:59,612
Pei Qianyu

93
00:07:01,093 --> 00:07:02,132
Do you

94
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:03,772
really like me

95
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:05,292
or

96
00:07:05,653 --> 00:07:07,652
are you just drunk

97
00:07:10,093 --> 00:07:11,532
You care a lot?

98
00:07:13,973 --> 00:07:15,012
don't

99
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:16,492
Forget it

100
00:07:16,493 --> 00:07:17,732
I won't say it

101
00:07:23,773 --> 00:07:25,092
Listen up

102
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:28,452
I'm not a casual person

103
00:07:29,893 --> 00:07:31,492
I like you

104
00:07:32,013 --> 00:07:33,532
I will take responsibility

105
00:07:39,373 --> 00:07:41,092
Then our feelings

106
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:42,532
are mutual

107
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:43,492
Of course

108
00:07:47,773 --> 00:07:50,452
Your hands are no longer cold

109
00:07:54,213 --> 00:07:55,652
Since that's the case

110
00:07:55,653 --> 00:07:57,972
Should I tell him my true identity

111
00:07:59,293 --> 00:08:00,572
Since that's the case

112
00:08:00,973 --> 00:08:03,252
I should tell her my true identity

113
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:05,572
Oh

114
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,212
Why did you tell everyone

115
00:08:09,213 --> 00:08:10,612
you're a eunuch

116
00:08:13,253 --> 00:08:15,172
I had no choice

117
00:08:16,213 --> 00:08:17,532
It's also a secret

118
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:19,612
I've kept

119
00:08:20,373 --> 00:08:21,972
for years

120
00:08:23,093 --> 00:08:23,972
At first

121
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:30,492
What happened

122
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:33,332
I have to go out for a bit

123
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,932
I'll explain when I get back
