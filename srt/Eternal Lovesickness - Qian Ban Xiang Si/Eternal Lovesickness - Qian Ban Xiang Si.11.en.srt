1
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:18,220
Please, sir

2
00:00:19,054 --> 00:00:20,695
Just let me out

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,179
That trick won't work on me

4
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,819
Are you really going to lock me here alone?

5
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,219
It's so dark here

6
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,979
So damp and gloomy

7
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,899
And there are so many bugs

8
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,499
Stop it, eat first

9
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:49,579
I won't eat!

10
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,499
I won't stop!

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,939
I won't eat, I just

12
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,739
If you don't listen

13
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,099
I'll keep you locked up here forever

14
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,899
Then, if I eat all this

15
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,699
Will you let me out?

16
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,539
No

17
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,339
Where did you go that night?

18
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,739
What did you do?

19
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,539
Tell me the truth

20
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,459
And I'll let you out

21
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,099
Well

22
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,779
Didn't I tell you that day

23
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,899
I went out for a walk

24
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,539
Still not willing to tell the truth?

25
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,339
Fine

26
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,819
I won't be home these few days

27
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,499
You just reflect on it here

28
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,499
Damn it

29
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,619
Sir

30
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,179
Miss hasn't eaten for two days

31
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,259
What should we do?

32
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,299
Two days?

33
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,219
In these two days you were not at home

34
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,139
She hasn't eaten anything

35
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,219
She can't go on like this

36
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,579
Sir

37
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,819
Please let her out

38
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,699
I beg you

39
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,539
It's so hot

40
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,179
Father, Mother

41
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,179
I miss you so much

42
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,739
Once I've avenged you

43
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,539
I will return to pay respects

44
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,499
But

45
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,899
It's so hard for me

46
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,739
I can hardly hold on

47
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,099
Father

48
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,939
Mother

49
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,739
She harbors a grudge for her nation's destruction

50
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,499
Naturally, she won't open up to someone from Zhou

51
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,419
I shouldn't have treated her this way

52
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,019
Go get the imperial physician

53
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,059
Say I'm ill

54
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,659
If anyone wants to visit

55
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,619
Refuse them all

56
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,579
Yes

57
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,659
I wanted to let you out after resolving everything

58
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,699
But you just won't listen

59
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,499
And I can't be by your side all the time

60
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,339
What if you really encounter danger?

61
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,739
The Crown Prince is eyeing us

62
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,299
And now I have to call the imperial physician

63
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,659
He will surely become suspicious

64
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,339
I need to find a way

65
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,219
To make him withdraw his troops

66
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,059
This way please

67
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,419
Your Highness

68
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,019
The Chief Eunuch is ill

69
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,059
He needs a physician

70
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,379
I?

71
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,819
That's rare

72
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,699
In all these years

73
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,699
This is the first time I’ve heard the Chief Eunuch is ill

74
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,499
He is a vital minister of our Zhou

75
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,099
I will personally visit him

76
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:21,979
But

77
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,219
You dare stop me?

78
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,779
No need to trouble yourself, Your Highness

79
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,819
If it weren't for you bringing the assassin to my residence

80
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,419
I wouldn't be injured

81
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,739
That's unreasonable

82
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,819
I did it for the security of the capital

83
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,819
Even before the Emperor

84
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,299
I will not shrink from you

85
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,099
Very well

86
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,299
I feel the same

87
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,579
Let His Majesty decide then

88
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,659
Your Majesty, don't be too harsh on the Crown Prince

89
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,659
Speaking of which

90
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,619
It's the cunning of the assassin

91
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,499
Hiding for days

92
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,059
And chose his moment to strike

93
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,579
when he was desperate

94
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,979
But unfortunately

95
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,499
The assassin got away

96
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,539
Chief Eunuch, did you see the assassin's face?

97
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,539
Where did the assassin flee to?

98
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,899
You still have the nerve to ask?

99
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,979
With so many men to capture the assassin

100
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,499
Not only did you fail

101
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,939
But you let him continue to attack the Chief Eunuch

102
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,259
What kind of head of the Ministry of Military is that?

103
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,939
It's all my fault

104
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,499
Father

105
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,139
Please calm your anger

106
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,099
Withdraw your troops

107
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,499
Do not disturb the Chief Eunuch's rest

108
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,379
Yes

109
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,219
I will obey

110
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,619
Pei Qianyu

111
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,259
I really underestimated you
