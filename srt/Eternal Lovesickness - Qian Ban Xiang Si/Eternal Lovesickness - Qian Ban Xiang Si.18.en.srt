1
00:00:18,902 --> 00:00:19,501
Chief Eunuch

2
00:00:19,622 --> 00:00:20,701
You finally arrived

3
00:00:20,902 --> 00:00:22,141
The Emperor summons you inside

4
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:24,021
I don't know the specifics

5
00:00:26,302 --> 00:00:26,941
Got it

6
00:00:27,502 --> 00:00:28,341
Wait here

7
00:00:37,902 --> 00:00:38,701
No need for formalities

8
00:00:39,782 --> 00:00:42,141
I summoned you today to discuss a matter

9
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:43,421
Yes

10
00:00:45,222 --> 00:00:46,421
I heard from Prince North

11
00:00:46,902 --> 00:00:48,581
that Xuanhe is very ill

12
00:00:50,062 --> 00:00:50,821
Your Majesty

13
00:00:51,462 --> 00:00:52,661
I have seen him

14
00:00:52,982 --> 00:00:54,781
He's been bedridden for more than half a month

15
00:00:55,102 --> 00:00:55,981
He's deeply regretted

16
00:00:55,982 --> 00:00:58,701
his past actions that disappointed you

17
00:00:59,222 --> 00:01:00,101
So

18
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,461
he has worried himself sick

19
00:01:02,502 --> 00:01:05,301
Xuanhe grew up under my watch

20
00:01:05,942 --> 00:01:07,501
His character isn't bad

21
00:01:07,782 --> 00:01:09,261
but he's indecisive

22
00:01:10,062 --> 00:01:11,221
and needs more tempering

23
00:01:12,102 --> 00:01:16,021
I think he's learned his lesson this time

24
00:01:16,582 --> 00:01:18,341
Let's lift his confinement

25
00:01:23,022 --> 00:01:24,501
Your Majesty's parental love

26
00:01:24,502 --> 00:01:26,061
is exemplary for us all

27
00:01:30,662 --> 00:01:32,941
This matter also involves the Chief Eunuch

28
00:01:33,782 --> 00:01:34,821
What do you think

29
00:01:37,462 --> 00:01:38,541
It's wise of you, Your Majesty

30
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,341
I have no objections

31
00:01:43,462 --> 00:01:45,501
You are truly understanding

32
00:01:46,302 --> 00:01:47,661
Then it is decided

33
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:50,021
Prince North

34
00:01:50,502 --> 00:01:51,701
Xuanhe is your nephew

35
00:01:52,462 --> 00:01:53,781
Go on my behalf

36
00:01:54,902 --> 00:01:56,101
Bring some gifts

37
00:01:56,262 --> 00:01:58,461
and convey my decree

38
00:01:59,062 --> 00:02:00,781
Tell him to rest and recover

39
00:02:02,342 --> 00:02:03,141
Yes

40
00:02:16,622 --> 00:02:18,821
An elephant doesn't need to bite an ant

41
00:02:19,782 --> 00:02:22,341
just step on it lightly

42
00:02:24,462 --> 00:02:25,981
I am waiting for you

43
00:02:27,782 --> 00:02:29,461
to walk into the trap

44
00:02:31,622 --> 00:02:33,301
You're right

45
00:02:33,702 --> 00:02:36,901
But you are the mayfly at the mercy of others

46
00:02:37,502 --> 00:02:40,221
I will soon ascend to that position

47
00:02:40,582 --> 00:02:45,581
Then I'll see how you beg for mercy

48
00:03:28,502 --> 00:03:29,501
Miss

49
00:03:29,782 --> 00:03:31,261
Why is your face so red

50
00:03:31,902 --> 00:03:32,741
I...

51
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,181
Did you have a good dream

52
00:03:38,782 --> 00:03:40,461
No, I didn't

53
00:03:57,702 --> 00:03:59,701
Miss, where are you going

54
00:04:04,382 --> 00:04:05,501
Why are you in such a hurry

55
00:04:06,502 --> 00:04:07,701
You're back

56
00:04:10,582 --> 00:04:11,461
Where are you going

57
00:04:11,462 --> 00:04:12,621
I'm going out to handle something

58
00:04:12,782 --> 00:04:13,621
I'll be right back

59
00:04:14,102 --> 00:04:16,061
Miss, Miss

60
00:04:16,062 --> 00:04:18,421
Be careful, it's dangerous

61
00:04:20,062 --> 00:04:21,261
What danger

62
00:04:21,622 --> 00:04:22,741
A dart suddenly shot

63
00:04:22,742 --> 00:04:24,261
in the house just now

64
00:04:24,262 --> 00:04:25,581
Miss saw the note on the dart

65
00:04:25,582 --> 00:04:26,741
and ran out

66
00:04:26,942 --> 00:04:27,941
I'm worried

67
00:04:48,262 --> 00:04:49,021
Who are you

68
00:04:49,262 --> 00:04:50,341
How do you know about the assassination

69
00:04:50,342 --> 00:04:51,501
of the Jiang envoy

70
00:04:57,262 --> 00:04:58,581
Of course I know

71
00:05:00,502 --> 00:05:01,901
It's your

72
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,141
What are you up to

73
00:05:03,982 --> 00:05:05,621
I just want to tell you the truth

74
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,501
These days

75
00:05:07,942 --> 00:05:09,621
I have discovered many things

76
00:05:11,022 --> 00:05:12,421
All this time

77
00:05:13,142 --> 00:05:15,301
you were kept in the dark

78
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:19,141
The person who suggested taking advantage of

79
00:05:19,502 --> 00:05:21,661
the marriage alliance with Jiang to destroy Jiang

80
00:05:22,582 --> 00:05:25,621
and the one who killed the entire Jiang envoy

81
00:05:26,142 --> 00:05:27,621
was Pei Qianyu

82
00:05:29,022 --> 00:05:30,741
He even went to Jiang

83
00:05:31,382 --> 00:05:33,021
three years ago

84
00:05:33,342 --> 00:05:35,701
to survey the terrain

85
00:05:36,142 --> 00:05:38,501
for future war preparations

86
00:05:38,742 --> 00:05:39,741
I don't believe you

87
00:05:39,742 --> 00:05:41,501
He's just a small eunuch

88
00:05:41,622 --> 00:05:42,781
He saved the Emperor Zhou

89
00:05:43,222 --> 00:05:45,341
and was rewarded with a residence in the Capital

90
00:05:45,622 --> 00:05:46,941
How could he influence anything

91
00:05:47,702 --> 00:05:50,261
Pei Qianyu is no small eunuch

92
00:05:51,022 --> 00:05:53,341
He is the Chief Eunuch of Zhou

93
00:05:53,822 --> 00:05:55,221
Chief Eunuch?

94
00:05:55,662 --> 00:05:56,781
What is it

95
00:05:56,942 --> 00:06:00,261
The Chief Eunuch holds the power to wield the emperor's seal

96
00:06:00,622 --> 00:06:03,261
He not only planned the whole thing

97
00:06:03,302 --> 00:06:04,381
but

98
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:06,061
he also knew

99
00:06:06,782 --> 00:06:08,781
that you are the princess of Jiang

100
00:06:10,142 --> 00:06:11,661
The reason he didn't kill you

101
00:06:12,262 --> 00:06:15,021
is because he still had use for you

102
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,501
I'm just a princess of a fallen kingdom

103
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,621
What use could I be to him

104
00:06:19,022 --> 00:06:20,661
Besides, he saved me

105
00:06:20,662 --> 00:06:22,941
A princess of a fallen kingdom is still a princess

106
00:06:23,022 --> 00:06:25,781
In critical times, you have the power to rally people

107
00:06:27,022 --> 00:06:27,941
Saving you

108
00:06:27,942 --> 00:06:30,821
was just to use you better

109
00:06:32,262 --> 00:06:33,341
Why do you think

110
00:06:33,702 --> 00:06:36,701
it was easy for you to assassinate those generals

111
00:06:37,782 --> 00:06:40,621
That's because those were also his targets

112
00:06:41,062 --> 00:06:43,341
But don't think you can assassinate the Emperor

113
00:06:43,902 --> 00:06:45,941
because he has use for the Emperor

114
00:06:46,222 --> 00:06:48,701
He won't let you succeed

115
00:06:50,822 --> 00:06:52,021
That's not true.

116
00:06:52,142 --> 00:06:53,501
Why should believe you

117
00:06:55,102 --> 00:06:55,821
If you don't

118
00:06:57,022 --> 00:06:59,061
you can go to the palace tomorrow night

119
00:06:59,142 --> 00:06:59,901
I'll have my uncle

120
00:06:59,902 --> 00:07:01,621
remove a section of the guards

121
00:07:02,262 --> 00:07:03,781
Try to assassinate the Emperor

122
00:07:05,222 --> 00:07:07,101
Then you'll see clearly

123
00:07:07,902 --> 00:07:09,021
who

124
00:07:09,502 --> 00:07:10,661
stops you

125
00:07:45,982 --> 00:07:47,181
Lee, you're back

126
00:07:48,222 --> 00:07:49,381
I have something to tell you

127
00:07:50,702 --> 00:07:51,741
But I'm tired

128
00:07:53,062 --> 00:07:54,501
I'll take you to your room to rest

129
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,341
But last night I

130
00:08:25,502 --> 00:08:26,701
made you uncomfortable

131
00:08:40,622 --> 00:08:41,781
Are you homesick

132
00:08:49,422 --> 00:08:50,581
Would you lie to me

133
00:08:54,382 --> 00:08:55,541
What happened

134
00:08:56,942 --> 00:08:58,101
Why are you saying this suddenly

135
00:08:59,742 --> 00:09:01,021
You treat me so well

136
00:09:01,502 --> 00:09:03,021
you wouldn't lie to me

137
00:09:03,622 --> 00:09:04,421
right

138
00:09:07,182 --> 00:09:08,141
Do you know

139
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:10,501
Last night I felt for the first time

140
00:09:11,262 --> 00:09:12,661
I had armor

141
00:09:14,582 --> 00:09:16,421
You are my armor

142
00:09:17,822 --> 00:09:19,901
I feel so happy

143
00:09:21,502 --> 00:09:22,821
But also fearful

144
00:09:23,702 --> 00:09:25,701
I'm afraid that this happiness is just a dream

145
00:09:28,582 --> 00:09:29,701
that will shatter

146
00:09:30,582 --> 00:09:31,701
with a touch

147
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,101
It's not a dream

148
00:09:38,422 --> 00:09:39,541
In this life

149
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:41,941
I am yours alone

150
00:09:44,022 --> 00:09:45,061
Even if it's a dream

151
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:48,501
I want to stay in it a little longer

152
00:09:55,782 --> 00:09:56,781
Don't say anything

153
00:09:57,822 --> 00:09:59,781
I just want to hold you quietly

154
00:10:12,702 --> 00:10:15,581
The Chief Eunuch holds the power to wield the emperor's seal

155
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,621
He not only planned the whole thing

156
00:10:20,462 --> 00:10:21,661
he also knew

157
00:10:22,582 --> 00:10:24,501
that you are the princess of Jiang

158
00:10:25,942 --> 00:10:27,301
The reason he didn't kill you

159
00:10:27,942 --> 00:10:30,501
is because he still had use for you
