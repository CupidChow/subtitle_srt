1
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:04,489
Sir

2
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,209
These three died the same way

3
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,049
all with a single sword piercing the heart

4
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,089
The shape of the wound, the force used

5
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,249
and the position of the sword edge

6
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,209
are all identical

7
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:15,489
It's evident

8
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,209
the same person did it

9
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,169
Got it.

10
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:24,409
These three people

11
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,489
were all officials appointed by the Chief Eunuch

12
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,289
Sir

13
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,849
The court officials you appointed

14
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,409
are now dead like this

15
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,089
What should we do

16
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,929
It seems some people can't wait

17
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,089
They're in such a hurry to sell positions

18
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,489
They must be trying to cover up their deficits

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,649
Corruption cases are definitely connected to them

20
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,889
Investigate secretly

21
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,569
And start with General Cao Duo

22
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,609
Yes

23
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,289
The next one

24
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,209
Could it be General Li

25
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:43,489
You make such progress

26
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,529
in such a short time

27
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,969
You're truly a promising young talent

28
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,209
Can I assassinate Emperor Zhou now

29
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:51,969
No rush

30
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,249
Grand Zhou has not only Emperor Zhou

31
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,449
but a slew of bloodthirsty generals

32
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:57,929
Over the years

33
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,609
they have waged wars everywhere

34
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,049
leading to widespread suffering

35
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,769
They deserve to die, too

36
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,409
Indeed they do

37
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,329
You can go kill them

38
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,529
You've trained for so long

39
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,009
It's time to test yourself

40
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,409
Remember

41
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,209
Be swift

42
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,369
Be ruthless

43
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:26,969
And be decisive

44
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,649
Most importantly

45
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,409
I should make them like me

46
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,809
Take his 'life

47
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,569
while he's entranced

48
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:02,729
Sir

49
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,289
have you ordered a bottle of aquavit

50
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,609
Yes

51
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,969
May I have the honor

52
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,769
of drinking with you

53
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,209
Who are you

54
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,049
I don't recall ordering any wine

55
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:51,289
Someone hired me to give you a good time

56
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,689
Is there such a good thing

57
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,089
A man as heroic and wise as you

58
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,689
naturally attracts many admirers

59
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:00,529
Sir

60
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,049
Just enjoy yourself

61
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,849
What are you doing, sir

62
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,409
Confess. Who sent you

63
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,209
Otherwise...

64
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,929
I'll tell, I'll tell

65
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,889
Sir, let me catch my breath first

66
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,409
You won't escape my grasp

67
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,009
Where did you go today

68
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,849
I just left the mansion for a stroll

69
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,409
From now on, without my permission

70
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,209
you're not allowed to leave

71
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,329
It's too dangerous outside

72
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,329
Why

73
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,409
You previously promised I could leave the mansion

74
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,409
I've changed my mind

75
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,649
As my maid

76
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,169
it's improper for you

77
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,409
to be out in public

78
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,209
That won't do

79
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,409
At worst, I just won't be your maid

80
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,849
You don't want to keep me anyway

81
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:48,809
No way

82
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,769
If she acts like this

83
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,369
she will get into trouble sooner or later

84
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:54,929
It's better to keep her by my side

85
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,369
Weren't you always trying to send me away

86
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,609
Actually, I don't want to burden you

87
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,569
I have a good friend in the Capital

88
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,089
I can go to her

89
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,689
Do you remember what you said

90
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:11,649
to stay here

91
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,729
My name is Lee

92
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,489
You saved me yesterday

93
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,729
I have no way to repay you

94
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,849
So I'm willing to give myself to you

95
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:23,249
Just please let me stay in the mansion

96
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,929
You said you would give yourself to me

97
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,929
you have to follow through

98
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,609
Leaving

99
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,329
is impossible

100
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,289
That was just a temporary measure

101
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,569
What I decide to do

102
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,409
I must do it

103
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,529
From now on, you're my girl

104
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,689
In that case

105
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,089
You can only have me

106
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,569
in your heart

107
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,649
and in your eyes

108
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,049
Understand

109
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:13,849
What

110
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,169
You always do whatever you want

111
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,249
I'm not an object

112
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,209
for you to pick and choose

113
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,649
So you still want to leave?

114
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,169
Leaving is not an option

115
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,929
The person I've decided on

116
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,609
It's for life

117
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,929
Even if I have to beg

118
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,209
I will keep you by my side

119
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,809
You're truly crazy
