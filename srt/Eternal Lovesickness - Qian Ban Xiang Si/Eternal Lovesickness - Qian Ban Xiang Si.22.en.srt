1
00:00:15,198 --> 00:00:16,158
I'll kill you

2
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,936
It's uncertain who will kill whom

3
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:29,409
You...

4
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:30,969
The deposed Crown Prince ordered me to kill you

5
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:33,929
Listen to me

6
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,209
You'll be fine

7
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:40,849
You

8
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:45,969
You...

9
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,249
I...

10
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,369
I have seen your head

11
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:51,689
What you saw

12
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:55,249
was just the head of a death row prisoner with a disguise

13
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,369
The Third Prince has long since left the secret chamber

14
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:00,729
The one I killed

15
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,329
was just a death row prisoner

16
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,929
That's how I gained your trust

17
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,729
and participated in your rebellion

18
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:10,809
You traitor

19
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,009
What else do you have to say

20
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:15,729
33

21
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:19,089
Father

22
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,649
I failed in my plan

23
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:29,889
I admit it

24
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,689
But Father

25
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,649
Do you know that one in this hall

26
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,889
is a Princess of Jiang who wants to kill you

27
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,689
And the other

28
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:56,209
is the sole survivor of a family you executed

29
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,529
How can they be kind to you?

30
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,529
You still want to turn the tables with your words

31
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,809
Do you really think His Majesty is old and foolish

32
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,489
Take this traitor

33
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:12,569
Father

34
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:13,929
and Prince North

35
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,289
in death row

36
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,969
and await further orders

37
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,449
Yes

38
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:18,769
Father

39
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,249
Father, I am your own son

40
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,129
Father

41
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,569
They are the ones with rebellious intentions

42
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,529
Father

43
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:27,569
Father

44
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,929
Father

45
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,889
The matter that weighed on my heart

46
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,729
is finally over

47
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,289
I'm really getting old

48
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,289
*Your Majesty

49
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,689
There's one more thing I'd like to report

50
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:06,889
Speak

51
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:11,849
Back then, the Pei family was executed for treason

52
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,489
All the evidence

53
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,409
was just a few impeachment memorials

54
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,609
and some forged letters by Cao Duo

55
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,889
The handwriting in those letters was vastly different from my father's

56
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,489
Yet Your Majesty

57
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,289
you chose to believe them easily

58
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,769
and executed the entire Pei family

59
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,089
without further investigation

60
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:40,929
You...

61
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,329
I should never have trusted you

62
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,129
Back then, I spared your life

63
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,609
even gave you a high position

64
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,769
I never expected you to harbor ulterior motives

65
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,409
and even want to overturn the case for a traitor

66
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,449
I want to overturn the case of course

67
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,209
The Pei family has been loyal for generations

68
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,649
Just because they blocked some people's path

69
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,729
Just because their power challenged your authority

70
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,889
They had to be humiliated

71
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,009
had to be wronged

72
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:19,529
and had to have hundreds of members die in vain

73
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,009
demand justice

74
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,529
The third

75
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:28,729
Arrest him

76
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,809
He's gone mad

77
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,449
He dares to demand justice from me

78
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,769
I also want justice from you

79
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,529
Who are you

80
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,529
I came for a peace marriage between our two nations

81
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,289
Yet you tore up the contract

82
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,369
You took advantage of Jiang's vulnerability

83
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,369
You destroyed my country

84
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,009
and killed my family

85
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,409
You kept this news from spreading

86
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,449
You ordered the former Crown Prince

87
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,609
to have the Jiang envoy killed

88
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:02,889
Aren't you afraid

89
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,649
of being ridiculed by the world

90
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,409
You all

91
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:14,889
The third

92
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,649
Arrest them

93
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,489
I don't want to

94
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,729
I dare not coerce you

95
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,289
But I also hope

96
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,649
you can overturn the case

97
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,809
and clear the Pei family's name

98
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,329
Traitor

99
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,569
As long as I am alive

100
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,529
and I have a breath

101
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,289
I will never agree

102
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:54,929
Father

103
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:06,689
7

104
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:13,929
It's cold up high

105
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,689
Don't catch a chill

106
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,449
I miss home

107
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,529
In Jiang, there are endless flowers

108
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,409
and endless fruits

109
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,569
We have the Flower God Festival

110
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,569
Water Worship Festival and Torch Festival

111
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,249
Every celebration goes on all night long

112
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,369
We're all together

113
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,689
drinking and dancing

114
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,369
It's really fun

115
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,609
When things are done

116
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,209
I'll go back to Jiang with you

117
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:50,889
Really

118
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,009
You really want to go back to Jiang with me

119
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,649
Of course

120
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,649
In life, I am your man

121
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,529
In death, I am your ghost

122
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,889
Just the first part

123
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,009
Alright, alright

124
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,849
In life, I am your man

125
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,529
In this life

126
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,049
I am all yours

127
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,329
What do you think

128
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,089
Emperor Zhou will do to us

129
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,529
Will he let us go

130
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,289
No matter what he wants to do

131
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:43,409
I won't let him hurt you

132
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,809
Your Highness

133
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,369
Thank you, Your Highness

134
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,649
I am from Jiang

135
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,769
You specially invited me here

136
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,249
to assist the princess

137
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,369
There's no need to be so polite between you and me

138
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:26,769
Miss Ji

139
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,129
I searched the Crown Prince's residence

140
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,329
I couldn't find the antidote to strychnine

141
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,089
But

142
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,569
I found a prescription in the secret chamber

143
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,929
that can ease the pain

144
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,809
Take it

145
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,049
I had a doctor look at this prescription

146
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,289
It's harmless

147
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,089
Miss Ji

148
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,369
You can rest assured

149
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,649
You give it to me so easily

150
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,449
Don't you want me to do something

151
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,009
Kill someone for you?

152
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,929
Miss Ji, you jest

153
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,009
You are a guest from another country

154
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,569
How could I use you

155
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,529
You don't need to do anything for me

156
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,529
I sincerely wish you well

157
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,729
I have met many men

158
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:21,809
But you

159
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,729
are the first one

160
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,529
who wants nothing

161
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:29,969
Thank you
