1
00:01:02,134 --> 00:01:02,773
You

2
00:01:03,614 --> 00:01:04,333
Don't make noise

3
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:07,693
Stay quiet with me

4
00:01:12,334 --> 00:01:14,813
If not for that being your wife

5
00:01:14,814 --> 00:01:16,933
Is the best disguise I could think of

6
00:01:17,774 --> 00:01:18,893
I wouldn't care about you

7
00:01:29,134 --> 00:01:30,133
But

8
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:32,653
You do look good

9
00:02:29,014 --> 00:02:29,813
Lee

10
00:02:31,814 --> 00:02:33,213
You shouldn't have stayed

11
00:02:48,854 --> 00:02:50,053
What happened?

12
00:02:52,334 --> 00:02:53,333
I am incompetent

13
00:02:54,254 --> 00:02:56,933
The 25 people we wanted to place in the government

14
00:02:57,854 --> 00:02:59,533
All were rejected by the Chief Eunuch

15
00:03:02,614 --> 00:03:04,093
This Pei Qianyu

16
00:03:05,334 --> 00:03:08,453
Is really becoming more and more dismissive of me

17
00:03:13,454 --> 00:03:14,053
Your Highness

18
00:03:14,974 --> 00:03:16,853
These official positions were sold

19
00:03:17,214 --> 00:03:19,133
And half of the silver hasn't been collected yet

20
00:03:19,654 --> 00:03:20,213
If

21
00:03:21,574 --> 00:03:22,733
If His Majesty returns to the capital

22
00:03:22,734 --> 00:03:24,213
And finds the treasury not replenished

23
00:03:24,214 --> 00:03:25,373
It might be troublesome

24
00:03:26,894 --> 00:03:28,413
I beg for your forgiveness

25
00:03:29,534 --> 00:03:30,333
Get out

26
00:03:35,134 --> 00:03:35,853
I got it

27
00:03:36,734 --> 00:03:37,773
You can go back now

28
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,293
Tomorrow I'll personally visit the Directorate of Protocol

29
00:03:43,374 --> 00:03:46,413
To meet this Pei Qianyu

30
00:04:43,374 --> 00:04:44,373
Get up

31
00:04:45,934 --> 00:04:48,973
Let's pretend last night never happened

32
00:04:51,974 --> 00:04:53,733
I only took care of you

33
00:04:53,734 --> 00:04:54,613
because you caught a chill

34
00:04:55,054 --> 00:04:56,653
Why are you like this?

35
00:04:56,814 --> 00:04:58,053
So heartless

36
00:05:01,574 --> 00:05:02,533
Stay away from me from now on

37
00:05:05,814 --> 00:05:07,733
May I go out for a walk?

38
00:05:14,454 --> 00:05:14,933
Whatever

39
00:05:16,974 --> 00:05:18,333
So fierce

40
00:05:19,814 --> 00:05:20,413
Forget it

41
00:05:21,214 --> 00:05:22,173
I don't care about him

42
00:05:23,814 --> 00:05:26,533
I need to find an opportunity to reach the Buddha Pavilion

43
00:05:39,574 --> 00:05:40,053
Sir

44
00:05:40,614 --> 00:05:41,333
Our people

45
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:42,333
Have already followed Miss Lee

46
00:05:44,414 --> 00:05:45,813
Protect her secretly

47
00:05:46,774 --> 00:05:47,773
Where she goes

48
00:05:48,254 --> 00:05:49,253
Who she meets

49
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:50,893
What she does

50
00:05:51,854 --> 00:05:52,893
Report to me at any time

51
00:05:54,174 --> 00:05:54,773
Yes

52
00:06:20,334 --> 00:06:22,453
Master, there's a young lady outside looking for you

53
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,493
It seems my Buddha Pavilion

54
00:06:29,854 --> 00:06:31,373
Really has fallen on hard times

55
00:06:32,454 --> 00:06:34,293
That just anyone comes'

56
00:06:35,814 --> 00:06:37,333
Must be reported to me

57
00:06:37,934 --> 00:06:40,213
Master, I dare not disturb you

58
00:06:40,494 --> 00:06:41,973
But she brought a jade pendant

59
00:06:42,254 --> 00:06:44,333
Said she's an old acquaintance of yours

60
00:06:44,334 --> 00:06:46,013
And you'll know once you see it.

61
00:06:57,934 --> 00:06:58,893
Bring her in

62
00:06:59,214 --> 00:06:59,733
Yes

63
00:07:04,254 --> 00:07:05,773
You going to spy on Zhou

64
00:07:06,214 --> 00:07:07,973
must always remember your mission

65
00:07:08,774 --> 00:07:10,053
While the mission is important

66
00:07:10,454 --> 00:07:12,373
Your lives are more valuable

67
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:15,453
I don't insist that you must send messages

68
00:07:15,934 --> 00:07:17,053
Only that you return safely

69
00:07:17,734 --> 00:07:19,333
Don't forget your home land and loved ones

70
00:07:25,734 --> 00:07:26,893
The path you're takingן'.

71
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:28,413
Is very dangerous

72
00:07:29,094 --> 00:07:30,253
I'm not afraid of danger

73
00:07:31,574 --> 00:07:33,213
Now that Jiang Country

74
00:07:33,214 --> 00:07:34,933
Is a subordinate to Zhou

75
00:07:36,254 --> 00:07:37,293
Your identity

76
00:07:37,734 --> 00:07:38,853
Must be kept secret

77
00:07:40,174 --> 00:07:41,093
If it leaks...

78
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:42,653
I understand

79
00:07:44,454 --> 00:07:46,093
I'm at the Buddha Pavilion every day

80
00:07:46,574 --> 00:07:48,613
You can visit whenever you have time

81
00:07:49,654 --> 00:07:50,813
My Buddha Pavilion

82
00:07:51,374 --> 00:07:53,093
Doesn't rely on martial skills

83
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,293
Then what does it rely on?

84
00:07:59,454 --> 00:08:02,173
You'll find out in time

85
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,453
By the way

86
00:08:05,814 --> 00:08:06,693
Your priority

87
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:09,653
Is to find a cover identity

88
00:08:10,254 --> 00:08:11,733
To facilitate your actions

89
00:08:12,854 --> 00:08:15,533
Do you know anyone in Zhou?

90
00:08:29,934 --> 00:08:31,373
Actually, there is someone suitable

91
00:08:42,134 --> 00:08:42,933
Father

92
00:08:43,974 --> 00:08:44,533
Mother

93
00:08:45,534 --> 00:08:46,613
I have found evidence

94
00:08:47,574 --> 00:08:49,053
about the past

95
00:08:51,534 --> 00:08:52,653
In my lifetime

96
00:08:54,054 --> 00:08:55,613
I will definitely let His Majesty

97
00:08:57,174 --> 00:08:58,293
clear our Pei family's name
