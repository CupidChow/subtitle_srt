5
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:47,130
I wanted to give you a surprise.

6
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,800
I didn't expect to bump into you.

7
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,900
I chose all the flowers in the yard

8
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,759
for you.

9
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,860
Do you like it?

Zijin.

11
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,830
Did you hear the rumors

12
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,150
about Li Xiangyi?

13
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,990
They're just rumors.

14
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,560
But about him,

15
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,780
you're always especially nervous.

16
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,580
I've checked.

17
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,590
Those rumors were spread on purpose.

18
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,510
Are you suspecting me?

19
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,130
I no longer have any feelings for Xiangyi.

20
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,620
He's just a friend.

21
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,120
In the past ten years,

22
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,180
you were the only one by my side.

23

Why don't you trust me?

24
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,870
When I became in charge of Sigu Sect,

25
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,630
you never once helped me with the discussions.

26
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,090
But as soon as the rumors about Li Xiangyi spread,

27
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,550
you rushed to question me.

28
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,090
You don't have romantic feelings for him,

29
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,020
but your feelings for him are true.

30
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,010
I never joined your discussions

31
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,130
because it's your first time being in charge of Sigu Sect.

32
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,530
I'm a senior in Sigu Sect.

33
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,390
If I were here, I was afraid I'd be in your way.

34
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,740
How could you be such a petty...

35
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,450
A petty man?

36
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,700
He founded Sigu Sect,

37
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,170
and I rebuilt Sigu Sect.

38
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,100
He's a Sect Leader.

39
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,360
I'm also a Sect Leader.

40
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,260
I don't understand

41
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,220
why I'm always inferior to him

We need to calm down.

What do you mean?

48
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,310
I thought you took over Sigu Sect

49
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,300
just to bring peace back to the martial world.

50
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,130
But I didn't expect

51

that you only wanted a war trophy.

52

54

You said I couldn't let him go.

These calligraphy paintings are all painted by famous martial artists.

73

These martial artists' paintings

Liu Rujing.

173
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,370
Liu Rujing?

174
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,820
You're an ordinary member of the Cao Gang.

175
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,320
Today, you're judging

176
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,040
great heroes like Li Xiangyi and Shan Gudao.

177
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,260
If you dare to talk nonsense again,

178
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,960
I'll hook your tongue out to make dried sausage.

179
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,670
The one with the surname Liu, what did you say?

180
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,020
Senior Liu, there's no need to fight.

181
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,530
Let's convince them with logic.

182
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,020
Liu Jiangchuan, Jiang Hua and Xu Yi.

183
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,190
You three have gambling debts of hundreds of taels.

184
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,180
How dare you come to the Sigu Tea Party?

185
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,460
How shameless.

186
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:52,980
Who are you?

187
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,840
A detective from Baichuan Court

188
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,370
and Li Xiangyi's disciple,

189
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,230
Fang Duobing.

190
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,820
Well said.

191
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,310
You can't trust gamblers and thieves.

192
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,230
But what about me?

193
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,150
He Zhang?

194
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,300
As the head of Four Tigers with Silver Spears,

195
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,430
I should be trustworthy, right?

196
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,620
Kid.

197
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,530
Just now, you sought justice for Li Xiangyi.

198
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,310
You should recognize his handwriting.

199
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,410
This letter is a secret order from Li Xiangyi.

200
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,330
The letter ordered Shan Gudao to travel to Yangsha Valley alone.

201
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,680
That Yangsha Valley

202
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,150
is Jinyuan Alliance's secret sanctuary.

203
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,130
That's why Shan Gudao was besieged and killed by the four kings.

204
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,280
[Something is off with Jinyuan Alliance.
You should go to Yangsha Valley immediately.
I'm also rushing there to meet you.]

205
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,280
[Xiangyi]

206
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,570
Since it's a secret,

207
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,220
how would my master know?

208
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,680
It's just a coincidence.

209
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,800
I told Li Xiangyi this myself.

210
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,620
If he didn't mean to harm me,

211
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,390
he wouldn't have let Shan Gudao go there to die.

212
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,050
You want to frame Li Xiangyi with this alone?

213
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,220
Master He sure is talking nonsense.

214
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,400
I have more evidence.

215
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,820
Sect Leader Xiao.

216
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,530
May I ask

217
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,970
where the Bluestone Chessboard of Shan Gudao's courtyard

218
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,250
is at now?

219
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,420
It's still sealed in its original form in his room.

220
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,590
Please send someone to carry it here.

221
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,820
Minghuang Jinyun? It's a letter from the imperial court.

222
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,580
This is a letter from the imperial court?

223
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,330
Yes.

224
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,900
It's a letter from the imperial court.

225
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,920
Back then, Li Xiangyi refused the incorporation of the court,

226
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,520
so the court wrote a secret letter to Shan Gudao

227
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,840
to get him to replace Li Xiangyi's position

228
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,880
and become the leader of the Sigu Sect.

229
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,060
Of course Sect Leader Shan didn't agree.

230
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,190
So he sealed this envelope in the Bluestone Chessboard.

231
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,950
But this kind of thing naturally couldn't be hidden from Li Xiangyi.

232
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,150
So he came up with a plan to kill two birds with one stone.

233
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,290
Li Xiangyi had long wanted to break

234
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,380
the agreement with Jinyuan Alliance

235
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,870
and unify the world.

236
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,490
But he is the leader of an orthodox sect.

237
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,180
It was inappropriate for him to initiate the battle.

238
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,570
So he sent Sect Leader Shan to die

239
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,200
and used it as an excuse to attack Jinyuan Alliance

240
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,510
in order to destroy it.

241
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,020
If his plan succeeded,

242
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,160
the two troubles in his heart would have been solved together.

243
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,700
Unfortunately for him,

244
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,100
God isn't blind.

245
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,280
The human will cannot defy God's will.

246
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,480
Liu Rujing.

247
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:44,970
Let me ask you.

248
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,830
That night, when Sect Leader Shan went to Luoyan Ridge,

249
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,960
we were both on duty in the courtyard.

250
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,140
Have you heard

251
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,320
about the dispute between him and Li Xiangyi?

252
00:11:58,950 --> 00:11:59,500
What?

253
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,890
You don't dare to say it now?

254
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,570
What do I have to be afraid of?

255
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,010
I did hear them

256
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,180
arguing about the matter of the imperial court.

257
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:13,710
Xiangyi.

258
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,680
Do you think

259
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,700
what you say is always right

260
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,500
and the truth,

261
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,260
and that Sigu Sect can't survive without you?

262
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,710
Yes.

263
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,420
You can lose anyone in the Sect

264
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,290
except Li Xiangyi.

265
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,200
I'd been silent for ten years

266
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,080
because Li Xiangyi is too famous

267
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,970
and I had nowhere to seek justice.

268
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,710
Taking the chance of today's Sigu Tea Party,

269
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,410
I request that you

270
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,480
move Li Xiangyi’s memorial tablet out of the Heroes Hall of Fame.

271
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,440
How dare you!

272
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,600
Why not?

273
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,910
If he dared to kill his senior,

274
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,220
then I'd dare to let his stinky reputation be known throughout the martial world.

275
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,240
I want Li Xiangyi out of the Heroes Hall of Fame!

276
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,170
Get out of the Heroes Hall of Fame!

277
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,420
Get out of the Heroes Hall of Fame!

278
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,620
Whoever dares to touch Sect Leader's memorial tablet,

279
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,820
I'll kill you.

280
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,100
A bunch of thugs.

281
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,220
Sigu Sect was built by Li Xiangyi.

282
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,150
Let's see who dares to mess around!

283
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,170
How dare you!

284
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,080
What kind of place do you think this is?

285
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,060
Although Sigu Sect was rebuilt,

286
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,410
I had already bought this place ten years ago.

287
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:44,340
It's a part of the private mansion of my Mumian Villa.

288
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,360
I didn't invite you all...

289
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,580
nor did I agree to lend it to Sect Leader Xiao.

290
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,390
If you are here for a cup of tea,

291
00:13:58,730 --> 00:13:59,530
I welcome you.

292
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,080
But if you humiliate your former Sect Leader here,

293
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,170
don't blame me for ordering you to leave.

294
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,420
Sorry, everyone.

295
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,450
Let's go.

296
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,960
Let's go.

297
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,190
He Zhang.

298
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,320
What a coincidence that you came at this time.

299
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,580
Miss Qiao.

300
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,680
You're the one that's late.

301
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,740
Mr. Fang.

302
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,680
This matter is very complicated.

303
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,820
It's not exactly like what they said.

304
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,420
Of course,

305
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,550
I have always trusted Li Xiangyi.

306
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,150
Thank you for today, Miss Qiao.

307
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:48,930
I'll take my leave.

308
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,420
Did you arrange all this?

309
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,220
What are you talking about?

310
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,420
This chessboard was long gone from Shan Gudao's room.

311
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,290
[To Shan Gudao]

312
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,480
Did you specially get it out?

313
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,570
Yes.

314
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,670
In order to smear him,

315
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,300
you actually went this far.

316
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,360
I just threw the bait

317
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,890
and so many people came to back it up.

318
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,600
There are so many people in the world who hate Li Xiangyi.

319
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,800
Is that also my fault?

320
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,210
I thought you just need some time

321
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,290
to let it go.

322
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:37,710
I was wrong.

323
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,720
About our wedding...

324
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,260
Let's forget it.

325
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,910
You can't live the rest of your life

326
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,910
with this emotional knot.

327
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,150
Mian.

328
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,620
It's not some top-notch tea.

329
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,690
Drink some to quench your thirst.

330
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,040
I'm sorry.

331
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:47,930
Mian.

332
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,680
You didn't do anything wrong.

333
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,520
Why are you apologizing?

334
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,100
Besides,

335
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,720
about Shan Gudao's matter,

336
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,770
Li Xiangyi is also responsible.

337
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,710
But those rumors were spread by Zijin.

338
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,869
I tried to persuade him,

339
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,310
but he's too petty about the past.

340
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,569
That means he cares.

341
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,200
Mian.

342
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,339
It's better than being dull

343
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,490
and not taking anything to heart.

344
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,050
I shouldn't have come to you.

345
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,480
This time, I'm here

346
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,880
to ask for your forgiveness on behalf of Zijin.

347
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,070
On account of our past friendship,

348
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,910
can you forgive him for a moment of foolishness?

349
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,070
Li Xiangyi is gone,

350
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,850
and Li Lianhua doesn't care about these.

351
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,120
Can you promise me

352
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,860
that you won't hold a grudge against Zijin?

353
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:50,910
Okay.

354
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,250
I promise you.

355
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,110
Thank you.

356
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,800
I remember the last time I begged someone

357
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,960
was 14 years ago.

358
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,360
I begged the Sword Demon

359
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,290
to allow him to give Li Xiangyi one more year

360
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,510
before battling him.

361
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:18,980
Yes.

362
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,150
One year later,

363
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,670
Li Xiangyi perfected his swordsmanship,

364
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,180
beat the Sword Demon,

365
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,770
and became the best in the world.

366
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:35,390
Time

367
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,950
really flies.

368
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:42,660
Yeah.

369
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,070
Time flies indeed.

370
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,580
Is she your lover?

371
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,130
Fei.

372
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,720
Don't you have manners?

373
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,670
Am I right?

374
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,620
No.

375
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,580
Do you have a crush on her?

376
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,940
I'll help you kidnap her back

377
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,200
in exchange for a secret of one's origin.

378
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,980
Don't do anything stupid.

379
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,840
Let me tell you.

380
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,460
She's an old friend of mine

381
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,610
named Qiao Wanmian.

382
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,500
She's Xiao Zijin's fiancee.

383
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,760
Xiao Zijin?

384
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,390
The leader of the Sigu Sect?

385
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,190
That's right.

386
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,030
They are very close.

387
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:48,300
Listen.

388
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,070
Don't make any trouble.

389
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,070
So you have a crush on Qiao Wanyu

390
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,970
and you're afraid of Xiao Zijin,

391
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:56,940
so you dare not admit it.

392
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

393
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,290
Tell me a secret about your origin.

394
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,700
Why do I have to?

395
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,120
Or I'll go to Xiao Zijin

396
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,600
and tell him that you have a crush on his lady.

397
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:08,700
How unreasonable.

398
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,360
Are you going to tell me or not?

399
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:12,890
Fine.

400
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,460
I'll tell you then.

401
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,730
Actually,

402
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,510
you lost your memory because of someone you trust.

403
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,730
Aren't you the one I trust?

404
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,000
There's someone else

405
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:25,830
besides me.

406
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:26,710
Who?

407
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,540
I'm afraid we don't know yet.

408
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,510
But let me tell you,

409
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,660
with your skills,

410
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,660
the person who can hurt you must be someone around you.

411
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:38,880
Li Lianhua!

412
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:39,980
Bad news.

413
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,800
What’s wrong?

414
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,660
Fang Duobing.

415
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,020
H-he’s crazy!

416
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,430
Let's go.

417
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,370
Fang Xiaobao.

418
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,360
Stop what you're doing!

419
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,220
Stop what you're doing!

420
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:05,740
Stop!

421
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,190
I've got a prescription to cure your amnesia.

422
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,550
Here, drink the medicine while it's hot.

423
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,080
Drink it.

424
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,550
Are you crazy?

425
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,850
I am.

426
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,340
I've searched every town nearby

427
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,840
and got the folk prescription.

428
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,250
You must take the medicine today.

429
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:25,780
Drink it!

430
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,450
Are you really crazy?

431
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,070
You...

432
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,290
Fei.

433
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,290
Don’t blame Fang Duobing.

434
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,210
Although he's a bit abnormal today,

435
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,940
the medicine he bought is real.

436
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:48,820
Fang Xiaobao.

437
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,780
I know you mean well.

438
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,740
But Fei

439
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,130
really doesn't have amnesia.

440
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,460
It's useless for him to take this medicine.

441
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,620
If you really want to help him,

442
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,140
you have to find another way, okay?

443
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,500
I'm not trying to help him.

444
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:58,870
I...

445
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,160
I just want him to remember

446
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,620
what happened ten years ago.

447
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,120
Move!

448
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,660
[Girls' Mansion]

449
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,750
[Lotus Tower]

450
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:31,690
Fang Xiaobao.

451
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,550
You didn't even eat dinner.

452
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,660
Are you full from all the gossip at the tea party?

453
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,270
The food smells so good.

454
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,690
And the good wine from town

455
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,160
is so fragrant.

456
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,250
Fine, if you don't want to eat,

457
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,460
I'll help myself.

458
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,440
I won't stand on ceremony.

459
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,420
Is what you said true?

460
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,240
About what?

461
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,200
You said my master had a cold nature,

462
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,070
and that's why they didn't get along.

463
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,100
Is it true?

464
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,540
Yes.

465
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,750
Then could he have

466
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,940
hurt your father?

467
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,420
I didn't say that.

468
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,070
Fang Xiaobao, think about it.

469
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:39,080
Your father forced you to marry the princess.

470
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,170
Your mother cut off your sources of making money.

471
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:41,970
Let me ask you.

472
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,520
Do you hate them?

473
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,090
Of course not.

474
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,830
Doesn't that explain it all?

475
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:50,770
As brothers and as family, Li Xiangyi and Shan Gudao

476
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,420
were bound to have some conflicts.

477
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,540
But he wouldn't have had killed his family

478
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,160
just for this.

479
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,750
Do you know

480
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,140
what Li Xiangyi's favorite line in a poem is?

481
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,390
Wine is left with an ordinary debt.

482
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,660
Swords don't waste their time.

483
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,730
In this world,

484
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:16,920
there are so many things that are not worth the effort.

485
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,810
Things that are worthy

486
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:18,810
are few.

487
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,170
Why would Li Xiangyi

488
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,470
waste his time

489
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,300
on these stupid schemes?

490
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,460
You're right.

491
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,620
My master won't waste his time for this.

492
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,850
I should not be so fixated.

493
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,700
I was narrow-minded.

494
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:40,920
That's right.

495
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,280
Li Lianhua.

496
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,370
Do you think my master might be

497
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:47,770
in hiding under an alias?

498
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:49,860
What's wrong?

499
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,900
Because I still think

500
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:57,660
the swordsman in white in the Yuanbao Villa was strange.

501
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,180
Since Di Feisheng is still alive,

502
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,110
maybe my master is still alive too.

503
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,090
Wait, Fang Xiaobao.

504
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,060
Are you having a fever and confused again?

505
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,260
How is that possible?

506
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,040
He's vain and values his reputation

507
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,160
and success.

508
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:08,580
You...

509
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,750

It has nothing to do with me.

I'm a detective from Baichuan Court.

Such a hassle just for a drink.

Should I throw away the gift that I brought for your master

down the mountain too?

710

Of course not.

711
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,410
It's just that we need to examine the gift

712

before presenting it to Master.

Don’t you think the matters inside

are enough for you to handle?

I'm just here to taste the good wine.

You even hid the luminous pearl with you.

Those calligraphy paintings I hid for myself are very valuable.

you have to choose an item.

How about I give you an idea?

what's the name of the mountain where the Girls' Mansion is?

This mountain has no name on the map.

792
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,550
Only because of the fragrance of the flowers all year round,

793
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,550
Master named it Fragrant Mountain.

794

Fragrant Mountain?
