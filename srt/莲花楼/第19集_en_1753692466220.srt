00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Kissing

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
After four thousand times

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Thousands of times

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The most reluctant moment is that moment

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
On the earth

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A thousand miles of wind and light

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who doesn't wander

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
On the edge of the cliff

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
On the earth

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Youthful and wild

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
A thousand times, I will not fall into the sorrow

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I will go to the end of the world

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
As if it's a dream

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
On the earth

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
A thousand miles of wind and light

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Who doesn't wander

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
On the edge of the cliff

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
On the earth

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
A thousand times, I will not fall into the sorrow

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
A thousand times, I will not fall into the sorrow

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
A thousand miles of wind and light

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Who doesn't wander

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
On the earth

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
A thousand times, I will not fall into the sorrow

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I will go to the end of the world

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
A thousand miles of wind and light

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Who doesn't wander

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
On the earth

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What's the matter

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I heard the sound of the birds

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm so worried

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:21,960
Send Boss Tang to the

38
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,960
This is the contract.

39
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,560
This is not my senior's handwriting.

40
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,760
Honorable Superior, how could this happen?

41
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,160
It's already happened.

42
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,560
There's no need to lie.

43
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,960
There are many doubts about the death of Shan Gu Dao.

44
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,760
That's why I went to grab it.

45
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,160
I'm afraid that

46
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,760
I went to grab his body to let the corpse and soul be exposed.

47
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,560
Maybe someone deliberately provoked the fight between the Golden Moon Alliance and the Four Seasons Sect.

48
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,960
But the Golden Moon Alliance didn't stop after the four-bone door and the Golden Moon Alliance were destroyed.

49
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,360
Who is the one behind this?

50
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,960
My senior's death

51
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,960
may be the key to this.

52
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,160
So you don't want to die now?

53
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,360
You don't need to worry about me.

54
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,560
Come to the Dream Land.

55
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,560
Don't you want to know the truth

56
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
from ten years ago?

57
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,560
The truth will be found out.

58
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,160
There will be a chance for it to be found out.

59
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,360
But our competition is about my honor.

60
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,560
When I find the Wang Quan Flower, you take the Silver Plant.

61
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,560
You can fight me again with your previous power.

62
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,560
It's okay to ask me to help you solve the puzzle.

63
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,760
Then I have to know first

64
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,160
what is the relationship between the Golden Moon Alliance and Nan Ying.

65
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,960
What did the Golden Moon Alliance do?

66
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,960
You said Nan Ying?

67
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,960
You forgot.

68
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,360
You forgot so quickly.

69
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,760
In the last one-on-one match,

70
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,760
the wooden box you took away

71
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,360
was the item of the princess of Nan Ying.

72
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,760
You don't know?

73
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,560
I went for the Guanyin Hammer.

74
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,160
I want to take the wooden box.

75
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,360
I just learned that ten years ago,

76
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,960
a large batch of thunder and fire was purchased from the Pili Hall in Jiangnan.

77
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,760
It was the Nan Ying people who did it.

78
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,760
I also want to know

79
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,560
why you think the Golden Moon Alliance is related to Nan Ying.

80
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,360
What else do you know?

81
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,960
Why don't you tell me?

82
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,360
The Nan Ying people

83
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,560
bought thunder and fire

84
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,960
to blow up everything you did in the East Sea.

85
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,360
Then you know

86
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,960
that Jiao Li Qiao is a Nan Ying person.

87
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,760
You are right.

88
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,760
Chief Yi,

89
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,360
your housework

90
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,360
needs to be cleaned up.

91
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,360
When I find out the truth,

92
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,160
I'll come to you again.

93
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,560
I think it's better you don't think about me

94
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,960
by telling me about him.

95
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,960
All right.

96
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,360
Open it.- Okay.

97
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,760
and you must obtain it.

98
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,160
I've been looking for you for half a day.

99
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,760
As a result, you ended up drinking by the car?

100
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,800
I'm sorry.

101
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,200
Feng Shou wanted to save me without thinking about the past.

102
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,880
The difference between now and before is too big.

103
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,200
Thank you.

104
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,560
Don't say thank you.

105
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,960
I know why you're called Li Lianhua.

106
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,760
Beautiful words come to your mouth.

107
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,280
You're really a snake and a lotus.

108
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,600
But most of the words you said

109
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,360
didn't go through your heart.

110
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,480
You even said thank you for saving your life.

111
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,440
I think

112
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,680
you haven't

113
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,200
taken your life seriously.

114
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,520
I'm just afraid of death.

115
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,160
But I'm really grateful to you.

116
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,760
You said thank you,

117
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,760
but you still sold me out.

118
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,280
Let me tell you the truth.

119
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,120
When I was in Shenzhuang,

120
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,000
I studied the book of the Moon and the Moon.

121
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,320
Studied?

122
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,800
What did you study?

123
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,960
You.

124
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,560
Fang Xiaobao,

125
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,240
are you free every day?

126
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,240
You're

127
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,680
quite independent before.

128
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,920
You're a good friend.

129
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,800
Apart from being independent,

130
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,200
you're quite like me.

131
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You have many friends.

132
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,280
But you don't have many true friends.

133
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,360
So later,

134
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,160
you either suffered from a huge change

135
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,120
and got burned.

136
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,240
Or you were betrayed by your good brother.

137
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,840
That's why you're not friends with your friends.

138
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,000
You think you're a lonely man.

139
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,240
How is it?

140
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,880
Am I right?

141
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,080
You're wrong.

142
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,720
Please.

143
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,360
Alright.

144
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,680
For the sake of your miserable life,

145
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,120
I'll forgive you.

146
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,000
Drink the rest of the medicine.

147
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,840
Then you can go to Jianghu with me.

148
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,160
Fang Xiaobao,

149
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,760
I remember someone said

150
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,920
if you say goodbye to Jianghu,

151
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,840
you're a dog if you talk to me.

152
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,480
I can't even understand you.

153
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,360
Drink the medicine.

154
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
aquela

155
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:35,840
Come on.

156
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,160
Eat more.

157
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,800
What's wrong?

158
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,320
No appetite?

159
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,920
I'm sorry.

160
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,360
Is your stomach still full?

161
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,520
I'll let Mr. Xue check it for you.

162
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,520
I'll take your pulse first.

163
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,320
No need.

164
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,400
Miss Qiao.

165
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,200
Miss Qiao.

166
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,040
Brother Ji.

167
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,200
Are you feeling better?

168
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,800
Thank you for your concern, Brother Ji.

169
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,840
I'm feeling better now.

170
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,200
I just told Zijin

171
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,840
not to bother the doctor to visit me.

172
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,400
Zijin is always worried about you.

173
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,760
She's always nervous when you're in trouble.

174
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,480
You were in a panic yesterday.

175
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,360
I haven't had time to ask you about something.

176
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,880
Miss Qiao.

177
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,600
You've met Jiao Liqiao.

178
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,280
The witch's martial arts are much better.

179
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,040
She put the cicada in my mouth.

180
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,160
I almost have no resistance to the enemy.

181
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,000
That's not the scariest thing.

182
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,640
The scariest thing is that the Golden Fist Alliance

183
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,840
came for the 188th prison.

184
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,560
I heard that

185
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,960
the 188th prison of the Baichuan Courtyard

186
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,200
has been opened by the Golden Fist Alliance more recently.

187
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,280
You set up the inner prison at the temple gate

188
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,440
and were found by Di Feisheng.

189
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,120
It seems that it's not a coincidence.

190
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,960
The address of the 188th prison

191
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,400
is indeed only known to me, Biqiu, Baishi

192
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,480
and my most trusted disciple.

193
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,560
If someone hadn't revealed the news,

194
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,000
it would never have been possible for someone to break the prison.

195
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,240
Brother Ji, do you suspect anyone?

196
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,760
I dare not suspect anyone

197
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,520
without evidence.

198
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,680
I just need to be strictly vigilant

199
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,640
and wait for someone to show up.

200
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,960
Brother Ji.

201
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,240
The temple gate was closed 10 years ago.

202
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,880
Only the Baichuan Courtyard can protect the evil spirit

203
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,960
of the past.

204
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,360
I really don't want to hear anyone

205
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,640
betraying their original intention in the Baichuan Courtyard.

206
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,560
If...

207
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,760
If Xiang Yi is still here,

208
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
he definitely doesn't want to see

209
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,320
the blood and spirit of the Four Gu Sects

210
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,240
be scattered.

211
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,040
Of course.

212
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,000
Xiang Yi is no longer here.

213
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,720
The Four Gu Sects are no longer here either.

214
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,120
Let Brother Ji

215
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,520
handle these things.

216
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,240
The Four Gu Sects are indeed no longer here.

217
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,280
But as long as there is a heart

218
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,840
that protects the peace and stability of the Jianghu,

219
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,880
as long as we gather everyone together,

220
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,080
why can't the Four Gu Sects come back?

221
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,080
You want to restore the Four Gu Sects.

222
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,840
Is this what the Baichuan Courtyard wants?

223
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,720
No.

224
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,520
This is what many people want.

225
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,360
Qiao Li Qiao has been

226
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,920
spreading evil spirits of the Golden Plains for so many years.

227
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,160
Now that Di Feisheng has made a comeback,

228
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,480
he even openly challenged us yesterday.

229
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,240
The other warriors here

230
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,440
are very angry.

231
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,840
Everyone hopes

232
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,760
the Four Gu Sects can rebuild their country

233
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,520
and make Jianghu's spirit

234
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,320
suppress Di Feisheng

235
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,920
and destroy the Golden Plains.

236
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,800
It seems

237
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,240
Brother Ji also supports this idea.

238
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,560
If the Four Gu Sects want to rise again,

239
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,720
they must re-establish the sect leader.

240
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,200
So I came to discuss with you.

241
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,920
I thought about it.

242
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,360
The Purple Golden Pillar was the protection of the Four Gu Sects.

243
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,160
It is undoubtedly the best choice.

244
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
How can this be?

245
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,400
I...

246
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,240
I will definitely think about it

247
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,040
when we rebuild the sect.

248
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,840
Brother Ji, let me think about it.

249
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,760
Okay.

250
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
I'll take my leave.

251
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,320
Zi Jin, don't be angry.

252
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,720
Don't be angry.

253
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,720
I just think

254
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,280
you said you didn't want to participate in Jianghu.

255
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,360
So...

256
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,160
Wan Min,

257
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,840
you don't like to lie.

258
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,280
So when you lie,

259
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,040
you always make some small moves.

260
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,640
I know it best.

261
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,840
Zi Jin,

262
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,640
I'm not...

263
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,560
Of course you think

264
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,560
I can't be the sect leader of the Four Gu Sects.

265
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,920
Because in your heart,

266
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,840
only Li Xiang Yi can be the sect leader.

267
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,720
Since the beginning,

268
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,040
you can't let go of him.

269
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,280
When I saved you from Di Fei Sheng,

270
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,920
you were in a coma.

271
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,360
But you called him Xiang Yi.

272
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,720
For so many years,

273
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,640
day and night,

274
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,320
you always think of him

275
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,480
and think of him, right?

276
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,680
It's not like that, Zi Jin.

277
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,400
Okay.

278
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:43,960
Let me ask you.

279
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,400
Why did you go to Li Lian Hua

280
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,840
when you were just fine?

281
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,120
Do you also feel that

282
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,720
Mr. Li Lian Hua is familiar with you?

283
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
Let alone you,

284
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,000
sometimes when I see his eyes,

285
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,560
I can always think of him.

286
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,160
So,

287
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,040
you're looking for

288
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,960
Li Xiang Yi's shadow on Li Lian Hua, right?

289
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,960
Zi Jin,

290
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,040
I never find

291
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,440
Xiang Yi's shadow on anyone.

292
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,880
My feelings for Xiang Yi

293
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,840
are already different.

294
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,560
He's a friend in the past,

295
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,240
a memory.

296
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,960
But he

297
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,800
will never become a problem between us.

298
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,360
You have to believe me.

299
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,520
Okay.

300
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,840
I believe you.

301
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,280
I believe everything you say.

302
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,680
But,

303
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,160
I also have to make a change.

304
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,760
Change?

305
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,080
I was

306
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,960
not interested in rebuilding the Four Gu Sect.

307
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,080
But now,

308
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,560
I've decided

309
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,240
to take the position of the head of the Four Gu Sect.

310
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,520
I want to prove to you

311
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,040
that I can do what Mr. Li can do.

312
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,040
And I want to do better.

313
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:21,860
Y Before

314
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,600
Turns out that

315
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,000
previous head inspiration

316
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,600
never passed the field test.

317
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,040
When you were a successful man,

318
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,040
you were at the age of a rich man.

319
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,040
Let's start now.

320
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,040
Let's go.

321
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,040
I'm waiting to buy a new wonton.

322
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,040
Why did you have to bring me here?

323
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,040
What wonton?

324
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,040
It's a big deal to restore the four gates.

325
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,040
It's hard to get a chance to see it.

326
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,040
If it weren't for me,

327
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,040
you wouldn't be able to come in.

328
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,040
Please, Master Zheng.

329
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,040
Everyone,

330
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,040
the four gates have been in the dust for ten years.

331
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,040
Many things have changed in the world.

332
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,040
Now,

333
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,040
the Golden Abyss Alliance is in the dark.

334
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,040
The evil heart is not dead.

335
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,040
The martial arts world is in chaos.

336
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,040
It's not easy for us to eliminate the chaos.

337
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,040
Restoring the four gates is also to

338
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,040
reunite all the old friends.

339
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,040
To work together to eradicate the evil and evil outside the martial arts world.

340
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,040
I have a good talent.

341
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,040
I'm not a good person.

342
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,040
It's rare for you to recommend me.

343
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,040
I'm not sure about the best.

344
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,040
I'm just doing my duty.

345
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,040
Today, I'm here to announce the martial arts world.

346
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,040
I hope you can support me.

347
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,040
Congratulations.

348
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,040
We will help you.

349
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,040
We are willing to join the four gates.

350
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,040
We will be the same as before.

351
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,040
We will do everything we can.

352
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,040
Give me one.

353
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,040
Give me one.

354
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,040
Give me one.

355
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,040
Give me one.

356
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,040
I'll join.

357
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,040
I'll join.

358
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,040
Okay.

359
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,040
Wan Sheng Dao, come to congratulate us.

360
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,040
Chief Feng.

361
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,040
Chief Feng.

362
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,040
Chief Feng.

363
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
Chief Feng.

364
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,040
It's Chief Feng's visit.

365
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,040
I sent all the people to support Wan Sheng Dao.

366
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,040
I, Chief Lan Shan Shen, am very grateful.

367
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,040
Everyone.

368
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,040
Come.

369
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,040
After Chief Li's visit,

370
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,040
the four gates collapsed.

371
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,040
It's so unfortunate.

372
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,040
Now, the two old friends of Chief Xiao have left.

373
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,040
The news of the four gates has been all over the world.

374
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,040
Wan Sheng Dao will support Wan Sheng Dao.

375
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,040
The allies of Wan Sheng Dao will support Wan Sheng Dao.

376
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,040
Chief Xiao.

377
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,040
If there's a problem, just tell me.

378
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,040
Chief Feng is right.

379
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,040
Yes.

380
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,040
Yes.

381
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,040
Yes.

382
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,040
This is not a congratulatory event.

383
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,040
It's obvious who will be the boss.

384
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,040
Chief Feng, you're too polite.

385
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,040
These years, I've been less involved in the world.

386
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,040
I heard that the rise of Wan Sheng Dao is also a sign of joy.

387
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,040
The way of the martial arts in the world should be like the river flowing water,

388
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,040
and the front and back should be connected.

389
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,040
It's also Lin Wei's order to go out of Wan Sheng Dao.

390
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,040
For the sake of the safety of the world,

391
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,040
I'll do my best.

392
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,040
I didn't expect this sincerity

393
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,040
to be recognized and supported by all the sects.

394
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,040
This is why Wan Sheng Dao has grown up over the past ten years.

395
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,040
As the saying goes, the more capable the better.

396
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,040
I'm here to congratulate the four gates.

397
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,040
Second, I want to say something to the comrades in the martial arts world.

398
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,040
If there's any difficulty in the future,

399
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,040
please ask me.

400
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,040
I'll definitely help you.

401
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,040
I won't refuse.

402
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,040
That's right.

403
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,040
That's right.

404
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,040
That's right.

405
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,040
The way of the martial arts in Wan Sheng Dao

406
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,040
is similar to the four gates.

407
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,040
I believe that we can work together

408
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,040
to fight against the strong enemy

409
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,040
and eliminate the Golden Abyss Alliance and the enemy.

410
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,040
Of course, the four gates won't let you down.

411
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,040
The four gates are a secret secret.

412
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,040
I'm willing to share it with everyone.

413
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,040
That's great.

414
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,040
That's great.

415
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,040
If Prime Minister Li were still here,

416
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,040
he would be happy to hear this.

417
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,040
What's wrong?

418
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,040
This is not a mutual understanding.

419
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,040
This is a distinction of interests.

420
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,040
If the four gates are not for mutual understanding,

421
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,040
but for the sake of the martial arts,

422
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,040
is there any point in this?

423
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,040
What nonsense are you talking about?

424
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,040
It's none of your business.

425
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,040
You...

426
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,040
Did I say something wrong?

427
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,040
Fang Xiao Meng.

428
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,040
I'm Zhuo Jian.

429
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,040
The Golden Abyss Alliance

430
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,040
is still unclear about what they want.

431
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,040
If they still want to fight against the four gates

432
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,040
in the current situation,

433
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,040
they will only get the different sects involved.

434
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,040
So I still suggest

435
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,040
that we don't give the different sects a chance to make trouble.

436
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,040
What's going on?

437
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,040
What's going on?

438
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,040
What's going on?

439
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,040
What's going on?

440
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,040
The evil demon is out there.

441
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,040
Everyone is in their own way.

442
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,040
If we don't get rid of them as soon as possible,

443
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,040
are we still waiting for them to dominate the martial arts?

444
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,040
Maintaining the martial arts is the original intention

445
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,040
of the four gates

446
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,040
of the late Prime Minister Li.

447
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,040
Is there any point in this?

448
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,040
There's no point.

449
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,040
Do you dare or not?

450
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,040
You're leaving?

451
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,040
A Min, I should leave too.

452
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,040
The revival of the four gates has just begun.

453
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,040
You're leaving?

454
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,040
You really don't want the four gates anymore?

455
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,040
I'm no longer Jiang Wu Ke.

456
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,040
Moreover, the four gates

457
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,040
already have their own rules.

458
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,040
So...

459
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,040
So...

460
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,040
you don't object to Zi Jin being the new sect leader?

461
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,040
I've never objected to it.

462
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,040
A Min,

463
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,040
all along,

464
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,040
I've always been sincere with you.

465
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,040
I've never lied to you.

466
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,040
Then you...

467
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,040
Where are you going?

468
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,040
You're still worrying about me.

469
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,040
I'm not.

470
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,040
Have you forgotten?

471
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,040
I have a small building.

472
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,040
I can go wherever I want.

473
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,040
The sky is clear and the sea is blue.

474
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,040
I can go out to sea or to climb mountains.

475
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,040
There's a camp in California.

476
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,040
There's a country under the bed.

477
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,040
Don't worry about me.

478
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,040
It's good.

479
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,040
But it's always a person.

480
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,040
Don't say it.

481
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,040
It's been ten years since the plague spread.

482
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,040
But...

483
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,040
changing such a way of life

484
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,040
isn't a crime.

485
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,040
Moreover,

486
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,040
it's a little cold

487
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,040
on your body.

488
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,040
You're afraid of cold?

489
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,040
A Min, I'm a human, not a ghost.

490
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,040
Of course I'm afraid of cold.

491
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,040
You never mentioned this before.

492
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,040
I didn't

493
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,040
react to it for a while.

494
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,040
You're really different from Xiang Yi.

495
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,040
She won't say she's tired.

496
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,040
She's always busy.

497
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,040
She hardly sleeps.

498
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,040
She's good at spending money.

499
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,040
She likes to order people.

500
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,040
She's always busy.

501
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,040
She's always busy.

502
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,040
But she can always do something

503
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,040
that's very busy.

504
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,040
Xiang Yi never forgives anyone.

505
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,040
But I'm very poor.

506
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,040
I can spend enough money.

507
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,040
I like to find a quiet place to sleep.

508
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,040
It's good.

509
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,040
And I haven't taken it yet.

510
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,040
But I forgot to tell you.

511
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,040
Don't say it's been ten years

512
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,040
since I learned to plant flowers

513
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,040
and to make a living.

514
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,040
I think it's really good.

515
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,040
I

516
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,040
have to help Zi Jin.

517
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,040
If I have a chance,

518
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,040
let me see the flowers you planted.

519
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,040
You must come.

520
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,040
Come.

521
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,040
Yang Zhou Man.

522
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,040
It's really him.

523
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,040
Yang Zhou Man

524
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
I'll use my perfect handwriting

525
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,040
to tell you to come here.

526
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,040
You really came.

527
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,040
Li Xiang Yi.

528
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,040
Li Xiang Yi is dead.

529
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
Her tomb is here.

530
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,040
Since she's dead,

531
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,040
why would she come back?

532
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,040
You still dare not let go of Wan Mian?

533
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,040
She's been hurt by you for ten years.

534
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,040
That's our ten years of youth.

535
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,040
She's dead.

536
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,040
She's dead.

537
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,040
She's dead.

538
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,040
She's dead.

539
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,040
That's our ten years of youth.

540
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,040
Do you know

541
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,040
how hard it was for her to get out?

542
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,040
Do you know

543
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,040
how hard it was for me to see the clouds?

544
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,040
When you came back,

545
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,040
you ruined everything.

546
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,040
Zi Jin.

547
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,040
I just came back

548
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,040
to give you a gift.

549
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,040
I was going to leave the country.

550
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,040
So I hope you can understand.

551
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,040
I know

552
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,040
you're close to A Min now.

553
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,040
I'm here to give you my best wishes.

554
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,040
Fine.

555
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,040
You came back

556
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,040
to see how we could get along.

557
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,040
Since you let A Min

558
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,040
recognize you,

559
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,040
you've ruined everything.

560
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,040
Bless me.

561
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,040
I think you came back

562
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,040
to laugh at me.

563
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,040
You're thinking too much.

564
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,040
Li Xiang Yi.

565
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,040
How old are you?

566
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,040
You're still here.

567
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,040
Jiao Li Qiao and Di Fei Sheng

568
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,040
are back in the martial arts world.

569
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,040
If you don't come back,

570
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,040
how can you face

571
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,040
your reputation?

572
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,040
So at the Re-invention Conference,

573
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,040
you deliberately

574
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,040
went against me.

575
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,040
I just want to give you my sincere advice.

576
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,040
What about the Four-Body Gate?

577
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,040
What about the Martial Arts Conference?

578
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,040
I won't interfere.

579
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,040
You're close to A Min now.

580
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,040
Even if you have my existence,

581
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,040
it won't affect

582
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,040
your relationship.

583
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,040
I'm worried now

584
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,040
that A Min will change

585
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,040
when he sees you.

586
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,040
Zi Jing.

587
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,040
Don't you believe A Min?

588
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,040
As long as you're alive,

589
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,040
I can't believe A Min anymore.

590
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,040
Didn't you say

591
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,040
you didn't care about everything here?

592
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,040
Then promise me

593
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,040
you'll never come back

594
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,040
and never see A Min again.

595
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,040
Even if I promise,

596
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,040
will you believe me?

597
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,040
That's right.

598
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,040
You're so selfish.

599
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,040
You can do whatever you want.

600
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,040
If you want to take back A Min's heart

601
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,040
and take everything from the Four-Body Gate,

602
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,040
how can I stop you?

603
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,040
So what?

604
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,040
You jump down.

605
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,040
I don't want to kill you myself.

606
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,040
There are ten tall trees in the cliff.

607
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,040
If I jump down,

608
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,040
I'll die.

609
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,040
I'll die.

610
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,040
Do it.

611
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,040
Do you really want to do this?

612
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,040
You know that

613
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,040
I can do whatever I want.

614
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,040
You're still as selfish as you were back then.

615
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,040
Zi Jing.

616
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,040
I don't want to fight anymore.

617
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,040
What if I say

618
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,040
I have to

619
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,040
kill you today?

620
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,040
You...

621
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,040
What are you doing?

622
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,040
What are you doing?

623
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,040
A Min,

624
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,040
Zi Jing recognized me.

625
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,040
I haven't competed with him for a long time.

626
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,040
We just cut two shots.

627
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,040
His martial arts

628
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,040
has improved a lot.

629
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,040
Yes.

630
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,040
I see.

631
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,040
Zi Jing.

632
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,040
I wanted to tell you that he is Xiang Yi's.

633
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,040
But Xiang Yi doesn't want to stay.

634
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,040
He doesn't want to bother us.

635
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,040
Yes.

636
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,040
It's time to go.

637
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,040
Goodbye.

638
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,040
Zi Jing.

639
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,040
We've changed

640
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,040
since he came back.

641
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,040
He left

642
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,040
and I stayed by your side.

643
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,040
Now,

644
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,040
you can rest in peace.

645
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,040
From now on,

646
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,040
we'll be together.

647
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,040
I'll be with you.

648
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,040
I'll be with you.

649
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,040
I'll be with you.

650
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,040
Don't let yourself go.

651
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,040
Don't treat him

652
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,040
as your enemy, okay?

653
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,040
You're back.

654
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,040
You treat this place as your own home.

655
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,040
I'm hungry.

656
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,040
I happened to see Lotus Pavilion when I went down the mountain.

657
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,040
I rarely cook.

658
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,040
Today, I'm giving you a treat.

659
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,040
Come on, sit down.

660
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,040
Eat while it's hot.

661
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,040
What are you waiting for?

662
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,040
Eat while it's hot.

663
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,040
Come on, sit down.

664
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,040
Eat while it's hot.

665
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,040
Come on.

666
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,040
Why did you go down the mountain?

667
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,040
The four palaces are in vain.

668
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,040
I thought you'd stay in the yard,

669
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,040
work hard,

670
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,040
and do a good job.

671
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,040
Isn't this what you've been trying to achieve?

672
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,040
This is not the four palaces I want to restore.

673
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,040
They just changed their name.

674
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,040
It's called Revenge Company.

675
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,040
Water is clear, so there's no fish.

676
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,040
I know that.

677
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,040
But now the four palaces

678
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,040
are using the oil of the Golden Cloud Alliance

679
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,040
to let the major sects

680
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,040
do the joint and cross-examination.

681
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,040
Then those small sects

682
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,040
can't be ignored.

683
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,040
Is that fair?

684
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,040
Is that still the four palaces of the past?

685
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,040
In my opinion,

686
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,040
Li Xiang Yi and the four palaces

687
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,040
have long been

688
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,040
the symbol of the Great Qi in their hearts.

689
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,040
Li Xiang Yi may not be the whole team.

690
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,040
I'm older than you.

691
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,040
I've heard a lot about him.

692
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,040
When he was young,

693
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,040
he was a stubborn person.

694
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,040
He had a lot to do with the four palaces.

695
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,040
I've heard about what you said.

696
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,040
But I've heard about his reputation.

697
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,040
He deserves to be a proud son.

698
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,040
If you add one more word,

699
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,040
it's proud.

700
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,040
What's the point of that?

701
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,040
Adding one more word

702
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,040
can also be proud.

703
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,040
It's not a good word.

704
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,040
People are not perfect.

705
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,040
It should be like that.

706
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,040
How can there be no shadow

707
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,040
under the light?

708
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,040
Yes, Li Xiang Yi is arrogant.

709
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,040
But he established the Four Gu Sect

710
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,040
for a better martial art.

711
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,040
A strong and a weak martial art.

712
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,040
Not like now.

713
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,040
He's doing everything for the interests of the sect.

714
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,040
If Li Xiang Yi knows that

715
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,040
after ten years,

716
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,040
someone will be happy

717
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,040
if he knows him so well.

718
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,040
Wang Dong Bing.

719
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,040
It's a pity that you don't cook.

720
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,040
I'm not that talented.

721
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,040
Don't underestimate me.

722
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,040
Cherish me.

723
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,040
I don't think of you.

724
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,040
But honestly,

725
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,040
I'm determined to take the role of Jiang Hu.

726
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,040
You can't do it.

727
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,040
I'm not that good.

728
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,040
You can't take me as a friend.

729
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,040
Don't take me as a child.

730
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,040
I only have one request.

731
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,040
Don't play tricks on me.

732
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,040
Let me go back to Tian Qi Hall, okay?

733
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,040
It's not easy for me to escape.

734
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,040
Bring it here.

735
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,040
Then, for the past,

736
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,040
let's end it.

737
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,040
To our new friend.

738
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,040
What did you say?

739
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,040
New friend?

740
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,040
The best friend.

741
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,040
Wait.

742
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,040
Is there something wrong with your wine?

743
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,040
I've already drunk it.

744
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,040
I've been tricked by you so many times.

745
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,040
Who's afraid of who?

746
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,040
You're good at drinking.

747
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,040
Since we're already friends,

748
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,040
there's nothing to hide.

749
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,040
I have to tell you something.

750
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,040
I just found out

751
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,040
that Shanggu Dao is not my uncle.

752
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,040
He's my biological father.

753
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,040
You knew it?

754
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,040
You...

755
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,040
You knew it long ago.

756
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,040
What else are you hiding from me?

757
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,040
I just found out.

758
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,040
I was investigating your father's real death.

759
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,040
I didn't know about it.

760
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,040
Real death?

761
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,040
Shanggu Dao

762
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,040
wasn't killed by King of Jingyuan Sect.

763
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,040
But his death

764
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,040
was a trick to get rid of the secretive secretive secretive of Jingyuan Sect.

765
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,040
I suspect someone

766
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,040
has played a bigger trick behind this.

767
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,040
He's involved in the Yu City,

768
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,040
Yiping Furnace,

769
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,040
Yuan Bao Villa

770
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,040
and even the ice flakes.

771
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,040
The South Ying people

772
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,040
played an important role in this.

773
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,040
But this

774
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,040
isn't all.

775
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,040
I've seen this ice flakes

776
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,040
from my biological mother.

777
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,040
Look.

778
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,040
It's the same ice flakes

779
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,040
that Yu Jingyuan used to play.

780
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,040
It's the same ice flakes

781
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,040
that Yu Jingyuan used to play.

782
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,040
Why did your mother

783
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,040
have this ice flakes?

784
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,040
Maybe it's related to Shanggu Dao.

785
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,040
I've studied it carefully.

786
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,040
It's a kind of mechanism key.

787
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,040
It's possible that it's not just this one.

788
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,040
I suspect

789
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,040
someone is trying to get them together

790
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,040
to open some kind of mechanism.

791
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,040
Your Majesty.

792
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,040
Since you came back from Qingfeng,

793
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,040
you've been busy with the affairs in the alliance.

794
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,040
You haven't had a proper meal

795
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,040
or a proper meal.

796
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,040
Here.

797
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,040
Have some.

798
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,040
Thank you, Your Majesty.

799
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,040
Thank you, Your Majesty.

800
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,040
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

801
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,040
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

802
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,040
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

803
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,040
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

804
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,040
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

805
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,040
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

806
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,040
Qiao prepared this for you.

807
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,040
I'm afraid

808
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,040
that I didn't do

809
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,040
what I should do

810
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,040
well enough.

811
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,040
That's why you're so worried.

812
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,040
You did a good job.

813
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,040
It's a great help

814
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,040
to help Prince Qiao get rid of the poison.

815
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:33,040
I made the decision without permission.

816
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,040
You said you did a good job.

817
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,040
Why are you so nervous?

818
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,040
I'm not as good as you

819
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,040
in terms of strategy.

820
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,040
I'm glad to have you

821
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,040
by my side.

822
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,040
I'm glad to have you by my side.

823
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,040
I'm glad to have you

824
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,040
by my side.

825
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,040
This is a toast

826
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,040
to your kindness to me.

827
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,040
Gongyang Wu Men said

828
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,040
that only Yang Zhongman

829
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,040
could cure the illness of the cicada in the ice.

830
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,040
I didn't expect that

831
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,040
the inner power of the village

832
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,040
could also be cured by this poison.

833
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,040
You mean that my inner power

834
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,040
is not as good as Li Xiangyi's?

835
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,040
It's Qiao's words.

836
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,040
I'll drink it myself.

837
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,040
How many years have you been with me?

838
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,040
Thirteen years.

839
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,040
I haven't asked you

840
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,040
what you want

841
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,040
for so many years.

842
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,040
I don't ask for anything.

843
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,040
I just want the truth.

844
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,040
I love you with all my heart.

845
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,040
But

846
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,040
you should also

847
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,040
get married.

848
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,040
I just hope that

849
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,040
you could let me

850
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,040
be your last

851
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,040
and only woman.

852
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,040
I'll marry you.

853
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,040
But I won't marry

854
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,040
a woman with unknown background.

855
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,040
You are the queen of the South Ying Imperial Family.

856
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,040
You've never mentioned it.

857
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,040
How did you know?

858
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,040
You are a little smart.

859
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,040
But if you are too smart,

860
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,040
you are just being smart.

861
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,040
Your Majesty, you misunderstood Qiao.

862
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,040
Since Qiao followed you,

863
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,040
he was afraid that you would be

864
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,040
my last home.

865
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,040
So he never mentioned the lonely land.

866
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,040
Okay.

867
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,040
Let me ask you.

868
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,040
In the Central Plains,

869
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,040
what else is there

870
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,040
besides you?

871
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,040
Your Majesty,

872
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,040
I follow you wholeheartedly.

873
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,040
So my heart is on you.

874
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,040
I have nothing to do

875
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,040
with other South Ying people.

876
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,040
Qiao Li Qiao.

877
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,040
You will never learn to be a good person.

878
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,040
You will never know

879
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,040
what I really want

880
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,040
and what I really want.

881
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,040
From today on,

882
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,040
you don't need to interfere

883
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,040
in the affairs of the Alliance.

884
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,040
Your Majesty.

885
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,040
Listen.

886
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,040
I don't want to

887
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,040
let you be my last wife.

888
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,040
I don't want to

889
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,040
be your last wife.

890
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,040
But my sword

891
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,040
will be the last wife of the traitor.

892
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,040
Your Majesty, even I am

893
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,040
a descendant of the South Ying royal family.

894
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,040
What else does he know

895
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,040
and hear?

896
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,040
If I find out

897
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,040
who leaked the secret,

898
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,040
and hurt your heart,

899
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,040
I will make him die.

900
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,040
Sheng Yu, don't panic.

901
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,040
Go and inform Feng Qing.

902
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,040
Get rid of the Thunderbolt Hall.

903
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,040
Don't let your father

904
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,040
know about the thunder.

905
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,040
Go.

906
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,040
Sheng Yu.

907
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,040
I think

908
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,040
it's time to think for yourself.

909
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,040
Sheng Yu, why don't you

910
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,040
take the people you have

911
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,040
in the martial arts world

912
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,040
as your backing?

913
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,040
Then,

914
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,040
you will be safe.

915
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,040
In my eyes,

916
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,040
those people are just

917
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,040
a bunch of cowards.

918
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,040
They are useless.

919
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,040
They can't be compared

920
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,040
to a superior.

921
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,040
A superior is a strong man.

922
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,040
But the Saintess

923
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,040
has to be cruel

924
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,040
and grab him in the hand.

925
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,040
If you follow her will,

926
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,040
you will be against her will.

927
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,040
Do you know

928
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,040
how the eagle was raised

929
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,040
on the grasslands?

930
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,040
It was because of its pride

931
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,040
and pride

932
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,040
that it was created.

933
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,040
The eagle was still raised

934
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,040
and flew away.

935
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,040
It was very fierce.

936
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,040
In the end,

937
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,040
it was only one person.

938
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,040
Xu Gong,

939
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,040
bring the incense.

940
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,040
Yes.

941
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,040
What is it, Fox Fairy?

942
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,040
Ling Lian Hua.

943
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,040
You said yesterday

944
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,040
that my father's death

945
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,040
may have something to do

946
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,040
with what he did before.

947
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,040
I don't know.

948
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,040
I just know

949
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,040
that he is not a human.

950
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,040
I found out

951
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,040
that he had four

952
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,040
capable generals

953
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,040
named Si Hu and Yin Jiang.

954
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,040
Two of them had died in battle.

955
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,040
One of them is missing.

956
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,040
Only Liu Ruo Jin

957
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,040
is heard to be

958
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,040
in the Fengzhou Ma Xia Bao's house.

959
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,040
He is not far from here.

960
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,040
But why didn't he come

961
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,040
when Xiao Zi Jin was married?

962
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,040
The four of them were separated.

963
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,040
It is said that he has

964
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,040
a lot of prejudice against Xiao Zi Jin.

965
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,040
It seems that we should

966
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,040
go there.

967
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,040
You are leaving now?

968
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,040
Are you okay?

969
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,040
I'm fine.

970
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,040
Well,

971
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,040
Miss Qiao's wedding

972
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,040
has not been completed yet.

973
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,040
You don't stay to manage it?

974
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,040
Well, then I don't have to.

975
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,040
Why are you looking at me?

976
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,040
There is something on my face.

977
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,040
Tell me about it.

978
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,040
You look sick.

979
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,040
But your face

980
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,040
is just fine.

981
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,040
How did you get

982
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,040
the love of the most beautiful woman

983
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,040
in the world?

984
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,040
You little bitch.

985
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,040
You are talking nonsense.

986
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,040
What nonsense?

987
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,040
Miss Qiao

988
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,040
looks at you

989
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,040
in a completely different way.

990
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,040
Fang Xiang Bao,

991
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,040
you are so old

992
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,040
that you can see

993
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,040
a woman's eyes.

994
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,040
She is thanking me

995
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,040
for helping her.

996
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,040
Do you understand?

997
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,040
Don't you miss the little girl?

998
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,040
If you want to take away the beauty of people,

999
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,040
I can help you.

1000
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,040
I will tell you again.

1001
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,040
We are not suitable for each other.

1002
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,040
I mean it.

1003
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,040
Many people in the world

1004
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,040
don't approve of them being together.

1005
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,040
They all say that Xiao Zi Jin

1006
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,040
used to be

1007
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,040
the subordinate of Li Xiang Yi.

1008
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,040
They all feel that

1009
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,040
they are sorry to Li Xiang Yi.

1010
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,040
As long as A Min is willing,

1011
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,040
he is the best in the world.

1012
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,040
Li Xiang Yi

1013
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,040
is not his match.

1014
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,040
Let's go.

1015
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,040
Pack up your things.

1016
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,040
You are still a detective.

1017
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,040
What are you thinking about?

1018
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,040
You can say that you are great.

1019
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,040
Why are you against my master?

1020
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,040
Go.

1021
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,040
Go.

1022
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,040
Go.

1023
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,040
Go.

1024
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,040
Go.
