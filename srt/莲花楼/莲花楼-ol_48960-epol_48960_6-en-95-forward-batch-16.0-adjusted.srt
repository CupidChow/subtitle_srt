00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:56,830
Sister.

177
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:57,710
Can I have a bun?

178
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,920
Excuse me, Sir.

179
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,980
This porridge is for the starving.

180
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,840
Your clothes are of high quality.

181
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,220
You're obviously from a rich family.

182
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,460
Why do you want porridge from here?

183
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,340
Go away.

184
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:06,820
This...

185
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,090
Here, this is for you.

186
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,440
Next.

187
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,710
Enemies are bound to meet.

188
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:19,690
Isn't this the person

189
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,150
who likes to ditch people?

190
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,610
What a coincidence.

191
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,210
It's fate.

192
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,210
What fate?

193
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,310
We're having bad luck as soon as we met.

194
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,380
-Bye.
-Wait.

195
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,460
You can leave.

196
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,220
If you don't want to travel with me,

197
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,980
I won't force you.

198
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,900
After all, we're friends.

199
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,960
But we need to have a farewell dinner.

200
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,030
It's your treat.

201
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:45,920
W-Why?

202
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,150
Because I'm hungry.

203
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,310
I'm hungry too.

204
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,070
Yes.

205
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,770
It's Yipin Tomb.

206
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,460
Yes.

207
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,220
I remember now.

208
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:52,820
It's called Yipin Tomb.

209
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,020
Have we met before?

210
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:56,460
Yes.

211
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,150
Are you talking about the strange case at Mount Puchu?

212
00:10:59,150 --> 00:10:59,730
Yes.

213
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,220
It's Mount Puchu.

214
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,650
Several days ago,

215
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,920
seven headless corpses appeared in the mountain.

216
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,520
The constable said the people who saw said they were still moving.

217
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,640
They were all grave robbers.

218
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,300
They wanted to rob

219
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,680
Yipin Tomb.

220
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:15,930
That's why they died.

221
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:18,050
Yipin Tomb is strange.

222
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,160
Let me show you something.

223
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,740
This is the evidence

224
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,060
the magistrate's office got from the corpses.

225
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,100
The half skull is the insignia

226
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,540
of the Fourteen Thieves of the Netherworld.

227
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,400
This is the grave robbers' badge.

228
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,980
I heard the leader of the Fourteen Thieves of the Netherworld

229
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,510
disappeared ten years ago.

230
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,260
Seven headless corpses suddenly appeared,

231
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,100
holding Prince Fangji's treasures

232
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,790
and carrying the grave robbers' badge.

233
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,120
Do you think

234
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,460
they were the Fourteen Thieves of the Netherworld?

235
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,010
Also,

236
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,220
I heard that this has something to do with

237
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,300
the legendary Yipin Tomb.

238
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,040
It’s pretty interesting.

239
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,130
I can cast aside our former grievances and bring you along with me

240
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,170
to investigate this case of the seven thieves‘ corpses.

241
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:00,830
However...

242
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,790
Young Hero Fang,

243
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,900
you’re talking on your own again.

244
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,350
When did I say I wanted to investigate the case with you?

245
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:09,700
You...

246
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,410
Besides,

247
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,590
I don't understand

248
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,570
a single word

249
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,600
of what you said.

250
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,350
It made me sleepy.

251
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,060
We'd better not see each other again.

252
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,740
Fine.

253
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,410
I don't need you to investigate the case.

254
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,420
Take care.

255
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,460
Buddy.

256
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:30,990
Let me ask you.

257
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,800
Is there a black market selling antiques nearby?

258
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,640
Antiques?

259
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,480
Yes.

260
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,890
In the mountain.

261
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,450
It's called Wei's Manor.

262
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,680
Thank you.

263
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,300
I'm here to investigate.

264
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,100
What are you doing here?

265
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,500
I'm here

266
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,000
to sell something.

267
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,820
To sell something?

268
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,190
Selling something in a black market in the mountains?

269
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,720
Are you selling Fox Spirit?

270
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,710
You said Yingzhu Armor is very valuable.

271
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:12,540
I'm here

272
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,830
to ask about the price.

273
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,750
Maybe I can sell it at a good price

274
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,340
and use the money to renovate

275
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,260
my Lotus Tower.

276
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,820
Yingzhu Armor is the martial arts world's great treasure.

277
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,230
You want to sell it to renovate your shabby building?

278

279

Forget it.

280

According to our rules,

you need to pay 100 taels of deposit to do business.

287
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,490
100 taels?

Don't tell me you didn't bring money with you to do business?

We're together.

I can't just watch you get kicked out, right?

295
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,350
At least you have a conscience.

296
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:02,680
Take it.

297
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,980
This piece of hetian jade

298
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,980
is enough for our deposit, right?

299

How could you use my jade pendant

303
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,470
to pay your deposit?

304
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:20,670
Think about it.

305

This jade pendant is the only valuable thing on you.

306
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,310
You had to hand it over anyway.

307
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,900
Since you paid, I won't have to.

308

It's more worth it for both of us to come in.

is a meathead.

349
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,340
He doesn't usually come out,

350
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,400
so he doesn't know our code.

351
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,530
Please forgive him.

352
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,740
What meathead?

353
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,360
How ominous.

354
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,000
Since when were meatheads allowed to the banquet?

355
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,980
When did you set off

356
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,700
and which road did you take?

357
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,760
I left at 20th watch

358
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:05,810
and I took

359
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,000
a solo road.

360
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,290
You're a veteran.

361
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,260
Since you took a solo road,

362
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,230
may I ask if you carried a flag,

363
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,570
and how many words were on it?

364
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,869
I carried a golden flag.

365
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,869
The four words left on the tower of the imperial mausoleum

366
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,660
in the south of the capital 13 years ago.

367
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,339
Greetings, Scholar Sushou.

368
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:45,980
Sir.

369
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,300
I didn't expect you to be here.

370
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,720
I am Ding Yuanzi

371
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,040
of the Gilded Gold Sect.

372
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,230
I am Duan Hai

373
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,660
of the Remnant Ink Sect.

374
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,350
I am Ge Pan

375
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,290
[Ge Pan]

376
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,770
of the Mountain Mortise Sect.

377
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:58,830
We are the brothers

378
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,220
Zhang Qingshi and Zhang Qinghu

379
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,750
of the Heavenly Clock Sect.

380
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,070
I've long heard your name, Sir.

381
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,120
Gu Fengxin!

382
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,500
Sir Sushou took the solo road

383
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,590
like you.

384
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,720
Come and pay your respects.

385
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,590
I'm not interested.

386
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,920
Sir, please forgive him.

387
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,010
Gu entered into this trade halfway.

388
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,160
He doesn't know the rules.

389
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,290
Please forgive him.

390
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:31,910
It's okay.

391
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,110
I'm here for the banquet, not to socialize.

392
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,910
Please make yourselves at home.

393
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,080
What did you mean just now?

394
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,770
It was code.

395
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,770
It's grave robbers' code.

396
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,190
You've followed me all the way here.

397
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,850
You should know where this is.

398
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:57,580
Of course I know.

399
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,790
The outer courtyard of Wei Manor is a black market for antiques.

400
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:02,350
The inner courtyard is a gathering point for grave robbers.

401
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,020
Someone discovered the tomb and came here to gather a team

402
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,460
to go down the tomb together.

403
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,610
I just don't understand

404
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,580
why they suddenly attacked me.

405
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,730
That's because you said something wrong.

406
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:11,790
The time you set off

407
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,360
is the number of years you've been in the trade.

408
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,640
The road you took

409
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,480
is the sect you're from.

410
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,540
The Heavenly Clock

411
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,950
[Heavenly Clock]

412
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,950
[Crimson Phoenix, Green Dragon, White Tiger, Black Tortoise]

413
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,790
observes the sky to look for openings.

414
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,590
The Mountain Mortise looks for tombs based on the terrain.

415
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,010
[Mountain Mortise]

416
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,300
The Remnant Ink references ancient scrolls.

417
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,610
[Remnant ink]

418
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,730
The Gilded Gold uses burial goods that have surfaced as clues.

419
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,110
[Gilded Gold]

420
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:37,010
As for the Bronze Pan and Fire Money, they're all small sects.

421
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,500
You didn't mention any of these

422
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,390
and instead said that you took the official road.

423
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,660
The official road means the magistrate's office,

424
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,860
which is their enemy.

425
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,410
Of course they'll have to kill you.

426
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,160
What does the solo road mean?

427
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,360
It means I entered the trade halfway

428
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,860
without an affiliation to any sect.

429
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,050
These people enter the tomb with their skills

430
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:57,100
and are often killers.

431
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,040
So when they asked if you carried a flag,

432
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,100
it's to ask if you have killed anyone.

433
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,230
You're smart.

434
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,800
A gold flag means I'm a wanted criminal.

435
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:06,980
In that case,

436
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,140
they wouldn't dare to provoke us.

437
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,360
Thirteen years ago, the imperial mausoleum in the south of the capital was robbed.

438
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,130
23 guards were killed.

439
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,300
The arrogant robber left his name, Scholar Sushou,

440
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,740
in front of the tower.

441
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,120
His Majesty was furious.

442
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,420
He ordered the criminal's arrest, but he hasn't been found.

443
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,680
You're pretending to be Scholar Sushou?

444
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,340
You're familiar with

445
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,820
the imperial court's files.

446
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,620
That's right.

447
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,940
So I pretended to be a famous person

448
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,410
to sneak in.

449
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,360
You said you're here for the black market but you came to the inner courtyard.

450
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,530
You're also so fluent in grave robbers' code.

451
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,590
More importantly,

452
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,500
the case of Scholar Sushou is a secret order from the imperial court.

453
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,440
You know it too?

454
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:46,760
Li Lianhua.

455
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,150
There must be something wrong with you.

456
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,150
Don't point at me.

457
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,060
It's rude.

458
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,660
Do you know why

459
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,290
they haven't found Scholar Sushou?

460
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,090
Why?

461
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,690
Because he died.

462
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,190
I buried him myself.

463
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,520
He was badly injured.

464
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,170
I pitied him,

465
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,720
so I allowed him to stay with me

466
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,170
until he passed away.

467
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,260
So

468
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,570
in order to thank me,

469
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,020
he taught me grave robbers' code.

470
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,500
Aren't you familiar with the imperial court's files?

471
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,770
You should know that

472
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,020
Scholar Sushou's name was Qi Zhiyuan

473
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,390
and he had a birthmark on his forehead.

474
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:27,890
Right?

475
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,460
Then why did you come to the inner courtyard?

476
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,340
Because someone was stupid.

477
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,770
Who are you talking about?

478
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,360
Because you're oblivious

479
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,170
and I was afraid you would be exposed.

480
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:41,900
As expected,

481
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,610
you were outed as a meathead and almost got yourself killed.

482
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:45,940
Think about it.

483
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,260
I got confused again.

484
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,720
What is a meathead?

485
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,220
Some people rob graves,

486
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,480
meathead rob corpses.

487
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,020
They even take corpses hostage for a ransom.

488
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,300
They're small fry.

489
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,390
Understand?

490
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,490
Since it's dangerous

491
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,420
and you're here,

492
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:05,180
let's work together again.

493
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,220
One more time.

494
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,420
You're calculating.

495
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,020
No need.

496
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,060
I'm quite safe

497
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,430
posing as Scholar Sushou.

498
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:15,670
You were angry at me for leaving you behind

499
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,330
and borrowing your jade pendant.

500
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,130
You told me to stay away from you.

501
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,500
I think you're right.

502
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,500
It makes sense.

503
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,300
You don't know martial arts.

504
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,250
If you are in danger,

505
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,250
I can protect you.

506
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,500
Thank you.

507
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:26,960
No need.

508
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:27,500
Goodbye.

509
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,440
I think the Zhang Brothers

510
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,360
are related to the seven thieves' corpses case.

511
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,160
I just saw the Fourteen Thieves of the Netherworld's insignia

512
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,960
on their badge.

513
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,910
What does that have to do with me?

514
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,170
You can use your status

515
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,160
to help me.

516
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,080
Besides,

517
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:49,610
we came in together.

518
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,300
If I get caught,

519
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,070
you won't be able to escape either.

520
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:54,900
Fine.

521
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,360
You're ungrateful.

522
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,190
That's right.

523
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,400
Li Lianhua.

524
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,710
Do you agree?

525
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,860
I only guarantee your identity won't be revealed.

526
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,320
The investigation has nothing to do with me.

527
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:08,890
Deal.

528
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,930
Thank you all for gathering at my manor.

529
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,070
[Wei Manor]

530
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,030
I am very honored.

531
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,610
I've long heard of Scholar Sushou's reputation.

532
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,210
I'm the Master of this Manor.

533
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,080
I am very honored

534
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,950
[Master Wei]

535
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:22,740
that you are attending my banquet.

536
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,560
I've just been idle for a long time

537
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,420
and am looking to earn some money.

538
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,070
You came at the right time.

539
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,210
Everyone,

540
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,570
I have a treasure.

541
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,420
Please give me a hand.

542
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,780
Penglai Jade Mountain Vase?

543
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,360
This is one of Prince Fangji's burial goods.

544
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,920
You should know

545
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,610
why I invited you here.

546
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,740
Master Wei’s banquet is indeed

547
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,510
because of Yipin Tomb.

548
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,630
You must have heard about

549
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,290
the case of Mount Puchu's headless corpses.

550
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:58,010
You came here after hearing the news.

551
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,830
I will make sure you have a good time.

552
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,720
Prince Fangji

553
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,270
was the eldest son of Emperor Xicheng 100 years ago,

554
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,240
and the granduncle of the current ruling Emperor.

555
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,500
He was the Crown Prince

556
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:11,000
but got into trouble and was ordered to commit suicide by Emperor Xicheng.

557
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,900
That's how the throne got passed to

558
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,330
His Majesty's grandfather, a member of the royal family.

559
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:16,040
His tomb is called Xi Mausoleum,

560
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,880
and in it are extraordinary treasures.

561
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,280
The martial arts world calls it Yipin Tomb.

562
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,980
Prince Fangji had many martial arts world contacts.

563
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,890
Rumour has it that there are many martial arts treasures,

564
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,910
brilliant weapons, and martial arts mental factors in the tomb.

565
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,310
Over the past hundred years, countless people have been searching for it.

566
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,440
But all have failed.

567
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,800
The tomb seemed to have disappeared.

568
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:38,870
Do you know why Yipin Tomb disappeared?

569
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,010
It had something to do with the reason Prince Fangji was ordered to commit suicide.

570
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:50,220
Back then, the Nanyin Kingdom hadn't been annihilated.

571
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,260
They sent a princess to our kingdom for a marriage alliance.

572
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,920
She married Crown Prince Fangji as his consort.

573
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,350
Prince Fangji was so enamored by her that

574
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,550
he wanted to force his father to abdicate.

575
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,810
Emperor Xicheng was terribly sad and angry,

576
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,810
so he ordered them to commit suicide

577
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:06,210
and forbade them from being buried in the imperial tomb.

578
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:09,070
Nanyin craftsmen were ordered to build their tomb.

579
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,550
Yipin Tomb was built in the Nanyin style.

580
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,920
Nanyin was known for its strange and evil magic,

581
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,460
so it's no wonder no one could find the tomb using the Central Plains' techniques

582
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,860
for over a hundred years.

583
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,940
But now, we're going to find it.

584
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,860
The seven headless bodies on Mount Puchu

585
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:26,190
had not only the treasures Prince Fangji was buried with,

586
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,030
but also

587
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,970
a map of Yipin Tomb.

588
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,970
I didn’t expect that so many years after Wei Manor was established,

589
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,290
Yipin Tomb would show up at my doorstep.

590
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,860
It’s a blessing from the Heavens.

591
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,190
I invited you here

592
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,820
to make a fortune.

593
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:46,680
Master Wei,

594
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:48,630
those seven corpses came out with treasures.

595
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,750
That means they'd entered the tomb.

596
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,470
But why did they die in the wild?

597
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,760
Why did they lose their heads?

598
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,610
Yipin Tomb was built with Nanyin's techniques.

599
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,700
Their traps were strange and powerful.

600
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,740
My guess is

601
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,970
they were beheaded in the tomb.

602
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,960
Their bodies were then flushed out of the tomb

603
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,960
by the heavy rain.

604
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,140
We got lucky.

605
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,100
Everyone here is a master.

606
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,820
We won't repeat their mistake.

607
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,750
If anyone is afraid,

608
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,040
you can leave now.

609
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:24,810
What do you think?

610
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,490
Everyone,

611
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,420
what do you think?

612
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,040
I'm not afraid of making money.

613
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,900
Let's do something big together.

614
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:31,780
Good.

615
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,380
I've prepared a banquet

616
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,410
to welcome you.

617
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,180
Come with me.

618
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,330
Let's go.

619
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,290
Brother.

620
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,780
The Weeping Guanyin we're looking for

621
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,780
is in Yipin Tomb.

622
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,370
What should we do?

623
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,620
No matter what, we must find it.

624
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,060
Let's enter the tomb with them first.

625
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,710
Then,

626
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:02,540
we'll kill them all.

627

[Wei Manor, Yipin Tomb]

628
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,460
[Lotus Tower]

629
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:24,030
Master Wei, the banquet is at Canglu Garden today?

630
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,460
I heard that your Canglu Garden is very auspicious.

631
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,900
Holding the banquet here

632
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,730
is sure to guarantee success.

633
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:30,740
Everyone,

634
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,960
may we make a fortune.

635
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:35,700
Great!

636
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,500
Where did you come from?

637
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,260
You want to die?

638
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:43,770
Guys,

639
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,790
don't fight.

640
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,660
This is my distant elder.

641
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,270
Although he's young,

642
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,850
he is very senior.

643
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,700
Please be seated.

644
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:05,770
Master Wei.

645
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,760
Why are all sorts of things

646
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,810
at your banquet?

647
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:11,570
A cowardly Qiutuo

648
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:13,780
and a meathead are fine.

649
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,460
Now, there's even a rude little turtle.

650
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,620
I've always paid my crew

651
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,140
according to their contribution.

652
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,010
Yipin Tomb is no exception.

653
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,390
If when the time comes,

654
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,670
this young elder of mine is useless,

655
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,880
he won't get paid.

656
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:26,940
Don't worry.

657
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,310
Here.

658
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,590
Don't ruin the mood.

659
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,720
Let's have a drink.

660
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,390
This wine is good.

661
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,850
Good wine.

662
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:46,090
Come.

663
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,450
Brother Gu.

664
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,740
Long time no see.

665
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,830
I was worried

666
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,540
when you first entered the trade

667
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:56,400
that the disciples of the Dunjia Sect would want to make a fortune too.

668
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:00,430
After that, you joined the trade with your sister.

669
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,170
I finally

670
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,510
felt relieved

671
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,560
and at ease.

672
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,190
What is real in life?

673
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:08,560
Gold!

674
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:10,990
Here.

675
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:11,740
Let's drink.

676
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,720
Good wine.

677
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,460
Kid,

678
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,370
Master Wei insisted on taking you with him.

679
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,110
Tell me.

680
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,500
What can you do?

681
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,410
In our business,

682
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,780
if you follow us,

683
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,690
you can't just eat.

684
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:37,830
Come on.

685
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:39,330
Have a drink.

686
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,910
You're real man when you have some hair.

687
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:46,590
Get lost.

688
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,180
My hand!

689
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,180
Come on.

690
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,860
Take Ding Yuanzi to get bandaged.

691
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:54,810
Be careful.

692
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,220
Bastard!

693
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:58,860
I'll teach you a lesson on the behalf of your Master!

694
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,420
Hold on.

695
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,060
Brother Qingshi.

696
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,380
Calm down for good luck.

697
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,020
Sir Sushou.

698
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:06,460
What do you mean?

699
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:08,720
It's not a good sign

700
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,910
to start fighting before the job.

701
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:19,010
Young man,

702
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,180
why did you do that?

703
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:23,210
We're here to make money.

704
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,600
Harmony brings wealth.

705
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,330
Harmony brings wealth, right?

706
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,620
Zhang Brothers,

707
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,180
I know you don't like it.

708
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:38,180
But my young elder has unique martial arts skills.

709
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,740
Only he can open the entrance to Yipin Tomb.

710
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,540
Even I have to put up with him.

711
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,540
Just bear with it.

712
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,560
How about this?

713
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,380
Let's hold another banquet at the pond outside the courtyard.

714
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,390
The Zhang Brothers and I will enjoy the moon

715
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,740
while drinking to our hearts' content.

716
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,620
I have a few vats of Xifenglie on my Manor

717
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,020
that have been ageing for ten years.

718
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,460
I know you like strong wine.

719
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:58,840
Don't miss it.

720
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,030
Everyone.

721
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,330
Let's go together.

722
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,500
Didn't he say there's going to be another banquet?

723
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,900
You're leaving already?

724
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,820
I'm sleepy.

725
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,610
At the banquet just now,

726
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,500
you suddenly hinted to me not to drink.

727
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,200
Why?

728
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,290
I just don't like drinking.

729
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,260
Forget it.

730
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:39,340
Since you were kind to that kid,

731
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:40,450
I'll let it slide.

732
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,240
If that kid

733
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,660
really got hit by Zhang Qingshi,

734
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,290
he'll die.

735
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:48,630
Yes.

736
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:49,980
If he hit him,

737
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,160
he'll die.

738
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,770
If the headless corpse case

739
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:58,380
can really lead to the Yipin Tomb that disappeared a hundred years ago,

740
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,120
it will surely astound the world

741
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,920
and give the Master of Baichuan Court a good shock.

742
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:06,570
You're really not interested in investigating the case with me?

743
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:07,860
Aren't you sleepy?

744
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,110
What are you waiting for?

745
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,710
Eight for you and nine for me.

746
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,940
What does that mean?

747
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,220
The bedrooms.

748
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:30,860
Master Wei loves gambling.

749
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,910
He used dice for room numbers.

750
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:33,780
Alright.

751
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:34,940
Go to sleep.

752
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,480
I have something to do.

753
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,620
Where are you going?

754
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,150
The Zhang Brothers have

755
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,300
the badge of the Fourteen Thieves.

756
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:44,660
I also heard them say they wanted to kill

757
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,940
all the people who were going to enter Yipin Tomb.

758
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,280
So I suspect the seven thieves' corpses case

759
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,300
is related to them.

760
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,230
I'll go see them.

761
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,080
I'll be off.

762
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,280
[Wei Manor]

763
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,620
Brother!

764
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,440
Zhang Qingshi is dead.

765
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,810
His head is gone,

766
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:41,020
just like the seven corpses down the mountain.

767
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,300
Zhang Qinghu.

768
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:45,580
What happened?

769
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,310
I didn't see anything.

770
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,090
I don't know.

771
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,660
You two slept in the same room.

772
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,140
How did you not see the murderer?

773
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,900
Did someone sneak in

774
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,150
when you left the room?

775
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:02,880
Impossible.

776
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:04,700
I just got up to pass urine,

777
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,700
right at the door.

778
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,420
I would know if anyone came in.

779
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,720
But I don't know why

780
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,210
when I turned around,

781
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,430
my brother became like this.

782
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:14,790
The window is locked from inside.

783
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,810
You can't kill and decapitate someone in such a short time.

784
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:20,130
Plus, the other brother was here all along

785
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,730
and didn't notice anything.

786
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:23,920
What kind of martial arts master could have done this?

787
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,460
Maybe it wasn't martial arts,

788
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,340
but sorcery.

789
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,739
I heard

790
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:30,080
Yipin Tomb is protected by sorcery.

791
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,070
Anyone who has designs on it

792
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,530
will be killed by sorcery.

793
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:35,179
The seven corpses at the foot of the mountain

794
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:36,710
lost their heads like this.

795
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,620
Zhang Qingshi is the same now.

796
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:39,980
Will it...

797
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:42,420
Will it be our turn next?

798
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:48,080
This sorcery is very generous.

799
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:51,980
Sir.

800
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,389
What do you mean?

801
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,179
If it were really sorcery,

802
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:57,510
it could have decapitated your brother in front of everyone

803
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:00,210
so no one would dare to go to Yipin Tomb.

804
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,460
Instead, it prevented Zhang Qinghu

805
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,980
from seeing this cruel scene.

806
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,350
It's rather empathetic.

807
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,710
The most important thing now

808
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,090
is to check if there are any other entrances

809
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,500
to this room.

810
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:22,440
You went to investigate the Zhang Brothers last night?

811
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,340
I've been looking for a chance to tell you.

812
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,460
I came out of Canglu Garden and followed them,

813
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,770
but they disappeared in the blink of an eye.

814
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:29,270
Why do you always make mistakes?

815
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,500
I always thought the seven thieves' corpses case

816
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,430
was done by them,

817
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,290
so they were vigilant and avoided me.

818
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,950
I didn't expect Zhang Qingshi

819
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,900
to become a headless corpse too.

820
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,430
Is there really some kind of sorcery?

821
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,860
I'm not getting involved in the investigation.

822
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,190
I'm not counting on you.

823
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,060
That's good.

824
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,240
Look.

825
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:57,990
Look.

826
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,660
The vent at the back of the room is broken.

827
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,720
If someone entered from here,

828
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,090
they could commit the murder without Zhang Qinghu realizing.

829
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,940
The entrance is just one chi wide.

830
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,270
How could anyone get in?

831
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,740
No adult could get in.

832
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:13,400
You mean the kid at the banquet?

833
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:19,100
That kid is sinister and vicious.

834
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,200
Zhang Qingshi had an argument with him.

835
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,530
It's possible that he would seek revenge.

836
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,650
Bastard.

837
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,370
Bastard! Stop!

838
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,660
Did you kill my brother?

839
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,990
Who do you think you are?

840
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,340
How dare you talk to me?

841
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,180
I'll crush your arm.

842
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,220
I'll see if you'll confess or not.

843
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,540
-Wait.
-You...

844
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:54,680
Wait.

845
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,750
Are you helping this bastard?

846
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,340
I’m just here to tell you

847
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,460
the murderer was someone else.

848
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,400
I received a secret letter

849
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:11,200
saying that a detective from Baichuan Court is among us.

850
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,780
The Zhang Brothers' martial arts skills are unique.

851
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,820
If they worked together,

852
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,160
it'd be hard for anyone to get the better of them.

853
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,190
He must have killed Zhang Qingshi

854
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,530
to weaken our strength

855
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,880
and make us suspicious of one another.

856
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:26,340
So Zhang Qingshi must have been killed by the detective.

857
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:29,230
In our trade, we meet once every few years

858
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,840
or not at all in person.

859
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,330
How do we know who is a detective from Baichuan Court?

860
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,040
I already know who he is.

861
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,700
"The hundred rivers flow down at once,

862
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,820
flushing away the murky and bringing out the clear."

863
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:22,670
Ge Pan, you are indeed from Baichuan Court.

864
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:29,470
Guards.

865
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,920
Drag him out and kill him.

866
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,340
Wait.

867
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:36,790
Master Wei,

868
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:38,970
there’s something wrong.

869
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,100
If the murderer were Ge Pan,

870
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,490
how could he

871
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,340
have avoided

872
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,200
Zhang Qinghu, who was at the door?

873
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:48,510
He wouldn't have been able to get through that small vent.

874
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:49,060
Exactly.

875
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:52,020
This little thing is the most suspicious.

876
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,040
Everyone,

877
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,960
I have a question.

878
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,130
I can vouch for my young elder.

879
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,910
Who dares to vouch

880
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,890
for the Baichuan Court's detective?

881
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:07,750
Even if he didn't kill anyone,

882
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,690
do we still want him to stay?

883
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,380
Since you have no objections,

884
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:19,300
let's send Ge Pan off.

885
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,750
Don't kill the innocent!

886
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:23,880
You're so concerned about someone from Baichuan Court.

887
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,390
Are you his associate?

888
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:27,140
I...

889
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,310
Hold on.

890
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:40,620
What advice do you have?

891
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,880
I'm flattered.

892
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:46,670
It's just that a detective of Baichuan Court sneaked in.

893
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,800
He must have backup.

894
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,860
If he has accomplices,

895
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,910
everyone will be in danger.

896
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:54,010
So my suggestion is

897
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,880
to spare his life for now.

898
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,320
After we find out the truth tomorrow,

899
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,710
we can rest easy.

900
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,990
Since Scholar Sushou has said this,

901
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,690
I have no objection.

902
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:07,980
What about you, Brother Qinghu?

903
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:08,360
Okay.

904
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,250
I'll wait for the good news from Scholar Sushou.

905
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,050
In that case,

906
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,730
thank you.

907
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:16,680
Guards.

908
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,200
Take him away.

909
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:20,880
Let's go.

910
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,580
There are so many detectives from Baichuan Court

911
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,470
at Wei Manor.

912
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,320
Do you know Ge Pan?

913
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:41,040
I've never trained at Baichuan Court.

914
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,810
I'm not sure.

915
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,160
But this weapon

916
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,410
indeed belongs to Baichuan Court.

917
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,610
So I had to save Ge Pan.

918
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:50,200
Thank you for helping me just now.

919
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,020
Thank you.

920
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,900
I wasn't helping you.

921
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,540
I’m afraid of death, Young Hero Fang.

922
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,190
We came in together.

923
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,400
If you start fighting,

924
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,680
I would be implicated.

925
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,830
After thinking about it,

926
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,210
I'd either have to rat you out

927
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,000
or help you.

928
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,760
I could only choose one of them.

929
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:09,490
Take it.

930
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,320
Rat me out?

931
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,520
What do you mean?

932
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,720
You haven't finished.

933
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:22,500
Fine.

934
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:24,850
I'll deal with you later.

935
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,780
There seems to be no entrance

936
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:32,230
other than the main door and the vent.

937
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,560
Did the kid really do it?

938
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,340
Let me ask you.

939
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,200
If you were that kid

940
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,760
and you wanted to climb into the room through the back wall,

941
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,820
how would you do it?

942
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,420
One, dig a hole.

943
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,510
Two, climb in.

944
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,940
Three, murder.

945
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,040
Take it.

946
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,210
The murderer's steps were different from what you said.

947
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:06,960
There's blood on it.

948
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,500
If he dug a hole through the bricks

949
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,030
before climbing in to kill,

950
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:12,790
blood wouldn't get on this brick.

951
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:14,320
There's blood on the brick.

952
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:16,890
It means the murderer killed

953
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,310
before making the hole.

954
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,260
So the murderer framed the kid?

955
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,070
What else?

956
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,900
But the murderer didn't leave any clues

957
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,580
in the seven thieves' corpses case.

958
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,780
Now, he's trying to frame someone else?

959
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,970
Do you think just because headless corpses showed up at Mount Buchu,

960
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,100
that it was all done by the same person?

961
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,060
You mean

962
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:38,060
these two cases might not be related?

963
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,030
I don't know.

964
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:42,840
I only know that the blood on Zhang Qingshi's clothes

965
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,560
seeped through the layers.

966
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,040
It didn't spurt out.

967
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:48,010
The blood splattered on one side,

968
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:50,140
but there was nothing behind the body.

969
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,170
So he died

970
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:53,220
before his head was chopped off.

971
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,480
He didn't die from being beheaded.

972
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,320
But he's dead.

973
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,010
Why did the killer behead him when he was already dead?

974
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:58,870
The head is a very strange thing.

975
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,230
It can reveal a lot of secrets

976
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:02,720
whether a person is dead or alive.

977
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,510
What do you mean?

978
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,300
Now,

979
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,510
we need to investigate

980
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:10,790
Zhang Qingshi's case.

981
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:14,370
The murderer killed him

982
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:17,120
before digging a hole in the wall to frame someone else.

983
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,180
That means he must have entered through the front door.

984
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:22,530
But Zhang Qinghu stayed in the same room,

985
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,720
and didn't see anything.

986
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,340
What if they didn't

987
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,800
stay in the same room?
