4
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,670
Kid,

5
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,920
don't say I didn't remind you.

6
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,800
This is the tomb of Prince Fangji and Princess Nanyin.

7
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,630
If you touch it, your whole family will be executed.

[Weeping Guanyin]

00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,560
Weeping Guanyin?

10
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,010
Hand over the Weeping Guanyin!

11
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,020
Do you want to die?

12
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,750
It's rare that someone can sustain my attack.

13
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,400
But...

14
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,520
What a pity.

15
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,560
So this is what you want.

16
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,170
Goodbye.

17
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,040
You're chasing me so closely.

18
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,170
I don't want it then.

19
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,329
Whirling Steps?

20
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,579
It's really you.

Finally, all my old injuries have been healed.

24
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,870
It's worth my effort to hide my identity

25
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,820
with the Bone Constriction Skill.

26
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,880
Li Xiangyi, I’m going to meet you now.

27
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,570
It’s been ten years.

28
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,450
Li Xiangyi, how've you been?

29
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,970
Director Di.

30
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,120
You're still so clingy after not seeing each other for ten years.

31
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,440
That's why you recognized me at Wei Manor.

32
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,120
Or what?

33
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,100
Every day, for the past ten years, I've been wanting to

34
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,560
have a duel with you again.

35
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,740
But they said you were dead.

36
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,670
Why are you so happy that I'm not dead?

37
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,160
Excuse me. I've to go.

38
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,520
I have to go back to cook.

39
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,720
Why do you only have 10% of your power left?

40
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,690
You were poisoned by my Mingyue Chenxihai

41
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:47,010
and I was poisoned by your Beifeng Cuibahuang.

42
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,650
It's normal to be injured.

43
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:52,840
Even before taking Weeping Guanyin,

44
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,300
I still had 60% of my power.

45
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,600
What have you been doing for the past ten years?

46
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,350
To be honest,

47
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,400
I've been busy for the past ten years.

48
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,130
I was busy taking care of myself

49
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,640
and living a good life.

50
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,550
By the way,

51
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,510
I also learned how to cook.

52
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,180
Cooking?

53
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,480
Yes, cooking.

54
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:10,290
I'm quite good at it.

55
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,590
How could Li Xiangyi, the great Sect Leader of the Sigu Sect

56
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,480
and the best martial artist in the world,

57
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,140
have spent ten years doing such mundane things?

58
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,160
Director Di, you're too assertive.

59
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,980
These daily life skills are harder than martial arts training.

60
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,110
You know what? Cooking is even harder.

61
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,640
To cook a good dish,

62
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,700
you have to be very particular to its quality.

63
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,950
Try it someday if you don't believe me.

64
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,040
-I don’t want to listen to your nonsense.
-Make a dish of stir-fried cabbage.

65
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,330
Come with me now to find the elixir.

66
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:33,880
Wait.

67
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,270
If supplements really work,

68
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,360
why did you have to use the Bone Constriction Skill

69
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,690
to get Weeping Guanyin?

70
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,980
They're useless.

71
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,140
Besides,

72
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,190
I don't care to use them now.

73
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:46,830
Moreover,

74
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,250
I'm fine now.

75
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,360
I have more vitality than before.

76
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,520
I didn't expect you to have been

77
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,720
living like a dog for the past ten years.

78
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,950
You are the dog.

79
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,380
You want to be a loser?

80
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:56,990
Fine.

81
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,760
I'll grant you your wish.

82
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,100
I'll take you to Baichuan Court now

83
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,310
and let your men see

84
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,700
what Li Xiangyi, the Sect Leader of the Sigu Sect,

85
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,750
has become.

86
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,340
If you don't want dignity,

87
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,530
I'll make you lose all your dignity.

88
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,000
Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.

89
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,330
I can't take it anymore.

90
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,820
I'm going to throw up.

91
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:23,670
Throw up.

92
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,130
I-I can't.

93
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,290
I just lied to get you to stop.

94
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,880
You were flying too high.

95
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:33,820
If your inner power is interrupted,

96
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,540
you'll suffer a terrible fall.

97
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,470
What do you mean?

98
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,580
My inner power?

99
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,700
Stop trying.

100
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,060
Your inner power has been blocked.

101
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,810
The Weeping Guanyin?

102
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,460
Smart.

103
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,880
You poisoned it.

104
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,150
Don't come over.

105
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,850
A gentleman doesn’t resort to violence.

106
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,659
It's Asura Grass from the Yipin Tomb.

107
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,409
One of Nanyin's Three Magical Techniques, Asura Grass?

108
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,230
Not bad.

109
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,190
Director Di is really knowledgeable indeed.

110
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,250
It's been 100 years

111
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,940
but the corpse of Princess Nanyin in the tomb hasn't rotted

112
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,140
because she has Asura Grass in her body.

113
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,320
But just now,

114
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,660
I also took some grass seeds from her body

115
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,840
and put them in the Weeping Guanyin.

116
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,910
This thing grows rapidly when it's met with blood.

117
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,640
Now, the Asura Grass has blocked your meridians.

118
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,570
Li Xiangyi.

119
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,290
Did you plan all this long ago?

120
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,990
I just went to Yu City,

121
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,930
and found out you're still alive.

122
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,520
After you left the borders,

123
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,220
you'd definitely go look for the elixir to heal your injuries.

124
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,220
Then it must be the Weeping Guanyin.

125
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,490
I've heard some old stories before,

126
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,059
that the Weeping Guanyin was buried with Prince Fangji.

127
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:53,320
Isn't it a coincidence

128
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,930
that strange things also happened on Mount Puchu?

129
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,300
Then, I wanted to go out and have some fun.

130
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:00,790
I didn't expect

131
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,000
to see a kid with a sword on his back

132
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,430
throwing a tantrum in broad daylight.

133
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,420
It's been so many years

134
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,690
and you still haven't changed a bit.

135
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:08,730
I can tell that.

136
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:09,620
Li Xiangyi.

137
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,410
You haven't been training your martial arts skills,

138
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,270
but you've become more scheming.

139
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,170
Don't.

140
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,740
You want to kill me with Asura Grass?

141
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,100
Before that,

142
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,760
do you believe I'll kill you first?

143
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,600
You're thinking too much.

144
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,660
I just

145
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,450
need your help with something.

146
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,680
Are you threatening me?

147
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,150
How could I threaten you?

148
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,720
We've known each other for a long time.

149
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,430
I know you.

150
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,550
You

151
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,830
are the least susceptible to threats.

152
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,600
How about this?

153
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,010
Put down your sword first and let's talk.

154
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,730
After this matter is settled,

155
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,170
I'll give you a gift.

156
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,900
The Mantra of Inner Body Cleansing.

157
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,960
Your master's ultimate skill?

158
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,760
That's right.

159
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,650
This skill can reverse the heart's pulse

160
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,750
and expel the strands of Asura Grass out of your body,

161
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,050
and restore your inner power.

162
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:11,650
Of course.

163
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,930
If you don't agree,

164
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,040
I won't force you.

165
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,110
You can just kill me with the sword.

166
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,860
What's the matter?

167
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,100
It's simple.

168
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,630
Firstly,

169
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,150
keep the secret of my identity for me.

170
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,850
Secondly,

171
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,860
where are the remains of my senior Shan Gudao?

172
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,300
I thought you wanted me to dissolve the Jinyuan Alliance,

173
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,020
or not hurt anyone in the martial world.

174
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,630
I can help you with the first thing.

175
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,610
I don't care if you're self-abasing.

176
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,240
I can't help you with the second thing.

177
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,680
Your senior has been dead for ten years.

178
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,040
The martial arts world has been in chaos for ten years.

179
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,240
I can't find his body.

180
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,960
Then, the Jinyuan Alliance killed my senior

181
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,250
and stole his remains.

182
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,800
That's why I fought against you at the East Sea.

183
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,130
Over the past ten years,

184
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,090
I've been looking for his remains.

185
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,790
But I never found them.

186
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,180
With your order,

187
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,690
I'm sure you can summon the Jinyuan Alliance to investigate the past again

188
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,150
and help me find my senior.

189
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,200
It's not impossible that your senior was eaten by a wild dog.

190
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,120
Do you want me to kill all the wild dogs in the world

191
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,050
to find the remains of your senior?

192
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,860
If that's the case,

193
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,420
Director Di,

194
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,250
I'm afraid you'll have to say goodbye

195
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,880
to your supreme martial arts skills.

196
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,660
Li Xiangyi.

197
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,530
Do you really think I won’t exhaust the torture methods

198
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,060
to force you to detoxify me?

199
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:43,710
You will.

200
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,720
Of course you will.

201
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,600
When you were feeling out my aura,

202
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,110
you realized that I don't have long to live.

203
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,970
What's the point of doing all that

204
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,930
to a dying man like me?

205
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,080
Stop wasting your time.

206
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,130
Otherwise, if I die before

207
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,660
I find my senior,

208
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,820
you'll be wasting your energy.

209
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,830
Greetings, My Lord.

210
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,720
Which coroner examined

211
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,220
Shan Gudao's corpse ten years ago?

212
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:25,880
My Lord.

213
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,400
Among the coroners in the Alliance,

214
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,060
Shi Hun has the best technique.

215
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,350
He must have been in charge of what you ordered.

216
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,390
Where is he now?

217
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,490
Because of the great battle ten years ago,

218
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,920
all the outstanding people in the Alliance were dispersed.

219
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,520
With the status of a coroner,

220
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,590
he has long disappeared and hidden from the martial arts world.

221
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,070
But I remember that

222
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,550
when Shi Hun was young,

223
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,410
he was adopted by a monk from Pudu Temple.

224
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,120
After he left the Alliance,

225
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,890
he might have returned to Pudu Temple.

226
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,150
My Lord, do you want me to investigate it?

227
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:51,640
No need.

228
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:55,420
Pudu Temple and Baichuan Court were built together.

229
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,900
I'll go there myself.

230
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,010
Don't tell anyone about this.

231
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,890
Tell the Alliance I have something personal to deal with.

232
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,180
Tell them not to bother me.

233
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:02,620
Yes.

234
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:08,460
Let's go,

235
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,840
to Pudu Temple.

236
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,070
Do you not dare to go?

237
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,050
Are you afraid that your men at Baichuan Court will see you like this?

238
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:21,890
That's not it.

239
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,690
Before I leave,

240
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,740
I have to bring someone with me.

241
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:26,750
Fang Duobing?

242
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,080
Smart.

243
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,610
You are really troublesome now.

244
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,180
Fang Duobing.

245
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,360
Fang Duobing?

246
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,360
Li Lianhua.

247
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,390
Are you okay?

248
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,190
Calm down.

249
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,720
Don't worry.

250
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:31,860
I'm fine.

251
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,570
I'm skilled at running away.

252
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,720
That brat is so good at martial arts.

253
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:40,410
By the way,

254
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,560
where is that little thing?

255
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,220
Where is he?

256
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,460
He left.

257
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,060
He left?

258
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,700
What about the Weeping Guanyin?

259
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,550
Hurry and go after him!

260
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,800
Calm down. Calm down.

261
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,360
You haven't recovered yet.

262
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,420
I told you.

263
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,470
He took it.

264
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,050
Actually, this brat

265
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,190
meticulously planned all this

266
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,190
to cure his illness.

267
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,070
So,

268
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,210
I used this Weeping Guanyin

269
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,180
to exchange a lifetime of him not doing evil again,

270
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,580
and he naturally agreed.

271
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:09,710
That simple?

272
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,450
Not at all.

273
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,540
In order to convince him,

274
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,070
I'd exhausted all my words.

275
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,230
But luckily,

276
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,670
that brat is a man of his word.

277
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,300
He's just a bit impolite.

278
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,620
What about you?

279
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,570
Without the Weeping Guanyin, your heart disease...

280
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,610
I'll be fine.

281
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,430
I've survived for so many years.

282
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,870
Don't worry. I won't die.

283
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,320
After all, it's quite nice now.

284
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,940
Since I could convince that brat to stop hurting people,

285
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,800
it's all worth it.

286
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,310
You're still quite chivalrous.

287
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:36,640
Don't worry.

288
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,670
I've long regarded you as my partner.

289
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,090
Even if I have to search all the magical herbs in the world for your heart disease's elixir,

290
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,290
I will find it for you.

291
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,850
As for whether you regard me as a partner,

292
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,460
I don't care.

293
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,720
What else can I do?

294
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,680
I can't get rid of you anyway.

295
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,270
Take this.

296
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,230
Let me tell you.

297
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,590
Now that the entrance of Yipin tomb is open,

298
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,670
many bandits will barge in

299
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,160
to steal these treasures.

300
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,340
There's no time to lose.

301
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,500
Go and report it.

302
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,480
Besides,

303
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,070
you should be solving your second big case now.

304
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,360
Can you stop mentioning it?

305
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,560
Everyone is dead now.

306
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,880
Who can testify for me?

307
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,640
Have you forgotten

308
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,650
that the one you hit at the entrance

309
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:21,910
is still alive?

310
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:24,710
That's right.

311
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,750
Who is blocking the way?

312
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,150
He's one of us.

313
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,860
He's the Iron Head Slave

314
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,540
who wore an iron helmet.

315
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,370
Remember?

316
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,140
The Iron Head Slave.

317
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,050
No wonder he looks so cold.

318
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,020
When did Iron Head Slave become one of us?

319
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,280
His name is Fei.

320
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:26,790
He's from the South Sea.

321
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,740
Many years ago,

322
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,400
I got acquainted with him.

323
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,280
Later, he was tricked by Master Wei

324
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,700
and was taken in as their Iron Head Slave.

325
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,829
I felt sorry for him.

326
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,310
I saw that he was homeless,

327
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,800
so I decided to take him in for a while.

328
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,970
It's just nice. You're taking Ge Pan to Baichuan Court

329
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:43,220
while I'm taking him to Pudu Temple

330
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,190
to find another old friend of his.

331
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,170
You talk so much nonsense.

332
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,290
You...

333
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,620
Who are you scolding?

334
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,470
How rude.

335
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,540
You don't have to argue with him.

336
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,860
It will degrade your status.

337
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,490
No.

338
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,260

00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:09,890
I was wrong about you.

506
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,060
Life is unpredictable.

507
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,160
Entanglements are unintentional.

508
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,630
Look.

509
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,670
The scenery here is so beautiful.

510
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:21,320
Just treat it like I no longer have any desires.

511
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,770
Right now, I just want to find my senior's remains.

512
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,780
Let's split up later.

513
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,800
Go the monks at Pudu Temple and investigate

514
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,710
the whereabouts of Shi Hun.

515
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:32,440
I'll go check if there's any record on the name list.

516
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:32,960
Thanks.

517
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:33,940
Here.

518
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,610
Give me a hand. I really can't walk anymore.

519
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:54,640
[Pudu Temple]

520
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,740
Slowly.

521
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:16,810
Bhante.

522
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:20,050
How's it going about what I'd asked you?

523
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,520
What Shi Hun? What Huiyuan?

524
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:24,330
I know nothing about it.

525
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,630
Ever since you became the abbot,

526
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,430
your temper has been very bad.

527
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,500
Listen.

528
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,980
You need to cultivate yourself.

529
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,020
I was seeking for some peace and quiet,

530
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,290
but secular affairs are inherently disturbing.

531
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,470
No matter how good my cultivation is,

532
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:41,120
you'd still manage to infuriate me.

533
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,840
Are you aware of your physical condition?

534
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,170
That's why I'm anxious.

535
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:45,840
Bhante.

536
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,830
If you can't find Shi Hun,

537
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:50,610
I wouldn't be able to find my senior's remains.

538
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:53,090
Then, how can I face my master?

539
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,220
Besides,

540
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,260
I'm afraid I'll become a lonely wild ghost.

541
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,910
Look at you.

542
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,430
You've already thought about becoming a ghost.

543
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,270
So I'm really worried.

544
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,200
Can you stop being stubborn?

545
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,550
Who dares to be stubborn in front of the Almsgiver Li?

546
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,840
I thought you would come back after you made up your mind.

547
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,160
But you actually left for ten years.

548
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,470
I wrote to you once I heard some news.

549
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,150
Where is the letter?

550
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,190
Was it sent into the dog's stomach?

551
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:26,880
Letter?

552
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,540
You actually wrote to me?

553
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:31,980
You...

554
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,830
Where is the letter?

555
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:34,970
Was it you?

556
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,280
Bhante.

557
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,570
I don't have a fixed place to live.

558
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,620
I'm afraid it's lost.

559
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,580
You're being willful.

560
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,690
Then, I shortened your life to ten years,
but you didn't save yourself.

561
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:54,150
Now you should have one out of ten years left.

562
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,010
But your pulse

563
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,300
is much weaker than I expected.

564
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,810
It won't even last a year.

565
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,490
You should have gone back to Baichuan Court earlier.

566
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,140
Coincidentally,

567
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,330
everyone is there today.

568
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,530
All your old friends of Sigu Sect are here.

569
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:13,130
I'll take you back and vouch for your identity.

570
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,090
The martial arts world is huge.

571
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:18,690
If everyone put their heads together, they'll definitely figure a way to save you.

572
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:28,680
Why are you resisting me with your life?

573
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:00,270
In the year of Dingyou,

574
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,600
a greedy thief was

575
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,270
expelled from the temple.

576
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,890
Then, he joined the Jinyuan Alliance

577
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,550
and took on the name of Shi Hun.

578
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,640
It's recorded here.

579
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,200
You're so stubborn.

580
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,960
I really can't force you.

581
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,220
Did something happen in Baichuan Court?

582
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:49,160
I thought you're stone-hearted

583
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,490
and have completely erased your past.

584
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,370
So you still care about them.

585
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,050
I heard that

586
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,580
Yun Piqiu has been isolating himself in Baichuan Court for ten years.

587
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,700
I hastily guessed that

588
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,500
he was the one who poisoned you

589
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,010
with Bicha Poison then.

590
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,250
After he knew something happened to you,

591
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,170
Yun Biqiu regretted it so much,

592
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:19,050
so he rushed to the East Sea and searched for you for months but to no avail.

593
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,640
When Master Bai found him,

594
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,540
he had no intention to resist,

595
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,420
and was stabbed through the chest by Master Bai.

596
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:29,060
Fortunately, Master Ji found out that

597
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:31,800
he was indeed bewitched by the evil.

598
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,130
He didn't mean to hurt you.

599
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,280
So Master Ji sent someone to save him and made him stay.

600
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:42,530
But Yun Biqiu has been imprisoning himself for ten years,

601
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,020
and refuses to forgive himself.

602
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,120
Let me guess again.

603
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:52,140
It's not this matter that you can't let go of.

604
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:56,760
After all, what happened back then is like a chain reaction.

605
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,580
Someone has to let it go first.

606
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:01,480
Bhante.

607
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:05,130
You are really good at guessing.

608
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,970
But don't worry and talk about him anymore.

609
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:11,690
Tell me.

610
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:16,980
Did something happen to Baichuan Court?

611
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,050
Don't worry.

612
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,490
Baichuan Court is fine.

613
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,860
It just recently got a new sword.

614
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,090
So they

615
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:29,340
sent out invitations to all the friends of Sigu Sect

616
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,340
to a Sword-Appreciation Ceremony.

617
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,080
This sword

618
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,320
was your personal sword in the past,

619
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,010
the Shaoshi Sword.

620
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:44,480
Then, many people followed the Shaoshi Sword into the East Sea.

621
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:47,800
Several years later, someone went fishing in the East Sea

622
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,260
and recovered this sword.

623
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,570
After that, the sword was resold repeatedly

624
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,590
until it returned to Baichuan Court.

625
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:57,970
It'd been used by 43 hands.

626
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,430
The fate of a famous sword.

627
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,460
Don't you think

628
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:05,690
it's time the sword return to its owner?

629
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:09,310
This famous sword

630
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:13,230
will naturally find a good master.

631
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,700
What about people?

632
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,680
Forget about others.

633
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,350
There's someone you have to meet.

634
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:27,980
Miss Qiao is also in Baichuan Court.

635
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,130
All these years,

636
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:34,570
she has been going to the temple to pray for you every year,

637
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,030
but she never lit the Rebirth Lantern.

638
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:40,330
Because no matter what, she refused to believe

639
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,070
that you're dead.

640
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:44,750
All these years,

641
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:47,340
Mr. Xiao has been guarding her laboriously.

642
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,139
She's waiting intently for you,

643
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:51,850
but you refuse to return even though you're alive.

644
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:53,000
Don't you want to

645
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:56,540
resolve this misery?

646
00:34:58,850 --> 00:34:59,909
Me not intervening

647
00:35:01,389 --> 00:35:02,920
would be the best solution.

648
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,179
But you'll regret it in the end.

649
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,340
Life

650
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:08,450
is full of regrets.

651
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,460
It's been ten years.

652
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,380
There's nothing you can't let go.

653
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,920
And there's nothing that can't be solved.

654
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,280
I'm to blame for my incompetence.

655
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:25,190
I failed to persuade someone with a cold heart.

656
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,180
Bhante.

657
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,520
Would you answer my question now?

658
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,200
About Shi Hun of the Jinyuan Alliance?

659
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,140
Yes.

660
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:45,030
He's indeed Huiyuan who was expelled from Pudu Temple.

661
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,230
After the battle at the East Sea,

662
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,610
did you hear anything about Shi Hun?

663
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,730
When Baichuan Court was newly established,

664
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:57,660
they once captured the remnants of the defeated troops of Jinyuan Alliance from everywhere

665
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,410
and imprisoned hundreds of thousands men.

666
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,560
After that, Miss Qiao suggested

667
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:06,770
releasing ordinary allies who have never done evil.

668
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,100
The name list of the released

669
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:11,460
was decided by Miss Qiao herself.

670
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:15,380
She must know who you are looking for.

671
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:18,930
The matters of the world are so mysterious.

672
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,860
You end up having to meet someone you don't want to.

673
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:32,860
Time to eat.

674
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,220
I cherish my life.

675
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,010
I never treat myself badly.

676
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:36,820
Come on.

677
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:38,270
Share the meal with me.

678
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:42,170
There's a new chef named Jingren in the temple.

679
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,430
He's quite a good cook.

680
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,410
Over the past half a month,

681
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,230
I've been eating a lot more.

682
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,630
I've sinned.

683
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,030
Oil paper,

684
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:53,710
and charcoal residue?

685
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:56,860
Come on.

686
00:36:58,530 --> 00:36:59,120
Bhante.

687
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,160
Has your new cook been eating secretly?

688
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,620
I won't join you in the meal.

689
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,260
Goodbye.

690
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,840
How did your investigation go?

691
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,850
Over the past ten years,

692
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,690
there are no records of Shi Hun visiting Pudu Temple.

693
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,550
Qiao Wanmian is the only clue now.

694
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,140
I'll go if you don't want to.

695
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:26,220
Don't worry.

696
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,700
We'll definitely figure everything out.

697
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,460
Director Di.

698
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,570
Now that you have no inner power,

699
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,250
you should keep a low profile.

700
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:40,820
[Baichuan Court]

701
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,210
For today's Sword-Appreciation Ceremony at Baichuan Court,

702
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:44,670
you need an invitation or referrer to enter.

703
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:45,920
Li Lianhua.

704
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,310
You came.

705
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:50,550
Yes.

706
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:52,950
It's the Sword-Appreciation Ceremony.

707
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:55,160
Fei insisted on joining in the fun.

708
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,060
By the way,

709
00:37:58,490 --> 00:37:59,490
this is my friend.

710
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,240
He got quite famous recently.

711
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,640
He's the master of Lotus Tower, Li Lianhua.

712
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:04,540
As for this,

713
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,200
he's just a handyman.

714
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,830
I'll be the referrer and bring them in.

715
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,520
Let's go. Let's go.

716
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,920
Let me take you to a place.

717
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,270
Come on.

718
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,530
Before the Sword-Appreciation Ceremony,

719
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,860
let me formally introduce someone to you.

720
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,780
This is the portrait of my master, Li Xiangyi.

721
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:45,730
It looks quite ordinary.

722
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,790
It can really ward off evil spirits.

723
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:49,830
Watch your mouth.

724
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:50,840
Be careful.

725
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,940
Since Baichuan Court was established,

726
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,780
his portrait has been hung up here.

727
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,910
It's been ten years.

728
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,420
No one can forget him.

729
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:03,740
By the way,

730
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,260
do you have candy with you?

731
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:05,920
Give me two.

732
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,280
What are you looking at?

733
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,520
I know you like candy.

734
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,160
Don't be stingy. Hurry up.

735
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,620
One more.

736
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,870
I only have one. Take it or leave it.

737
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:43,640
I bring him some every time I come here.

738
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:47,460
In everyone's eyes,

739
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,730
he is the sect leader of Sigu Sect, Li Xiangyi.

740
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,520
Many people rely on him

741
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,870
and many people want to challenge him.

742
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,290
But not many people

743
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:02,690
really paid attention to his preferences.

744
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:05,760
Let me tell you secretly.

745
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,840
I've seen him

746
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,250
avoiding everyone to eat candy secretly.

747
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,420
Who would have thought

748
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:14,020
the number one martial artist Li Xiangyi

749
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,550
would be as happy as a child when eating candy?

750
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:39,790
Come to think of it,

751
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,700
-you are quite similar to my master...
-He’s not.

752
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,300
Not what?

753
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,760
In the great battle at the East Sea,

754
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,690
Li Xiangyi lost.

755
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,250
He should be the second best.

756
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,730
Are you saying Li Xiangyi lost to Di Fengsheng?

757
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:56,790
Did you witness it?

758
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:58,190
They fought at sea.

759
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,000
Where were you?

760
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,200
Are you a Fish Spirit or a Turtle Spirit?

761
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,100
Stop arguing.

762
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,210
Did you hear that?

763
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,470
It's about to start.

764
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:06,580
Let's go.

765
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,370
Don't talk nonsense.

766
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,820
There has been no news of the Shaoshi Sword for ten years.

767
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:18,040
It was found and reappeared

768
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,440
only because of the help of all my friends in the martial world.

769
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,700
More fortunately, we had two old friends who ran around with all their might.

770
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,720
So, it's Miss Qiao and Mr. Xiao

771
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,320
who found the Shaoshi Sword.

772
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,980
♫I'm only getting into character after half of my life♫

773

780

788
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:44,430
After all these years,

789
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:49,050
to have found the Shaoshi Sword that never left Xiangyi's hand,

790
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:50,580
we're also very comforted.

791
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,320
Today, I hope the people of the martial arts world

792
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,830
don't forget the ideal of punishing evil, promoting good

793
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:59,630
and bringing peace to the world.

794
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:03,440
So that we don't let Xiangyi down.
