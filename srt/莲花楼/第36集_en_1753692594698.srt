2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Kissing myself thousands of times

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The most reluctant moment is that moment

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Live in the world

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A thousand miles of madness

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who doesn't wander

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
On the edge of the world

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Live in the world

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The youth is wild

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The youth is not drunk like the sorrow

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
A journey through the world is like a dream

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Live in the world

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
A thousand miles of madness

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Who doesn't wander

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
On the edge of the world

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Live in the world

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The youth is wild

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The youth is not drunk like the sorrow

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
A journey through the world is like a dream

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000

Episode 16

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Master Li, you really have to stay in the palace.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Is Master Yang here to persuade me?

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I can't control the ideas of Master Tao.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But I believe Master Li.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's just that it's difficult to live.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I can only help.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Thank you, Master Yang.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's enough.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Does Master Li really know the Xuan Tree?

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Of course I don't know.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm just a poor man.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Of course I don't understand.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Then why did you send it to the rain in the universe?

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is the news that the buyer sent today.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's just that I'm lucky.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I went to the palace that day to buy a vegetable.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I happened to meet a vegetable farmer.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
He told me that the water on the mountain is very strong.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And the north wind will make the water flow into the universe.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And the winter weather will definitely rain.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Master Li is such a person.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I admire him for being able to realize the world.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What kind of person is he?

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's the same.

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You have to eat and drink porridge.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
By the way, Master Yang.

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You have to help me with the house later.

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What?

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Eunuch Wang.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Master.

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Where is this place?

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's just a abandoned land that has been abandoned for a hundred years.

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Second Emperor.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Let's just keep going.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Wait.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I think this place is very windy and very good.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's very potential to build a mysterious tower.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
This...

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
This place is a brother in the palace.

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Master, did you see it wrong?

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
No.

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This place is just a little deserted.

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But the Qi School is hidden in the moon.

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
This...

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Master.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What I said is all true.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
This place was originally the residence of Empress Dowager Kang Xian.

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
There were often workers missing.

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
When they were discovered, there was only a piece of flesh left.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And someone saw...

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What did they see?

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
They saw a monster with two heads.

77
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's the legendary double-headed murderer, Ni Tianhou.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's been a long time since this place was abandoned.

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The guards of the night patrols are all avoiding this place.

80
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's indeed a brother.

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You don't understand this.

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,620
The

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
first place is also like this.

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
When the mysterious tower is built,

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
it can be changed to a different place.

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This place becomes the most auspicious place in the palace.

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The four of you,

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
go and check this place.

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
See which piece of land is suitable for building a tower.

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes.

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
State Preceptor,

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
you must be thirsty after walking all the way here.

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Come, drink some water I brought.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
This Lord's hand is very extraordinary.

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But,

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
you're taking my magic weapon.

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Is it reasonable?

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Lord Yang is afraid that the water will stain the State Preceptor's hand.

99
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So,

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
it's hard for the State Preceptor to be safe.

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Don't be too smart,

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
if you're in a hurry and get caught in a corner

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and get kicked out of the palace,

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
you'll be in a big trouble.

105
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Li Shen Yi,

106
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
since you're tired,

107
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
please go to the palace to rest.

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You can enter the palace tomorrow.

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The palace?

110
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Sect Leader Li,

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
what should we do next?

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Next?

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Aren't we going to look for Zi Teng?

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But there's nothing in the wheel in the hand of the Demon Lord.

115
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What should we do next?

116
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Those Zi Teng have died long ago.

117
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Died?

118
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
When you were attacking,

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
you were in the palace.

120
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Died?

121
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
When you were attacking,

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
he was protecting the Demon Lord's magic power.

123
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I guess,

124
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Zi Teng is there.

125
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
He should be dead now.

126
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Why are you wearing this?

127
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
This is...

128
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Snow Yan?

129
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Snow Yan is so precious.

130
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
How did you get it?

131
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's just a coincidence.

132
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I just gave it to someone.

133
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Lord Yang,

134
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
did you notice that

135
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
these four soldiers of the Ministry of Works...

136
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
They look a little timid.

137
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
They shouldn't have any special power.

138
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That's right.

139
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Those four soldiers of the Ministry of Works

140
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
only listen to the secret of the Demon Lord.

141
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
That ruins

142
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
should be the place that Zi Teng

143
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
went to with the Demon Lord.

144
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It means that the tomb is nearby.

145
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
But the Demon Lord

146
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
has been looking for it

147
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
with the four soldiers of the Ministry of Works.

148
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's probably just a direction.

149
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So,

150
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
we have to look for the rest.

151
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You mean,

152
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
those four soldiers

153
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
know where the tomb is?

154
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Did you notice that

155
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
those four soldiers

156
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
don't even have a beard?

157
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Come on.

158
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Let's drink.

159
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Come on.

160
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Let's drink.

161
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Okay. Let's drink.

162
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The wine is not good.

163
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Who are you?

164
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm the doctor of the Jianghu.

165
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The doctor of the Jianghu.

166
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Hurry up.

167
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Little brother,

168
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
are all the soldiers of the Ministry of Works

169
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
here?

170
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The tomb is about to be closed.

171
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
They all came out

172
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
to have a good time.

173
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Come on.

174
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Send someone to watch the prison.

175
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Don't make any mistakes.

176
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
They come to chase the soldiers every day.

177
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But it's been so long.

178
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
How can you remember it clearly?

179
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
As soon as I entered the abyss,

180
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I remembered that we were...

181
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
How about

182
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
we find a way to escape?

183
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Shuhua, be careful.

184
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Okay.

185
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Mr. Yang.

186
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Don't be rash.

187
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Wan Shengdao's people

188
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
have been watching here.

189
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I found the four people's details.

190
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
As the chief said,

191
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
they were all eunuchs

192
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
in the palace a few years ago.

193
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Now they live in various places.

194
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Wan Shengdao

195
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
brought them here

196
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
and sent them

197
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
to the palace

198
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
as the soldiers of the Ministry of Works.

199
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Then why were the eunuchs

200
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
in the palace

201
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
driven out?

202
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
They committed theft.

203
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
They stole things.

204
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Shouldn't they be killed?

205
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The reason is here.

206
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Back then,

207
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
they found a lot of gold and silver treasures

208
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
from them.

209
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But they insisted

210
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
that they found them

211
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
on the corpses

212
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
in the desert.

213
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
When we went to check the imperial city,

214
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
we found

215
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
a dead body.

216
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The body was broken and broken.

217
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The body was broken and broken.

218
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It was dead and missing.

219
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It wasn't a human-made body.

220
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It looked like a tiger-pumped wolf killing people.

221
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But the eunuchs were in the outside palace.

222
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
How could they let the beasts

223
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
into the palace?

224
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
There were a lot of treasures

225
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
around the body.

226
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What the four people said

227
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
was very credible.

228
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The dead person

229
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
was also an eunuch in the palace.

230
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's right.

231
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
If you calculate it like this,

232
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I think it's like

233
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
a group of five people

234
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
committed a crime

235
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
and killed one person.

236
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Master was also

237
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
suspicious of it.

238
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But the treasures

239
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
weren't made in the court.

240
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It was made hundreds of years ago.

241
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
When we checked the material in the palace,

242
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
we didn't find anything missing.

243
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But without any evidence,

244
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
we could only

245
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
take the dead person

246
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
and use it as a tool.

247
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The treasures from hundreds of years ago

248
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
suddenly appeared.

249
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And they appeared next to the corpses.

250
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Don't you think it's strange?

251
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Do you know

252
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
where the treasures

253
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
were found?

254
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Gold, silver, and silver.

255
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
There was no trace of them.

256
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But there was a statue

257
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
that was hidden from the Buddha.

258
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It was a statue

259
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
that was given to the Emperor

260
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
by Emperor Guangqing

261
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
a hundred years ago.

262
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It is said that

263
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
it was worshiped in the Jile Tower.

264
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Jile Tower?

265
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I heard from the Empress Dowager

266
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
that the Jile Tower

267
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
was built by Emperor Guangqing

268
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
for the sake of his son.

269
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But His Majesty said

270
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
that it wasn't about that.

271
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It was just a rumor.

272
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Then what did they say

273
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
about the Jile Tower?

274
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The old people in the palace

275
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
said that

276
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Emperor Guangqing

277
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
was poor and had no children.

278
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Later, a master

279
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
built the Jile Tower.

280
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Soon, Consort Ying

281
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
became the Empress

282
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
and became the Prince.

283
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But I don't know why

284
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
the Jile Tower disappeared

285
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
overnight.

286
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Disappeared overnight?

287
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yes.

288
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It was overnight.

289
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The place where it was

290
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
was always

291
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
in the middle of nowhere.

292
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's gone.

293
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's gone.

294
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's gone.

295
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's gone.

296
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The death seal in the Zongzi Palace

297
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
is not allowed to mention this again.

298
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It became a mystery.

299
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It is said that the Jile Tower became the Heavenly Court.

300
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
After the Heavenly Court changed to the Imperial Court,

301
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
it was taken back by the Heavenly Court.

302
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
But the building was built back then.

303
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
But everyone in the palace knew about it.

304
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's impossible that

305
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
there is no clue left.

306
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
There is no record in the palace.

307
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But I was in the

308
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Wugonggongshouji

309
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
who served Emperor Guangqing.

310
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I found a map of the tower.

311
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
This Wugonggongshouji

312
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
is cool.

313
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
This map is inside.

314
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
But I don't know if it's the Jile Tower.

315
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Look.

316
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Jile Tower.

317
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
The tombstone is hidden

318
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
in the disappeared Jile Tower.

319
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
If we can't find it,

320
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
why we should find

321
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
these four eunuchs?

322
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's because of these four eunuchs.

323
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The Jile Tower

324
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
is inside.

325
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
The Jile Tower

326
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
is inside.

327
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
If we can't find it,

328
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
why we should find

329
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
these four eunuchs?

330
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's because of these four eunuchs.

331
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
My father

332
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
killed the Jile Tower

333
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
that day.

334
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,600
because of these four eunuchs

335
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,000
to live in this Ji Le Pagoda.

336
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,600
He can't escape.

337
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,800
Or... Or...

338
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
We've said it.

339
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,000
You're not afraid of death?

340
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,400
He can still follow us all the time.

341
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,600
Someone!

342
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,600
There's a monster!

343
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,600
There's a monster!

344
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,400
A monster!

345
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,200
What monster?

346
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,800
The Nite Tiger is here again!

347
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,400
Don't hurt me.

348
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
I didn't say it.

349
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,000
I didn't say it.

350
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,400
What did you say?

351
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Who's going to kill you?

352
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,200
You said the Nite Tiger is here again.

353
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,600
Then have you seen this monster before?

354
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,600
Before... Before...

355
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,200
Shut up!

356
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Tomorrow?

357
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,800
I'll be here.

358
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,800
Clan Leader Shan,

359
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,800
you were in time.

360
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,200
Bro.

361
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,600
You spent efforts

362
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,600
ARR.

363
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,000
It's useless, right?

364
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,800
You did artificial things.

365
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:06,780
Old

366
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,000
Under customer

367
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,760
This qin wrong

368
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,040
Is a royal model a hundred years ago

369
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,920
Now

370
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,600
There will be no more people wearing it

371
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,560
A hundred years ago

372
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,480
Is it really made by Guiling?

373
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,840
This style is old

374
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,920
The fabric is new

375
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,020
In this dress

376
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,820
with a smell of a new car.

377
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,980
It should be the smell of blood.

378
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,060
It seems that

379
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,940
someone is playing tricks behind my back.

380
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,580
It's Wan Sheng Dao's men.

381
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,220
What I can't figure out is

382
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,460
that Wan Sheng Dao found these four people

383
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,460
to find this Ji Lan Tao.

384
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,380
Then why did he

385
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,780
make such a big move?

386
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,300
Shan Gu Dao said that I tried my best to get the painting.

387
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,140
I'm afraid he thinks

388
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,380
that the blood and the murderer are my doings.

389
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,620
It seems that there is a third person behind the scenes.

390
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,460
Who is he?

391
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,660
He hasn't done it yet.

392
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,660
It's Li Lian Hua.

393
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,260
She spilled water on purpose in the daytime.

394
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,820
In fact, she used blood to freeze Ziteng.

395
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,820
Now she's wearing a blood dress.

396
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,180
It's very difficult for her to stay in her senses.

397
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,740
Let's kill her.

398
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,300
No.

399
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,020
Don't ruin the big picture.

400
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,860
The assassin can't be killed.

401
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,740
She showed her face in front of the emperor.

402
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,060
Now we have to kill her.

403
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,580
It's like cleaning the capital.

404
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,860
She is no longer

405
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,580
the ideal woman who was in the haoling world.

406
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,900
Where did

407
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,700
the blood of these valuable people come from?

408
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,260
Wu Teng was not found.

409
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,540
But Ziteng died.

410
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,420
Those four people

411
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,420
dare not say where the entrance was.

412
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,900
How can we get her?

413
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,700
Tomorrow, we'll use some means

414
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,260
to let them say it.

415
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,140
We can't wait any longer.

416
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,660
Go.

417
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,060
What's wrong?

418
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,740
Can't you tell which one is the best?

419
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,220
Well, we still have to see.

420
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,140
We still need to check it carefully.

421
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,220
Eunuch Wang.

422
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,980
In order to avoid the evil doings

423
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,060
during the frozen land,

424
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,140
we need to put these rebels

425
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,020
in the ruins

426
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,700
and take advantage of the evil.

427
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,180
It's better than nothing.

428
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,260
Let's go.

429
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,460
I can catch you guys to the capital.

430
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,660
I've figured out your background.

431
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,900
If you don't say anything

432
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,420
for one more day from now,

433
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,740
I'll kill one of your relatives

434
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,340
every day.

435
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,860
Please spare us.

436
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,620
There are really monsters.

437
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,980
If we say nonsense, we'll die.

438
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,180
If you say it,

439
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,180
you'll die.

440
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,620
If you don't say it,

441
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,140
you and your family will die.

442
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,860
Lu Fang.

443
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,340
Your mother, who is 80 years old,

444
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,380
is waiting for you.

445
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,020
Do you want her to die?

446
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,100
How do you want her to die?

447
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,060
Kill her?

448
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,980
It's reasonable to die.

449
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,140
But she's killed by someone.

450
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,620
Say it.

451
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:38,940
Don't kill me.

452
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,420
I won't do anything.

453
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:40,940
Please spare me.

454
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,060
Li Tianhao is the one who stole

455
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,140
the treasure of the Jile Tower.

456
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,220
Where do you want to escape?

457
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,900
I entered the Jile Tower with someone else.

458
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:46,980
It's not a crime.

459
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,180
Don't kill me.

460
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,020
Where is the Jile Tower?

461
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,660
Doctor Li.

462
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,140
What's wrong?

463
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,540
Doctor Li.

464
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,660
Aren't you sick?

465
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,820
Why are you here again?

466
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,540
I gave myself a few medicines.

467
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,220
I'm much better now.

468
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,460
Thank you for telling me about it.

469
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,180
Doctor Li doesn't care about his health,

470
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,580
but he's so troublesome.

471
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,100
Thank you for your concern.

472
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,820
2

473
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,340
Let me think.

474
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,420
해요

475
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,140
then

476
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,140
Good.

477
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,260
I just tried to kill Rong Jinzhen.

478
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,180
Who is that?

479
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,060
I'll continue to lead the battle.

480
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,580
The elephant sword.

481
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,500
This is the sword of Master Li Xiangyi.

482
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,260
This is to face Li Xiangyi's master.

483
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,860
This last battle

484
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,100
you will never win.

485
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,220
No.

486
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,020
I can't win this.

487
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,300
Give up.

488
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,660
I can't let Li Xiangyi

489
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,700
defeat Ji Mochen.

490
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,500
There will be a new legend.

491
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,740
Maybe

492
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,220
you are the next new legend.

493
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,780
The elephant sword and Yang Zhoman are a match made in heaven.

494
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,700
The inner energy is the fruit of swordsmanship.

495
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,620
Swordsmanship is the soul of inner energy.

496
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,460
Li Xiangyi's martial arts

497
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:49,820
are his

498
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,260
and pride.

499
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,460
Take my secret.

500
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,180
Where is Shaan乾?

501
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,380
Get him!

502
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,860
The new one is Duochou Gongzi Jian.

503
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,620
I'll ask you again.

504
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,300
Where is the Shantou knife?

505
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,540
I don't know.

506
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,340
Master... Master is in the palace.

507
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,300
He went to the palace too.

508
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,340
Where is Lianhua?

509
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,620
Incredible...

510
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,420
Election Show

511
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,160
Lei가

512
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,740
brother

513
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,120
Thank you

514
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,720
I didn't expect that Shan Gu Dao's martial arts skills are so high.

515
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,920
If he hadn't been caught this morning

516
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,520
by him in the palace,

517
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,520
what would he do?

518
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,520
Did he get anything?

519
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,520
These four people didn't come back?

520
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,720
Didn't they leave the palace with you?

521
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,720
When they left the palace,

522
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,120
the soldiers were to follow the Ministry of Works to visit the people.

523
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,520
So they were taken away.

524
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,120
It seems that Shan Gu Dao

525
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,320
is going to hide these four people.

526
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,320
Lord Yang,

527
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,920
is there a special place for the Ministry of Works to stay in the palace?

528
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,120
The palace is a royal forbidden area.

529
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,120
How can there be a place for the Ministry of Works to stay?

530
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,120
But there is a room

531
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,720
for the people to store their materials.

532
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,720
But that's not a place for people to stay.

533
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,920
These people

534
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,920
were investigated by the Ministry of Works.

535
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,320
They must be hiding in this room.

536
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,720
Shan Gu Dao must be waiting for too long now

537
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,720
to find a way to find the whereabouts of the people.

538
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,120
I must take the first step.

539
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:52,920
Who is it?

540
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,120
I am here to see Commander-in-Chief Dian Qiu.

541
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,320
I am Dian Qiu.

542
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,720
You are...

543
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,520
I can only send you to the palace,

544
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,720
but I can't let you walk around the palace.

545
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,720
Mr. Zhang Bao can walk around the palace freely.

546
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,920
There are many people in the palace.

547
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,720
You must be careful.

548
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,720
Don't worry. Even if you get caught,

549
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,720
I will climb over the wall and enter.

550
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,120
Please.

551
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,120
Gui Yong, have you told them?

552
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:51,920
Gui Yong,

553
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,920
I should have told them long ago.

554
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,320
I told them on the first day I recognized the osmanthus tree.

555
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,520
Maybe we are on our way back now.

556
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,320
Even if we told them,

557
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,720
the murderer may have let us go.

558
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,120
But don't forget,

559
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,320
we saw the blood vessel

560
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,120
being killed by that monster.

561
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,720
We saw it.

562
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,720
We saw it.

563
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,720
We saw it.

564
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,720
We saw it.

565
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,920
I saw the blood vessel

566
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,120
being torn into pieces by that monster.

567
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,520
Don't mention the blood vessel.

568
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,520
He was drunk and hit by something.

569
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,120
He found the osmanthus tower.

570
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,720
He went there because he wanted to steal the treasure.

571
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,320
He wanted to steal the treasure.

572
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,520
We didn't know how many we had.

573
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,120
We saw it

574
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,920
in the hole we came out from.

575
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,320
We saw it.

576
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,120
We saw it. The monster bit it to death.

577
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,120
It...

578
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,720
There was a dragon

579
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,720
floating behind the monster.

580
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,920
There was a voice

581
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,320
threatening us

582
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,920
not to reveal the secret.

583
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,920
We've been waiting for so many years

584
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,320
to be safe.

585
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,320
Look.

586
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,720
We just arrived here.

587
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,520
The monster has appeared.

588
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,720
Let's not talk about it.

589
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,520
Most of the treasures

590
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,920
were taken away by the Imperial City Department.

591
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,720
We only hid a few pieces of them.

592
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,720
We didn't dare to sell them for many years.

593
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,720
We only sold one.

594
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,920
We were watched.

595
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,520
We brought them here.

596
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,720
How could I have seen them?

597
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,520
Tell me.

598
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,520
But what about the murderer?

599
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,920
The murderer is scary,

600
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,920
but he only killed us.

601
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,520
But the Osmanthus Tao

602
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,320
can do anything.

603
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,520
For the sake of our family's safety,

604
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,120
we don't want this secret.

605
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,920
It's worth it.

606
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,720
I remember

607
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,720
your secret.

608
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,920
Back then,

609
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,120
there was a secret plan.

610
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,720
The distance from the entrance

611
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,120
to the entrance

612
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,720
was about the same as the entrance to the tent.

613
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,120
Based on the tricks

614
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,120
we saw yesterday,

615
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,720
the entrance

616
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,520
was probably

617
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,920
here.

618
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,520
It was the kite

619
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,520
that carried Qingrong.

620
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,320
No wonder the Qing Palace is so strange.

621
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,720
Lord.

622
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,520
What happened?

623
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,320
Tell them

624
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,520
not to burn my family.

625
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,720
Lord.

626
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,920
I... I'll tell them.

627
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,520
I'll see them.

628
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,920
Lord, there's an order.

629
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,320
Whoever breaks in,

630
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,120
will be punished.

631
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,720
How should we deal with this thief?

632
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,720
Leader Li,

633
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,120
how can I help you?

634
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,320
Lord Yang, don't make it difficult.

635
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,320
It's a matter of duty.

636
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,920
It's a serious crime to break in.

637
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,720
Why do you have to fight?

638
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,920
You can still be pardoned

639
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,520
by admitting your crime.

640
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,120
You should be more lenient.

641
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,920
The Da Li Temple

642
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,720
is far worse than the Bai Chunyue Temple.

643
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,520
Lord.

644
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,920
Lord Yang Yun Chun of the Imperial City Bureau

645
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,720
is going to investigate again.

646
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,720
Boyun.

647
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,120
This person is a serious criminal.

648
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,320
He can't be investigated.

649
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,120
Leave us.

650
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,720
Yes.

651
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,920
It's fine if you don't admit it.

652
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,320
It doesn't matter now.

653
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,720
If you think it's too troublesome,

654
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,520
I'll send you to hell.

655
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,520
Go.

656
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,120
Stop.

657
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,520
Lord Huang has an order.

658
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,120
Li Lian Huang broke into the inner palace.

659
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,520
There are many doubts and false accusations.

660
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,920
I ordered him to help the Bai Chunyue detective Fang Nuo Bing.

661
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,920
From today,

662
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,120
we will investigate this case and take the crime as a credit.

663
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,920
Hurry up and leave.

664
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,320
Hurry up.

665
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,720
Fang Jiang Bao.

666
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,720
Thank you.

667
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,120
I told you to stay in the Tian Di Villa

668
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,320
to keep you safe.

669
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,120
But you still came to the Imperial Palace.

670
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,120
I heard about your accident in the capital.

671
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,320
I hurried to find Princess Zhao Lin

672
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,320
to beg the Empress Dowager.

673
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,320
I'm so scared to beg for this will.

674
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,120
Do you really think you have nine lives?

675
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,720
Don't be so excited.

676
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,320
Actually, I came here

677
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,920
for another benefit.

678
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,320
No one is bothering me.

679
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,120
You can still sort out your thoughts.

680
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,320
I don't want to bother you.

681
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,720
As long as you're fine.

682
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,920
By the way,

683
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,320
I heard that the Shanku knife came to the capital

684
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,320
for Muteng.

685
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,720
I

686
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,320
happened to have a fight with him.

687
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,520
I asked Yang Ying Chun about it in the palace.

688
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,520
He thinks that the Shanku knife is a trap to frame you.

689
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,920
But I don't think so.

690
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,920
The person who killed himself in the Shanku knife

691
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,920
caused a ruckus in the palace.

692
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,720
It's harmful to find Muteng.

693
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,920
There must be a third person behind it.

694
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,520
The purpose of his doing all this

695
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,920
is to stop anyone from finding the Jile Tower.

696
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,920
That's right.

697
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,120
It's the same as what I guessed.

698
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,920
Do you have any other findings?

699
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,120
Before Li Fei died,

700
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,720
he drew a circle on the table.

701
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,320
I thought about it in the prison for a long time and didn't figure it out.

702
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,320
But now I finally know

703
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,720
what this circle represents.

704
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,720
What?

705
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,720
A mirror.

706
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,320
You mean

707
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,920
the entrance of the Jile Tower

708
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,520
is very likely to be beside a well.

709
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,920
But if such a big tower

710
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,920
is still in the palace,

711
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,520
no one will find it.

712
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,920
I didn't think about it.

713
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,920
But the only thing I know is

714
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,720
that the four people were killed.

715
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,120
The Shanku knife

716
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,920
also lost the Jile Tower's clues.

717
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,120
The third person behind it

718
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,120
stopped others from finding the Jile Tower.

719
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,920
I'm sure he knows all the clues.

720
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,120
So our current goal

721
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,120
is to find the third person behind the tomb.

722
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,320
This footprint is indeed a victim

723
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,720
and was forged.

724
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,920
I saw the body of these four people.

725
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,320
The throat was broken.

726
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,720
The abdomen was twisted.

727
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,520
It was indeed a murder.

728
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,520
But look.

729
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,720
The blood on the ground seems to be off.

730
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,920
The blood

731
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,920
is all around the body.

732
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,720
There are no traces of it.

733
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,320
It means that these four people

734
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,320
didn't want to escape.

735
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,920
There are four people in total.

736
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,320
The murderer

737
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,120
could only kill one person at a time.

738
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,320
They have a chance to escape.

739
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,520
Why didn't they escape?

740
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,920
They let the beast attack the murderer.

741
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,820
This gold was bestowed by getsh.

742
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,720
Where areunky person.

743
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,920
Who is the murderer?

744
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,920
I do not see anything.

745
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,520
There are no poisons.

746
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,520
No poisons

747
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,920
There was this art of drawing back then.

748
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,720
The entrance was like this.

749
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,320
Based on the art of drawing we saw the year before yesterday,

750
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,720
that entrance was probably...

751
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,520
this position.

752
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,520
Fish land.

753
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,320
It should be Li Fei and the four of them.

754
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,320
I looked over this fish land.

755
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,520
The poison was on it.

756
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,720
After a month,

757
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,720
it was paralyzed and lost consciousness.

758
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,520
It was seriously cut.

759
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,320
Now that the fish land is gone,

760
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,520
the murderer must be afraid of being tracked.

761
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,320
If we want to find the fish land in a huge palace,

762
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,720
it won't be easy.

763
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,320
Since the beast's heart is real,

764
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,920
and the mud is fake,

765
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,520
then we can follow the smell and track it.

766
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,120
The smell?

767
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,920
This fox spirit has been lazy for so long.

768
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,320
It should be him.

769
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,720
Go.

770
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,320
It should be here.

771
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,320
Hurry.

772
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,720
Be careful.

773
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,920
It's here.

774
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,920
Fang Xiao Bao, you've improved a lot.

775
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,920
How about the night sky and the mountain?

776
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,920
Don't show it to Di Fei Sheng.

777
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,320
I'm afraid he'll get involved in your contest.

778
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,120
I didn't know that the murderer, Ni Tian Hong,

779
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,520
was trapped in the two animals.

780
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,520
That's why he's so fierce.

781
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,320
Let's go in and have a look.

782
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,320
Let's go.

783
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,720
It seems like they've figured it out now.

784
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,120
There are so many dead animals in the cave.

785
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,320
It seems that the murderer has been playing tricks in the dark for many years.

786
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,520
The maid eunuchs who have been missing for years

787
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,520
must have been at the entrance of the altar

788
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,520
and were killed by the murderer.

789
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,720
Think about it.

790
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,720
He just borrowed the cat to kill people.

791
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,520
He won't come here for a moment.

792
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,920
Since that's the case,

793
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,720
we need to find a way to find out who he is.

794
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,120
The dead animals in the cave

795
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,120
are usually fed to the cats.

796
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,520
It's very intense.

797
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,320
They're fed a lot of meat every few days.

798
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,920
It's hard not to attract attention.

799
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,120
This fake mountain is right next to the wall of the palace.

800
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,920
The small gate in the cave can go through the outer palace.

801
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,520
That's why he can sneak in from outside.

802
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,920
Even if it's from outside,

803
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,320
there are people who have seen it.

804
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,120
There are records of the objects that were entered.

805
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,720
It's hard to get anything if he's trying to steal or get lucky.

806
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,120
That's why he can sneak in from a group of people

807
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,920
and eat them.

808
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,920
I know.

809
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,920
The wild animals in the cave.

810
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,520
That's right.

811
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,120
Let's go.

812
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,720
Uncle Qian.

813
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,920
Long time no see.

814
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,720
You're so relaxed, kid.

815
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:41,120
You've grown up so much.

816
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,720
Kid, you're here at night.

817
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,520
Are you here to see the tigers again?

818
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,520
Next time.

819
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,920
I'm here to ask you something.

820
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,920
Uncle Qian,

821
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,520
the wild animals in the cave

822
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,320
are all in the cave.

823
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,520
Why did you go up there to lose them?

824
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,720
How did you know?

825
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,320
Uncle Qian, don't worry.

826
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,320
We're here to catch the thieves.

827
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,320
Oh.

828
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,920
If you ask me about losing the wild animals,

829
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,120
I can't say it clearly.

830
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,520
A few decades ago, when I was in the Baishou Garden,

831
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:20,520
I only remember that it was enough to consume half an egg a day.

832
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,920
It was enough to consume two catties.

833
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,720
Since then,

834
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,520
the number of meat was decreasing.

835
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,720
The number of month of month increased.

836
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,520
It increased to about ten catties.

837
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,520
It's been seven or eight years.

838
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,720
It has become two catties again.

839
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,120
It's strange to see it keep increasing.

840
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,320
It's like...

841
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,720
It's like someone raised a wild animal.

842
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,720
When it was seven or eight years old,

843
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,520
it died and then started to raise it again.

844
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,320
Right?

845
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,720
Yes.

846
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,120
At first, I wanted to investigate this matter.

847
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,120
Others laughed at me and said that I was too nervous.

848
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,520
It's just that the guys' appetite

849
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,320
is small and big.

850
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,720
That's right.

851
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,120
It's convenient for the little wild cat to sneak into the palace.

852
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,120
It's been raised for seven or eight years.

853
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,320
When it's about to die,

854
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,920
it will be brought in again.

855
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,920
This...

856
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,920
Little wild cat?

857
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,720
The Baishou Garden doesn't raise wild cats.

858
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,320
Uncle Qian, we're talking about the case.

859
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,720
By the way, Uncle Qian,

860
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,720
where is the silk usually stored?

861
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,520
Is it easy to be stolen?

862
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,920
That's why I'm confused.

863
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,720
Why is there no reason to investigate?

864
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,320
This silk is usually locked in the warehouse.

865
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,520
But what about this key?

866
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,120
Besides me,

867
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,720
there are spare keys in the Ministry of Works.

868
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,120
If the thief wants to steal silk all year round,

869
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,120
he can't do it.

870
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,920
No, let's go.

871
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,920
What's going on?

872
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,920
The Ministry of Works is responsible for building the palace.

873
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,120
The fake land of the wild cat is from the Ministry of Works.

874
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,720
The key to the Baishou Garden

875
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,920
is a backup from the Ministry of Works.

876
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,720
Li Fei and his men are from the Ministry of Works.

877
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,720
They also have the poison-reduced fish soil from the inner palace.

878
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,920
So, at the beginning,

879
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,720
the four people didn't return to the residence after the selection.

880
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,520
They went to the Shan Yi House.

881
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,320
Before, I always thought it was done by the Shan Gu Dao.

882
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,320
But it doesn't seem to be so.

883
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,320
Maybe I was wrong.

884
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,320
It's because there are people in the Ministry of Works

885
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,920
afraid that Xie Luo will steal his secret

886
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,520
and deliberately arranged them to go to the Shan Yi House

887
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,120
and let the wild cat kill people.

888
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,520
To do this,

889
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,520
the Ministry of Works has been in office for many years.

890
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,720
Moreover, this matter has to be followed by the selection

891
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,720
so that it can be arranged at any time.

892
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,720
The construction of the Ministry of Works, Liu Ke He.

893
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,720
If they have informed Shan Gu Dao

894
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,320
and secretly arranged Li Fei to go to the Shan Yi House,

895
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,720
then Shan Gu Dao will also know that the murderer is Liu Ke He.

896
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,320
Let's go.

897
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,120
It's too late.

898
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,320
Shan Gu Dao lost Li Fei's four people

899
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,920
and is looking for the Jile Dao.

900
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,320
The only clue is this Liu Ke He.

901
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,120
It's hard to handle now.

902
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,520
What secret does this Jile Dao have?

903
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,120
It needs him to protect it with his life.

904
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,720
Does he also know about the Wild Cat Cove?

905
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,120
If he had known earlier,

906
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,920
he would have already

907
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,920
taken the Jile Dao from the beginning.

908
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,920
He would have already taken the Jile Dao from the beginning.

909
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,520
Then he should have noticed the five-storied monk from the beginning.

910
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,120
So, he should have a purpose.

911
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,720
There is a mess here now.

912
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,320
There is no clue to find it.

913
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,120
Think about it.

914
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:35,120
Liu Ke He would rather choose to kill himself

915
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,320
than to keep the secret of the Jile Dao.

916
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:41,720
I think he will not leave any clues.

917
00:41:45,220 --> 00:42:08,820
Timing and Translations are علي lipstick.

918
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:14,220
Kä 그다음에CC grande cloudy

919
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,200
They said they saw the entrance of the osmanthus tree

920
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,400
with such a calculation.

921
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,520
That's right.

922
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,080
Only when they saw the osmanthus tree can they recall.

923
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,320
It means that the police station at the entrance

924
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,840
is different from the one ten years ago.

925
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,680
Such a big change in a palace.

926
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:34,040
This may be a clue itself.

927
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,040
Maybe they made a mistake in the tower.

928
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,720
Liu Kehe used the branch to change the palace.

929
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,360
In fact, it's to hide the entrance.

930
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:44,800
Look.

931
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,160
This is the record of the construction

932
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,120
of the construction site near the waste site.

933
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,840
There are so many buildings.

934
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,720
Fifty-three trees.

935
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,680
Eight seats on the flat land.

936
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,240
Five entrances in the field.

937
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,200
Six bridges in the ditch.

938
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,600
According to the osmanthus tree we saw yesterday,

939
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,840
the entrance is probably

940
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,880
this position.

941
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,760
It's indeed the body.

942
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,080
Let's go.

943
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,400
Let's go down to the waste yard.

944
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:23,880
Lian Lianhua.

945
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,040
What's wrong?

946
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,400
The jade pendant hanging on the waist

947
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,080
shouldn't be so heavy.

948
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,840
It's not heavy.

949
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,520
It's just a little heavy.

950
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,320
It's not heavy.

951
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,080
It's just a little heavy.

952
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:46,880
It's just a little heavy.

953
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,680
It's just a little heavy.

954
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,480
It's just a little heavy.

955
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,280
It's just a little heavy.

956
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,080
It's just a little heavy.

957
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:50,880
It's just a little heavy.

958
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,680
It's just a little heavy.

959
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,480
It's just a little heavy.

960
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,280
It's just a little heavy.

961
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,080
It's just a little heavy.

962
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:54,880
It's just a little heavy.

963
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,680
It's just a little heavy.

964
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,480
It's just a little heavy.

965
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,280
It's just a little heavy.

966
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,080
It's just a little heavy.

967
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,080
It's just a little heavy.

968
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,080
It's just a little heavy.

969
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,080
It's just a little heavy.

970
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,080
It's just a little heavy.

971
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,080
It's just a little heavy.

972
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,080
It's just a little heavy.

973
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:09,280
Blue jade, green gilded mountains, green leaves, and green grass.

974
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:16,280
Who doesn't want to be a loner and sit on a bench?

975
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:29,880
Like the rain falling, the wind is getting more and more frantic.

976
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:35,480
It will pour down the pureness.

977
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:41,080
Like the rain falling, the wind is getting more and more frantic.

978
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:45,480
My hands are warm but my heart is warm.

979
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,680
The wine is drunk, the rain is drunk, and the moon is in full bloom.

980
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,480
The sky is dark, the city is dark, and the sky is dark.

981
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:57,080
If I turn and turn, I accidentally cut off the mark.

982
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:23,300
The

983
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:28,500
The green hills and the vast plains are all for you

984
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:35,780
Who doesn't want to part with the old and the new

985
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:40,140
Life is too cruel

986
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,900
Can't wait to grow old

987
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,340
There will be a long journey ahead

988
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:48,460
In exchange for the immortal wish

989
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:51,260
Life is too cruel

990
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:56,700
The green hills and the vast plains are all for you

991
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:03,500
Who doesn't want to part with the old and the new
