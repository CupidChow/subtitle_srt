1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
There's not much time

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
But there's still a lot of longing

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Ask yourself thousands of times

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The most reluctant moment is that moment

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Live in the city, thousands of miles of wind and waves

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Who doesn't wander

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway lands and mountains

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Live in the world, young and wild

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The past is not drunk as sadness

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
See a journey like a dream

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Live in the world, thousands of miles of wind and waves

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Who doesn't wander

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway lands and mountains

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Live in the world, young and wild

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The past is not drunk as sadness

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
See a journey like a dream

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Live in the world

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Episode 2

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Li Shen Yi, can I talk to you?

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Li Lian Hua, let's talk

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Let me show you something good

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
This is called the infinite golden needle

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It was used by the first god of Zhou State a hundred years ago

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It can cure a hundred diseases and can also be used for self-healing

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
My grandfather spent a long time to find this magic needle

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You helped me just now, this is to repay you

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Brother, this is not good

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Don't refuse

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Then thank you

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Bullshit, when I come back to the Fang family

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
These ten sets of eight sets will give you better

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Bullshit

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Little kid

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's still Li Shen Yi

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We are here to investigate the case

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Why are some people following us?

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Who said I followed you

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I obviously followed Li Lian Hua

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Besides, I'm here to investigate the case too

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Little kid

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Jinggu Wenqiang

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Jinggu Wenqiang

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This is

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I prepared a clean clothes for my master

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Change it for him

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Why did you come in?

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This magic needle has no reaction

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Did you hide in this secret room before?

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But when I came in last time

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The table was on this

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But he has already cleared the treasure

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
How could it not be found?

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Look

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What did you find?

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This sticker is a bill

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Can you see it in such a dark place?

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Let me see

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Brother

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The fairy is a mess

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I didn't notice this incense stove

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You help me see

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
This is the incense stove

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
This is the incense stove

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
This is the incense stove

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
This is the incense stove

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
In fact, this Golden Pagoda has opened a treasure shop

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's not rare to have a ticket

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What's in here?

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I have a sense of melancholy

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This is a kind of fragrance

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And it's a scent of ink

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Be careful

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
This incense

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Is it the Golden Pagoda of the Cloud?

75
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So that the community can be killed?

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Or this incense

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Is it made by Golden Pagoda?

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's used to deal with Dongming

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Unfortunately, I don't know what kind of incense

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Otherwise, I can get some clues

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
At this time

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
If Wanren Cessu Wencai was here

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He knows everything in the world

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
He will know what this is

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That old man is like a lock

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Weird temper

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Ordinary people ask him questions

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's hard to get to the top

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Don't think about it

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You don't know this

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Wanren Cessu Wencai's granddaughter

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Is my sister-in-law

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
My work

94
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
He will help

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What are you thinking?

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I always feel like this smell

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Has been smelled before

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Wood incense

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's right

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You just said wood incense

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
This fragrance only lasts for a long time

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
This can't be a small thing

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Bottle

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What's wrong with the bracelet?

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
There is something wrong with the bracelet

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
go

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
People ran away

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Find separately

109
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
it is good

110
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Wait

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Miss Zhiyu

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Where is this look going?

113
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You went to Jingmantang's room last night

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You put the incense

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I didn't

117
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You obviously have the fragrance

118
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
A father just died

119
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
As a wife

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Even not attending the funeral

121
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Just want to run away

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What's the matter with you and Jingmantang?

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Don't say it

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I had so many bracelets on my hands

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Just to cover

126
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
By being caught by Jingmantang

127
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I can't do it

128
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I can't do it

129
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I can't do it

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm afraid of injury

131
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Want to escape for the crime

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What are you doing

133
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The murderer found

134
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Of course it's closed

135
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Questioned

136
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Take it away

137
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yes

138
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I don't dare to move

139
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Such a beautiful girl

140
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm not willing to move

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Say it

142
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Where is the head of Bolan?

143
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I do not know

144
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I didn't kill him

145
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I didn't take the head of Bolan

146
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Don't say it

147
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The Supervision Bureau uses private torture

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
If someone is in the court

149
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
To refer to this

150
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You say I'm a murderer

151
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm not a murderer

152
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm not a murderer

153
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Refer to this

154
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You say you will be furious

155
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Watch her for me

156
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
No one can get close

157
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
She didn't say it for a day

158
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I didn't give her water for a day

159
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I see how long she can hold

160
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Young Hero Fang

161
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Please

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Please

163
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
No

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Stop

165
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Guan Xiu, are you okay?

166
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Nothing

167
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Miss Zhui, come out

168
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
This

169
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
This is

170
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
This is the murderer

171
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
This is the murderer

172
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
This is the murderer

173
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
This is the murderer

174
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
This is the murderer

175
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
This is the murderer

176
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
This

177
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What's going on

178
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
We originally thought

179
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The bracelet on Miss Zhiyu

180
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Is to cover up

181
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Jing Mantang's death-calling wound

182
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It doesn't seem like that

183
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The wound was caused by Dao Ge

184
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So you judge

185
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
There was a misunderstanding before

186
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
We misunderstood you before

187
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Then Zhiyun's wound

188
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And the incense on her body

189
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What's going on

190
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Miss, you should talk

191
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
If you don't talk, how can we help you

192
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's okay to talk to you now

193
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Everyone thinks

194
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I am the adopted daughter of Jing Mantang

195
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Only dress in jade and stone

196
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Rich and rich

197
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
But in fact

198
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I am just the medicine she bought

199
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What medicine

200
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I was bought at the Yuan Bao Mountain Village when I was six

201
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I have to use dozens of kinds of medicine every day

202
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Ten years later

203
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Finally became her medicine

204
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Jing Mantang used incense every few days

205
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Causing me to be ill

206
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And numb my pain

207
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
On the one hand, he took blood from me

208
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
He put my blood and medicine

209
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
In the head of the Bolan people

210
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
To drink

211
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That's how he can get healthy

212
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
This

213
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What you said is true

214
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
There is such a cruel way to cure disease in this world

215
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
He is really a sin

216
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
People like him

217
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Should be punished like this

218
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Then

219
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What disease did he have

220
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
He never speaks to outsiders

221
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Everyone is on guard

222
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So

223
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Never in front of me

224
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Cut off the head of the Bolan people

225
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Then why didn't you say it earlier

226
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Why do you pretend to run away

227
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm afraid everyone will find out sooner or later

228
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
My relationship with him

229
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Doubted on me

230
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The night when Jing Mantang died

231
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You go to his room to get blood for him

232
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So on your body

233
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And in the house

234
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That's why it smells like this

235
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
After you leave

236
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
He opened the door

237
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
The visa to take me in

238
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
But I left after taking the blood

239
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I really didn't do anything

240
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Then you think about it again

241
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Before Jing Mantang died

242
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Is there anything strange

243
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
By the way

244
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
By the way

245
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
He usually doesn't blood

246
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Not in a hurry

247
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But that night he was not in the heart

248
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It seems to be in a hurry to do something else

249
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So I accidentally

250
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Got the blood into my nails

251
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I guess it was Jing Mantang

252
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Should be in a hurry to the room

253
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Check if Donglin is right

254
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You still think

255
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Before we set up the fairy formation

256
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Donglin is already in the house

257
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Not the day we arrived

258
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Half a month ago

259
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
He has already arrived

260
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Donglin

261
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Did you come from Chuzhou

262
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
How do you know

263
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
That bill

264
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I understand

265
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It must be Donglin in the early years

266
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Asked what Jin Mantang was

267
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Then want to redeem it now

268
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It may be the head of the Bolan

269
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Then

270
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Jin Mantang was reluctant to return it to him

271
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So they became enemies

272
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I have been thinking

273
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Donglin threatened Ximantang

274
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And Jin Mantang got the jinx

275
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
The evidence was not revealed to Donglin

276
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So Donglin was already in his control

277
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Not Donglin hiding in the secret room

278
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
To plot against Jin Mantang

279
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But Jin Mantang

280
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Has managed to imprison him

281
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Donglin came to see our master

282
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Fortunately, the master secretly

283
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Defeated him with a small sword

284
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Fortunately, the master was in a hurry

285
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So Donglin was not hurt

286
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But an emergency

287
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
We didn't arrive in time

288
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Called Donglin to run

289
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
After that, our guards

290
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Because of poor protection

291
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Also got hit by the steward

292
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Yes

293
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
People in Yuanbao Villa all said

294
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Donglin was driven away by Jin Mantang

295
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
But no one saw it

296
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So

297
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Jin Mantang is lying

298
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Not right

299
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
But Donglin is good at martial arts

300
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Jin Mantang is not his opponent at all

301
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
How can he be trapped

302
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You don't remember this

303
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Before

304
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
This box was not in the underground

305
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Why is there an empty box on the ground

306
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I thought it was the third person

307
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Entered the secret room

308
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Took the things in the box

309
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
If someone really came in

310
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:31,040
The

311
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,040
Hurry up

312
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Don't talk to me

313
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm not talking to you

314
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm talking to you

315
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm talking to you

316
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm talking to you

317
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm talking to you

318
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Don't talk to me

319
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You said I promised to give it to you

320
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
What are you worried about?

321
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm here to get the head

322
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
There

323
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm here to get the head

324
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Right there

325
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Want to run

326
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Jin Mantang

327
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Let me out

328
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Jin Mantang

329
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Half a month later

330
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
After that

331
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Jin Mantang

332
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Guess Donglin should be dead

333
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So I rushed to the secret room to find him

334
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
But he didn't think of it

335
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Donglin is still alive

336
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Isn't that like what Zong Zheng Mingzhu said

337
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's them killing each other

338
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Not so simple

339
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Why is Donglin trapped for half a month

340
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But not dead

341
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
There is even a chance to stab Jin Mantang

342
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And this Jin Mantang

343
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
How to explain it with only one blood

344
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
So you think

345
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Although there is no third person in this secret room

346
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
No trace of the third person

347
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But it doesn't mean that there is no third person in this story

348
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Could it be that black man

349
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
But why did he kill Miss Zhi Yue

350
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Maybe he just wanted to find a scapegoat

351
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
The more likely it is

352
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
He wanted to find something that he didn't get

353
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It seems that only the murderer can know the truth

354
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
So you deliberately set this up

355
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's all my fault

356
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
So let him have a chance to run away

357
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I really don't know if you two are with him

358
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Fang Dongbin

359
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Don't let him run away again next time

360
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You think you have next time

361
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's really you again

362
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Hit my subordinate to kidnap the suspect

363
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What is the situation

364
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
People are not killed by Miss Zhi Yu

365
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
We are here to find out the truth

366
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
This is to find out the truth

367
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Find out the truth

368
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I told people to check

369
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
The detective list of Baichuan Academy's recording

370
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Fang Dongbin

371
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You are a western country

372
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You have the right to investigate here

373
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Go quickly

374
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Zong Rui Mingzhu

375
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Open the door if you can

376
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I am destined by Baichuan Academy

377
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I am the professional detective of the political party

378
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Who are you scolding?

379
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
How dare you accuse me of being a mess

380
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Fang Dongbin

381
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Take it easy

382
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I haven't finished scolding

383
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Zong Rui Mingzhu, listen to me

384
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You committed a crime and escaped from prison

385
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I don't care what your purpose is this time

386
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You don't want to be a guard

387
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I will find out all the truth

388
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Catch you back in jail by hand

389
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Wait for me

390
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm so angry

391
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm so angry

392
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The tension is too big

393
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You

394
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Oh no

395
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
In two days

396
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Even if Fang Dongbin is just gathered

397
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm afraid I will be out of martial arts

398
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I have to find the people of Bolan quickly

399
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Zong Rui Mingzhu

400
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Wake up

401
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Your throat is fine

402
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I have to be careful with Baichuan Academy

403
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I have already broken three cases

404
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
They want to fulfill their promise

405
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's a kill, not a insult

406
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
No no no

407
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Hu Yijing

408
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm sorry

409
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I don't know why Guan Xiong came

410
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'll come to see you

411
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And the West Valley

412
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I know you must be concerned

413
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
The situation in Yuanbao Mountain Village

414
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Tell you

415
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Zong Rui Mingzhu is worried about someone

416
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Take out Bolan's head secretly

417
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Let him search

418
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Just let me out

419
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
This Zong Rui Mingzhu

420
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Still saving Zhiyu

421
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,640
to ask him?

422
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,440
Yes.

423
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,920
He said he'd rather be caught

424
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,200
than let Zhiyu go.

425
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,680
He also continued to search

426
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,280
for the head of Bolan in Yuanbao Villa.

427
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,080
Everyone cooperated with him

428
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,480
and said they must find the murderer

429
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,760
and seek justice for Jin Mantang.

430
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,840
They are all very thoughtful.

431
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,280
But the housekeeper is in a bad mood.

432
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,160
I don't know

433
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,040
if it's because of Jin Mantang's death

434
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,080
that he is too sad.

435
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,160
From last night to today,

436
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,200
he has been lost.

437
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,480
He doesn't even respond to her.

438
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,320
Is he so deep in love?

439
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,480
I didn't expect

440
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,520
Jianxiong is also a flower lover.

441
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,600
I just like

442
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,800
using flowers as medicine.

443
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,440
You are also a skilled artist.

444
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,520
You should know

445
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,400
the value of these flowers.

446
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,680
Li Lianhua,

447
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,760
what are you staring at?

448
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,640
It's not easy for you to come here.

449
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,520
Come on, I'll cook for you.

450
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,720
I don't have your share.

451
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,280
Li Lianhua,

452
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,360
I didn't expect you to be so good at cooking.

453
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,360
Come on, eat.

454
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,000
You are not only a skilled artist,

455
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,800
but also a reasonable person.

456
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,960
You are also good at cooking.

457
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,400
Pork belly chicken,

458
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,680
braised fish with brown sugar?

459
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,240
What's wrong with you?

460
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,560
I called you so many times,

461
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,480
but you just didn't cook.

462
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,520
You actually took the initiative to treat her today?

463
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
It's delicious.

464
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,200
Let the guests eat.

465
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,800
Slow down.

466
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,200
Brother Guan,

467
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,720
to be honest,

468
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,880
now that we are both

469
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,280
kicked out of Yuanbao Villa,

470
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,000
we can't find out a lot of things.

471
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,400
Now that you are here,

472
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,240
why don't you

473
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,360
give us a reason to make up?

474
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,200
How about it?

475
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,360
Well,

476
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,080
it's a little troublesome.

477
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,320
After all, I, Guan He Meng,

478
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,960
am a person with a good reputation.

479
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,640
It's not like anyone who treats us to a meal

480
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,720
will help us.

481
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,880
Miss Su,

482
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,000
why don't you consider it?

483
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:23,840
Miss Su?

484
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,120
Who?

485
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,520
Ru Yan, Xuan Zhen, Guan He Meng,

486
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,560
is good at competing with others.

487
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,400
When we first entered the villa,

488
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,960
you ran after people with the medicine.

489
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,840
It's definitely not the method

490
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,600
used by Ru Yan, Xuan Zhen and Guan He Meng.

491
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,400
When you first saw the body,

492
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,640
you had no judgment

493
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,760
about this body.

494
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,800
You even have a good sense of people.

495
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,800
So I guess

496
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,440
you don't know anything about art.

497
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,080
So?

498
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,360
The world is well-known in Yuanbao Villa.

499
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,040
So all the strange things

500
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,560
in the world are gathered here.

501
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,400
The world knows it.

502
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,240
But Guan He Meng

503
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,800
is not here to be investigated.

504
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,800
So the owner

505
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,760
must know about this.

506
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,840
Anything else?

507
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,760
You mentioned Su Wen Cai before.

508
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,280
So my guess is

509
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,920
you are the sister of Guan Xia Yi,

510
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,040
the granddaughter of Su Wen Cai,

511
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,160
Su Xiaoyong.

512
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,960
You're smart.

513
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:18,840
Good.

514
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,560
I'm Su Xiaoyong.

515
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,240
What?

516
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,920
You're a girl?

517
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,840
Or what?

518
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,520
You like to take the burden of others.

519
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,640
If the princess knows

520
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,240
what you've been doing,

521
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,040
how will you explain it?

522
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,480
I don't know.

523
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,080
Wait.

524
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,080
What do you mean by explaining to the princess?

525
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,720
I didn't say I wanted to be her father-in-law.

526
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,760
Don't talk nonsense.

527
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,400
That night, Miss Su

528
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,960
was seen by Jian Lin Xiao

529
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,360
coming out of the door in secret.

530
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,400
I guess she wanted to avoid the public

531
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,480
and take a bath.

532
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,320
That's right.

533
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,280
I'm just curious about the human head.

534
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,440
That's why I came to see you.

535
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,160
I didn't want to be found out.

536
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,280
Li Lian Hua.

537
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,480
Are you trying to take my identity

538
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,320
and threaten me to help you?

539
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,880
I'm not that kind of person.

540
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,920
I can help you.

541
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,480
But I'm not afraid that you'll reveal my identity.

542
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,240
It's because

543
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,400
I like you.

544
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,040
You...

545
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:22,840
I...

546
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,800
There's a rule in the Su family.

547
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,720
The daughter of the Su family

548
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,000
never gives people things easily.

549
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,160
Once she gives it to you,

550
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,720
it means she's in love with you.

551
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,520
You've already taken my heart.

552
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,640
You're mine now.

553
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,880
Why are you laughing?

554
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,960
Why are you eating?

555
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,240
It's all because of her.

556
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,480
It's because she doesn't have food to eat.

557
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,520
That's why I took it.

558
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,600
I'm a man of great fame.

559
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,880
How could I do such a thing?

560
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,040
So, this world

561
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,240
is not for you.

562
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,320
So, I have to complain about this world.

563
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,120
Li Lian Hua.

564
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,560
How could you talk to her like that?

565
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,240
I think Miss Su is nice.

566
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,240
You don't have to eat.

567
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,360
Miss Su.

568
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,840
I've already made up my mind

569
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,600
about the ten-fifth love.

570
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,960
In your case,

571
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,320
it's...

572
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,240
She hasn't made up her mind.

573
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,520
I've never heard her say it.

574
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,240
And

575
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,840
she said it the first time she saw you.

576
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,000
She's like a friend to you.

577
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
She's very close to you.

578
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,160
Really?

579
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,880
Miss Wan.

580
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,240
I do have someone I like.

581
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,960
But

582
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,000
she has a family background.

583
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,760
So, I've made up my mind

584
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,320
to not marry anyone.

585
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,640
I don't dare to delay you anymore.

586
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,440
I didn't know

587
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,720
that the Su family had so many rules.

588
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,840
Now I know.

589
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,640
I can't let this competition down.

590
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,280
Look at you.

591
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,640
Did I say anything?

592
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,760
Marriage?

593
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,000
Not only that.

594
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,560
We can

595
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,080
get to know each other better.

596
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,040
I'll help you with the case.

597
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,280
It's my gratitude for saving me.

598
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,400
Aunt Guan Xia.

599
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,600
What... What are you doing?

600
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,800
Don't be afraid.

601
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,280
I just want to ask you

602
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,600
a few questions.

603
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,360
I've told Li Lian Hua everything I know.

604
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,280
I really don't have the Bolan Head.

605
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,640
I know you don't have it.

606
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,440
Because

607
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,080
it's with me.

608
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,040
What?

609
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,240
You killed him?

610
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,840
I didn't kill him.

611
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,240
I killed him.

612
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,440
I killed him.

613
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,640
I killed him.

614
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,680
I killed him.

615
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,560
I've wronged you.

616
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,480
Who said I'm with them?

617
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,880
As for the girl,

618
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,000
she cured you and the Bolan Head

619
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,320
with strange disease.

620
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,720
You said

621
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,560
such a magical thing.

622
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,160
Which doctor doesn't want it?

623
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,800
You've got the memory.

624
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,720
Why are you still holding me?

625
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,200
Don't worry.

626
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,680
I'll get you out.

627
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,720
By then, you and the Bolan Head

628
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,320
will be in my hands.

629
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,800
I'll figure it out

630
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,000
the secret of the Bolan Head.

631
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,120
Episode 18

632
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,700
If you return a favor,

633
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,680
I'll get in trouble, too.

634
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,240
Qian Ling Xiao.

635
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,200
Li Lianhua is right.

636
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,520
You didn't succeed last time.

637
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,720
You won't give up.

638
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,520
You've been waiting outside the woodshed for a chance.

639
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,520
Jian, sorry to bother you.

640
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,520
I let you watch a play.

641
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,720
So you knew it was me.

642
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,440
How can I say?

643
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,520
I didn't know it was you at first.

644
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,320
But I suddenly remembered

645
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,120
once there were some petals

646
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,200
under your feet outside your room.

647
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,080
And those fresh petals

648
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,800
were originally medicinal plants.

649
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,640
But you didn't care.

650
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,960
So he went out

651
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,640
and put those petals on purpose.

652
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,200
It's not what you said.

653
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,480
For medicinal plants.

654
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,800
That's right.

655
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,360
I thought about it before.

656
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,200
In the hands of Jian Man Tang,

657
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,440
I suddenly found a little bit of a bruise.

658
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,600
But at that time, the blood in his nails

659
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,360
transferred his attention.

660
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,080
So I ignored it for a moment.

661
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,040
But now I suddenly remembered

662
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,200
those bees flying outside your room

663
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,560
were not accidental.

664
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,680
The flowers you raised

665
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,800
were for keeping bees, right?

666
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,040
You really keep bees with you.

667
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,120
Since you have set up this plan,

668
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,960
you should know clearly

669
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,920
that I don't have the head of the Polaris.

670
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,040
Otherwise,

671
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,560
I wouldn't have come after Guan He Meng.

672
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,760
That's right.

673
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,160
You're right.

674
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,080
Let me tell you.

675
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,320
That night,

676
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,760
I pretended to be Miss Zhi Yu

677
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,640
and found that someone

678
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,200
didn't kill her.

679
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,080
So I can be sure that

680
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,720
you want to catch Zhi Yu

681
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,360
because you want to get the head of the Polaris from her.

682
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,400
So

683
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,520
she was deceived by my words.

684
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,880
The flower was indeed used to keep bees.

685
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,880
But the honey of the honey is an accident.

686
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,400
This is the Black Bee.

687
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,640
It's a kind of honey that can

688
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,560
follow the human's tracks.

689
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,520
I just want to find

690
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,800
the head of the Polaris.

691
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,880
Master, open the door.

692
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,640
The next day, I was outside the Golden Pond.

693
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,320
I found the body of the bees that had broken the needle.

694
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,720
Then I found out that the Golden Pond was injured by her.

695
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,040
So,

696
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,040
the Golden Pond was poisoned by your poisonous bees.

697
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,560
But I didn't know

698
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,440
that you didn't get the head of the Polaris before she died.

699
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,080
Although the bees are poisonous,

700
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,440
they are just the poison of the honey.

701
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,200
They can't do anything to humans.

702
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,280
Whether you are a bee killer or not,

703
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,000
you can know it by looking at the poison.

704
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,360
But I still want to ask you,

705
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,480
why do you have to get the head of the Polaris?

706
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,440
So what if I want to get the head of the Polaris?

707
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,760
You guys,

708
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,360
who doesn't want to think about it?

709
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,160
This poisonous honey

710
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,520
won't kill anyone.

711
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,640
It seems that she didn't lie.

712
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,800
I don't know if Brother Jian can tell us now

713
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,040
why you insist on getting the head of the Polaris.

714
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,960
I want the head of the Polaris

715
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,640
to cure my son.

716
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,800
What's the difference between the two?

717
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,800
Can't you even get the head of the Polaris?

718
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,200
It's a congenital disease.

719
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,440
So when I saw Dong Lingye also have this disease,

720
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,200
I was very surprised.

721
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,360
To be honest,

722
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,200
the congenital disease is very rare.

723
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,400
And it's a family ancestor disease.

724
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,680
It's passed down from generation to generation.

725
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,480
Family ancestor disease?

726
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,200
My wife died from this disease.

727
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,800
Now, my son is also starting to get sick.

728
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,800
I don't want to see him

729
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,600
suffer like my wife.

730
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,880
No matter what,

731
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,800
he has to get the head of the Polaris.

732
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,120
Then Brother Jian,

733
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,400
how did you know

734
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,600
that the head of the Polaris

735
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,600
can cure this congenital disease?

736
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,800
Because I know

737
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,200
Jin Mantang

738
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,680
used the head of the Polaris

739
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,280
to cure his disease.

740
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,600
You mean Jin Mantang

741
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,600
also got congenital disease?

742
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,400
This disease is so rare.

743
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,800
Why are they all gathered together?

744
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
Could it be...

745
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,800
That's right.

746
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,480
My wife Jin Yuzhu

747
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,880
is the sister of Jin Mantang's stepmother.

748
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,280
Before his death,

749
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,280
Jin Yuzhu liked to travel and travel.

750
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:43,600
He was always in the

751
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,080
wind and rain.

752
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,280
His wife was born in the outside world.

753
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,280
She was never recognized

754
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,080
as the Yuanbao Villa.

755
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,480
It seems that

756
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,480
Dongming Duo Fan

757
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,080
is also related to Jin Yuzhu.

758
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,680
I also guessed so.

759
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,680
I didn't expect Jin Mantang

760
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,280
to not care about the bloodline at all.

761
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,480
He would rather watch them die

762
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,680
than take out the head of the Polaris.

763
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,280
I've been talking to Miss Zhi Yi

764
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,480
about this.

765
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,880
Every few days,

766
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,480
Jin Mantang used the head of the Polaris and his blood

767
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,480
to cure his congenital disease.

768
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,480
This method is extremely cruel

769
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,080
and is completely ungrateful.

770
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,680
Jian, you are a man of your word.

771
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,080
You must be reluctant

772
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,880
to get this head of the Polaris.

773
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,480
There is nothing to be gained by this.

774
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,280
Not really.

775
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,280
At least, we can now be sure

776
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,880
that Dongming was in this secret room

777
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,680
half a month ago.

778
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,880
What we need to figure out now is

779
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,280
how he survived for so many days.

780
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,480
Crying snakes stop the poison

781
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,280
can make people sick

782
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,680
and feel greedy.

783
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,080
But Dongming is actually a brain injury.

784
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,480
He died of excessive loss of blood.

785
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,080
It was not in our Dao Sect

786
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,680
but earlier, half a month ago.

787
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,680
Miss Su,

788
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,480
can you do me another favor?

789
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,480
Okay.

790
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,680
What's the use of you asking Su Xiaoyang

791
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,480
to return to the secret room?

792
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,080
We didn't find any clues before

793
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,080
and we can still count on her.

794
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,680
That's why I asked her to bring a helper.

795
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,680
Helper?

796
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,680
You guys are here.

797
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,680
Look.

798
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,880
This is a steamed bun with crab?

799
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,080
Yes.

800
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,280
You really did bring it.

801
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,480
Helping is still useful.

802
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,080
Brother.

803
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,680
It's your turn.

804
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,480
Li Lianhua is smart.

805
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,680
She thought of using a mouse to find clues.

806
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,280
Fang Xiaobao,

807
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,080
didn't you ask Dongming

808
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,280
why he was trapped for so long

809
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,480
and didn't starve to death?

810
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,280
Isn't that the answer?

811
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,680
Someone sent him food.

812
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,880
But the door to the secret room

813
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,680
can only be opened by the Golden Pellet.

814
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,680
Could it be...

815
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,480
Su Xiaoyang,

816
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,880
you're here.

817
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,880
I'm here.

818
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,880
I'm here.

819
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,880
I'm here.

820
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,680
Su Xiaoyang,

821
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,680
did you find these steamed buns

822
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,680
at the wall

823
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,280
facing the yard?

824
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,480
How did you know?

825
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,880
Is there a piece of unevenness

826
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,680
at the height of the wall?

827
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,680
That's right.

828
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,280
There should be a vent above.

829
00:34:59,280 --> 00:34:59,880
It's very simple.

830
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,080
That person sent food

831
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,080
from this vent to Dongming.

832
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,280
That's why Dongming

833
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,480
can live for so long.

834
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,880
That person was trying to lure people into their ears

835
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,880
and blocked the vent.

836
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,080
In that case,

837
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,880
the person who helped him

838
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,280
was the most suspicious.

839
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,880
He deliberately let Dongming live

840
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,080
so that he and Jing Mantang

841
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,680
could kill each other.

842
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,480
It's not that simple.

843
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,480
He's very cunning.

844
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,480
The charcoal and food

845
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,280
were blocked by the vent.

846
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,080
Could Dongming not have been poisoned

847
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,680
but died of carbon dioxide?

848
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,680
Carbon dioxide?

849
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,080
The person who helped him

850
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,580
burned charcoal

851
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,880
in the vent of the chamber

852
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,680
after he died.

853
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,880
Dongming was absorbed

854
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,080
by the carbon dioxide.

855
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,680
After losing consciousness,

856
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,280
he hit his head

857
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,080
and died of excessive blood loss.

858
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,680
I thought it was strange before.

859
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,080
Dongming

860
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:07,880
did have

861
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,280
a scar from the poison arrow.

862
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,680
But the scar was very shallow.

863
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,080
Dongming's internal force was good.

864
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,480
How could this poison

865
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,480
make him lose consciousness?

866
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,480
But he didn't have

867
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,880
any other traces of poisoning.

868
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,280
So he ignored it.

869
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,680
That's right.

870
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,880
In that case,

871
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,280
Jing Mantang's death

872
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,680
was a good thing.

873
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,280
It's not that simple.

874
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,680
It's not that simple.

875
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,880
It's not that simple.

876
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,280
It's not that simple.

877
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,680
It's not that simple.

878
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,480
Jing Mantang's shoes

879
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,680
can explain it.

880
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,880
The secret room is not inside

881
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,680
but it's not a key

882
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,080
but a point-point mechanism.

883
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,280
So even if Dongming

884
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,280
turned over the whole body of Jing Mantang,

885
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,480
he couldn't turn over the key.

886
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,880
Be quiet.

887
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,080
If there's a chance,

888
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,880
the vent

889
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,680
can still send Dongming food.

890
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,080
So there's no doubt

891
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,280
that this person

892
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,880
must be in this Yuanbao Villa.

893
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,480
That's right.

894
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,680
But

895
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,580
there are so many

896
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,280
people in this Yuanbao Villa.

897
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,080
Who is it?

898
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,080
Ding Lianhua,

899
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,880
where are we going now?

900
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,880
Fang Xiaobao,

901
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,880
you forgot the charcoal

902
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,480
so quickly.

903
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,880
What's wrong with the charcoal?

904
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,680
Take a closer look.

905
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,080
The charcoal is soft and white.

906
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,680
It should be silver silk charcoal.

907
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,880
What's wrong?

908
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,680
Now,

909
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,880
it's about to taste winter.

910
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,880
The charcoal in the cabinet

911
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,480
will definitely be locked in the warehouse.

912
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,280
So this season,

913
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,880
who will take away silver silk charcoal

914
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,880
in Yuanbao Villa?

915
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,080
The steward Jin Changbao.

916
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,680
Only he has the key to the internal warehouse.

917
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,880
That's right.

918
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,680
Zongzheng Mingzhu

919
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,280
searched the whole Yuanbao Villa

920
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,280
but didn't find the head of Bolan.

921
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,280
I think the head of Bolan

922
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,680
may not have left

923
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,480
this room of Jing Mantang at all.

924
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,080
I understand.

925
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,880
I'll go to Yuanbao Villa now.

926
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,280
Please wait.

927
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,880
I heard that you are

928
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,480
guests of Yuanbao Villa.

929
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,080
I happen to have some

930
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,280
medicines that Jin Yuan likes to drink.

931
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,680
But I don't know why

932
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,680
Steward Jin

933
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,080
hasn't come to get them these days.

934
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,280
The medicine of Jing Mantang?

935
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,280
That's right.

936
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,280
I don't know if you can

937
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,280
help me take this medicine

938
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,680
to Yuanbao Villa.

939
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,080
The amount of daily use is different.

940
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,280
I have marked it.

941
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,480
Come on, give me more.

942
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,480
Okay.

943
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,640
Why are these medicines

944
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,680
all in double portions?

945
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,480
Before,

946
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,080
they were only one portion per day.

947
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,280
These two years,

948
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,480
Steward Jin said

949
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,280
that the disease of Jing Yuan is getting worse.

950
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,480
The doctor who invited him

951
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,680
said that the medicine should be in large quantities.

952
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,880
So, he took two portions per day.

953
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,080
I have been secretly

954
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,280
paying attention to the medicine of Jing Mantang.

955
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,680
Judging from the medicine of the pharmacy,

956
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,880
it is indeed used to treat the congenital disease.

957
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,280
But from what I have observed,

958
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,680
he doesn't use two doses of medicine every day.

959
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,280
That's great.

960
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,880
Steward Jin personally

961
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,080
ordered me to take two portions per day.

962
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,080
Then, this medicine

963
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,680
was also taken by Jin Changbao himself.

964
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,880
That's right.

965
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,280
Steward Jin is loyal to the outside world of Jin Yuan.

966
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,080
I think he will be willing to take the medicine.

967
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,080
Lingling,

968
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,280
could it be that...

969
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,080
Could it be that Jin Changbao also has congenital disease?

970
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,680
Could it be that he is also the son of Jin Mantang's father?

971
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,480
The commander has ordered

972
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,280
that you two are not allowed to enter.

973
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,680
We have found important clues.

974
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,080
If you don't let us in,

975
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,480
if the suspect runs away,

976
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,880
how will the Supervisory Bureau handle it?

977
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,080
Last time, I didn't arrest you

978
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,080
because of Minister Fang.

979
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,280
Please leave immediately.

980
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,480
You...

981
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,480
Brother Li, Brother Fang.

982
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,280
Brother Yang.

983
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,280
I heard that Zongzheng Mingzhu

984
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,280
has brought the Supervisory Bureau people here.

985
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,280
I'm worried.

986
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,280
So, I came to see.

987
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,680
The Supervisory Bureau is now

988
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,280
in the turn of having a criminal as its supervisor.

989
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:52,880
I don't know

990
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,280
if the Supervisory Bureau's supervisors

991
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,280
can still hold the coffin.

992
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,680
Forget it.

993
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,680
We have other things to do.

994
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,880
It's just that...

995
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,880
Something happened!

996
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,880
Something happened!

997
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,880
Deputy Manager Yang, something happened.

998
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,680
What happened?

999
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,480
The supervisor of Yuanbao Villa, Jin Changbao,

1000
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,680
committed suicide.

1001
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,880
You dare to break in again?

1002
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,280
Yang Yun Chun?

1003
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,880
You actually colluded with these two

1004
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,880
who are faking and lying.

1005
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,080
I saw it with my own eyes.

1006
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,680
Miss Shi Shui from Baichuan Courtyard

1007
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,080
sent a group of people to Fang Duobing.

1008
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,280
Why did they lie?

1009
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,880
These two are suspicious.

1010
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,280
They've been kicked out by me.

1011
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,080
You're just a deputy manager.

1012
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,880
You dare to disobey my order.

1013
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,280
Although I'm a deputy manager,

1014
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,680
I have the right to give the Heavenly Dragon's title

1015
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,880
and the power to govern the Heavenly Dragon.

1016
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,080
I heard that

1017
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,680
something happened to the supervisor.

1018
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,280
If Zongzheng Mingzhu is fine,

1019
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,280
I'll go in and check.

1020
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,680
Fang Xiao Meng,

1021
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,880
this is much more magnificent

1022
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,080
than Baichuan Courtyard.

1023
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,680
What's going on?

1024
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,880
Jin Changbao is so mischievous.

1025
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,080
How could he commit suicide?

1026
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,480
The supervisor may have been

1027
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,680
too sad

1028
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,880
because of Master's death.

1029
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,080
He either lost his soul

1030
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,280
or got emotional these days.

1031
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,080
He cried and laughed for a while.

1032
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,280
He kept saying,

1033
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,880
why can't I do it?

1034
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,880
Why is it useless?

1035
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,680
I've been treating the supervisor

1036
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,080
for the past two days.

1037
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,480
The needle on his head

1038
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,480
was what I

1039
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,480
used to

1040
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,880
use to pierce his brain.

1041
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,680
But I only

1042
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,080
finished the needle for him

1043
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,680
and went out to make the medicine.

1044
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,680
I heard that

1045
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,680
the supervisor learned a short sword.

1046
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,680
What a pity.

1047
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,280
It's a pity.

1048
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,480
I wanted to

1049
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,680
ask the supervisor

1050
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,080
about something.

1051
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,280
It seems that

1052
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,480
I have to

1053
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,880
do it myself.

1054
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,280
Come on.

1055
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,520
No way.

1056
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,680
How dare you?

1057
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,480
Come on.

1058
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,880
Never!

1059
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,780
Get into the edge 1900 aspects of wait strum,

1060
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,580
I want to interview you.

1061
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,280
Why are you here?

1062
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,280
Come on.

1063
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,280
Don't let me know if you want to reconnaissance.

1064
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,280
don't leave.

1065
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,480
I have white onion,

1066
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,480
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

1067
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,480
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

1068
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,480
