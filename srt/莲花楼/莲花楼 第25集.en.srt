Farewell, your Highness.

8

You're in such a hurry to bid me farewell.

Do you take me for a plague?

10

But you said you were leaving.

What are you thanking me for?

Can he really cure us?

100
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,380
Then we can leave here.

101
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:11,730
Yes.

102
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,780

Yes

104
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,820
The Nanyin people left their hometown.

105
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,250
But they must need a place to worship their ancestors.

106
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,220
We've found

107
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,530
Jin Mantang's ancestral hall.

108
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,280
But we've never seen Yu Louchun's ancestral hall.

109
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,020
I think the formula for the antidote

110
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,450
should be in the same place as the ancestral hall.

-Go ahead.
-I’m sorry.

114
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,340
I'll look into the ancestral hall.

115
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,760
Let's go there.

116
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,430
Mr. Fang,

117
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,340
are you the nephew of Shan Gudao?

118
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:49,960
Yes.

119
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,540
That's good.

120
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,290
Thank you for saving me from Li Yufu's

123
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,580
But I have a favor to ask.

124
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,260
Please help me.

125
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,220
Go ahead.

126
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,360
Many years ago,

127
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,100
Shan Gudao once brought a piece of cloud iron

128
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,300
to the Weapon Valley.

129
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,190
He said he wanted to make himself an armor piece

130
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,420
and a sword for Li Xiangyi.

131
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,440
But he died in the battle against the Jinyuan Alliance.

132
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,840
It doesn't make sense.

133
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,860
Why?

134
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,980
Mr. Fang, you don’t know.

135
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,720
Cloud iron is both the toughest and softest material to exist.

136
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,580
The Weapon Valley had only ever seen

137
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,040
Shan Gudao with such a material once in a hundred years.

138
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,140
The armor forged from cloud iron

139
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,460
can only be penetrated by

140
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,060
Li Xiangyi's Wenjing Sword,

141
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,380
which was also made from cloud iron.

142
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,740
I saw my father forge it with my own two eyes.

143
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,070
There's no doubting it.

144
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,530
So I wanted to ask you

145
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,030
if Shan Gudao was wearing the armor

146
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,320
when he died.

147
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:45,350
This...

148
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,470
Only Li Xiangyi's Wenjing Sword

149
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,400
can penetrate Shan Gudao's armor.

150
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,780
Isn't it just like what they said at the Sigu Tea Party?

151
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,380
The death of Shan Gudao is very strange indeed.

152
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,020
My father held a grudge

153
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,550
over this matter for years.

154
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,860
That’s why I came to ask you.

155
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,020
He wasn't wearing

156
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,340
the armor.

157
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:10,750
I see.

158
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:11,860
Great!

159
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:12,980
Great.

160
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,620
I’ll take my leave.

161
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,610
If you do visit me in the Weapon Valley in the future,

162
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,460
I’ll compose ten poems for you.

163
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,340
Goodbye.

164
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,220
Goodbye.

165
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,390
The armor was indeed on my father's body.

166
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,060
But a hole was pierced into it by a sword.

167
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,010
What the hell is going on here?

168
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,060
Fang Xiaobao.

169
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,250
Why are you spacing out?

170
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,400
Let's go. I found the ancestral hall.

171
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,370
I asked Xifei.

172
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,270
There should be a Yingyue Pavilion

173
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,730
near the Guanri Pavilion.

174
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,320
It's just a pavilion.

175
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,100
Why didn't Yu Louchun allow

176
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,180
anyone near it for the past few years?

177
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:57,580
All these years,

178
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,920
Xifei has only seen one guest,

179
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,290
Jin Mantang.

180
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,700
What's on your mind?

181
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,220
The fog here is so heavy,

182
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,180
it's exactly the same as the fog at the Yipin Tomb.

183
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,540
If my guess is right,

184
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,020
the key

185
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,330
should be this tree.

186
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:25,830
I did it.

187
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:26,720
Let's go.

188
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:46,980
Li Lianhua!

189
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,650
Li Lianhua!

190
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,510
Fei!

191
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,590
At least you have a conscience.

192
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,300
The trick of this mechanism is the stone walls on both sides.

193
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,590
Think of a way to push them back.

194
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,120
Why don't you think of a way?

195
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,540
Yangzhouman?

196
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,040
I'm exhausted.

197
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,240
Your inner power is Yangzhouman?

198
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,130
I'm very familiar with inner powers.

199
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,660
Where did you learn it from?

200
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,290
Tell me,

201
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,110
what's the name of this technique?

202
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,620
Oh, it's an amazing one.

203
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,650
It's as powerful as Yangzhouman,

204
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,780
called Suzhoukuai.

205
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,340
This is not Yangzhouman.

206
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,080
It's called Suzhoukuai, understand?

207
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,480
I’ll teach you next time.

208
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,240
What are you waiting for?

209
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,190
Find Li Lianhua.

210
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,450
What happened to the two of you?

211
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,650
What took you so long?

212
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,880
Everything is here.

213
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,610
I found them.

214
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,630
Young master, here.

215
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,690
This is the formula for the antidote.

216
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:18,740
Take it.

217
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,650
Take a good look.

218
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,580
Take it.

219
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,380
This is Yu Louchun's ledger from ten years ago.

220
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,180
I've checked all these ledgers.

221
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,230
Ten years ago,

222
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:30,410
Yu Louchun

223
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,180
rarely invited people to the Girls' Mansion.

224
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,620
Apart from Jin Mantang,

225
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,330
there were only two other people.

226
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,810
One of them was Four-faced Qingzun from the Jinyuan Alliance.

227
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,140
The other was the Lord of the Netherworld.

228
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,640
I think these two are descendants of Nanyin.

229
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,030
Four-faced Qingzun and Jinyuan Alliance?

230
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:50,790
Oh, right.

231
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,290
It's also a famous sect in the martial world.

232
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,820
It’s no surprise if you've heard of it before.

233
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,660
But the Four-faced Qingzun

234
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,630
had long died

235
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,240
in Prison 188,

236
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,380
which is your territory.

237
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,230
The only clue left

238
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,260
is this Lord of the Netherworld.

239
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:08,740
See?

240
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,590
I'm still the best.

241
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:14,820
Fang Xiaobao.

242
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,370
Why are you spacing out?

243
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:19,630
I'm not.

244
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,460
I just think

245
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,360
it's good to have a smart friend like you.

246
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,510
That's right.

247
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,340
Let's go.

248
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,980
You two nearly scared me to death.

249
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,510
Hurry up.

250
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,160
This is the prescription.

251
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,790
Please find a physician

252
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,480
to make an antidote for the guards.

253
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,740
Don’t worry, Mr. Fang.

254
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,160
Will you report back to Sigu Sect with us?

255
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,610
I have something important to do.

256
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,560
Please help me

257
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,500
report back instead, Sister Shi.

258
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,450
What are the Jinyuan Alliance and Nanyin up to?

259
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,350
If you've changed your mind,

260
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,350
it's not too late.

261
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,860
Maybe Baichuan Court

262
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,660
can reduce your punishment.

263
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:11,190
Fine.

264
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,900
You're on your own.

265
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,330
If it's really him,

266
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,350
how could he be hurt by Li Yifu?

267
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,490
He brought it on himself.

268
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,150
Are you okay?

269
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,700
I'm fine.

270
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,330
He was right behind you just now.

271
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,790
You really didn't notice?

272
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,010
No.

273
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,350
Luckily you came in time.

274
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,610
That really scared me.

275
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,820
Check it out for me.

276
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,390
How is it?

277
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,980
Is it serious? Any marks?

278
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,220
Stop messing around.

279
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,160
Miss Shi,

280
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,010
shall we proceed to the

281
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,140
local government office

282
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,140
and count the confiscated goods?

283
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:32,580
Let's go.

284
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:38,710
Let's go.

285
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,730
It's time to move.

286
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,940
Let's find the Lord of the Netherworld.

287
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,700
Why are we avoiding the Baichuan Court?

288
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,890
That's because you've done a lot of evil in the martial world.

289
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,090
If someone finds out,

290
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,430
it'll be a big trouble.

291
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,400
Am I really wrong?

292
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,610
How could Li Lianhua be Li Xiangyi?

293
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,340
But...

294
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,530
What about the Yangzhouman?

295
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,580
Di Feisheng.

296
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,050
Li Xiangyi.

297
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:24,460
No.

298
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,040
I have to get to the bottom of this.

299
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:38,910
What are you doing?

300
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:39,790
Here.

301
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,210
Have a drink on me.

302
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:41,880
A celebration for

303
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,940
solving the big Girls' Mansion case.

304
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,740
You're treating me with my wine?

305
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,870
You're so eloquent.

306
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,550
I just want to drink and

307
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,820
chat with you, can't I?

308
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,480
What do you want to chat about?

309
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,140
How about why you know Yangzhouman?

310
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,700
What Yangzhouman? You're so full of strange words.

311
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,940
Stop pretending.

312
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,820
It's the inner skill mental factor you taught me.

313
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,680
Let me tell you.

314
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,270
I rarely offer to let bygones be bygones.

315
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,840
Think before you answer.

316
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,560
If you're really hiding something from me,

317
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,760
you'd better tell me everything today.

318
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,810
You mean the mental factor?

319
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,500
I remember it now.

320
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,250
What did I tell you back in that cave?

321
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,820
Can you stop talking nonsense?

322
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,100
There can't be so many coincidences at once.

323
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,100
Do you take this for writing a novel?

324
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:26,870
Let me ask you.

325
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,380
You know Yangzhouman,

326
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,340
and you appeared in Yuanbao Villa at the same time

327
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,950
as that mysterious swordsman in white.

328
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:31,350
You...

329
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,270
Are you Li Xiangyi?

330
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,960
Li Xiangyi? How's that possible?

331
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,130
Fang Xiaobao.

332
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,230
If I were Li Xiangyi,

333
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,940
how could Fo, Bi, Bai, and Shi not have recognized me?

334
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,660
Besides,

335
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,040
I asked you to practice every day,

336
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,280
but you only think about this nonsense.

337
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:04,680
What?

338
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:06,790
You don't trust me?

339
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,130
Do you know that

340
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,839
my father had impenetrable armor

341
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,020
forged from cloud iron?

342

343
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:18,619
Junior.

344

It's your first time leaving the mountains for training.

345

The He family of Changma Blade Sect

346
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,460
was besieged by the Dongling Three Gang.

347
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,589
It'll be dangerous.

348
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,339
You should not take the risk.

349

The Changma Blade Sect has long retired.

352

The Dongling Three Gang claims to be eliminating bandits,

353
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,060
but they are actually coveting the He family's cloud iron.

354
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,330
I must interfere with this matter.

I beg of you.

364
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:12,050

365

Don't worry.

366
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,620
-We will...
-Junior.

367
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,180
I heard that the He family owns the

368
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,980
cloud iron, a material that is both tough and soft.

369
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:22,850
Heroes,

370
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,620
as long as my son arrives safely,

371
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:32,050
he will tell you the whereabouts of the cloud iron.

372
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,420
There is no need.

373
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:34,940
A hero does not

374
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,880
take advantage of others.

375
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,260
I'm just worried that it might fall into the wrong hands.

376
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,320
That's why I asked.

377
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,370
Master He, don't worry.

378
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,060
We will send your son

379
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,100

380
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:49,730
Senior.

381
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,440
You asked me to assist you outside the city that day.

382
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,570
You escorted the kid to Luoyang alone.

383
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,150
Did you personally send him to his grandfather's house?

384
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,880
Then why did he still die outside of Luoyang City?

385
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,510
Really?

386
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,700
Of course I sent him

387
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,300
to his grandfather's house.

388
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,820
The He family of Changma Blade Sect committed a lot of evil deeds.

389
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,330
It must be their enemies seeking revenge

390
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,930
and wanting to get rid of him.

391
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,750
How unfortunate.

Did Senior still acquire the cloud iron in the end?

395
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:29,510
No.

396
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,240
He's definitely not that kind of person.

397
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,690
It's just a random guess.

398

If you had only stumbled upon the Yangzhouman,

your words are meaningless?

I just don't get it.

421
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,070
You obviously lied to him.

422
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,630
But you don't seem to want to harm him.

423

Tell me something about myself

Lian Quan, Lord of the Netherworld,

The Shishou Village.

455
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,530
It is said that Shishou Village was famous for

456
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,280
its Rouchang wine, which can enhance one's inner power.

457
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,010
Back then, many people in the martial world went there for the wine.

Rouchang wine.

I may have heard of this legend before.

00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:28,770
Was the Lord of the Netherworld also seeking the Rouchang wine?

had a serious internal injury once.

464

If Rouchang wine can increase his inner power,

465
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,780
it's possible for him to go to Shishou Village.

00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,340
is always getting in my way.

512
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:48,170
We can't keep such a nuisance alive.

513
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,900
Mount Chrysanthemum is Feng Qing's territory.

514
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,020
I'll wait for your good news there.

515
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,430
Go now.

516
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,020
We've been circling around Mount Chrysanthemum for so many times.

517
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,750
We haven't even seen a village.

518
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:21,360
No wonder

519
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,910
they said Shishou Village is a mysterious village.

520
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:26,440
Could it be that we're not destined to find it?

521
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,020
I don't know if it's destiny.

522
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,900
But we seem to be lost.

523
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,300
Lost?

524
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,610
Are you kidding me?

525
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,860
I've never been lost since I was six.

526
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,070
Even in the desert,

527
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,060
I could find my way.

528
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:38,620
We're already lost.

529
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,740
Stop bragging.

530
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,440
Let's go. Hurry up.

531
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,650
[Bahuang Hunyuan Lake]

532
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,300
Bahuang Hunyuan Lake.

533
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,540
Since there's a boundary stone here,

534
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,340
there should be someone nearby.

535
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,610
I'll wash my face by the lake.

536
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,250
Come and have a look.

537
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,960
I just wanted to wash my face.

538
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,020
But why are there skulls in the water?

539
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,000
It's the reflection of the strange stones.

540
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:41,670
Move!

541
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,450
Who are you?

542
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,690
Can't I wash my face in peace?

543
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,900
We're the ones who will kill you.

544
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,740
Windy Poplar?

545
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,730
My Lord.

546
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,980
Who are you? Why are you calling me your lord?

547
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,580
Don't you recognize me?

548
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:45,100
I'm your subordinate, Snow Master.

549
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,540
You are the director of the Jinyuan Alliance.

550
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,730
The Jinyuan Alliance. Director.

551
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:08,870
Let's go!

552
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:33,580
Are you okay?

553
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,800
I'm fine. How are you?

554
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,330
I'm fine.

555
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,760
What is this place?

556
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,880
Looks like

557
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,330
we've rounded to the back of the mountain.

558
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:44,630
Let's go.

559
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,550
Let's go over there.

560
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,850
Out of the woods, another village.

561
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,140
It's truly destined.

562
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,700
You were staring at that lake for a long time.

563
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,930
You must have long noticed that

564
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,990
something was under the lake, right?

565
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:20,750
Fei, what's wrong?

566
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,220
The Wuxin Huai poison is spreading throughout his body.

567
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,810
Use your power to suppress it for him.

568
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,120
I...

569
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,090
Why should I save this villain?

570
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:33,930
Hurry up.

571
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:35,750
Fine.

572
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:37,510
I can't let you die

573
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,970
before I take you to Baichuan Court.

574
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,820
Why is this small village so quiet?

575
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,870
Are you feeling better?

576
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,900
The Jinyuan Alliance. My Lord.

577
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,140
What do they mean?

578
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,320
You mentioned these words before.

579
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,720
You must know something.

580
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,530
Why do I have a headache whenever I think of it?

581
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,760
Well,

582
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,600
about the Jinyuan Alliance.

583
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,180
You really were

584
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,790
the evil leader of the Jinyuan Alliance.

585
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,150
You were their lord.

586
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,050
However,

587
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,990
you've turned over a new leaf.

588
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,550
You are no longer on their side.

589
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,210
That's why they poisoned you.

590
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:37,970
What's wrong?

591
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,790
Your words can never be fully trusted.

592
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,970
But I can't completely disregard them either.

593
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:43,500
Listen.

594
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,830
-I’m not lying.
-Let's enter the village.

595
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:50,720
Li Lianhua.

596
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,000
How long do you think we can

597
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,530
keep lying to him like this?

598
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:58,050
But if he regains his memory,

599
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:59,530
he might be able to figure out

600
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,730
what happened in the Jinyuan Alliance.

601
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,010
I have something

602
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,050
to ask him too.

603
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,460
Is it about your father?

604
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:14,050
If he regains his memory,

605
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,410
do you think he'll be a friend or foe?

606
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,190
[Shishou Village]

607
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,090
Shishou Village?

608
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,860
This is the legendary paradise?

609
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:28,050
Maybe it's not paradise season yet.

610
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:28,490
Right?

611
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:32,030
But this village is so hidden.

612
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,180
Did the Lord of the Netherworld really come here?

613
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,510
It's been so many years.

614
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,330
It's not easy to find someone.

615
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,180
It's not dark yet.

616
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,520
Why is there no one outside?

617
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,030
Kid.

618
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:54,980
Excuse me.

619
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:55,990
It's getting dark.

620
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,520
I told you not to run around.

621
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,620
The villagers are strange.

622
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:04,090
They seem to be avoiding something.

623
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:07,250
Wasn't this place known for its Rouchang wine,

624
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,220
and many martial artists came here for it?

625
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,950
Why is it in this state instead?

626
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,320
This place is indeed strange.

627
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:15,740
It's getting late.

628
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,580
Let's find an inn first.

629
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:18,630
Let's go.

[Yuquan Inn]

633
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,700
no one has lived here for a long time.

634
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,060
This village is so desolate.

635
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,120
But they built an inn here.

636
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,580
Who is it for?

637
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,540
Maybe it was quite lively a few years ago.

638
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:51,490
Don't forget.

639
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,170
Many martial artists

640
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,690
came here for the Rouchang wine.

641
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,670
Let's go in.

642
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,070
What is this?

643
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:39,670
Don't you think

644
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,330
there's a strange smell here?

645
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:44,400
What smell?

646
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:46,940
The smell of the dead.

647
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,050
It's all blood.

648
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,590
You're right.

649
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,660
The marks here are short and messy.

650
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,750
They weren't caused by swords or blades.

651
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,670
It's more like

652
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,690
someone tore into them with bare hands.

653
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,490
The blood splattered very fast.

654
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:34,330
I'm afraid the victim won't survive.

655
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:39,470
Look.

656
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,040
Be careful.

657
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:35,530
This way.

658
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,350
Someone hanged to death here.

659
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,610
Since they have retrieved the body,

660
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,340
why didn't they remove the cloth

661
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,870
and the bench on the ground?

662
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,510
At night, the ghost emerged from the fourth room.

663
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,080
It peeped into my window.

664
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,700
I am terrified.

665
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,970
I wish you were here.

666
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,660
It's a suicide note.

667
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,020
This is left by a woman.

668
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,020
Before her husband returned,

669
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,170
she encountered something terrible.

670
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,830
It forced her to hang herself.

671
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,680
She said a ghost entered through the window.

672
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,080
The main hall does have a lot of

673
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,480
bamboo tags with ghost characters on them.

674
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,270
Is this another haunted inn?

675
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,660
Don't you think it's strange?

676
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,260
There's the sound of wind outside,

677
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,660
but the wind can't get in.

678
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,060
It's as if someone is blocking the wind.

679
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,630
It's a ghost.

680
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,470
The ghost blocked the wind for you.

681
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,650
Are you done?

682
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,320
Fine.

683
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,550
Let's go our separate ways.

684
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,860
Did you find anything?

685
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:48,880
There are signs of a

686
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,230
serious battle in the room.

687
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,550
But the bodies are all gone.

688
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,140
It's like everyone disappeared

689
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,470
at the same time one day.

690
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,070
How did we get in here?

691
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,800
There's a door.

692
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,020
You're right.

693
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,050
What is it?

694
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,400
This severed hand was ripped off.

695
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,950
Judging from the decay,

696
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,580
it should be less than four to five days.

697
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,740
That means

698
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,280
this ghost is still killing.

699
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:34,050
Why are you looking at me?

700
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:34,960
Think about it.

701
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,210
We've been in the inn for so long.

702
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:39,270
Maybe we're already being targeted.

703
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:42,350
If we don't leave this inn now,

704
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,670
we'll be in danger.

705
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,870
Look. On the doorframe.

706
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,870
Looks like this hand

707
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,480
had an insane grip.

708
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,310
If not for the traces of martial arts,

709
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:09,200
I would have thought that the people here

710
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,130
were torn apart by a vicious tiger.

711
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,270
The pillar was broken like this.

712
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:16,690
I'm afraid this beast

713
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,160
was no match for the owner of this severed hand either.

714
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:24,700
They even managed to

715
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,560
split such a tough copper censer.

716
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,790
This was split open in one strike.

717
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:31,020
The person must have been quite skilled.

718
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,880
But they are still inferior to me.

719
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,080
Why are you looking at me?

720
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:45,030
The sword mark split the copper censer from the center.

721
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,500
But the sword tilted left by three points.

722
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,840
This seems to be a move from Zhaoyue Sect.

723
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:49,920
Also,

724
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:53,060
the fingerprints and the palm print on the doorframe

725
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,460
were also made by people.

726
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:57,140
The finger strength was strong enough to dent a hard surface.

727
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,270
There are also claw marks on each side.

728
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,030
This is the outer martial arts of the Kunlun Sect.

729
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,060
Identifying the moves and sects only through the marks...

730
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:09,190
Only those who are skilled in martial arts can do that.

731
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:09,910
Li Lianhua.

732
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:11,700
Who are you?

733
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:12,590
Zhaoyue here,

734
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:13,470
Kunlun there.

735
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:15,660
Looks like a bunch of skilled martial artists

736
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,920
really did fight here.

737
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:19,380
If it really was a fight between martial artists,

738
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,980
why are there so many

739
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
beast marks here?

740
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:23,470
Fang Xiaobao,

741
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,240
have you heard of

742
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,200
any sect in the martial world

743
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,370
that specializes in taming beasts?

744
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:38,650
What are you doing?

745
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:40,450
Why are you spacing out at night?

746
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:42,330
I've never heard of it.

747
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:46,190
You're right.

748
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,650
Where did these people go?

749
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,870
Whether they won or lost the fight,

750
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,840
they had to leave after fighting.

751
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,320
They might have left after the fight,

752
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,360
but this is an inn.

753
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:55,820
It has been deserted all these years.

754
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,720
Is there no one here to clean this up?

755
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,120
So many people died here,

756
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:01,720
and there are so many talismans downstairs.

757
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,080
Maybe no one dared to come in

758
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:03,810
because this place is haunted.
