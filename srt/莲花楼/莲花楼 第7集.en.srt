[Episode 7]

4
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,300
The head is a very strange thing.

5
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,509
It leaks a lot of secrets,

6
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,979
whether one is dead or alive.

7
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:45,729
What do you mean?

8
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,620
At this point,

9
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,820
we need to find out the truth

10
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,520
about Zhang Qingshi's death first.

11
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,220
The murderer made a hole on the wall

12
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,430
to frame someone else after the murder.

13
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,430
It means he must have entered through the front door.

14
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,330
But Zhang Qinghu was staying in the same room

15
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,010
and didn't see anything.

16
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:04,700
What if

17
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,170
they weren't staying in the same room?

18
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:12,210
Room 4 and Room 5 are adjacent to each other.

19
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,870
Which one do you think is Room 4?

20
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,040
Isn't it obvious?

21
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:15,820
One is 4.

22
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,290
The other is 5.

23
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:17,320
This one, of course.

24
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,320
This is strange.

25
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,180
How come this one is 4 as well?

26
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,340
You put the mud on it?

27
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,010
As it was dark,

28
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,560
the murderer only needed to cover the white dot
in the middle on Room 5's door sign

29
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,880
and add a dot

30
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,860
with this white powder to Room 4's door sign

31
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,630
to switch the numbers.

32
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,340
As long as the Zhang Brothers came back separately,

33
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,510
the murderer could perform this trick

34
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,030
in the interval between their returns

35
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,280
and make the one who came back later

36
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,350
mistake Room 5 for Room 4.

37
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,170
But I saw the Zhang Brothers

38
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,260
leave Canglu Garden together

39
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,530
last night.

40
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,070
They should have come back together.

41
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,340
Why did they separate on the way?

42
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,380
So how come you lost them?

43
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,060
I'll show you.

44
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,530
I followed them here last night

45
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,690
and lost them.

46
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,010
I see.

47
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:26,820
Let's re-enact it.

48
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,020
Li Lianhua?

49
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,440
You're going the wrong way.

50
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:58,610
That's the secret of last night?

51
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,950
It's very foggy here,

52
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,140
which makes this place suitable for employing
the Qi Men Dun Jia technique.

53
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,280
A master doesn't have to do much.

54
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,940
It only takes a few simple steps to get people astray.

55
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,560
Li Lianhua?

56
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,410
Zhang Qinghu and his elder brother

57
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:22,870
were separated in this manner.

58
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,200
I see.

59
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,810
That's pretty much what happened last night.

60
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,230
I see.

61
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,870
I thought my brother just went ahead

62
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,150
because I was drunk and too slow.

63
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,760
Unlike a sober person, your steps are unsteady

64
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,080
when you are drunk.

65
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,060
The two of you were intentionally separated,

66
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,300
and when you were back,

67
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,920
you went into different rooms.

68
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,310
The two of us stayed in the same room.

69
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,220
Did you hear your brother's voice?

70
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:58,810
No.

71
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,100
I was drunk and sleepy,

72
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,310
and fell asleep as soon as I was back.

73
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,560
So your brother was in Room 4,

74
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,110
and you were in Room 5.

75
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,320
On their way back from the banquet last night,

76
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,690
the Zhang Brothers were separated by the flagstone path.

77
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,130
Zhang Qingshi was ahead of Zhang Qinghu.

78
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,650
After a long wait for Zhang Qinghu, Zhang Qingshi went ahead

79
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,610
and returned to Room 4 first.

80
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,520
At this moment, the murderer

81
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,159
switched the signs through putting mud

82
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:34,940
and white powder on them,

83
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,620
and then entered Room 4

84
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,290
and killed Zhang Qingshi while he was alone.

85
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,960
When Zhang Qinghu was back,

86
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,210
as it was dark and he was drunk,

87
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,140
he saw the door signs that had been tampered with

88
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,670
and naturally went into Room 5.

89
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,400
After killing him,

90
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,020
the murderer broke the air vent on the back wall

91
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,450
to make people suspect the kid,

92
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:53,680
and then cleaned the signs.

93
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:56,770
When Zhang Qinghu

94
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,530
got up to use the bathroom, the signs
had been switched back.

95
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,120
He was transferred to Room 4,

96
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,790
and finally saw that his brother had been killed.

97
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:05,860
Please tell me

98
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,220
who killed my brother.

99
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,420
That person could think of adjusting the gaps
between the flagstones,

100
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,580
as well as

101
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,810
this method of leading people away
from a fork in the road.

102
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,240
In my opinion,

103
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,240
this person knows the Qi Men Dun Jia technique.

104
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:29,880
Gu Fengxin,

105
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,850
isn't that what you learned before you entered the sect?

106
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,690
I've heard a lot about you, Scholar Sushou.

107
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,340
Now I see you're indeed quite extraordinary.

108
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,120
That's right.

109
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,700
It was me who killed Zhang Qingshi.

110
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:49,900
Gu,

111
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,020
we have done nothing to you,

112
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,610
why did you kill my brother?

113
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,280
Done nothing to me?

114
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,990
Do you remember the name Yu Wanwan?

115
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,620
"The Dusty Butterfly," Yu Wanwan?

116
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,910
I heard that she entered this trade quite late
following her cousin.

117
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,730
Her cousin... is you?

118
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,350
Dun Jia Qi Men is hard to learn and master.

119
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,090
You put in a lot of hard work, but rarely get to use it.

120
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,740
That's why most of the disciples of that sect are poor.

121
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,540
By chance,

122
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,280
I started stealing treasure from tombs

123
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,560
and found that I could apply what I had learned

124
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,540
and even make a fortune through that.

125
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,100
I got carried away

126
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,700
and had my cousin join me and become a tomb robber as well.

127
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,380
But five years ago,

128
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,460
while she was collaborating with the Zhang Brothers,

129
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,700
my cousin was raped and killed by a drunken Zhang Qingshi.

130
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,020
I kept looking for opportunities for revenge,

131
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,020
but the Zhang Brothers were too powerful together

132
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,890
and I couldn't do anything.

133
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,150
I finally got this chance today

134
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,630
and avenged my cousin.

135
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,900
Zhang Qingshi was stabbed at the throat
with my cousin's jade hairpin.

136
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,700
I had a great time killing him.

137
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,560
And he very much deserved it.

138
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,160
But I didn't chop off his head.

139
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,800
I'll kill you and avenge my brother!

140
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,290
Duan Hai, help me!

141
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,700
Stop!

142
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,350
We've found the murderer of my brother.

143
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:28,850
What are you trying to do, Master Wei?

144
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,410
I asked you to come for the purpose
of entering Yipin Tomb.

145
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,789
Put aside your personal grudges for now.

146
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,340
When we're done,

147
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,580
you can do whatever you want.

148
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,570
Wei,

149
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,179
what's wrong with you today?

150
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,890
What I said just now

151
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:42,929
is for everyone here.

152
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,960
Do as I say and enter Yipin Tomb,

153
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,780
or you might not make it out of Mount Puchu alive.

154
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:51,420
Master Wei,

155
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,120
we came here for the banquet.

156
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,050
You think these servants of yours

157
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,970
will get us to work for you like slaves?

158
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,500
The servants, no.

159
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,890
But Ghost Wail Potion will.

160
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,890
Everyone,

161
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:07,200
you enjoyed the wine last night, didn't you?

162
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,530
Now feel your Shenque and Guanyuan acupoints.

163
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,690
Very sore, aren't they?

164
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,470
That means the Ghost Wail Potion is taking effect.

165
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,900
You poisoned the wine?

166
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,260
Ghost Wail Potion is colorless and tasteless.

167
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,140
It's not hard to cure at the beginning,

168
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:27,190
but six hours later, the poison enters the bone marrow

169
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,280
and can only

170
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,680
be cured by the poisoner.

171
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,460
To wait for the poison to take effect,

172
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,960
I had to put up with your noise all night.

173
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,470
It was so annoying.

174
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,240
Master Wei,

175
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,300
why did you do that?

176
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,690
You guys haven't stopped arguing

177
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,220
since you entered my manor yesterday.

178
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,530
How will you unite?

179
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,010
Now it's easy.

180
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,700
If you want to live, do as I say

181
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,500
and help me enter Yipin Tomb.

182
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,340
Give me the antidote!

183
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,290
Thread of Netherworld?

184
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,340
The weapon of the Fourteen Thieves of the Netherworld?

185
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,670
How did you get it?

186
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,590
The weapon of the Fourteen Thieves of the Netherworld

187
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:05,860
was taken

188
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,460
from the bodies of the Fourteen Thieves, of course.

189
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,000
You and your brother are descendants

190
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,290
of Fourteen Thieves' member Zhang Qianhuang.

191
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,990
I've known it for a long time.

192
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,300
The seven headless bodies on Mount Puchu

193
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,300
-The Fourteen Thieves of the Netherworld?
-are seven of the Fourteen Thieves.

194
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,830
I beheaded them

195
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,300
because I didn't want you to find out

196
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,910
that even the Fourteen Thieves died here,

197
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,600
and then get too scared to come.

198
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,400
How did you kill the Fourteen Thieves?

199
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,180
Don't get the wrong idea.

200
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,960
I didn't lie at the banquet.

201
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,100
It's been ten years since the seven of them

202
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,090
died in Yipin Tomb.

203
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,690
I only cut off their heads

204
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,850
to hide their identity.

205
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,340
The head is a very strange thing.

206
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,580
It leaks a lot of secrets,

207
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,070
whether one is dead or alive.

208
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,180
The Fourteen Thieves have been dead for ten years?

209
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,180
Did you think that the Fourteen Thieves disappeared

210
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,220
because they got rich and ran away?

211
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,580
You and your brother

212
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,820
showed your devotion looking for them with the badge.

213
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:03,980
But it's easy now.

214
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,100
As long as you do as I say

215
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,290
and help me enter Yipin Tomb,

216
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:09,390
you might actually see the remains of your late father.

217
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,690
Wei is sinister and ruthless.

218
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:14,440
Everyone,

219
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,640
let's fight him together.

220
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,930
We still have a chance to win.

221
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,050
Hurry up!

222
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,260
The poison has reached the internal organs

223
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,390
and your stomach is churning.

224
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,100
It hurts a lot.

225
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,100
Master,

226
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,250
please show mercy.

227
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:41,380
I'll enter the tomb.

228
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,610
I will do everything I can to help you.

229
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,000
Please spare my life.

230
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,940
We're all in the same trade.

231
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,750
I don't want to hurt you.

232
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,220
As long as you do as I say,

233
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,400
I'll give you half of the antidote,

234
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,580
which can put off the poison's taking effect
for three days.

235
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,020
When we're done,

236
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,400
I'll give you the other half of the antidote

237
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,480
and distribute the treasure in Yipin Tomb
according to the work you've done.

238
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,890
We'll all be happy.

239
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:04,740
I promise I'll do as you say.

240
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,220
Please give me the antidote.

241
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,460
You're very sensible.

242
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,340
Please... give me... the antidote.

243
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,030
Please... please give me the antidote.

244
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,400
Please give me the antidote.

245
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,700
Please give us the antidote.

246
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,060
Please give us the antidote.

247
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,230
Good.

248
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,940
When you have taken the antidote,

249
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,620
go to the storehouse and pick some handy tools,

250
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,580
and get ready to set out.

251
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,560
Li Lianhua,

252
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,550
there're fewer guards in the northeast corner,

253
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,070
so it'll be easier for you to leave from there.

254
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:54,700
Leave?

255
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,580
Master Wei has spent his life on Mount Puchu.

256
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,170
If he were really capable of entering the tomb

257
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,180
and getting the Fourteen Thieves' bodies out,

258
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,420
why would he have waited until now?

259
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,930
There must be someone powerful
behind the seven thieves' corpses case,

260
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,790
who's trying to lure people into the tomb
through Master Wei.

261
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,390
This trip into Yipin Tomb is going to be dangerous.

262
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,340
You don't know martial arts yet.

263
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,170
You should leave now.

264
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,610
If I leave,

265
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,220
won't you be found out?

266
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,300
No need to worry about me.

267
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,300
It'll be too late if you don't leave now.

268
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:15,940
Hurry up.

269
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,340
Come on.

270
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,980
Don't fret. Listen to me.

271
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,740
To be honest,

272
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,690
actually,

273
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,200
I'm just like them.

274
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,720
I'm here for Yipin Tomb too.

275
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,060
You want the Weeping Guanyin too?

276
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,350
How do you know that?

277
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,220
You may be stingy,

278
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:40,530
but you've never been greedy.

279
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,340
So you're definitely not after the treasure

280
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,170
in Yipin Tomb.

281
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,020
I'm standing right in front of you,

282
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,780
but I've never heard you seek advice on martial arts.

283
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,800
So you're not after the books on martial arts either.

284
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:49,530
Also,

285
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,560
you don't even care about Yinzhu Armor,

286
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,980
which means you're not interested

287
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,240
in sophisticated weapons.

288
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,580
So it can only be the Weeping Guanyin.

289
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,980
What exactly

290
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,060
is the Weeping Guanyin?

291
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,430
How come everyone wants it?

292
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,340
Even you want it.

293
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,250
The Weeping Guanyin is a rare elixir.

294
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,540
The Zhang Brothers wanted it

295
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,940
because they wanted to become more powerful.

296
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,600
I...

297
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,740
need it as a cure.

298
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,480
A cure?

299
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,650
Are you injured? Are you ill?

300
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,960
It's just that when I was little,

301
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,700
I had heart disease.

302
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,990
I couldn't sleep or eat well in the evening,

303
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,860
and had severe chest pain.

304
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,910
Only the Weeping Guanyin

305
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,180
can cure this disease.

306
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:32,090
The Weeping Guanyin is just a medicine
that's been hidden for a century.

307
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,970
What's the point if it can't save people?

308
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,020
Besides,

309
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,500
I'm not an ungrateful person.

310
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,030
Don't worry.

311
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,580
I'll find a way

312
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,460
to get the Weeping Guanyin for you.

313
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,940
Actually, I don't really have to get it.

314
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,220
Then let's make it fair.

315
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,690
I'll get the medicine for you,

316
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,060
and you'll help me investigate the case.

317
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:51,640
What do you think?

318
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,460
It's a deal.

319
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,630
Who do you think that kid is?

320
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,040
Master Wei used poison to control everyone,

321
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,530
but is very nice to him.

322
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,700
The kid is being carried up the mountain.

323
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,190
Maybe Master Wei is afraid that he'll be difficult
to deal with when he grows up.

324
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:23,860
I don't believe that.

325
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,130
Now,

326
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:26,790
I need to find a chance to try him out.

327
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,020
Don't do that.

328
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:29,620
Why?

329
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,430
Don't you think Zhang Qinghu is weird?

330
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,020
Why don't you pay more attention to him?

331
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,040
[Wei Manor's Yipin Tomb]

332
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,020
Something's going on here.

333
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,910
The Qi Men technique is being used over there.

334
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:00,700
Look.

335
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,980
That pearl is big

336
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,450
and pierced.

337
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,410
It must have fallen from a piece of jewelry.

338
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,460
Judging from that,

339
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,220
this should be the place.

340
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,100
The seven thieves' corpses are here.

341
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,940
Yipin Tomb is also here.

342
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,240
The person behind this is probably nearby,

343
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,670
waiting for us to enter the tomb.

344
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:21,980
Everyone,

345
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,190
as you can see,

346
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,230
this is Yipin Tomb.

347
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,340
Unfortunately,

348
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,480
it's blocked by the Qi Men technique.

349
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,340
Mr. Gu,

350
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,580
please.

351
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,650
This Qi Men formation is really something.

352
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,490
It drew all the fog around here to hide the mountain.

353
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:27,109
But the core of the formation seems
to have been cracked recently.

354
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,480
Otherwise, even my mentor wouldn't have been able

355
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,960
to find this place.

356
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,900
That precipice over there is not natural.

357
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,370
It's probably a secret mechanical gate,

358
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,400
which must be the entrance to Yipin Tomb.

359
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,980
The craftsmen of Nanyin must have worked really hard

360
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,770
to make a tomb gate out of a mountain.

361
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:43,800
Unless we cut into the mountain,

362
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,700
we'll hardly be able to open it.

363
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,140
There's a breach over there.

364
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,140
If someone can get in,

365
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,500
we might be able to open the gate from inside.

366
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,570
The breach is dozens of meters above the ground.

367
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,300
No one can get up there.

368
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:25,730
Everyone,

369
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,170
you see?

370
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,230
Now you know why we can't enter Yipin Tomb

371
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,940
without my little master.

372
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,060
Did you see that?

373
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,570
Don't be so amazed.

374
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,030
His flying skill

375
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,090
is not bad.

376
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,490
It's far more than that.

377
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,890
With that flying skill,

378
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,450
his name will appear in the who's who of martial arts.

379
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:52,930
Why are you not at all impressed?

380
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,680
I just can't tell if it's real

381
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,100
or if it's good.

382
00:18:58,850 --> 00:18:59,740
Keep learning then.

383
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:27,770
Watch out!

384
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,700
Duan Hai was unlucky.

385
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,280
Being in this trade,

386
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,640
surely you've all seen dead people before.

387
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,020
Now the tomb gate is open,

388
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,280
don't waste time.

389
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,560
Iron Slave,

390
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:02,920
you stay here and keep guard.

391
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,770
Give us a signal if any stranger comes.

392
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:05,430
Let's go.

393
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:20,270
What are you laughing about?

394
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,750
About luck and human relationships.

395
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,920
Looks like someone turned the boulder around

396
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:34,180
with palm power.

397
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,860
Could it be Zhang Qinghu?

398
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,940
If nobody touched it,

399
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,380
it would have hit between the two
and caused only minor injuries.

400
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,650
Zhang Qinghu killed his friend Duan Hai.

401
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,460
Zhang Qinghu's palm power is very strong.

402
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,230
All right now, let's go.

There is gold leaf on the ever-burning lamps.

406
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,830
Yipin Tomb is so ornate.

407
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,410
Everyone,

408
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,420
you won't be disappointed.

409
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,060
When we're done, you won't have to

410
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,780
do this kind of underground work anymore.

411
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,420
Th-This is going up?

412
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,660
A sky-facing tomb?

413
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:35,920
It's indeed a sky-facing tomb.

414
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,230
All other tombs go down,

415
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,830
while sky-facing tombs are built on mountains.

416
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,560
Their burial chambers are built on mountaintops,

417
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,250
so that the buried are exposed to sunlight.

418
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,620
In this way,

419
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,020
the buried are punished for their disloyalty,

420
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,770
and the mausoleums on the mountains

421
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,370
can highlight the majesty of the imperial family.

422
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,900
The craftsmen of Nanyin really put a lot of thought into it.

423
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,740
Strange.

424
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,470

They're the other members of the Fourteen Thieves
of the Netherworld.

434
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,940
I told you it's been ten years

435
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,020
since the Fourteen Thieves

436
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,060
died in this tomb.

437
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:38,500
Zhang Qinghu,

438
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,120
I didn't lie to you.

439
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,590
The bodies haven't really decomposed.

440
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,020
I suppose this is a special tomb.

441
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,270
That's why the seven corpses at the foot of the mountain

442
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,660
look like new deaths.

443
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,700
Apparently the Fourteen Thieves of the Netherworld

444
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,620
came here ten years ago.

445
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,460
If they were trapped and died here,

446
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,460
why is it that half of them are in the tomb,

447
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,560
and half are at the foot of the mountain?

448
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,130
How should I know?

449
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,540
But the Fourteen Thieves

450
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,130
managed to inform us

451
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,420
about the existence of Yipin Tomb.

452
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,590
We must not let them down.

453
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,500
Everyone,

454
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,560
let's take a look.

455
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:20,450
Come on, open it.

456
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,950
Everyone.

457
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,790
Hold on.

458
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,420
By the look of it,

459
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,310
there's probably no corpse inside this coffin,

460
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,540
which means this is a fake burial chamber.

461
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,640
There's so much treasure

462
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,420
even in a fake burial chamber.

463
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,850
How much treasure will there be

464
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,210
in the real burial chamber where Prince Fangji is buried?

465
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,280
Everyone,

466
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,700
aren't you curious?

467
00:24:58,770 --> 00:24:59,510
About what?

468
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,230
Get the treasure first!

469
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:04,700
Too small.

470
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,860
Too small-minded.

471
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,780
Why bother with this second-class stuff?

472
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,420
When we find the real burial chamber,

473
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,080
you'll need more pockets than you have.

474
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,540
We're at the end of the tomb passage.

475
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,620
The real entrance must be somewhere around here.

476
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,740
Whoever finds the entrance first

477
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,780
gets to pick their treasure first.

478
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,940
Do your best if you want to make a fortune.

479
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,840
Most of the tomb gates here are intact.

480
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,220
So how did the person behind all this

481
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,460
throw the seven bodies out of the tomb?

482
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:50,800
The easiest way

483
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,910
is to just toss them out.

484
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,420
Toss them out?

485
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,620
Yipin Tomb is not on the ground,

486
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,320
but on the top of a mountain, remember?

487
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:01,980
Hold out your hand.

488
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,650
What do you feel?

489
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,940
Why is there wind?

490
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,700
There's indeed a breach here.

491
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,380
Now I see.

492
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,980
The seven bodies were tossed out from here.

493
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,980
The local folks who were getting married
on a full moon night

494
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,220
stumbled across them and saw their decayed

495
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,780
and twisted look under the moon,

496
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,020
and thought they were still alive.

497
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,180
It's exactly the same.

498
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,500
I mean

499
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,620
the breach here

500
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,320
is exactly the same as the one
on the gate of the fake tomb.

501
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,220
Both were made with a smack.

502
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:56,900
So the person behind this

503
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,460
is extremely powerful.

504
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:00,450
He came here

505
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,010
but didn't find the real burial chamber,

506
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,380
so he threw the bodies out,

507
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,700
and then broke the tomb gate,

508
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,180
to lure other people in

509
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,350
to help him find the real burial chamber.

510
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,180
You have a point there.

511
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,210
So we came,

512
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,010
just as he expected.

513
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:18,520
Interesting.

514
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:33,210
Ge Pan,

515
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,320
what do you want?

516
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,890
Everyone, we were poisoned and threatened,

517
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,470
have you forgotten?

518
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,380
Wei poisoned us,

519
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,860
why would he give us the antidote when we're done?

520
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,460
It'll be much safer for him

521
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:51,550
to kill us and take all the treasure alone.

522
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,370
I don't want to be your enemy.

523
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,190
I just want to live.

524
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,020
If we catch and torture him,

525
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,060
he will have to give us the antidote.

526
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,860
Won't it be better to divide the treasure equally

527
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,020
among yourselves?

528
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,740
Keeping me waiting for so long.

529
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,260
So you rebelled!

530
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,080
Be good.

531
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,780
Don't court death.

532
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:33,900
This kid.

533
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,850
Tomb robbers are very discreet.

534
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,700
It's normal for them to know a trick or two,

535
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:41,340
right?

536
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,420
Besides,

537
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,380
you should take a closer look.

538
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,620
The skin between his thumb and forefinger is not calloused,

539
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,460
but his fingers are.

540
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,420
Maybe he's a master of hidden weapons too.

541
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,700
Mr. Ge,

542
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:53,300
are you OK?

543
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,940
Let me help you up.

544
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:55,560
Come on.

545
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,140
Mr. Ge,

546
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,030
are you alright?

547
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,140
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

548
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,730
We were all poisoned by Master Wei.

549
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,820
We're in the same boat.

550
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:09,720
If we can't get the antidote this time,

551
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:12,130
please take us back to Baichuan Court

552
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,930
and ask Master Bai to save us.

553
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,860
Of course.

554
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,460
Of course.

555
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:16,960
Thank you.

556
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,300
I hope you've all realized now

557
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,480
that whoever vexes my little master will die.

558
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,660
Hurry up and look for it!

559
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:37,860
No need.

560
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,260
The machines here

561
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,640
correspond to six of the eight directions.

562
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,420
Only Heaven and Earth are missing.

563
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,400
This is a sky-facing tomb.

564
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,060
Heaven and Earth are reversed.

565
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,940
So we only need to find a Heaven direction

566
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,220
to connect the other machines.

567
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,460
This is a Flying Ape Claw.

568
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,940
When you're in danger,

569
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,240
use it to climb up high and escape.

570
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,050
I'll find a way to get the Weeping Guanyin for you.

571
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:55,990
OK.

572
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,140
I'm counting on you.

573
00:30:59,570 --> 00:30:59,980
Let's go.

574
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,350
Guanyin Gate.

575
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,540
We've found Yipin Tomb.

576
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,460
Finally!

577
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,920
Trying to kill us all?

578
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,300
Quite some tactics indeed.

579
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,120
The Plum Blossom Darts came from the side
where you three are standing.

580
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:32,980
Tell me,

581
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:34,900
who did it?

582
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,060
I was almost killed by a hidden weapon just now.

583
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,900
My inner breath got impaired.

584
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,410
I can't use my martial arts skills anymore.

585
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,300
Zhang Qinghu,

586
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:49,170
between you and your brother, I remember you were the one
who used hidden weapons.

587
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:53,740
All the lights went out at the same time

588
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,660
just now.

589
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:55,730
Exactly.

590
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:57,540
I used Tiger Tooth Darts,

591
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,460
and have never used Plum Blossom Darts.

592
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:04,360
But the Zhang Brothers are actually quite good at acting.

593
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:05,750
Still not tired?

594
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,330
What do you mean?

595
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,540
I mean

596
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:10,850
it must be tiring to play your younger brother.

597
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,220
Do you ever forget who you are,

598
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,260
Zhang Qingshi?

599
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:21,940
Zhang Qingshi?

600
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:27,900
But I have killed him.

601
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,480
You did kill someone,

602
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,960
but it doesn't mean

603
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,580
that you killed Zhang Qingshi.

604
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,020
I followed Zhang Qingshi back to the room last night.

605
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,290
I couldn't have gotten it wrong.

606
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,300
The Zhang Brothers,

607
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,390
as we all know,

608
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:41,860
are identical twins.

609
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,620
So how did you distinguish between the two of them?

610
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,650
Zhang Qingshi had two hammers in his hands

611
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,820
and was in black.

612
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,460
Zhang Qinghu used a dart pouch

613
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,340
and was in white.

614
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,620
A glance was enough.

615
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,140
Let me ask you,

616
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,060
what if they exchanged their clothes and weapons?

617
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,920
Why would they do that?

618
00:33:58,810 --> 00:33:59,800
It was a coincidence.

619
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,660
Master Wei said at the banquet

620
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,300
that between the Zhang Brothers,

621
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,620
Zhang Qingshi

622
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,300
loved hard liquor,

623
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,730
and the drink being served that night
was Xifeng Liquor.

624
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,060
That's right.

625
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:11,650
Yes.

626
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,469
How much did they drink respectively yesterday?

627
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:18,500
Zhang Qingshi drank half a jar

628
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,260
and got drunk.

629
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,719
Zhang Qinghu drank less than half a cup,

630
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:25,590
and then changed to tea instead.

631
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,420
Now you've probably realized that you got it wrong.

632
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:33,139
The Zhang Qingshi you followed last night

633
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:34,260
was very sober.

634
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,830
On the contrary, Zhang Qinghu, who was following behind,

635
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,060
was terribly drunk.

636
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,739
Besides, you told us

637
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,510
you killed him by stabbing a jade hairpin
into his throat.

638
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,120
I'd like to ask you,

639
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,389
after you killed him,

640
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:47,940
where did his head go?

641
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,980
I found that strange too.

642
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,620
Why was he beheaded?

643
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:56,750
It's simple.

644
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,460
With his head gone,

645
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:01,010
people can't tell who that person is.

646
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,340
What happened last night

647
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,490
was an accident from the beginning.

648
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:12,980
It's hot.

649
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,940
Here, brother, put it on.

650
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,130
Last night at the banquet,

651
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,140
Zhang Qingshi got drunk on Xifeng Liquor

652
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,770
and felt hot.

653
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:30,030
So he took off his black gown

654
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,190
and put it on his younger brother, Zhang Qinghu.

655
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,260
His white gown underneath was shown.

656
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,460
His hammers were carried by his brother as well.

657
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,860
Gu Fengxin, who kept himself hidden in the dark,

658
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:00,250
mistook Zhang Qinghu, who was in black
and had the hammers in his hands,

659
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:01,570
for Zhang Qingshi,

660
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:04,570
went into Room 4 and killed him.

661
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,290
The real Zhang Qingshi

662
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,660
went into Room 5 and survived.

663
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,670
What was originally an accident

664
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,620
soon became a scheme.

665
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,500
When Zhang Qingshi in Room 5

666
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,530
got up to use the bathroom, the door signs
were back to normal.

667
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,090
He turned around

668
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,590
and went back to Room 4 following the correct door sign,

669
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:50,040
and finally saw that his brother had been stabbed at the throat
with a hairpin and died.

670
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,570
His black gown and hammers on the floor

671
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,420
made him realize

672
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,020
that it was a disaster caused by his alcoholism and lust,

673
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:59,080
and that his brother had been made a scapegoat.

674
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,310
Thinking that the murderer wouldn't stop there
if he found out

675
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,300
that he'd got the wrong person,

676
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,100
while he himself was on his own now

677
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,340
and no match for his enemy,

678
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,740
he cut off and hid away his brother's head,

679
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,420
and pretended to be Zhang Qinghu,

680
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,420
both to protect himself

681
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,140
and find out the murderer.

682
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,260
The corpse being headless,

683
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,570
no one would know who it was that died.

684
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:28,920
Brother!

685
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,220
Zhang Qingshi,

686
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,950
am I right?

687
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,000
If you like,

688
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,140
I'll analyze it for you a bit further.

689
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:45,100
You've probably read too many novels, Mr. Sushou.

690
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,030
All this empty talk,

691
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,200
with absolutely no evidence.

692
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,180
Look, he's still in denial.

693
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:54,460
I'll go on then.

694
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,420
Outside the gate,

695
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,630
the boulder suddenly turned around and killed Duan Hai.

696
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,140
It required a lot of arm strength.

697
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,820
Zhang Qinghu wouldn't have been able to do it,

698
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,460
but only Zhang Qingshi could.

699
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:10,800
Look,

700
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,980
this fake freckle that you drew on your face

701
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,860
to impersonate Zhang Qinghu

702
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,350
is coming off.

703
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,260
Why are you so nervous?

704
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,910
I was just kidding.

705
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:26,900
Zhang Qingshi,

706
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,980
is Zhang Qinghu's head in your room?

707
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,090
So you're still alive!

708
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,540
Zhang Qingshi doesn't know how to use hidden weapons.

709
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,930
So these Plum Blossom Darts...

710
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,350
Mr. Ge, let's stop acting now.

711
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,380
Although you have internal injuries,

712
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:11,540
the crossbow at your cuff can still kill, can't it?

713
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,980
You found out that he was pretending to be his brother

714
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,140
and blackmailed him into cooperating with you.

715
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,180
So this weapon that you have now

716
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,130
is from Zhang Qingshi, isn't it?

717
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,540
I coerced Zhang Qingshi under the order of Baichuan Court

718
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,740
to eliminate you thieves.

719
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:33,380
The other detectives will soon surround this place.

720
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,060
If you want to live,

721
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,950
you'll have to rely on me to put in a good word for you.

722
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,120
I'd advise you to be good and let me go.

723
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,180
Under the order of Baichuan Court?

724
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,630
Your gown is lined with gray moire.

725
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,660
Only trainees who haven't passed the preliminary exam

726
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,420
dress like that.

727
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,140
I asked you to beg Master Bai for the antidote

728
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,300
and you agreed,

729
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,740
not knowing that Master Bai

730
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,900
is not at all good with poisons.

731
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:56,100
You are clearly a new trainee.

732
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:57,210
Also,

733
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,890
while these thieves are criminals,

734
00:39:58,910 --> 00:39:59,820
their crimes are not capital.

735
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,900
But you killed them all.

736
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,420
You're so despicable and greedy.

737
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,940
Come back to Baichuan Court with me

738
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:06,630
and we'll let Fo, Bi, Bai, Shi interrogate you!

739
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,200
You hit him so hard.

740
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:18,710
Who are you exactly?

741
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:22,790
Detective at Baichuan Court,

742
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,400
Fang Duobing.

743
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,740
I'd advise you to forget it.

744
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,140
You don't get to decide

745
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:01,730
how the treasure here will be used.

746
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:11,810
Master,

747
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,420
I gathered people for you

748
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:14,900
and forced my friends to take poison,

749
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:17,270
it was all to help you enter this Yipin Tomb.

750
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:17,980
Master,

751
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,420
perhaps you could do me a small favor today

752
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:22,670
and kill these two people for me?

753
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:43,780
How dare you make a request?

754
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,720
So you're the one who's behind this?
