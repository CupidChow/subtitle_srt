00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:52,950
Xiangyi.

5
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,789
Do you think that

6
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:59,070
what you say is always right,

7
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,070
always the truth,

8
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:02,520
and Sigu Sect can't survive without you?

9
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,560
Yes.

10
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,640
It has been proven over the years

11
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,980
that all these are true.

12
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,520
Sigu Sect will run normally

13
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,840
regardless of who leaves.

14
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,650
But without Li Xiangyi,

15
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:22,850
it'll collapse.

16
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,540
Fine.

17
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,860
You've finally said it.

18
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,180
We grew up together since we were young.

19
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,579
When there was food, I couldn't bear to eat them,

20
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:37,850
and I gave all of them to you.

21
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,980
I also gave you the best sword I forged.

22
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:41,980
Deep down,

23
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,260
I value you

24
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,260
more than myself.

25
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,079
But what about you?

26
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,329
Since Sigu Sect only needs you,

27
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,650
I quit.

Sect Leader.

51
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,580
We were ambushed by the Jinyuan Alliance.

52
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,990
Senior's dead body was snatched too.

53
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,000
It was a trick of luring the tiger out of the mountain.

54
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,270
Sigu Sect, listen to my order.

55
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,990
From today onwards,

56
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,910
we'll fight the Jinyuan Alliance

57
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,810
till death do us part.

Li Lianhua.

59
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,350
Why are you spacing out?

60
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,650
Since I exposed your nonsense,

61
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,780
you don't know how to quibble anymore, do you?

62
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,510
I can't hide anything from you.

63
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,310
Of course.

64
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,909
They are very close.

65
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,690
I'll spare your life today.

66
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,290
Don't spread rumours again.

67
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,390
It's time to go.

68
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,700
Fei knows my uncle.

69
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,830
He must know Li Xiangyi.

70
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,300
Fei is not familiar with Li Xiangyi.

71
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,820
You don't have to ask him.

72
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,370
I don't care about others,

73
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,970
but I must find out about Fei.

74
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,530
He is so bad at martial arts

75
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,460
but so arrogant.

76
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,270
There must be something fishy.

77
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:34,840
Come on.

78
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,410
Let's go to Baichuan Court together.

79
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,340
Why are we going to Baichuan Court?

80
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,380
Counting the murder cases in Cailian Manor,

81
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,140
I've already solved three major cases.

82
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,340
It's time to go to Baichuan Court

83
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,810
for the real detective badge.

84
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,730
If so, you will have Baichuan Court as your partner

85
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,330
when you become a detective.

86
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,030
Congratulations.

87
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:51,830
Same to you.

88
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,720
You used to be my partner,

89
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,560
and you'll also be the only one in the future.

90
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,420
How about this?

91
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,960
We'll imitate the Sigu Sect

92
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,600
to solve mysterious cases

93
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,140
and rectify the martial arts world.

94
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:01,670
Let's go.

95
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,220
So much money?

96
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,560
Li Lianhua,

97
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,659
did you strike gold

98
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:11,460
or get a fever?

99
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,000
You're leaving soon.

100
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,340
If you don't prepare well,

101
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,100
you may starve to death on the way.

102
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,760
Take it to buy some solid food.

103
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,360
No need?

104
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,740
Fine, if you don't need it, I can just...

105
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,230
It's a rare opportunity for misers like you to be generous.

106
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,340
I'll go buy food in town right away.

107
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:29,490
By the way,

108
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:30,910
keep an eye on Fei.

109
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,180
I'll investigate him when I come back.

110
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,950
I bought a lot of fresh vegetables.

111
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,400

So I'm writing this letter to inform you.

to stop sulking

Otherwise, things will change."

124
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,440
There's no way I will buy that.

Hurry up.

Director Di,

134
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:08,460
you've emptied all the pharmacies nearby, right?

135
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,510
Let's begin.

136
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,490
To practice this technique,

137
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,020
you have to insert silver needles at certain anatomical points

138
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:20,200
and take herbal medicine to get the poison out of your body.

139
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,960
Director Di,

140
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,410
please meditate and circulate your qi.

141
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,720
I'll perform the acupuncture.

142
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,560
Li Xiangyi,

143
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,350
don't play tricks with me when it's related to martial arts.

144
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,080
It's been ten years since we saw each other,

145
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,940
and you've become more vigilant.

146
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,170
Don't worry.

147
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,720
I won't play any tricks.

148
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:36,700
It would be best.

149
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,940
I've told you

150
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,340
the mantra.

151
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,480
Circulate your inner breath for 49 days,

152
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,840
and the poison of the Xiuluo Grass will be detoxified.

153
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,400
Remember, it's 49 days.

154
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,490
Don't miss even a bit.

155
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,880
Do you hear me?

156
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,150
Director Di.

157
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:25,860
Do you hear me?

158
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:26,910
Director Di.

159
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,520
When should I leave

160
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,810
if not now?

161
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,260
My Lord ordered that

162
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,100
I must make Sect Leader Li stay.

163
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,260
Your Lord just said I can leave.

164
00:09:59,420 --> 00:09:59,930
Oh no.

165
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,140
The poisonous grass has backfired on Your Lord.

166
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,600
Go quickly and have a look.

167
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,180
You have recovered just like that?

168
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,020
I didn't realize how quickly 49 days went by.

169
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,780
Where are you going?

170
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,050
We're even now.

171
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,120
So I'm leaving.

172
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,340
I promised not to expose your identity.

173
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,350
But do you think you can retire from the martial arts world

174
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,480
and die like a loser?

175
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,700
You're too naive.

176
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,230
Director Di,

177
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,720
why bother forcing me?

178
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,900
All I want is for you to live on

179
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,750
and fight with me again.

180
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,230
Greetings, My Lord.

181
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,710
Medicine Demon.

182
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,320
I want him to regain his inner power.

183
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,670
My Lord,

184
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,980
he is severely injured.

185
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,270
It's not easy to deal with.

186
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,150
Is it not easy,

187
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,480
or are you not competent enough?

188
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:22,860
No, no, no.

189
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,110
My Lord, if you want him to recover,

190
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,330
I'll try my best.

191
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,990
My Lord, please come with me.

192
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,300
Let's go.

193
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:35,980
Move.

194
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,620
My Lord,

195
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,680
Hundreds Herbs Syrup

196
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,380
is a treasure I have decocted

197
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,410
with hundreds of exotic herbs for over ten years.

198
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,860
Normally, a cup of it works.

199
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,500
But if you drink too much,

200
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,760
your meridians will overreact and cause unbearable pain.

201
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,080
Drink that.

202
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:08,680
Please.

203
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,870
With his injury,

204
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,370
one cup may not work.

205
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,070
Go on.

206
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,540
It's so bitter.

207
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:54,870
Well...

208
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:56,830
Feed him.

209
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,430
Yes, My Lord.

210
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:05,310
Please.

211
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:07,910
Thank you.

212
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,980
I'll do it myself.

213
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:25,610
My Lord,

214
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,870
this guy's qi has been disrupted.

215
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,230
His inner power is weak.

216
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:29,760
Well...

217
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,300
Even three cups are of no avail.

218
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,160
His inner power is weak?

219
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,090
I'll insert my inner power into his body

220
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,590
to stimulate the drug effect.

221
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:14,460
My Lord.

222
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,810
He will die if you do so.

223
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,440
I told you it's incurable.

224
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,010
It's such a waste of resources

225
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,920
for Director Di to get me all these treasures.

226
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,770
Think of another way.

227
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,340
Think of a way.

228
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,950
We can give it a shot at the Spiritual Snake Cave.

229
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,360
Spiritual Snake Cave?

230
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,460
My Lord,

231
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,580
these spiritual flood dragons in the Eastern Sea

232
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,580
have been fed with spiritual medicine for many years.

233
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,930
They like to suck people's qi and feed them again.

234
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,330
Now that this guy's qi is disrupted.

235
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:23,310
Let's have an exchange transfusion for him.

236
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,610
It might work.

237
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:27,650
Let's try then.

238
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,780
B-Bicha Poison?

239
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:58,830
My Lord.

240
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,800
He was poisoned by Bicha Poison.

241
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:07,920
Useless!

242
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,040
My Lord, please calm down.

243
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,430
If you want him to regain his inner power,

244
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,270
and fight him,

245
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,710
there's another way.

246
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,140
Say it.

247
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,020
Wangchuan Flower.

248
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,590
Wangchuan Flower?

249
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,210
It has the supreme yang.

250
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,670
It can help me break through the eighth level of the Windy Poplar.

251
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,750
But his inner power is not strong.

252
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:29,990
How can it cure him?

253
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,400
My Lord,

254
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,540
Wangchuan Flower has two different types, namely Yin and Yang.

255
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,370
The Yang grass is a kind of martial art, same as you.

256
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,770
While the Yin grass

257
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,900
is the most poisonous grass in the world.

258
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,760
Even if a child takes it,

259
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,810
they can gain more than ten years of martial skills.

260
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,260
But it's like the last radiance of the setting sun.

261
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,540
A few days later,

262
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,870
the Yin grass will start to have a strong effect,

263
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,400
and it will get stronger and stronger.

264
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,140
His meridians will break

265
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,550
and his organs will split.

266
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,710
There is no other way to die more terribly

267
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,980
than it in the world.

268
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,110
I don't want him to live a long life.

269
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,820
I just want him to live on until we fight again.

270
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,460
Let's go.

271
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,300
I want the Wangchuan Flower.

272
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,400
Yes, My Lord.

273
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,220
Why are you laughing?

274
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:28,950
Director Di,

275
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,980
stop wasting your time.

276
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:34,220
It's all for nothing.

277
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,650
So what if you get the Wangchuan Flower?

278
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:39,770
You can force me to eat it,

279
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,700
but you can't force me to fight with you.

280
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,540
By then, I'll lie in front of you

281
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,420
and wait for death under the sun,

282
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,750
seeing you anxious.

283
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:51,750
It's already interesting even if I just imagine the situation.

284
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,350
Lee Xiangyi.

285
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,900
Don't you want to know

286
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,500
how your senior, Shan Gudao,

287
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,560
died?

288
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,900
The three kings of the Jinyuan Alliance killed my senior.

289
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,390
Yet you want to deny it?

290
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,060
It's written clearly on the mortuary records of the Jinyuan Alliance.

291
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,700
Shan Gudao died because his left chest was stabbed.

292
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,150
Among the three kings, only the King Xunming of Yama used a sword as his weapon.

293
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,300
He made a mistake back then.

294
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,130
I punished him to bind his right hand for a month.

295
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,430
Even if he did attack your senior,

296
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,980
he should have used his left hand.

297
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,510
It's impossible for him to kill your senior with his right hand.

298
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,040
Ten years ago,

299
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,980
we declared a five-year truce.

300
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,940
After that, your senior was killed for no reason.

301
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,110
Then the war between Jinyuan Alliance

302
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,900
and Sigu Sect

303
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,980
started again.

304
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,640
In the end, both of us lost our power

305
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,300
and declined in the martial arts world.

306
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,570
But you and I were not the ones who benefited from it.

307
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,790
If you really want to avenge the death

308
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,590
of tens of Sigu Sect's warriors,

309
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,420
and avenge the death of your senior,

310
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,620
I can help you find out the hidden truth.

311
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,580
As long as you promise

312
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,380
to fight with me again.

313
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,360
Avenge?

314
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,510
If they really want to avenge themselves,

315
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,460
they should take revenge on Li Xiangyi.

316
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,340
Because he was arrogant,

317
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,220
and he killed everyone.

318
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,350
He deserved to die.

319
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,540
And he did die after that.

320
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,420
All the hatred

321
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,340
vanished with Li Xiangyi ten years ago.

322
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,720
Director Di,

323
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,330
Li Lianhua

324
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,940
won't fight with you.

325
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:47,530
I understand.

326
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,360
You are now a lost soul

327
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,490
although you're alive.

328
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,160
You won't be easily persuaded by me.

329
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,310
Okay.

330
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,620
I'll add some more bets.

331
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,030
If you don't promise me,

332
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,600
I'll kill Shan Gudao's son myself.

333
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,360
Director Di,

334
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,900
please stop joking.

335
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,540
My senior didn't even get married.

336
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,160
How could he have a son?

337
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,710
18 years ago, the Second Young Miss of the Tianji Hall, He Xiaolan,

338
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,840
was in a relationship with Shan Gudao.

339
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,840
This is her farewell letter to Shan Gudao.

340
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,430
[To Shan Gudao]

341
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,250

00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:25,920
My Lord,

513
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,290
I have good news for you.

514
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,860
Aren't you looking for the King  Xunming of Yama

515
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,770
and the Four-faced Qingzun?

516
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,690
I sent someone to find some parts

517
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:38,260
of the map of Prison 188.

518
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,900
The whereabouts of King Xunming of Yama are included.

519
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,130
My Lord, I am so loyal to you,

520
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,940
please spare me this time.

521
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,830
Are you really that loyal?

522
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:55,990
Then tell me

523
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,040
why Li Xiangyi got poisoned by Bicha Poison.

524
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:00,930
How did you...

525
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:02,930
It doesn't matter how I know about it.

526
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:05,040
What matters is that in the past ten years,

527
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,730
you made me feel that I won the battle at the East Sea.

528
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:09,630
What matters is that in the past ten years,

529
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,760
you made me become an ignorant person.

530
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,170
Li Xiangyi deserved to die.

531
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,180
In this life,

532
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,740
I hope only My Lord ranks first in the martial arts world.

533
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,400
How do I need to use poison to dominate the world?

534
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:26,690
I wanted to get rid of Li Xiangyi secretly

535
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:28,400
to solve your problem.

536
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,600
But Li Xiangyi was so ignorant

537
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,550
that he came to steal your thunder.

538
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,840
I know I was wrong.

539
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:42,460
I've been waiting for you in the Jinyuan Alliance for ten years.

540
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,190
Finally, My Lord is back.

541
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,620
Please punish me.

542
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:47,690
I'll accept it.

543
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,110
I'm willing to accept the punishment.

544
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,120
Don't think you can do whatever you want

545
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,650
with ten years of hard work.

546
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,940
I don't care

547
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,160
whether Jinyuan Alliance survives or not.

548
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,000
From now on,

549
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,020
you don't have to investigate the thundering fire bombs anymore.

550
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,060
I have assigned Wuyan to investigate it.

551
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,120
If I find out that it's related to you,

552
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:05,730
I'll kill you.

553
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,260
Fang Duobing!

554
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,140
Are you abandoned again?

555
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,400
Are you hungry?

556
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:49,730
Dig in.

557
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,010
Eat.

558
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,370
Eat slowly.

559
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,490
What were you mumbling about?

560
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,540
I'm hungry.

561
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:13,980
Eat slowly.

562
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,240
Don't get choked.

563
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:38,880
I'm not eating.

564
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,340
You eat.

565
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,500
Why are you staring at me?

566
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,740
It's nothing.

567
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,820
Aren't you more like your mother?

568
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,900
What kind of nonsense is that?

569
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:54,530
Our butler said

570
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,700
I resemble my second aunt the most.

571
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,760
But when I was born,

572
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,690
my second aunt had already died.

573
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,510
You didn't see your uncles many times.

574
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,070
When you were young,

575
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,340
did he dote on you much?

576
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,230
My uncle is the second master of the Sigu Sect.

577
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,440
He was usually very busy.

578
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,900
He didn't have time for me.

579
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,800
Besides, my mother seemed to hate him very much.

580
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:21,260
She didn't allow me to get close to him.

581
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:29,260
Why do you suddenly ask about my family matter?

582
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:31,460
It's nothing.

583
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,280
I was just asking.

584
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,830
Eat your buns.

585
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,060
Then let me ask you.

586
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,150
You have to answer me honestly.

587
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,469
Who is Fei exactly?

588
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,860
Why is he so skilful in martial arts?

589
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:49,190
Since we are now at this point,

590
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,000
I won't hide it from you anymore.

591
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,290
He's Di Feisheng.

592
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,159
D-Di Feisheng?

593
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:59,100
The devil of the Jinyuan Alliance, Di Feisheng?

594
00:34:59,100 --> 00:34:59,560
Well...

595
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,260
Do you know my master

596
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,170
is unaccounted for ten years because of him?

597
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:06,230
How can you hang out with such a devil?

598
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,990
He asked me to promise him to save someone.

599
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:10,790
Save someone?

600
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,100
You can lie with your medical skills,

601
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,900
but you can't save lives with it.

602
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,400
There are people in this world

603
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,850
who can only be saved by me.

604
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:22,980
Unfortunately,

605
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,700
I don't want to save them.

606
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,180
So you left me behind

607
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:30,120
because you were afraid Di Feisheng would deal with me,

608
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,090
but it turned out that you were caught

609
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,740
and got hurt all over your body.

610
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,400
Li Lianhua,

611
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:34,980
I won't accept your kindness for that.

612
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,850
We agreed that friends should share weal and woe.

613
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:38,850
Even if the opponent is Di Feisheng.

614
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,040
Young Hero Fang,

615
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,540
I know you're good.

616
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,340
It's my fault this time.

617
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,310
Thank you.

618
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,500
At least you have a conscience.

619
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,140
By the way,

620
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,820
don't promise Di Feisheng

621
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,730
to save the person he mentioned.

622
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:54,910
The person he wants to save

623
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,710
is definitely not a good person.

624
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,800
He is indeed not a good person.

625
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,960
I won't save him.

626
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,590
It's more important to save you now.

627
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,450
Di Feisheng has inserted Gang Qi

628
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:07,360
into your body.

629
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,320
It'll be troublesome.

630
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:11,990
It doesn't matter.

631
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,260
I'm talented.

632
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,960
I felt a little uncomfortable just now.

633
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,560
Look now.

634
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:16,830
I'm fine.

635
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,380
I don't have much inner power left.

636
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:46,190
I almost can't deploy my power to suppress the Gang Qi.

637
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:48,190
But if Gang Qi reaches his temple,

638
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,080
he will surely die.

639
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:52,020
This is the only way.

640
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,200
You're awake.

641
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,420
Get up and have some warm water.

642
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,880
Why did I faint again?

643
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,290
You've been inserted Gang Qi.

644
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:13,820
You fainted all of a sudden.

645
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:16,070
I didn't expect that you are so heavy

646
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,530
that I was exhausted

647
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,880
to carry you back to the Lotus Tower.

648
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:27,470
Practice the skill set according to the papers I put on the table.

649
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,040
Practice it properly.

650
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:39,780
What is this?

651
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:41,230
A draft?

652
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:43,870
A draft?

653
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,410
This is an ancestral skill.

654
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,710
Previously,

655
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,000
the Gang Qi inside your body

656
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,390
was suppressed by it.

657
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:51,870
Study hard.

658
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,710
Don't bother me anymore.

659
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:56,370
It's ancestral?

660
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,480
The ink is not dry yet.

661
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,260
Did you draw it just now?

662
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,450
The ancestral martial arts

663
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,140
must be passed down by word of mouth.

664
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,330
So I drew it for you

665
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:06,630
to make you understand

666
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,600
and learn well.

667
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:08,560
Understand?

668
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,470
I can't simply practice any martial arts for no reason.

669
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,780
If it can't cure the Gang Qi,

670
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,760
and I'm obsessed because of it,

671
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,650
it's not worth it.

672
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:15,740
I won't practice it.

673
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,110
No.

674
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,130
Do you know why Di Feisheng

675
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,830
wanted me to save lives?

676
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,940
It's because of this skill set.

677
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,370
If you don't trust me,

678
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,000
or you doubt me, it's fine.

679
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,530
But Di Feisheng's judgment

680
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,800
can't be wrong.

681
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,470
You don't want it?

682
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,930
Fine, if you don't want it, give it to me.

683
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:37,660
Give it to me.

684
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,820
Listen, Fang Xiaobao,

685
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,550
how can you be a detective?

686
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,310
You're such a fool,

687
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:45,860
an idiot.

688
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:46,990
How can you be a detective?

689
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,430
Can't you think about

690
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,850
why Di Feisheng

691
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:51,750
used you to threaten me to save others?

692
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:54,350
If the Gang Qi in your body is getting more serious,

693
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:55,990
you'll fall into his trap

694
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,150
because you have to listen to him.

695
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,480
What should you do then?

696
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,000
That devil keeps killing people

697
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,860
and keeps doing evil.

698
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,120
Don't you feel guilty?

699
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,510
-Do you want to practice it or not?
-Fine.

700
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,180
I will practice it.

701
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,050
You're talking too much.

702
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,710
I won't let the devil succeed.

703
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:08,960
Remember.

704
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,200
If I

705
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,010
go crazy,

706
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:12,660
foam at the mouth

707
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,060
and dance uncontrollably after practising it,

708
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,270
do remember to find me a physician from the town.

709
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,000
Don't worry.

710
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:20,410
I'll get you any expensive medicine if you need it.

711
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:21,710
Practice hard.

712
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,300
Fine.

713
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,660
After all, you've called Li Xiangyi

714
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,320
your master for so many years.

715
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,690
I'll pass this Yangzhouman to you.

716
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:59,840
It's a way to repay his promise to you.

717
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,320
What are you doing?

718
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,280
Are you sleepwalking at night?

719
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:31,940
Li Lianhua,

720
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,460
where did you get that skill set?

721
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,580
Didn't I tell you?

722
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,500
It's ancestral.

723
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,230
Impossible.

724
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:39,560
The skill set is profound and mysterious.

725
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,560
It's very useful.

726
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,580
Even Tianji Hall's Mind-reading Skills

727
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,710
can't compare to it.

728
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:45,830
If it's really ancestral,

729
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:49,540
there must have been many high-skilled warriors coming from your family.

730
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,100
Tell me.

731
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,830
Where did you get it?

732
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,590
Let go of me!

733
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:54,860
No manners.

734
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:58,050
Fine.

735
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,950
One year, I went to the mountain to collect herbs.

736
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,400
Unfortunately, I fell off the cliff.

737
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,890
Suddenly, in front of a cave,

738
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,720
a fairy godmother appeared.

739
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,980
She asked me to kowtow thrice to her

740
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:13,240
and passed me the set of skills.

741
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:15,410
After thinking about it,

742
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:18,820
I realised that was a legendary immortal fate.

743
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:20,430
Bah!

744
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,380
How can there be like the pie in the sky?

745
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,280
Didn't I tell you?

746
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,410
It's all fate.

747
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:26,550
Tell me

748
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,840
what the name of the skill set is.

749
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,190
That's amazing.

750
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:32,590
It's almost the same as Yangzhouman.

751
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,590
It's Suzhoukuai.

752
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:35,860
I'm not buying that.

753
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,480
You know what?

754
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:40,460
You asked me to tell you, but you don't believe me after I told you.

755
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,620
Then explain to me

756
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:44,080
why I, a physician who sells plasters,

757
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,860
can get the ultimate skill set.

758
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,380
If I were born good at martial arts,

759
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,170
I would have become a hero.

760
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,230
Unfortunately,

761
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,780
we have different fates.

762
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:01,130
I can only be a wandering physician.

763
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,540
Unlike someone,

764
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,810
who's going to be a master soon.

765
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:06,480
All right.

766
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,010
I owe you this time.

767
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:13,680
It's okay if you don't know martial arts.

768
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,880
It's the same if I can.

769
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:17,580
After we get out of here, I'll take care of you

770
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:18,500
and protect you.

771
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,250
No matter what happens, just mention my name.

772
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,310
Most importantly,

773
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,110
I kowtowed three times

774
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,710
to get the skill set.

775
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:27,900
So you also have to kowtow thrice to me

776
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,430
so that I can feel better.

777
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:32,280
Dream on.

778
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,540
Except for my parents,

779
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,390
I'll only kowtow to my master, Li Xiangyi.

780
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,150
Who are you?

781
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,580
Your Suzhoukuai

782
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,900
is definitely not as good as my master's Yangzhouman.

783
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,270
Take your time.

784
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,500
Li Lianhua,

785
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,470
why don't you tell me more

786
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:45,470
about my master?

787
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:46,580
You said too little last time.

788
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,460
I haven't heard enough yet.

789
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,950
Don't you feel hot

790
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,180
and chest tightness?

791
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:51,310
No.

792
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:53,930
The crucial part of Suzhoukuai is silence.

793
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,950
Most importantly, talk less

794
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:56,680
and be quiet.

795
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,440
When you talk, you'll spend your energy and cause blood flow.

796
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,170
It'll boom like a firecracker.

797
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:01,270
It's up to you.
