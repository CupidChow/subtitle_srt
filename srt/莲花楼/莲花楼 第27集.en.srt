4
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,120
If I'd known you were fine,

5
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,100
I wouldn't have come to save you.

6
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,180
Watch out!

7
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,810
Cosmos Fortune Palm!

8
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,500
Jin.

9
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,600
Is it you?

10
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,100
Jin.

11
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:17,860
Is it really you?

12
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,850
As I expected, he and Lu

13
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,140
have a history.

14
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,829
In the inn,

15
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,740
this guy attacked us

16
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,140
but didn't mean to hurt us.

17
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,660
Because he recognized

18
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,600
the wine gourd Lu gave me.

19
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,460
Jin,

20
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,400
you still remember this gourd,

21
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,260
so you must remember me too,

22
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:55,820
right?

23
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,650
I've been looking for you for three years.

24
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,780
I finally found you.

25
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,130
I know you're a man of your word

26
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,110
and won't break your promise.

27
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,790
I came as I promised.

28
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,000
The flower wine this year is mine.

29
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,980
No hard feelings.

30
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,640
Nice move.

31
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,210
You're the first one

32
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,220
who can take something from me.

33
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,420
You can have the wine.

34
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,450
I'm Jin Youdao.

35
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,380
Lu Jianchi.

36
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,810
What a surprising ending.

37
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,110
Is he really Jin Youdao?

38
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,110
It's Jin

39
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,590
who protected me.

40
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:54,570
Luckily,

41
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,270
I have the wine gourd Lu gave me.

42
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,630
Later I found that those mutants were afraid of fire.

43
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,880
So I made this fire circle

44
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,820
to keep them away.

45
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,330
I'm glad you're safe.

46
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,740
Where are the other mutants?

47
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,780
When the morning light shone through,

48
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,470
I noticed that their movements slowed down.

49
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:36,460
So I lured them into this dungeon

50
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,560
and locked them up.

51
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,530
That was close.

52
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,630
Thank god you made it to dawn.

53
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:41,980
Yes.

54
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:44,060
I was up all night

55
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,450
and felt so sleepy.

56
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,430
I was going to find a place

57
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,540
to have a good rest

58
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,659
but someone ruined my plan.

59
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,940
Thank you for your concern.

60
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,870
You're welcome.

61
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,300
You're a man.

62
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,430
Don't be so fragile.

63
00:05:58,690 --> 00:05:59,490
But…

64
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,140
Why is Jin now afraid of sunlight?

65
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,580
Maybe his Head Bane

66
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,170
isn't the same as it was ten years ago.

67
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:08,870
Head Bane?

68
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,240
I found some clues here.

69
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,560
This sinkhole is

70
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,870
where Nanyin people created mind control bugs.

71
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,120
These people

72
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,900
were tricked here

73
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,030
to be test subjects.

74
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,630
But it seems that those bugs

75
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,700
were a failure.

76
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,780
Nanyin people are so despicable.

77
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,260
Is the Lord of the Netherworld

78
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,400
among these people?

79
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,590
The Netherworld Sword?

80
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,380
Yes.

81
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,670
It's the Lord of the Netherworld's sword.

82
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,130
Then he…

83
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,290
He's not here.

84
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,500
I found it on a stone wall

85
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,140
nearby.

86
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,880
It proves that he was here.

87
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,370
The Lord of the Netherworld

88
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,370
knows a technique to break his sword

89
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:55,930
as a diversion to escape.

90
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,100
He must

91
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,890
have gotten out of here.

92
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,810
Then the trail goes cold again.

93
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,140
You're still alive!

94
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,050
Tell us.

95
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,210
Where is the antidote for Head Bane?

96
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:20,980
Antidote?

97
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,010
There is no cure for Head Bane.

98
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,150
People who gave their souls to the Head God

99
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,060
will be his servants forever.

100
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:32,690
Nonsense!

101
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,320
All the poisons

102
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,140
and black magic in the world

103
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,260
are invented by humans

104
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,460
and can definitely be neutralized.

105
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,100
Tell us!

106
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,540
There is no cure for Head Bane.

107
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,940
You had it coming.

108
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,100
Shut up!

109
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,130
It's a big world

110
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,200
full of experts and geniuses.

111
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,430
I believe as long as I keep searching,

112
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,220
I'll eventually find a way

113
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,260
to cure Jin.

114
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:03,020
Sirs,

115
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,310
without your help,

116
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,120
I wouldn't have found Jin.

117
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,150
Thank you very much.

118
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,720
Lu, don't say that.

119
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,590
We didn't do much.

120
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,000
After we part ways today,

121
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,120
no one knows when we can meet again.

122
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,260
Take care.

123
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,140
Lu, take care.

124
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:25,820
Take care.

125
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,760
By the way,

126
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,350
I found an important place

127
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,650
in the sinkhole.

128
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,300
I'm afraid what Nanyin wants

129
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,370
is not that simple.

130
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,860
Lock those guys up.

131
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,520
I'll take you there.

132
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:49,790
Okay.

133
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,430
This is where they made research on Head Bane.

134
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,250
When I was running from the mutants,

135
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,450
I found this place by chance

136
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,260
and saw their notes.

137
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,050
Look.

138
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,630
They're prints of ancient murals.

139
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,120
Bug eggs are raised in human skulls.

140
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,100
This is Nanyin's magical technique

141
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,500
of creating Karmic Bugs.

142
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,350
Karmic Bugs raised in skulls

143
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,090
can be divided into mother bugs and child bugs.

144
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,460
By controlling mother bugs,

145
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,140
one can control the child bugs' hosts.

146
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,100
So Karmic Bugs are used to control people.

147
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,510
Head Bane may work the same way.

148
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,260
What does it have to do with Karmic Bugs?

149
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,370
Karmic Bugs were created

150
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,890
by black magic in ancient Nanyin.

151
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,020
That technique

152
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,580
has long been lost.

153
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,900
Think about it.

154
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,470
Back then in Nanyin,

155
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,530
only the royal family had one Karmic Bug.

156
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,220
With Nanyin's downfall,

157
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,170
that Karmic Bug went missing.

158
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,590
You mean,

159
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,510
Nanyin people found these murals

160
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,070
which only depicted part of the technique

161
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,290
so the descendants of Nanyin

162
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,350
couldn't fully understand how to make Karmic Bugs.

163
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,330
That's why they tried again and again

164
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,180
and caused those martial art masters

165
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,130
to become uncontrollable monsters.

166
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,140
Yes.

167
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,100
That's also

168
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,960
why Head Bane was a failure

169
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,030
despite ten years of effort.

170
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,200
Nanyin people quit creating it

171
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:54,740
and started searching for

172
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,170
the Karmic Bug the royal family once owned.

173
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,310
Nanyin wants to control martial forces

174
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,340
in the Central Plains through Karmic Bugs.

175
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:01,880
That's why

176
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,480
they need Rama Heavenly Ice.

177
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,130
Elder Shi,

178
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,330
is my guess right?

179
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,690
So it is right.

180
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,270
So what?

181
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,920
You can't get out anyway.

182
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,880
I've informed my master.

183
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,660
She's on her way here

184
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,380
with men from the Jinyuan Alliance.

185
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,220
You found out

186
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,650
the secret of our village

187
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,460
and ruined our Head Bane.

188
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,250
You won't survive today.

189
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,540
The Jinyuan Alliance.

190
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,020
It's your men's doing again!

191
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:43,590
Forget it.

192
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,370
You've been in seclusion for the past decade.

193
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,100
I don't think you know about it.

194
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,020
The Jinyuan Alliance and Nanyin…

195
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,290
Someone from Nanyin

196
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,470
bought gunpowder and blew up

197
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,220
everything you had in the East Sea.

198
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,620
Do you know that Jiao Liqiao is from Nanyin?

199
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,120
What did you mean in the secret letter?

200
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,870
Your master wants me to take control of the Jinyuan Alliance?

201
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,980
What you did

202
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,340
will be found by Di Feisheng sooner or later.

203
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,660
By then, if the Jinyuan Alliance is under your control,

204
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,120
things will be easier for both of us.

205
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,110
Fei.

206
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,340
Are you okay?

207
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,300
I didn't blame you.

208
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,300
Stop pretending.

209
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,020
Wuxin Huai is attacking him again.

210
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,440
Fei. Careful.

211
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,640
I remember seeing the cure

212
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,300
for Wuxin Huai on the murals.

213
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:32,960
Take a look.

214
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,010
Okay.

215
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,350
Here it is.

216
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,110
This painting says,

217
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,640
using a leech raised in Wuxin Huai

218
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,550
to suck out poisonous blood from Taiyuan Acupoint

219
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:52,080
can remove Wuxin Huai from the victim's body.

220
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,780
Leech raised in Wuxin Huai?

221
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,080
You know how to use Wuxin Huai,

222
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,950
so you must have such leeches with you.

223
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,080
I won't give you any

224
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,150
even if you kill me!

225
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:03,600
You…

226
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,730
We won't bother you then.

227
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,080
You guys have been doing evil for so many years.

228
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,540
You can't get away with it.

229
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,070
Just wait to be thrown into

230
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,000
the Baichuan Court's 188 prisons.

231
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,480
Fei.

232
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,320
I need some of your blood.

233
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,540
There's a pond here.

234
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,360
If you cure Wuxin Huai for him,

235
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,830
he'll regain his memory

236
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,460
and may become the old Di Feisheng again.

237
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,190
Are you sure you want to do that?

238
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,240
Never mind.

239
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,400
He opened the device for me.

240
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,660
I'll consider it as returning the favor.

241
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,220
Di Feisheng

242
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,040
has only one opponent,

243
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,610
Li Xiangyi.

244
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,180
Defeating him

245
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:56,910
is all I want.

246
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,180
Sorry.

247
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,510
I can't help you.

248
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,490
No one can defeat you now.

249
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,090
Fei.

250
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,700
He's fine.

251
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,500
Wuxin Huai is already out of his system.

252
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,910
He just fainted

253
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,710
from exhaustion.

254
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:36,940
Xiaobao!

255
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:41,600
Run!

256
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,550
Protect Fei.

257
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,500
Granny Blood!

258
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,119
Dragon in Snow?

259
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:24,750
Xiangyi Swordplay?

260
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,220
Back then, Li Xiangyi

261
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,130
saw a unique plum

262
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,280
in Dongfang Qingzhong's plum garden.

263
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,630
He found it so beautiful

264
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,010
that he wanted to pick 17 blossoms

265
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,250
for the 17 girls in the Sigu Sect.

266
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,000
Dongfang Qingzhong wouldn't let him

267
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,080
so they fought in the plum garden.

268
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,720
You defeated him

269
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,110
and took the flowers.

270
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,110
You used that move

271
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,780
called Dragon in Snow to defeat him, right?

272
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,040
I was right.

273
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,880
You are Li Xiangyi.

274
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,060
The Shaoshi Sword can slice steel.

275
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,850
The Wenjing Sword can shatter bones.

276
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,620
Sect Leader Li, how have you been?

277
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,190
It's been ten years.

278
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,530
You're still so young and handsome.

279
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,140
Miss Jiao.

280
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,180
Thank you for your compliments.

281
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,360
It's been ten years.

282
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,540
You've aged a lot.

283
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,580
He's really Li Xiangyi.

284
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,390
You're so mean,

285
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:49,000
even more annoying than ten years ago.

286
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,670
I thought you were disabled by the Bicha Poison.

287
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,770
The Bicha Poison

288
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:58,320
is far from enough to ruin me.

289
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,880
You're right.

290
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,700
I've been practicing martial arts so hard for ten years

291
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,990
in order to defeat you.

292
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,470
I must kill you today.

293
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,630
I won't fight you today.

294
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,140
Saving Director Di is more important.

295
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,600
I'll settle the score with you in the future.

296
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,780
You're awake.

297
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,030
Li Lianhua.

298
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:33,620
No.

299
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,600
I should call you

300
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,570
Li Xiangyi, right?

301
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:45,940
Yes.

302
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,580
You can use Yangzhouman.

303
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:52,810
You've been involved with Di Feisheng.

304
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,840
You know so much about my father.

305
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,630
You always want to ditch me

306
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,320
because you don't want me to find out who you are.

307
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,840
You're also the guy in white who helped me,

308
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,500
aren't you?

309
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,980
You hid it from me for so long.

310
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,400
I was kept in the dark

311
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,220
and so worried about your safety.

312
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,820
Fang Xiaobao,

313
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,350
I didn't mean

314
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,410
to hold out on you.

315
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,560
You didn't mean it?

316
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,320
How do you explain

317
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,080
why you have the Wenjing Sword?

318
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,900
Back then, my father asked the Shi family of the Tiejia Sect

319
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,760
to forge weapons with cloud iron.

320
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,250
They made body armor

321
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,200
and a soft sword for him.

322
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,540
When we moved my father's grave,

323
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,380
we all saw

324
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,390
my father in that body armor.

325
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:41,630
Do you know

326
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,220
that cloud iron is hard and flexible

327
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,190
and the only thing that can pierce that body armor

328
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:48,160
is that soft sword made of cloud iron too?

329
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,890
And that is your Wenjing Sword!

330
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,780
Cloud iron has a blue glow when stained with blood.

331
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,450
What else do you have to say?

332
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,760
You mean,

333
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,270
the Wenjing Sword has a blue glow

334
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,090
because it's made of cloud iron?

335
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,460
Your inner power is fierce.

336
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,660
This soft sword may suit you.

337
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,140
In a few days,

338
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,510
you'll turn eighteen.

339
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,750
I give you this soft sword

340
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,170
as your birthday gift.

341
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,960
This sword is flexible

342
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,990
and can easily slice your enemies' throats.

343
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,650
You'll be invincible with it.

344
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,770
What an amazing sword.

345
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,570
Sharp

346
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:35,850
yet soft.

347
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,420
Since it's a gift from you,

348
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,630
I'll take it as a token of our friendship.

349
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,910
We'll hold together through thick and thin.

350
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,140
I'll call it the Wenjing Sword.

351
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,470
Is my Wenjing Sword

352
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,810
made of the cloud iron from the He family?

353
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:00,160
Were the He brothers killed by…

354
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,940
You said you don't know about cloud iron.

355
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,370
Then why do you have a sword made from it?

356
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,240
There's more to this story.

357
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,570
It's not what you think.

358
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,800
Then tell me about it.

359
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,500
I'll make my own judgment.

360
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,530
I didn't know this sword

361
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,310
was made of cloud iron.

362
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,180
Originally,

363
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,060
the He family planned to use cloud iron to…

364
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:35,320
What?

365
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:38,780
I saw through your lie

366
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,440
and you don't know what to say?

367
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,570
Or do you

368
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,920
even not care to lie to me now?

369
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,540
Xiaobao.

370
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,740
There are many things I haven't figured out yet.

371
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,800
I don't want you to harbor resentment

372
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,070
because of what I say.

373
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,910
Please give me more time.

374
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,700
Li Lianhua!

375
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:07,770
No.

376
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,560
I should call you Li Xiangyi.

377
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:14,710
All this time,

378
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:16,150
I've seen you as my best friend,

379
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,210
but what did you do?

380
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,800
You promised to be honest with me

381
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,460
but are actually full of lies!

382
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,670
In terms of calculation,

383
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,440
no one can be your match, Sect Leader Li.

384
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,200
I was wrong about you.

385
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,130
If you can't explain yourself today,

386
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,460
I'll kill you

387
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,790
to avenge my father now!

388
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,430
Forget it.

389
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,530
I don't know what to believe.

390
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:13,930
You and I

391
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,630
are like this flute.

392
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,260
In the future,

393
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,810
we'll be strangers.

394
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:37,810
If one day,

395
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,490
I find that my father's death

396
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,630
was related to you,

397
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,010
I'll find you

398
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,820
and fight you to the dead.

399
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,720
Let's put an end to our past.

400
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:15,660
Here.

401
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,570
To my new friend.

402
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:19,860
New friend?

403
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,440
My best friend.

[Shishou Village]

405
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,590
[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

406
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:41,400
My Lord.

407
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,550
You're awake.

408
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,620
Where am I?

409
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,580
My Lord,

410
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,760
I did all this for you.

411
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,400
Please forgive me.

412
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,750
Forgive you?

413
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,720
You've been my Guardian for ten years.

414
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,390
What should I forgive you for?

415
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:31,740
Are you talking about

416
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,940
me ending seclusion by force

417
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,660
and almost losing my sanity?

418
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:41,430
Yu Hongzhu failed in her duty as my Guardian.

419
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,210
My Lord,

420
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,950
you mean

421
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:48,580
you just ended seclusion in Yu City yesterday?

422
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:49,840
Didn't I?

423
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,530
My Lord, please forgive me.

424
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:56,930
I was not with you.

425
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:00,100
What happened?

426
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,110
I only remember lots of noises.

427
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,160
Men from the Baichuan Court seemed there.

428
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,890
I stopped cultivation by force

429
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,380
and my power backfired.

430
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,600
I was relieved when you arrived.

431
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,270
Get in!

432
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,100
Come in.

433
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,080
My Lord.

434
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,680
I was in seclusion for ten years.

435
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:42,220
It's been long since the last time I saw so many people.

436
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,930
Why were you hiding outside?

437
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,080
My Lord,

438
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,350
Saintess asked us

439
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,250
to protect you outside.

440
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,110
My Lord, you just ended seclusion.

441
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,480
How are you feeling?

442
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:02,570
My head aches.

443
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:06,740
Let me make you feel better.

444
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,220
Okay.

445
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:12,290
You may leave.

446
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,080
Yes.

447
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,300
It's been ten years.

448
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:38,310
You're still so beautiful.

449
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,430
Thank you for everything you did these years.

450
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,520
My Lord.

451
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,100
I'm glad you're back.

452
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,440
Ten years is nothing.

453
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,540
For you,

454
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,490
I'll do anything.

455
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,660
Then tell me

456
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,090
what you will do for me.

457
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,630
I'm preparing a big gift for you.

458
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:16,540
A gift that can make you invincible

459
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,560
in the martial world.

460
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,620
But I haven't gotten it yet.

461
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,110
After I succeed,

462
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,480
I'll give you a surprise.

463
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,650
Okay.

464
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,250
I'll wait for you.

465
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,580
I heard

466
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:37,700
that he lost all his memories

467
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,870
when he was with Li Lianhua.

468
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:45,240
Wuxin Huai is so powerful.

469
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:07,480
Mr. Li.

470
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,300
You've been unconscious for three days.

471
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,460
What happened?

472
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,620
I came to see you

473
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:17,510
and found you unconscious outside the Lotus Tower.

474
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,320
Don't worry.

475
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:19,800
Look.

476
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:20,920
I'm tough.

477
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,580
I won't die.

478
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,450
I'm fine now.

479
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,310
Are you really okay?

480
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,760
The monk said the poison

481
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,870
will attack me every three days.

482
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,560
As time passes by,

483
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,160
I'll faint more and more often.

484
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,930
I must hurry up.

485
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,130
It's strange.

486
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:43,800
Li Lianhua.

487
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,890
Weren't you

488
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,560
always with Fang Duobing?

489
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:48,600
You're sick now.

490
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,060
Why is he not here?

491
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,360
Careful.

492
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,360
Fang Xiaobao has gone home.

493
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,850
These matters have nothing to do with him.

494
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,930
He shouldn't be involved.

495
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,860
What are you talking about?

496
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:13,700
Nothing.

497
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,860
What brought you here?

498
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:16,650
Li Lianhua.

499
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,940
My grandpa found something about Rama Vessel.

500
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,100
Rama Vessel is used

501
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,360
to keep Karmic Bugs, isn't it?

502
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,330
Yes.

503
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:27,270
There are two types of Karmic Bugs: mother bugs and child bugs.

504
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,510
There are only child bugs in Rama Vessel.

505
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,040
Mother bugs have been lost.

506
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,430
I'm confused about one thing.

507
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,320
If Jiao Liqiao is from Nanyin too,

508
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,520
why is it so hard for her to gather the four pieces of Heavenly Ice?

509
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,190
I think

510
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,560
those four people brought Heavenly Ice

511
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,780
to the Central Plains to restore Nanyin

512
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,340
but their descendants

513
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,940
gradually got used to the luxurious life here.

514
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:51,980
As a result,

515
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,650
they quit restoring Nanyin

516
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,280
and hid their identities.

517
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:01,240
So it's hard to gather those four pieces of Heavenly Ice.

518
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:02,500
Besides,

519
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,350
my grandpa has also found

520
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,290
that mother bugs

521
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,920
can live in their hosts for thousands of years

522
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,210
and the child bugs

523
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,940
can sense the locations of the mother bugs.

524
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,830
You mean,

525
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,949
they took Rama Vessel

526
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,449
not just for the child bugs?

527
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,630
They want to find where the mother bugs are.

528
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,429
Yes.

529
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:25,199
Once they find the mother bugs,

530
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,540
they can create tens of thousands of child bugs.

531
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,460
That'll be a disaster.

532
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,170
This matter

533
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,260
is much more serious than I thought.

534
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:39,300
I need to go to…

535
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,230
No matter what you need to do,

536
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,030
you need to be in good health to do it.

537
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:44,940
You look like

538
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,760
you may faint again anytime.

539
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,659
Let's eat something first.

540
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,770
They look great.

541
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:00,640
Miss Su,

542
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,140
thank you.

543
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,810
You're welcome.

544
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,310
I took them from the Shishou Village.

545
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,050
Eat up.

546
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,490
By the way,

547
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:15,450
that village is so remote.

548
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,690
How did the Wansheng Clan find it?

549
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:20,330
They sent lots of food to the villagers.

550
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,700
The Wansheng Clan?

551
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,080
How did you know the food was from the Wansheng Clan?

552
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,480
It's written on the grain bags.

553
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,080
I took them from the village.

554
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,520
That mark

555
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:37,510
looks very familiar.

556
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,130
That mark is solely used by the Wansheng Clan

557
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,820
for internal communication.

558
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,920
The Wansheng Clan. The cloud iron armor.

559
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,300
Wuxin Huai.

560
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,560
No wonder the Sigu Sect

561
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,520
and the Jinyuan Alliance suffered great losses from the showdown ten years ago.

562
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,180
The Wansheng Clan benefited the most from that.

563
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:11,860
Ten years ago.

564
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,790
Ten years later.

565
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,940
What is the conspiracy behind all this?

566
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,240
Senior.

567
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,940
Look where your lies have got me.

568
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:23,950
All these years,

569
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,480
what role have you played

570
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,890
in this game?

571
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,270
Director Di only remembers

572
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:36,270
what happened after he left Yu City.

573
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:37,760
He's completely forgotten

574
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,020
what we've done.

575
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,890
Wuxin Huai is so amazing.

576
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:43,470
It didn't damage his martial art skills

577
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,800
but damaged his memory.

578
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,080
The wind is in my sails!

579
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,510
Maid,

580
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:51,930
go get me some tonics.

581
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,670
If Director Di summons me,

582
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,220
I need to be at my very best.

583
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:02,470
Saintess,

584
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:06,600
I think Director Di is very weird.

585
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,310
He's never interested in women.

586
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:13,580
Why is he suddenly so fond of you?

587
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,280
We don't know if he's really lost his memories.

588
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,940
Maybe he was just pretending.

589
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,260
What if he wants to deceive you?

590
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:23,370
In my opinion,

591
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,600
you should

592
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:27,620
be careful around him.

593
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,320
That's impossible.

594
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:32,110
I know him very well.

595
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:35,670
He's too proud

596
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,130
to pretend.

597
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,130
If he cares to act,

598
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,520
he's not the Di Feisheng we know.

599
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,520
He spent lots of time with Li Lianhua.

600
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,220
Maybe he picked up tricks

601
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,760
from Li Lianhua.

602
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,980
Snow Master is right.

603
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,900
This is strange.

604
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,620
Don't let him

605
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,390
get in our way again.

606
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,780
If he's really lied to me,

607
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,710
I'll cut off his limbs,

608
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,070
lock him in a room,

609
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,150
and make him unable to live without me.

610
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,010
However,

611
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,300
he's my man.

612
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,480
I'm the only one who can hurt him.

613
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,820
Don't you dare lay a finger on him.

614
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:27,570
I'm not interested in Di Feisheng at all.

615
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,520
I've read the secret letter

616
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,330
you sent me.

617
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,100
Are you sure

618
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,680
that Li Lianhua

619
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,340
is Li Xiangyi?

620
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,360
Yes.

621
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,980
That guy is such an annoyance.

622
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,340
Ten years ago,

623
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,800
Director Di was obsessed with defeating him

624
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,940
and didn't care about anything else.

625
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,810
Ten years later,

626
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:48,940
he appeared around Director Di again.

627
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:52,820
The Bicha Poison is said to be the deadliest poison in the world.

628
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,110
Why didn't it kill him?

629
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,720
Why is he still alive?

630
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:02,320
Li Xiangyi can't be killed so easily.

631
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:09,180
I think it's Yangzhouman that saved him.

632
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,710
Although he's only left with ten percent of his power,

633
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,310
he's still hard to deal with.

634
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:17,860
Should we…

635
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,060
No.

636
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,400
He's a wreck now

637
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,270
and can't threaten us.

638
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,310
I've gotten bored

639
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:32,300
of traveling at night.

640
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,730
I don't need to do that anymore.

641
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:38,810
It's God's will that he survived.

642
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:42,880
He'll be able to witness my success.

643
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:46,850
But if we don't kill him,

644
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,780
he may keep getting in our way.

645
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:49,830
Besides,

646
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:51,980
he has Yu Louchun's Rama Heavenly Ice.

647
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,380
We need all the four pieces of Heavenly Ice

648
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,730
to open Rama Vessel.

649
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,810
We don't need to deal with him ourselves.

650
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:01,100
Didn't you plant

651
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,930
lots of spies in the Sigu Sect?

652
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,690
Snow Master,

653
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,710
send a letter to the Sigu Sect immediately.

654
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,810
Xiao Zijin is petty

655
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:10,900
and narrow-minded.

656
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,260
He can't amount to much.

657
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,750
You just need to

658
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:15,790
give him a little bit of information

659
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:18,830
and he'll try desperately to seize this chance.

660
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,340
My Lord.

661
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:39,900
My Lord.

662
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,190
I never thought

663
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,290
that Jiao Liqiao

664
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,560
would plot with outsiders against you.

665
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,950
Thank god you survived.

666
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:48,520
Jiao Liqiao.

667
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,670
What can she do to me?

668
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:52,890
It's just that I was in seclusion for ten years

669
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,120
and the whole Jinyuan Alliance

670
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,210
answers to her now.

671
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,500
I underestimated her.

672
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,230
My Lord, don't worry.

673
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,660
There are still people loyal to you in the Alliance.

674
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,790
After we leave here,

675
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,370
we'll take the Jinyuan Alliance back for you.

676
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:07,550
No hurry.

677
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,510
Whatever she did to me,

678
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,870
I'll do worse to her.

679
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,140
I'm very interested in the thing

680
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,460
in her Rama Vessel.

681
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:22,270
They want to tear each other down.

682
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:26,080
I just need to sit back and watch.

683
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:33,900
[Pudu Temple]

684
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,060
Bhante Wuliao is meditating.

685
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,580
Please come another time.

686
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,930
Is he meditating

687
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,370
or avoiding me?

688
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,070
Fine.

689
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,390
Since you're meditating,

690
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,800
I'll wait for you to come out right here.

691
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,410
We caught a spy tonight.

692
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:44,900
He's from the Jinyuan Alliance

693
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,300
and got into the Pudu Temple disguised as a visitor.

694
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:47,900
He came

695
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:49,550
for the map of the 188 prisons.

696
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:51,810
Who told you the map is in the Pudu Temple?

697
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:58,500
Tell us.

698
00:42:58,970 --> 00:42:59,500
Who's it?

699
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:01,440
I heard Saintess say

700
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:03,770
that she got the news from the Lotus Tower.

701
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:04,770
That's all I know.

702
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,500
I'm telling the truth.

703
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:11,810
Li Lianhua?

704
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:16,870
The Sigu Sect just received an anonymous letter

705
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:19,300
informing on Li Lianhua.

706
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:35,490
It's been six days.

707
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,280
I can't wait any longer.
