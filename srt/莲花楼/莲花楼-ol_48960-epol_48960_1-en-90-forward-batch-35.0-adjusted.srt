Ten years ago,

the fastest sword in the wide world was Li Xiangyi's sword.

6
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:20,979
He defeated the Demon of the Blood Realm at 15

7
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:23,300
and became the best martial artist in the world.

8

He established Sigu Sect at 17.

9

He even killed Shan Gudao, Li Xiangyi's senior

I took the exam for three years in a row,

If you let my son enter Baichuan Academy,

00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,710
put a coffin at the back

345
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,580
and caught a doctor here.

346
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,060
They forced him to save the people in the coffin.

347
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,660
What an interesting doctor.

348
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,100
He said he needed a condition to save people.

349
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,490
He needs to get his dog to pick up the luckiest draw.

350
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:26,780
He's not an immortal.

351
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,990
How could he save the dead?

352
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,220
You are right.

353
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,220
If people don't have morality,

354
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,280
how are they different from animals?

355
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,220
Who are you?

356
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,700
How dare you meddle with things of the Hall of Wind and Flame?

357
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,620
Who am I?

358
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,740
Baichuan Academy.

359
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,930
A detective from Baichuan Academy.

360
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,540
It's a misunderstanding.

361
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,200
It's all a misunderstanding.

362
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,790
So you're a friend from Baichuan Academy.

363
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,740
I didn't know.

364
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:00,530
I'm sorry.

365
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,930
But we didn't do anything wrong.

366
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,460
I don't know why Baichuan Academy

367
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,100
is hard on the Hall of Wind and Flame.

368
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,460
So many of you bullied one of him.

369
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,260
It's not fair.

370
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,770
People who know martial arts bully him who doesn't know martial arts.

371
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:10,500
It's unjust.

372
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,930
For unfair and unjust things,

373
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,130
people of Baichuan Academy

374
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,860
will definitely get involved.

375
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,520
Well...

376
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,260
Well said.

377
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,620
Well said.

378
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,080
Young man.

379
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,830
You're a detective, right?

380
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,420
Then you came at the right time.

381
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,880
You came at the right time.

382
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,230
They...

383
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,810
They killed someone.

384
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,830
Killed someone?

385
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,900
Who did they kill?

386
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,220
Arrest them now!

387
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:45,090
Tell me.

388
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,460
What case?

389
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,890
We killed those who deserve to be killed.

390
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,850
But he shouldn't die at this moment.

391
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:52,250
Right?

392
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,550
That's right.

393
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,350
You'll die anytime I want.

394
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,120
You own the Yama's Palace?

395
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,580
You...

396
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,430
What are you doing?

397
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:58,910
Look.

398
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,020
He's staring at me.

399
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,080
All right, stop it.

400
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,860
Where is he?

401
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,420
Show me.

402
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,950
Emptying Hands, the master thief?

403
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,410
That's right.

404
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:15,660
Li.

405
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,750
His mouth and nose are cold.

406
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,620
There's no pulse at all.

407
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,790
He can't die anymore.

408
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,260
As for the cause of death,

409
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,150
it's probably your meteor hammer.

410
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,980
Sir.

411
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,980
He stole the treasure of Hall of Wind and Flame.

412
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,720
He is a Shaolin lay disciple.

413
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,180
He practiced Impenetrable Defence.

414
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,710
He shouldn't die like this.

415
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,060
That's right.

416
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,300
In that case,

417
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,020
what does it have to do with this doctor?

418
00:25:59,020 --> 00:25:59,980
Did he kill him?

419
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,020
No.

420
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,220
Did he still with Emptying Hands?

421
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,280
No.

422
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,260
In that case,

423
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,780
why are you making things difficult for this...

424
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,440
Li Lianhua.

425
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,530
Doctor Li Lianhua?

426
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,380
Well said, young man.

427
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:14,920
This...

428
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,700
Did we just lose our things for nothing?

429
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,360
Didn't you just kill someone?

430
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,520
He took your stuff.

431
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,610
You killed him.

432
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,520
He's at a disadvantage.

433
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,910
You had a chance to find the lost thing.

434
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,360
Unfortunately...

435
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,080
Think about it before you take action next time.

436
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:33,040
Everyone's life is expensive.

437
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:35,300
You have to pay for killing, right?

438
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,540
As for this dead body,

439
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,220
I'll stay and inform Baichuan Academy.

440
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,620
As for how to deal with it,

441
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,420
it's also up to us.

442
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,100
Doctor Li.

443
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,140
You may leave now.

444
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,540
Thank you.

445
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,820
He can't leave.

446
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:52,750
Brother.

447
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,940
We lost the treasure of our Hall.

448
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,030
He is the only hope we can get it back.

449
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,270
Shi Wenjue of the Iron Armor Sect.

450
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,200
Iron Flute Hero.

451
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,860
It is said that Li Lianhua

452
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:03,140
is a miracle-working doctor who can cure the dead.

453
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,340
They would never lie.

454
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,460
But I only remember

455
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,050
I gave them

456
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,680
some rheumatic plasters.

457
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,260
But this plaster

458
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,420
can't bring people back to life.

459
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,680
I'm not that powerful.

460
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,660
I can't cure the dead.

461
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,900
How could you believe

462
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,430
words to cheat kids?

463
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,460
That's right.

464
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,900
If he can bring people back to life,

465
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,160
I'll take his surname.

466
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,390
This...

467
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:28,980
What?

468
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,720
You're not convinced?

469
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,310
13 years ago,

470
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,760
the court had an agreement with Sigu Sect.

471
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,090
The affairs of the people are under the government's jurisdiction.

472
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,540
Baichuan Academy judge the grudges between people who know martial arts.

473
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,260
Are you disregarding the ruling

474
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,460
of Baichuan Academy?

475
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,070
Fine.

476
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,510
For today's matter,

477
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,660
we will not just let it go.

478
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:52,710
Let's go.

479
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,090
Let's go.

480
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,470
Thank you for saving my life.

481
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:05,930
But

482
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,240
now,

483
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,260
they should...

484
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:10,340
Don't worry.

485
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,040
As long as I'm here,

486
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,830
no one dares to touch you.

487
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,540
Stay with me tonight.

488
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,440
I'll send you out of the city tomorrow morning.

489
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,170
How can I?

490
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,820
But my money...

491
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:29,420
I'll pay for it.

492
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:32,330
How loyal!

[Lingshan Sect]

[Lotus Tower]

00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:49,980
Young Master.

496
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,830
The dessert is not delicate enough.

497
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,160
I'll prepare some more.

498
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,900
Thank you so much, Mr. Fang.

499
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,100
Li, don't mention it.

500
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,440
How do you know my surname?

501
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,880
Daring to recruit the only son of Minister Fang,

502
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:11,240
Fobi Baishi is really bold.

503
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,360
You know my father?

504
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:20,270
Mr. Fang.

505
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,930
If I'm right,

506
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,030
your sward ornament

507
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,740
should be a rare jade, cold smoke.

508
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,390
Last year, only one piece came out.

509
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,130
Fuyu Building charged an extremely high price.

510
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,710
Tianji Manor got it.

511
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,090
Your name is more frightening

512
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,020
than the title of a detective.

513
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,830
I didn't expect that although you don't know martial arts,

514
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,290
you're quite insightful.

515
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,780
I didn't want to be ostentatious

516
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,220
in the wide world.

517
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,530
Mr. Fang,

518
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,500
you must have just entered Baichuan Academy, right?

519
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:54,990
Yes.

520
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,420
Since I was young, I swore

521
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,980
I would join Baichuan Academy when I grow up

522
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,660
and revive the Sigu Sect.

523
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,050
So I don't want anyone to know

524
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,000
I'm the son of Prime Minister Fang.

525
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,660
I just want others to remember me as

526
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:11,790
an ordinary detective of Baichuan Academy.

527
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,650
Good ambition.

528
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:20,250
I like passionate young men like you.

529
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,550
It seems that we really get along well.

530
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,350
Here.

531
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,220
To Mr. Fang.

532
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,300
To Baichuan Academy.

533
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:27,630
Here.

534
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:28,850
It's my honor.

535
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,320
Cheers.

536
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:29,920
Cheers.

537
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:34,620
By the way,

538
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,570
Mr. Fang,

539
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,690
what's your plan on

540
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,310
handling the body of Emptying Hands?

541
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,180
I'll send a pigeon to Baichuan Academy

542
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,780
and ask them to bring it back.

543
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,780
By the way, Li.

544
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,060
I'm curious about one thing.

545
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,100
Why is the Hall of Wind and Flame so sure that

546
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:53,020
you saved two dead people?

547
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,980
I don't believe in resurrection.

548
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,640
In this world,

549
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,350
there are ways to revive the dead.

550
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,580
Because sometimes,

551
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,930
the dead may not really be the dead.

552
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,110
Li,

553
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:16,360
what do you mean?

554
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,300
This tea...

555
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:33,250
I haven't met a detective for so many years.

556
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,780
I didn't expect that the first detective

557
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,830
to meet is you, a newbie.

558
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,760
Baichuan Academy is getting worse every year.

559
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,650
Who are you?

560
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,020
For the sake of your help,

561
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,920
I'll say something more.

562
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,560
You made the first mistake as a detective

563
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,490
as soon as you got off the mountain.

564
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,430
You trust others too easily.

565
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,610
You deserve a beating.

566
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:03,520
Secondly,

567
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,460
your autopsy is not done professionally.

568
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,860
That's another beating.

569
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,590
I'm not blaming you.

570
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,460
Being a detective doesn't suit you.

571
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,120
Go home after one or two cases.

572
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:13,750
By the way,

573
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:14,960
also,

574
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:18,090
you even brought maids and servants with you.

575
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,750
Can you be more ostentatious?

576
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,690
Just you wait.

577
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,100
Get up.

578
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,250
Li.

579
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,400
Why are you so late?

580
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:55,770
Do you know that the Unbreathing Skill

581
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,260
can only last for three days at most?

582
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,420
Lower your voice.

583
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,970
The Hall of Wind and Flame is so cruel.

584
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:05,360
They almost killed me.

585
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,400
Cut the crap.

586
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,220
Leave now.

587
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:07,640
Okay.

588
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:08,820
Let's go.

589
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:11,760
Hurry!

590
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:15,160
Hurry!

591
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,350
Where is Li Lianhua?

592
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:30,270
My people just found out that

593
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,020
he knew Emptying Hands long ago.

594
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:32,900
He deliberately

595
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,300
lured us here to find him.

596
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,000
Boss.

597
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,160
Bad news!

598
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,100
The man in the coffin is gone.

599
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:39,140
Go after him!

600
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:42,780
Wait for me!

601
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:44,850
Wait for me!

602
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:49,550
Huahua?

603
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,200
You are well prepared.

604
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,270
Stop! Stop!

605
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,700
Stop! Stop!

606
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,690
-Stop!
-Go!

607
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,000
Kid.

608
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,210
What did you say?

609
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,940
If this brother can really come back to life,

610
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,340
you'll take his surname.

611
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,740
I must seek an explanation from Baichuan Academy for this.

612
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,270
Let's go.

613
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:21,480
Let's go.

614
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:24,970
Li Lianhua.

615
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:31,010
Did you see Huahua?

616
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:33,610
That detective was so stern.

617
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:36,890
I owe you nothing now.

618
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,290
All clear.

619
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,180
The Hall of Wind and Flame

620
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,440
is really not good.

621
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,659
They started off as bandits.

622
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:46,050
Five years ago, they took the Shi family's secret book

623
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:46,889
as their own.

624
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,730
I had no choice.

625
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:49,190
I have to find and steal it.

626
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,139
But today,

627
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,020
fortunately, you're here.

628
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,880
-This play...
-Where's my stuff?

629
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,420
Yes.

630
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,190
Here.

631
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,340
You're really weird.

632
00:35:05,659 --> 00:35:06,820
If you're stingy,

633
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:09,090
when I want to give you half of the silver, you didn't want it.

634
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:11,179
You only want the recipe and five taels of silver.

635
00:35:11,179 --> 00:35:12,380
If you're not stingy,

636
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,110
when anyone owes you three coins,

637
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,739
you have to get it back no matter where you have to go.

638
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:16,659
My consultation fee

639
00:35:16,659 --> 00:35:17,719
is just five taels.

640
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,980
No more.

641
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,840
No less.

642
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,760
This is my master's recipe.

643
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:23,679
I wonder

644
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:25,920
how it ended up in someone else's hands.

645
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,429
I just like eating this.

646
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,290
You are always mysterious.

647
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:31,480
I can't tell if you know any martial arts.

648
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,940
But you're good at flying.

649
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,260
Who is your master?

650
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,660
Stop studying.

651
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,820
I'm just a lonely ghost.

652
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,320
Li Lianhua.

653
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,880
Are you looking for people of the Jinyuan Alliance?

654
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,410
It's my professional habit.

655
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,330
I was just curious.

656
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:52,860
Besides,

657
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,860
even if I search you thoroughly,

658
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,040
I can't find anything important.

659
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:58,990
Goodbye.

660
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:01,660
Go to Lingshan Taoist Rite

661
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,540
in Jiazhou,

662
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:05,510
you might find the person you're looking for.

663
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:07,790
Lingshan Sect?

664
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,260
Young Master.

665
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,460
Calm down.

666
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,670
We travel in the wide world,

667
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:18,320
it is normal to get our feet wet occasionally.

668
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,940
It's unexpected that

669
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,620
he looks harmless.

670
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,020
Who knows he's an old fox?

671
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:23,930
Young Master,

672
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,820
let's go back to the manor.

673
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,820
Do you remember that Lady said

674
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,180
if you dare to join Baichuan Academy, she will teach you a lesson.

675
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,910
My mother always threatens me.

676
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,980
When did she really teach me a lesson?

677
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,420
Actually, Young Master,

678
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,060
I just found that

679
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,980
all the money we brought out this time

680
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,110
has become invalid.

681
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:42,260
What?

682
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,850
The manager asked us to move out overnight.

683
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:45,850
But you know

684
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,460
we're used to living in the superior room.

685
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,140
We can't sleep on the streets.

686
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:51,720
No.

687
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,850
Since I've made up your mind,

how can I return so easily?

Excuse me,

698

how do I get to Lingshan Sect in Jiazhou?

699
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,660
You're going to Lingshan Sect?

Are you too old?

701
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:37,690
There are many people going to Lingshan.

Go ask them.

Do you know?

704
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,330
I heard that the person the Lingshan Sect is looking for

[Notice]

In my opinion,

if they can find this boy,

709
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:54,940

Young master,

I was born on the sixth day of the fourth month of the lunar year.

Does this look like a lotus mole?

Wangfu.

720

How long haven't you washed your feet?

721
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,940
I think you have a mole in your brain.

722

How can you believe that?

Why are you here?

00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,710
I've been looking for you.

727

Cousin.

728
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,360
Did you see the notice?

729
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,810
It's clearly you.

730
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:31,920
Let's go.

731
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:32,740
Go to Lingshan Sect with me.

732
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,180
Wait.

733
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,120
What cousin? From Lingshan Sect?

734
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,800
Make it clear before we go.

735
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,190
As soon as Lingshan's notice came out,

736
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:44,880
I thought

737
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,870
isn't this Wangfu?

738
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,760
I went to the manor to find you.

739
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,090
But the people in the manor said

740

you and Eldest Young Master ran out.

741

Luckily I met you here.

They have many followers.

That's why it's super rich.

749
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,260
Of course.

750
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,770

752

it's one of the richest.

But followers of the Lingshan Sect can't marry.

00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,980
Now the head of Lingshan Sect

859
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:31,910
has been killed.

860
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:33,780
I can help you solve the case

861
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,320
and help you pass the test of Baichuan Academy

862
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,760
so that your parents have nothing to say.

863
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,960
If I seal these two acupoints,

864
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,980
ordinary people can't unseal them.

865
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:48,630
Don't even think about escaping.

866
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:51,410
As for whether Head Wang was killed,

867
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:52,990
I'll get into it myself.

868
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,120
I don't need you, a talkative

869
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,140
fake miracle-working doctor, to help me.
