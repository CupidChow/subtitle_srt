00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,950
Xiangyi.

5
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,789
Do you think that

6
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,070
what you say is always right,

7
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,070
always the truth,

8
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,520
and Sigu Sect can't survive without you?

9
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,560
Yes.

10
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,640
It has been proven over the years

11
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,980
that all these are true.

12
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,520
Sigu Sect will run normally

13
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,840
regardless of who leaves.

14
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,650
But without Li Xiangyi,

15
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,850
it'll collapse.

16
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,540
Fine.

17
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,860
You've finally said it.

18
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,180
We grew up together since we were young.

19
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,579
When there was food, I couldn't bear to eat them,

20
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:26,850
and I gave all of them to you.

21
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,980
I also gave you the best sword I forged.

22
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:30,980
Deep down,

23
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,260
I value you

24
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,260
more than myself.

25
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,079
But what about you?

26
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,329
Since Sigu Sect only needs you,

27
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,650
I quit.

Sect Leader.

51
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,580
We were ambushed by the Jinyuan Alliance.

52
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,990
Senior's dead body was snatched too.

53
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,000
It was a trick of luring the tiger out of the mountain.

54
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,270
Sigu Sect, listen to my order.

55

From today onwards,

56
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,910
we'll fight the Jinyuan Alliance

57
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,810

Li Lianhua.

59
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,350
Why are you spacing out?

60
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,650
Since I exposed your nonsense,

61
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,780
you don't know how to quibble anymore, do you?

62
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,510
I can't hide anything from you.

63
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,310
Of course.

64
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,909
They are very close.

65
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,690
I'll spare your life today.

66
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,290
Don't spread rumours again.

67
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,390
It's time to go.

68
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,700
Fei knows my uncle.

69
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,830
He must know Li Xiangyi.

70
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,300
Fei is not familiar with Li Xiangyi.

71
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,820
You don't have to ask him.

72
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,370
I don't care about others,

73
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,970
but I must find out about Fei.

74
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,530
He is so bad at martial arts

75
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,460
but so arrogant.

76
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,270
There must be something fishy.

77
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:23,840
Come on.

78
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,410
Let's go to Baichuan Court together.

79
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,340
Why are we going to Baichuan Court?

80
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,380
Counting the murder cases in Cailian Manor,

81
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,140
I've already solved three major cases.

82
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,340
It's time to go to Baichuan Court

83
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,810
for the real detective badge.

84
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,730
If so, you will have Baichuan Court as your partner

85
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,330
when you become a detective.

86
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,030
Congratulations.

87
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,830
Same to you.

88
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,720
You used to be my partner,

89
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,560
and you'll also be the only one in the future.

90
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,420
How about this?

91
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,960
We'll imitate the Sigu Sect

92
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,600
to solve mysterious cases

93
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,140
and rectify the martial arts world.

94
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:50,670
Let's go.

95
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,220
So much money?

96
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,560
Li Lianhua,

97
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,659
did you strike gold

98
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,460
or get a fever?

99
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,000
You're leaving soon.

100
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,340
If you don't prepare well,

101
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,100
you may starve to death on the way.

102
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,760
Take it to buy some solid food.

103
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,360
No need?

104
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,740
Fine, if you don't need it, I can just...

105
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,230
It's a rare opportunity for misers like you to be generous.

106
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,340
I'll go buy food in town right away.

107
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:18,490
By the way,

108
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:19,910
keep an eye on Fei.

109
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,180
I'll investigate him when I come back.

110
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,950
I bought a lot of fresh vegetables.

111
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,400

to stop sulking

Otherwise, things will change."

124
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,440
There's no way I will buy that.

Director Di,

134
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:57,460
you've emptied all the pharmacies nearby, right?

135
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,510
Let's begin.

136
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,490
To practice this technique,

137
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,020
you have to insert silver needles at certain anatomical points

138
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,200
and take herbal medicine to get the poison out of your body.

139
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,960
Director Di,

140
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,410
please meditate and circulate your qi.

141
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,720
I'll perform the acupuncture.

142

Li Xiangyi,

143
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,350
don't play tricks with me when it's related to martial arts.

144
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,080
It's been ten years since we saw each other,

145
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,940
and you've become more vigilant.

146
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,170
Don't worry.

147
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,720
I won't play any tricks.

148
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,700
It would be best.

149
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,940
I've told you

150
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,340
the mantra.

151
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,480
Circulate your inner breath for 49 days,

152
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,840
and the poison of the Xiuluo Grass will be detoxified.

153
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,400
Remember, it's 49 days.

154
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,490
Don't miss even a bit.

155
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,880
Do you hear me?

156
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,150
Director Di.

157
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:14,860
Do you hear me?

158
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:15,910
Director Di.

159
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,520
When should I leave

160
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,810
if not now?

161
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,260
My Lord ordered that

162
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,100
I must make Sect Leader Li stay.

163
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,260
Your Lord just said I can leave.

164
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:48,930
Oh no.

165
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,140
The poisonous grass has backfired on Your Lord.

166
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,600
Go quickly and have a look.

167
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,180
You have recovered just like that?

168
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,020
I didn't realize how quickly 49 days went by.

169
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:15,780
Where are you going?

170
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,050
We're even now.

171
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,120
So I'm leaving.

172
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,340
I promised not to expose your identity.

173
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,350
But do you think you can retire from the martial arts world

174
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,480
and die like a loser?

175
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,700
You're too naive.

176
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,230
Director Di,

177
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,720
why bother forcing me?

178
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,900
All I want is for you to live on

179
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,750
and fight with me again.

180
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,230
Greetings, My Lord.

181
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,710
Medicine Demon.

182
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
I want him to regain his inner power.

183
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:02,670
My Lord,

184
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,980
he is severely injured.

185
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,270
It's not easy to deal with.

186
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,150
Is it not easy,

187
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,480
or are you not competent enough?

188
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:11,860
No, no, no.

189
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,110
My Lord, if you want him to recover,

190
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,330
I'll try my best.

191
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,990
My Lord, please come with me.

192
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:23,300
Let's go.

193
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:24,980
Move.

194
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,620
My Lord,

195
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,680
Hundreds Herbs Syrup

196
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,380
is a treasure I have decocted

197
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,410
with hundreds of exotic herbs for over ten years.

198
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,860
Normally, a cup of it works.

199
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,500
But if you drink too much,

200
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,760
your meridians will overreact and cause unbearable pain.

201
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,080
Drink that.

202
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:57,680
Please.

203
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,870
With his injury,

204
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,370
one cup may not work.

205
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,070
Go on.

206
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,540
It's so bitter.

207
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:43,870
Well...

208
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:45,830
Feed him.

209
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,430
Yes, My Lord.

210
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,310
Please.

211
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:56,910
Thank you.

212
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,980
I'll do it myself.

213
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:14,610
My Lord,

214
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,870
this guy's qi has been disrupted.

215
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,230
His inner power is weak.

216
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:18,760
Well...

217
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,300
Even three cups are of no avail.

218
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,160
His inner power is weak?

219
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:36,090
I'll insert my inner power into his body

220
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,590
to stimulate the drug effect.

221
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:03,460
My Lord.

222
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,810
He will die if you do so.

223
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,440
I told you it's incurable.

224
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,010
It's such a waste of resources

225
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,920
for Director Di to get me all these treasures.

226
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:33,770
Think of another way.

227
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,340
Think of a way.

228
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,950
We can give it a shot at the Spiritual Snake Cave.

229
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,360
Spiritual Snake Cave?

230
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,460
My Lord,

231
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,580
these spiritual flood dragons in the Eastern Sea

232
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,580
have been fed with spiritual medicine for many years.

233
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,930
They like to suck people's qi and feed them again.

234
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,330
Now that this guy's qi is disrupted.

235
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,310
Let's have an exchange transfusion for him.

236
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,610
It might work.

237
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:16,650
Let's try then.

238
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,780
B-Bicha Poison?

239
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:47,830
My Lord.

240
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,800
He was poisoned by Bicha Poison.

241
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:56,920
Useless!

242
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,040
My Lord, please calm down.

243
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,430
If you want him to regain his inner power,

244
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,270
and fight him,

245
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,710
there's another way.

246
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,140
Say it.

247
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,020
Wangchuan Flower.

248
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,590
Wangchuan Flower?

249
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,210
It has the supreme yang.

250
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,670
It can help me break through the eighth level of the Windy Poplar.

251
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,750
But his inner power is not strong.

252
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:18,990
How can it cure him?

253
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,400
My Lord,

254
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,540
Wangchuan Flower has two different types, namely Yin and Yang.

255
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,370
The Yang grass is a kind of martial art, same as you.

256
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,770
While the Yin grass

257
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,900
is the most poisonous grass in the world.

258
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,760
Even if a child takes it,

259
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,810
they can gain more than ten years of martial skills.

260
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,260
But it's like the last radiance of the setting sun.

261
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,540
A few days later,

262
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,870
the Yin grass will start to have a strong effect,

263
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,400
and it will get stronger and stronger.

264
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,140
His meridians will break

265
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,550
and his organs will split.

266
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,710
There is no other way to die more terribly

267
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,980
than it in the world.

268
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,110
I don't want him to live a long life.

269
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,820
I just want him to live on until we fight again.

270
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,460
Let's go.

271
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,300
I want the Wangchuan Flower.

272
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,400
Yes, My Lord.

273
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,220
Why are you laughing?

274
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:17,950
Director Di,

275
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,980
stop wasting your time.

276
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:23,220
It's all for nothing.

277
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,650
So what if you get the Wangchuan Flower?

278
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:28,770
You can force me to eat it,

279
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,700
but you can't force me to fight with you.

280
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,540
By then, I'll lie in front of you

281
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,420
and wait for death under the sun,

282
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,750
seeing you anxious.

283
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,750
It's already interesting even if I just imagine the situation.

284
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,350
Lee Xiangyi.

285
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,900
Don't you want to know

286
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,500
how your senior, Shan Gudao,

287
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,560
died?

288
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,900
The three kings of the Jinyuan Alliance killed my senior.

289
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,390
Yet you want to deny it?

290
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,060
It's written clearly on the mortuary records of the Jinyuan Alliance.

291
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,700
Shan Gudao died because his left chest was stabbed.

292
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,150
Among the three kings, only the King Xunming of Yama used a sword as his weapon.

293
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,300
He made a mistake back then.

294
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,130
I punished him to bind his right hand for a month.

295
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,430
Even if he did attack your senior,

296
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,980
he should have used his left hand.

297
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,510
It's impossible for him to kill your senior with his right hand.

298
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,040
Ten years ago,

299
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,980
we declared a five-year truce.

300
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,940
After that, your senior was killed for no reason.

301
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,110
Then the war between Jinyuan Alliance

302
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,900
and Sigu Sect

303
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,980
started again.

304
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,640
In the end, both of us lost our power

305
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,300
and declined in the martial arts world.

306
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,570
But you and I were not the ones who benefited from it.

307
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,790
If you really want to avenge the death

308
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,590
of tens of Sigu Sect's warriors,

309
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,420
and avenge the death of your senior,

310
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,620
I can help you find out the hidden truth.

311
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,580
As long as you promise

312
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,380
to fight with me again.

313
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,360
Avenge?

314
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,510
If they really want to avenge themselves,

315
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,460
they should take revenge on Li Xiangyi.

316
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,340
Because he was arrogant,

317
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,220
and he killed everyone.

318
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,350
He deserved to die.

319
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,540
And he did die after that.

320
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,420
All the hatred

321
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,340
vanished with Li Xiangyi ten years ago.

322
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:25,720
Director Di,

323
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,330
Li Lianhua

324
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:30,940
won't fight with you.

325
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:36,530
I understand.

326
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,360
You are now a lost soul

327
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,490
although you're alive.

328
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,160
You won't be easily persuaded by me.

329
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,310
Okay.

330
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,620
I'll add some more bets.

331
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,030
If you don't promise me,

332
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,600
I'll kill Shan Gudao's son myself.

333
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,360
Director Di,

334
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,900
please stop joking.

335
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,540
My senior didn't even get married.

336
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,160
How could he have a son?

337
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,710
18 years ago, the Second Young Miss of the Tianji Hall, He Xiaolan,

338
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,840
was in a relationship with Shan Gudao.

339
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,840
This is her farewell letter to Shan Gudao.

340
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,430
[To Shan Gudao]

341
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,250

00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:14,920
My Lord,

513
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,290
I have good news for you.

514
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:20,860
Aren't you looking for the King  Xunming of Yama

515
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,770
and the Four-faced Qingzun?

516
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,690
I sent someone to find some parts

517
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,260
of the map of Prison 188.

518
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,900
The whereabouts of King Xunming of Yama are included.

519
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,130
My Lord, I am so loyal to you,

520
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,940
please spare me this time.

521
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,830
Are you really that loyal?

522
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:44,990
Then tell me

523
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,040
why Li Xiangyi got poisoned by Bicha Poison.

524
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:49,930
How did you...

525
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,930
It doesn't matter how I know about it.

526
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:54,040
What matters is that in the past ten years,

527
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,730
you made me feel that I won the battle at the East Sea.

528
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,630
What matters is that in the past ten years,

529
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,760
you made me become an ignorant person.

530
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,170
Li Xiangyi deserved to die.

531
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,180
In this life,

532
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,740
I hope only My Lord ranks first in the martial arts world.

533
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,400
How do I need to use poison to dominate the world?

534
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:15,690
I wanted to get rid of Li Xiangyi secretly

535
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,400
to solve your problem.

536
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,600
But Li Xiangyi was so ignorant

537
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,550
that he came to steal your thunder.

538
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,840
I know I was wrong.

539
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:31,460
I've been waiting for you in the Jinyuan Alliance for ten years.

540
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,190
Finally, My Lord is back.

541
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,620
Please punish me.

542
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,690
I'll accept it.

543
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,110
I'm willing to accept the punishment.

544
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:40,120
Don't think you can do whatever you want

545
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,650
with ten years of hard work.

546
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,940
I don't care

547
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,160
whether Jinyuan Alliance survives or not.

548
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,000
From now on,

549
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,020
you don't have to investigate the thundering fire bombs anymore.

550
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,060
I have assigned Wuyan to investigate it.

551
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,120
If I find out that it's related to you,

552
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:54,730
I'll kill you.

553
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,260
Fang Duobing!

554
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,140
Are you abandoned again?

555
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,400
Are you hungry?

556
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:38,730
Dig in.

557
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,010
Eat.

558
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,370
Eat slowly.

559
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,490
What were you mumbling about?

560
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,540
I'm hungry.

561
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:02,980
Eat slowly.

562
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,240
Don't get choked.

563
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:27,880
I'm not eating.

564
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,340
You eat.

565
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,500
Why are you staring at me?

566
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,740
It's nothing.

567
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,820
Aren't you more like your mother?

568
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,900
What kind of nonsense is that?

569
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,530
Our butler said

570
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,700
I resemble my second aunt the most.

571
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,760
But when I was born,

572
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:48,690
my second aunt had already died.

573
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,510
You didn't see your uncles many times.

574
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,070
When you were young,

575
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,340
did he dote on you much?

576
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,230
My uncle is the second master of the Sigu Sect.

577
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,440
He was usually very busy.

578
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,900
He didn't have time for me.

579
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,800
Besides, my mother seemed to hate him very much.

580
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,260
She didn't allow me to get close to him.

581
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:18,260
Why do you suddenly ask about my family matter?

582
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:20,460
It's nothing.

583
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,280
I was just asking.

584
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,830
Eat your buns.

585
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,060
Then let me ask you.

586
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,150
You have to answer me honestly.

587
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,469
Who is Fei exactly?

588
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,860
Why is he so skilful in martial arts?

589
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,190
Since we are now at this point,

590
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:40,000
I won't hide it from you anymore.

591
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,290
He's Di Feisheng.

592
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,159
D-Di Feisheng?

593
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:48,100
The devil of the Jinyuan Alliance, Di Feisheng?

594
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:48,560
Well...

595
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,260
Do you know my master

596
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,170
is unaccounted for ten years because of him?

597
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:55,230
How can you hang out with such a devil?

598
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,990
He asked me to promise him to save someone.

599
00:34:58,990 --> 00:34:59,790
Save someone?

600
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,100
You can lie with your medical skills,

601
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,900
but you can't save lives with it.

602
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,400
There are people in this world

603
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,850
who can only be saved by me.

604
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:11,980
Unfortunately,

605
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,700
I don't want to save them.

606
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,180
So you left me behind

607
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:19,120
because you were afraid Di Feisheng would deal with me,

608
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,090
but it turned out that you were caught

609
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,740
and got hurt all over your body.

610
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,400
Li Lianhua,

611
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:23,980
I won't accept your kindness for that.

612
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,850
We agreed that friends should share weal and woe.

613
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:27,850
Even if the opponent is Di Feisheng.

614
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,040
Young Hero Fang,

615
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,540
I know you're good.

616
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,340
It's my fault this time.

617
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,310
Thank you.

618
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,500
At least you have a conscience.

619
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,140
By the way,

620
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,820
don't promise Di Feisheng

621
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,730
to save the person he mentioned.

622
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:43,910
The person he wants to save

623
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,710
is definitely not a good person.

624
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,800
He is indeed not a good person.

625
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,960
I won't save him.

626
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,590
It's more important to save you now.

627
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,450
Di Feisheng has inserted Gang Qi

628
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,360
into your body.

629
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,320
It'll be troublesome.

630
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:00,990
It doesn't matter.

631
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,260
I'm talented.

632
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,960
I felt a little uncomfortable just now.

633
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,560
Look now.

634
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:05,830
I'm fine.

635
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:32,380
I don't have much inner power left.

636
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,190
I almost can't deploy my power to suppress the Gang Qi.

637
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,190
But if Gang Qi reaches his temple,

638
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,080
he will surely die.

639
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,020
This is the only way.

640
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,200
You're awake.

641
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,420
Get up and have some warm water.

642
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,880
Why did I faint again?

643
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,290
You've been inserted Gang Qi.

644
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:02,820
You fainted all of a sudden.

645
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,070
I didn't expect that you are so heavy

646
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,530
that I was exhausted

647
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,880
to carry you back to the Lotus Tower.

648
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:16,470
Practice the skill set according to the papers I put on the table.

649
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,040
Practice it properly.

650
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:28,780
What is this?

651
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:30,230
A draft?

652
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:32,870
A draft?

653
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,410
This is an ancestral skill.

654
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:36,710
Previously,

655
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,000
the Gang Qi inside your body

656
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,390
was suppressed by it.

657
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:40,870
Study hard.

658
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,710
Don't bother me anymore.

659
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,370
It's ancestral?

660
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,480
The ink is not dry yet.

661
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,260
Did you draw it just now?

662
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,450
The ancestral martial arts

663
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,140
must be passed down by word of mouth.

664
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,330
So I drew it for you

665
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:55,630
to make you understand

666
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,600
and learn well.

667
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:57,560
Understand?

668
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,470
I can't simply practice any martial arts for no reason.

669
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,780
If it can't cure the Gang Qi,

670
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,760
and I'm obsessed because of it,

671
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,650
it's not worth it.

672
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:04,740
I won't practice it.

673
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,110
No.

674
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,130
Do you know why Di Feisheng

675
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,830
wanted me to save lives?

676
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:14,940
It's because of this skill set.

677
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,370
If you don't trust me,

678
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,000
or you doubt me, it's fine.

679
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,530
But Di Feisheng's judgment

680
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,800
can't be wrong.

681
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,470
You don't want it?

682
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,930
Fine, if you don't want it, give it to me.

683
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:26,660
Give it to me.

684
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,820
Listen, Fang Xiaobao,

685
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,550
how can you be a detective?

686
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,310
You're such a fool,

687
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:34,860
an idiot.

688
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:35,990
How can you be a detective?

689
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,430
Can't you think about

690
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,850
why Di Feisheng

691
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,750
used you to threaten me to save others?

692
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:43,350
If the Gang Qi in your body is getting more serious,

693
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,990
you'll fall into his trap

694
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,150
because you have to listen to him.

695
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,480
What should you do then?

696
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,000
That devil keeps killing people

697
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,860
and keeps doing evil.

698
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,120
Don't you feel guilty?

699
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,510
-Do you want to practice it or not?
-Fine.

700
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,180
I will practice it.

701
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,050
You're talking too much.

702
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:56,710
I won't let the devil succeed.

703
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:57,960
Remember.

704
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,200
If I

705
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,010
go crazy,

706
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:01,660
foam at the mouth

707
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,060
and dance uncontrollably after practising it,

708
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,270
do remember to find me a physician from the town.

709
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,000
Don't worry.

710
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,410
I'll get you any expensive medicine if you need it.

711
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:10,710
Practice hard.

712
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,300
Fine.

713
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,660
After all, you've called Li Xiangyi

714
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,320
your master for so many years.

715
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,690
I'll pass this Yangzhouman to you.

716
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:48,840
It's a way to repay his promise to you.

717
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,320
What are you doing?

718
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,280
Are you sleepwalking at night?

719
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:20,940
Li Lianhua,

720
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,460
where did you get that skill set?

721
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,580
Didn't I tell you?

722
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,500
It's ancestral.

723
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,230
Impossible.

724
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:28,560
The skill set is profound and mysterious.

725
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,560
It's very useful.

726
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,580
Even Tianji Hall's Mind-reading Skills

727
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,710
can't compare to it.

728
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,830
If it's really ancestral,

729
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:38,540
there must have been many high-skilled warriors coming from your family.

730
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,100
Tell me.

731
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,830
Where did you get it?

732
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:42,590
Let go of me!

733
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:43,860
No manners.

734
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,050
Fine.

735
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,950
One year, I went to the mountain to collect herbs.

736
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,400
Unfortunately, I fell off the cliff.

737
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,890
Suddenly, in front of a cave,

738
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,720
a fairy godmother appeared.

739
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,980
She asked me to kowtow thrice to her

740
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:02,240
and passed me the set of skills.

741
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:04,410
After thinking about it,

742
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,820
I realised that was a legendary immortal fate.

743
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:09,430
Bah!

744
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,380
How can there be like the pie in the sky?

745
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,280
Didn't I tell you?

746
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,410
It's all fate.

747
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:15,550
Tell me

748
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,840
what the name of the skill set is.

749
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,190
That's amazing.

750
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,590
It's almost the same as Yangzhouman.

751
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:22,590
It's Suzhoukuai.

752
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,860
I'm not buying that.

753
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,480
You know what?

754
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,460
You asked me to tell you, but you don't believe me after I told you.

755
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,620
Then explain to me

756
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:33,080
why I, a physician who sells plasters,

757
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,860
can get the ultimate skill set.

758
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,380
If I were born good at martial arts,

759
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,170
I would have become a hero.

760
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,230
Unfortunately,

761
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,780
we have different fates.

762
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,130
I can only be a wandering physician.

763
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,540
Unlike someone,

764
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,810
who's going to be a master soon.

765
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:55,480
All right.

766
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,010
I owe you this time.

767
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,680
It's okay if you don't know martial arts.

768
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,880
It's the same if I can.

769
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:06,580
After we get out of here, I'll take care of you

770
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,500
and protect you.

771
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,250
No matter what happens, just mention my name.

772
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,310
Most importantly,

773
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,110
I kowtowed three times

774
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,710
to get the skill set.

775
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:16,900
So you also have to kowtow thrice to me

776
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,430
so that I can feel better.

777
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:21,280
Dream on.

778
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,540
Except for my parents,

779
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,390
I'll only kowtow to my master, Li Xiangyi.

780
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:25,150
Who are you?

781
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,580
Your Suzhoukuai

782
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,900
is definitely not as good as my master's Yangzhouman.

783
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,270
Take your time.

784
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,500
Li Lianhua,

785
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,470
why don't you tell me more

786
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:34,470
about my master?

787
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:35,580
You said too little last time.

788
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,460
I haven't heard enough yet.

789
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,950
Don't you feel hot

790
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,180
and chest tightness?

791
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:40,310
No.

792
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:42,930
The crucial part of Suzhoukuai is silence.

793
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,950
Most importantly, talk less

794
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:45,680
and be quiet.

795
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,440
When you talk, you'll spend your energy and cause blood flow.

796
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,170
It'll boom like a firecracker.

797
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,270
It's up to you.
