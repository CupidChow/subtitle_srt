[Episode 38]

4
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:43,900
It's no use coughing.

5
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,820
Didn't I tell you?

6
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,550
You'll only get a bowl of porridge every two days.

7
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,100
My dear boy, I'm not coughing.

8
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,440
I'm not hungry either.

9
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,620
I'm angry.

10
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,740
The other day, that Shan fellow came to quarrel with me.

11
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,180
I didn't stand up to him well.

12
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,810
Call him over now.

13
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,100
I'll argue with him properly again.

14
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,660
I can't believe you take quarreling that seriously.

15
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,220
I wonder why Master is even keeping

16
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,260
a blind fool like you alive.

17
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:07,980
Stop thinking about it.

18
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,580
Shan went down the mountain long ago.

19
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,910
Went down the mountain?

20
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,660
So we're currently staying

21
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,860
on this mountain huh?

22
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,860
Isn't it quite inconvenient for you to go down the mountain

23
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,120
to enter the city then?

24
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,950
If only we could enter the city.

25
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,960
Ruyi City is more than a dozen li away.

26
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,900
Just going out to buy groceries will take a day of walking.

27
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,380
Ruyi City is more than a dozen li away.

28
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,630
That is some distance away.

29
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,680
Forget it then.

30
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,470
Looks like I won't be able to

31
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,180
quarrel with Shan.

32
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,060
Why am I not locked up

33
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,120
with other people?

34
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,260
You mean you won't be bored if there's someone else to quarrel with?

35
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,780
There is someone else besides you.

36
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,140
But he's being confined in Master's room.

37
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,740
Master treats him differently,

38
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,140
and visits him every day.

39
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,190
Master doesn't allow us to talk about him.

40
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,320
-Palace Commander.
-Palace Commander.
-Palace Commander.

41
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,320
Palace Commander.

42
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,500
His Majesty has never missed the morning court assembly.

43
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,300
We would like to see His Majesty.

44
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,780
You are by His Majesty's side every day.

45
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,380
How is His Majesty's health?

46
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,940
I have something important to report to His Majesty.

47
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,060
I request to see His Majesty.

48
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,970
Please let His Majesty know.

49
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,160
-We request to see His Majesty.
-Guards!

50
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:25,790
What are you doing?

51
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,000
What are you doing?

52
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,630
Palace Commander!

53
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,690
What are you doing?

54
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:30,410
Palace Commander!

55
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,420
Why are you doing this?

56
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,950
Are you intending to rebel?

57
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,540
What?

58
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,980
Xuanyuan Xiao dared to arrest high-ranking officials?

59
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,780
The Minister of War,

60
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,820
the Minister of Rites,

61
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,380
on top of the Minister of Revenue, Lord Fang previously.

62
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,420
only the Minister of Industry is left in the six ministries.

63
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,260
Lord Xuanyuan also issued a verbal instruction from His Majesty,

64
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,540
saying that New Year's Eve is coming.

65
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,380
This year's Sacrifice to Heaven will be changed to a Nuo Sacrifice Ceremony,

66
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,940
and will be moved to Zhurong Hall at the suburbs of the capital.

67
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,500
They want to make it extravagant.

68
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,230
Impossible.

69
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,690
The Nuo Sacrifice Ceremony is overly extravagant,

70
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:00,570
and will cost a lot of money.

71
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,940
It's already been abolished for a hundred years.

72
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,740
Father will never make such a decision.

73
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,860
I'm going to see Father now.

74
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,640
Did you hear that His Majesty is ill?

75
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,900
He can't come into contact with the wind.

76
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,390
So he's been staying in his sleeping chamber.

77
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,040
The Imperial City Division is guarding the door too.

78
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,280
No one is allowed in.

79
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,220
There must be something wrong with Xuanyuan Xiao.

80
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,750
Even if I have to take a risk,

81
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:19,010
I must see Father.

82
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,910
Li Lianhua gave me a lot of useful things previously.

83
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,820
I'm sure they'll come in handy.

84
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:30,560
[Yi'an Hall]

85
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:30,750
His Majesty gave the order that

86
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,590
he won't see anyone.

87
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,710
I must see him.

88
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:41,659
Father!

89
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:44,810
Father!

90
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,409
Father, what's wrong?

91
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,990
From three days ago,

92
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,170
I've been weak and couldn't get up.

93
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,280
Xuanyuan Xiao brought the imperial physician to see me.

94
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,740
They said my energy is depleted and I'm weak, and I need to rest.

95
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,430
I didn't believe it,

96
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,500
and I tested myself with a silver needle.

97
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,120
It looks like I have symptoms of poisoning.

98
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,120
This Xuanyuan Xiao is so audacious.

99
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,480
Father, what should we do?

100
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:10,360
Now Xuanyuan Xiao is no longer Xuanyuan Xiao.

101
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,340
Strange things are happening in the palace.

102
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,200
Something big will be happening.

103
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,540
The princess is disrupting His Majesty's quiet rest.

104
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,290
Take her back to Zhaohua Hall and watch her closely.

105
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,490
Without my order, she is not to come out.

106
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,450
You...

107
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,130
Father.

108
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:34,900
-Donâ€™t be afraid.
-Father.

109
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,600
Don't be afraid.

110
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,360
Father!

111
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,850
The smell of the medicine in this porridge is so strong.

112
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,100
How am I supposed to eat it?

113
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,900
The medicine is being served as porridge.

114
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,470
Looks like the cook today

115
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,960
has been changed to a medicine peddler.

116
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,220
Li Xiangyi.

117
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,050
You lost your sight,

118
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,080
but your sense of smell is still pretty sharp.

119
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,659
So it's Gang Leader Jiao we have here.

120
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,440
Sect Leader Li.

121
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,060
You were so powerful back then.

122
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,220
Looking at you now,

123
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,550
you must have suffered much

124
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,650
over these past few years.

125
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,140
How much I've suffered,

126
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,540
shouldn't your spies know

127
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,580
even better than me?

128
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,050
Li Xiangyi.

129
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,130
You should know the reason

130
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,410
why I'm not killing you.

131
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:09,010
It doesn't matter if Li Lianhua is dead or alive.

132
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,490
But for Li Xiangyi,

133
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,990
that's not the case.

134
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:17,060
I'm here today to tell you two pieces of good news.

135
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:28,970
Have a feel.

136
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:43,090
These clothes aren't made too well.

137
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,270
But I think it should suit you quite well.

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,480
This is a piece of armor.

139
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,930
This is made exactly according to

140
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,159
what the powerful Li Xiangyi wore on the day

141
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,020
Sigu Sect was first founded.

142
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,480
I'm gifting it to you.

143
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,140
You don't have to give it to me.

144
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,930
You should give it to Shan Gudao.

145
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,450
This is what he asked me to make for you.

146
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,510
On the day he succeeds in his plan,

147
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,090
he wants you to wear this armor

148
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,250
and kneel respectfully at his feet.

149
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,010
Then he will be disappointed.

150
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,690
I can't see clearly now.

151
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,010
No matter how glorious he looks, I won't be able to see it.

152
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,340
No wonder Shan Gudao hates you so much.

153
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,799
You have a glib tongue.

154
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,659
But look at you now.

155
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,559
What's the use of having a glib tongue?

156
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,290
I guess you can use it to drink wine.

157
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,920
Let's talk about the second piece of good news.

158
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,380
Let me guess.

159
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:57,960
Could it be...

160
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,560
a wedding toast?

161
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,210
Bingo.

162
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,410
This is a toast for the lord and I's wedding.

163
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,800
You must drink it.

164
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,800
I don't know if Director Di is happy about this though.

165
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,810
Director Di's taste

166
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,770
has become like this now?

167
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,490
What do you know?

168
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,880
I'm gifting him the world as dowry,

169
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,520
and giving him my heart.

170
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,400
Isn't he satisfied?

171
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,510
So you want the world too.

172
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,530
Bingo again.

173
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,990
I think

174
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,400
no one is your match now.

175
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,740
It's not that you can't do it. You're just tired of it.

176
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,770
So now you want to take the throne.

177
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,510
I was originally a Nanyin royal.

178
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,650
Why can't I be the emperor?

179
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,200
Why can't I do

180
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,180
what those men can do?

181
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,540
But there is only one throne.

182
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,520
It seems that you are not on the same side as Shan Gudao.

183
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,820
Of course the throne belongs to me.

184
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,010
What about Di Feisheng?

185
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,390
Don't tell me...

186
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,250
you want him to be the empress?

187
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:18,520
Empress?

188
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,690
Li Xiangyi.

189
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,470
You're getting more interesting now.

190
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,590
How about... I marry you too?

191
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,720
What do you think?

192
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,190
But three days later

193
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,280
will be my wedding day with Di Feisheng.

194
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,680
I need you to officiate our marriage for me.

195
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,240
Don't be jealous.

196
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,600
When I become the emperor,

197
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,990
you'll have the chance to humor me.

198
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,410
Are you that sure

199
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,350
you'll be the one to win in the end?

200
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:02,500
Since Shan Gudao has the mother bug of the Karmic Bug,

201
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,160
he thinks he's guaranteed to win,

202
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,890
and has nothing to worry about.

203
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,120
He doesn't even know that I can destroy

204
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,030
that mother bug easily.

205
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:22,060
Talking to you is so dangerous.

206
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,110
Earlier I was careless,

207
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,540
and you made me spill so many secrets.

208
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,310
You don't believe I'll kill you?

209
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,460
If I die,

210
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,610
who else will attend your wedding with Di Feisheng?

211
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,460
I'm afraid no one will sing congratulatory songs for you.

212
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,740
It's not very appropriate for a wedding to be

213
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,000
quiet and empty, is it?

214
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,830
Li Xiangyi, good for you.

215
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,980
Let's wait and see.

216
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,440
Oh Di Feisheng...

217
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,870
Having the affection of someone like her is really dangerous.

218
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,630
I work for the Imperial City Division.

219
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,940
Why won't you let me enter the inner palace?

220
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,580
Lord Yang.

221
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,160
This is the Emperor's order conveyed by the Palace Commander.

222
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,300
Without His Majesty's special permission,

223
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,040
no one can enter the inner palace.

224
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,900
Please go back.

225
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,200
I want to go out.

226
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,700
Let me out!

227
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,190
I'm just going out for a walk.

228
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,460
Say something!

229
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,180
Let me out!

230
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,620
Don't!

231
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,050
Father is sick in bed.

232
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,530
But yet I can't even see him.

233
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,100
You people from the Imperial City Division are such bullies!

234
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,820
All the court officials are either arrested by you,

235
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,620
or chased out.

236
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,290
All the important officials in the capital

237
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,870
and the generals' families have been arrested.

238
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,070
What else do you want?

239
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,510
Master!

240
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:25,880
Master.

241
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:26,940
What's wrong?

242
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,350
You've been bewitched by them.

243
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,310
It's the Karmic Bug.

244
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,000
Master, you've been loyal all your life.

245
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,600
How could they do this to you?

246
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,590
Master.

247
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,740
Go find Li Xiangyi.

248
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,860
Save His Majesty.

249
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,750
Go, quickly!

250
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,290
Master!

251
00:13:59,180 --> 00:13:59,870
Go!

252
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,390
Quickly!

253
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,490
I want to eat.

254
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:37,920
It's not two days yet.

255
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,140
What are you yelling about?

256
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,800
Even if it's not two days yet, I should still eat.

257
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:42,820
Why?

258
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:43,930
You ask why?

259
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,570
My dear boy,

260
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,020
you're not being very loyal here.

261
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,890
I helped you to make a contribution.

262
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,450
Aren't you going to feed me in return?

263
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,540
You agree to wear that armor?

264
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,400
Yes.

265
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,440
Your master is so beautiful.

266
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,950
She'll be angry if I don't wear it.

267
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,060
You are indeed thirsting for

268
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,190
my master's beauty.

269
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,940
I still thought you were a man of integrity.

270
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,670
Hey, watch what you're saying.

271
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,040
I wonder how your master

272
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,950
is treating this Di Feisheng.

273
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,170
What else, Master cut his tendons and tied him up.

274
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,370
He can't go anywhere.

275
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,440
Di Feisheng used to kill countless people.

276
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,640
But now he's only my master's prisoner.

277
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:35,580
Eat up.

278
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,170
Smells good.

279
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:40,930
Let's not be in a hurry,

280
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,460
I'll have a few bites first.

281
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,390
Not that I want to criticize you,

282
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,860
but you two are so bad at making your master happy.

283
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,450
If you call her here directly,

284
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,170
how can you show your ability?

285
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,310
If you call her after

286
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,550
I put on this armor,

287
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,080
this will all be your work.

288
00:15:59,190 --> 00:15:59,840
Right?

289
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,970
Sorry, kids.

290
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,590
Have a good rest for now.

291
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,810
I need to go save an old friend.

292
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,420
So Jiao Liqiao's residence is here.

293
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,190
Are you having a good day today,

294
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:39,680
my dear lord?

295
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:41,910
Look.

296
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,960
This is how I looked the first time you saw me.

297
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,030
Do you remember?

298
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:52,550
The day after tomorrow is our wedding day.

299
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:53,720
Are you happy?

300
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,720
After the wedding,

301
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:07,579
I'll officially call you my husband.

302
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,220
Shouldn't you also change your stance,

303
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,140
and say you love me?

304
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,290
Don't worry.

305
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,220
As long as you say it to me,

306
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:20,760
I'll let you go.

307
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,440
This hot spring aids blood circulation.

308
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,690
The wounds on your body can't heal at all.

309
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,510
My heart aches seeing it too.

310
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,740
It must hurt so much.

311
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,380
You're still so shy.

312
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,460
You won't even open your eyes to look at me.

313
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,550
I can only play the old game we've been playing these few days.

314
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,850
If you don't answer,

315
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,490
I'll pretend to be angry

316
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,650
and give you a fierce stab.

317
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,220
Here we go.

318
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,040
Di Feisheng.

319
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,420
Do you love me?

320
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,450
Do you love me?

321
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,180
Do you?

322
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:22,660
Forget it.

323
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,750
We should change how we play this game.

324
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:35,030
Do you know Li Xiangyi is also locked here?

325
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,970
I knew you would be concerned

326
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,330
after hearing his name.

327
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,370
I will...

328
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,650
grant you death.

329
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:10,290
I can't believe you're doing this to me.

330
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,170
All the tendons in your limbs are severed.

331
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,300
You have no strength.

332
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,100
Yet you only think of killing me.

333
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,180
Granting me death...

334
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,780
Do you want me to die so badly?

335
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,500
Our wedding will happen the day after tomorrow.

336
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,190
After we exchange our vows,

337
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,070
even if you become a human swine,

338
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:36,000
you'll still be my husband.

339
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,800
Forever,

340
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,560
my husband.

341
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,290
Does this look good?

342
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:02,580
Li Xiangyi.

343
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,640
Of course Beauty Jiao looks good.

344
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,200
You can have her if you like.

345
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,940
But...

346
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,670
you don't look too good.

347
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,720
Don't tell me you're here

348
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,120
to say all this nonsense.

349
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,500
You're saving me unconditionally.

350
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,550
Aren't you afraid I'll attack you again after escaping?

351
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,350
Director Di.

352
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,780
Saying harsh things without meaning it,

353
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,840
you'd better save it for Jiao Liqiao.

354
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,380
Iâ€™ve been to Di Fortress.

355
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,310
You're working with Shan Gudao

356
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,510
only because you want to steal the Rama Vessel

357
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,340
to cure yourself of the mind control techniques.

358
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,760
But looking at you now...

359
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,150
I've always been a kind person,

360
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,180
and I deeply empathize with you.

361
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,310
Aren't you the same?

362
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,730
I asked Wuyan to look for you,

363
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,390
but you were captured and brought here.

364
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:14,220
Looks like Shan Gudao got his way.

365
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,640
Since both of us are in such a situation now,

366
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,570
let's save the spite at each other.

367
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,380
I killed the child bug of the Karmic Bug

368
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,070
using the snow salt that Wuyan gave.

369
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,330
But I didn't think that

370
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,490
Shan Gudao got the mother bug instead.

371
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,420
Let's not waste any more time talking,

372
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,820
and get out of here first.

373
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,450
Let's hide for a while first.

374
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,420
Hide where?

375
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,970
The most dangerous place is the safest place.

376
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,960
The newlywed room.

377
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:56,980
Newlywed room?

378
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,110
Your newlywed room.

379
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,900
Bad news!

380
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,540
The man Master caught has escaped.

381
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:08,980
Hurry!

382
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,240
Block all the exits!

383
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:11,350
After them!

384
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,060
You're starting to practice already?

385
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,790
There's no need for such a rush.

386
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:36,270
I'm rebuilding my meridians.

387
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,220
Looks like I underestimated

388
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,430
your Windy Poplar.

389
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:43,120
Your Yangzhouman is proper and long-lasting,

390
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,060
but Windy Poplar seeks survival in dangerous situations.

391
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,790
We have different approaches.

392
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,210
When Jiao Liqiao got rid of my martial skills,

393
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,940
the Windy Poplar protected me,

394
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,930
and locked my internal power within my Sea of Qi.

395
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,810
That's why I still have a chance to try.

396
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,300
No wonder you could survive

397
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,880
after the battle at the East Sea.

398
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,240
My injury back then

399
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,280
was not as serious as it is now.

400
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,400
What about now?

401
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,850
It'll depend on my luck.

402
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,680
Odds of one to nine.

403
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,480
There's a 9 out of 10 probability

404
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,220
that I'll die.

405
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,540
If you die,

406
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,620
it would be a waste of me saving you.

407
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:24,670
Fine, whatever.

408
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,270
Treat it as me owing you a favor.

409
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:26,750
Fine.

410

00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,480
you are so lucky.

You've won even though it was a 1-in-10 chance.

Congratulations.

You helped me just now.

I will pay you back.

I don't like to be indebted to people.

428
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,780
Don't say all this about paying back and what not,

429
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,910
it's tiring to hear.

I'm most afraid of returning favors.

If you really want to repay me,

don't ever challenge me to a fight in the future.

434

I don't need you to teach me how to repay you.

435

It seems to be today.

00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:22,920
You won't be able to escape.

508
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,110
Director Di,

509
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,880
of all people to provoke,

510
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,350
you chose to provoke her.

511
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,840
Even if you want to leave, it's hard.

512
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,550
Li Lianhua.

513
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,930
Do you think you don't have your share of traps here?

514
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,280
Look who this is.

515
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,590
Biqiu was the one who designed this formation for me.

516
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,900
What do you think?

517
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,310
The number one trap master of Sigu Sect.

518
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,320
Even Tianji Hall never had

519
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,930
such an entertaining trap formation.

520
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,060
Biqiu,

521
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,380
I like it very much.

522
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:03,820
Li Lianhua.

523
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,640
What a coincidence.

524
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,990
It was Yun Biqiu who brought you here

525
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,990
from Lotus Tower.

526
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:12,200
Now he will also help me to keep you from leaving.

527
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,790
Ten years ago,

528
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:16,490
it was him who used a cup of Bicha

529
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,340
to turn Li Xiangyi into Li Lianhua.

530
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:22,010
Now it'll also be him

531
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:26,180
to turn Li Lianhua into a lonely wandering ghost.

532
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,190
Saintess!

533
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:34,720
Saintess.

534
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:35,730
Bad news.

535
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,530
Qiao Wanmian and Fo, Bi, Bai, Shi

536
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,820
have led a large group of Sigu Sect disciples

537
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,020
and are already at the foot of the mountain.

538
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,500
What are you nervous about?

539
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,140
Biqiu.

540
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:47,450
Activate all the traps on the mountain,

541
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,220
and have them all come up to die.

542
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:57,730
Let's go.

543
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,460
Di Feisheng.

544
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,610
At this point,

545
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:06,430
you will need to choose between two options.

546
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,320
Will you choose to be my husband,

547
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,540
or to be a ghost with Li Xiangyi?

548
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,610
You'll be the one to be a ghost.

549
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:28,500
Director Di.

550
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,390
You really don't know how to treat ladies well.

551
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,890
Gang Leader Jiao is trying so hard to keep you,

552
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:35,420
but you're still so fierce.

553
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,140
You mean you know how to treat ladies well?

554
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:37,940
Go ahead then.

555
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,130
I dare not.

556
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:41,520
Di Feisheng.

557
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,920
You asked for it.

558
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,290
Don't touch it.

559
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,270
I caught him again.

560
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:15,990
Why don't we let him

561
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,940
stay enclosed in this metal tower,

562
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,780
so that I can control him forever?

563
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,820
It's not a bad idea

564
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:23,360
to let him be a zombie that won't budge.

565
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,420
Beauty Jiao.

566
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,580
You're joking around again.

567
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:30,800
This poisonous smoke has no effect on you.

568
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:33,190
I got away from the Bicha Poison already.

569
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,760
Other poisons

570
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:37,530
are nothing to me.

571
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:50,070
I thought this Bicha Poison couldn't do anything to you.

572
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,240
But you're just a paper tiger.

573
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,660
Then hurry up and die

574
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,560
to liven things up for me.

575
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,050
What's going on?

576
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,800
Sigu Sect is approaching fiercely.

577
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,780
The trap formations are all activated.

578
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,659
How did they get in?

579
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:16,520
We can't stop them at all.

580
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,290
You may leave.

581
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:17,659
Yes.

582
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,190
Useless!

583
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:35,260
You don't have the upper hand anymore.

584
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,230
Where is Li Lianhua?

585
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,960
Li Lianhua is waiting for you in the netherworld.

586
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:08,970
You still want to activate the traps?

587
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:09,960
It's too late.

588
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,040
Li Lianhua!

589
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:20,970
Li Lianhua!

590
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:23,690
The bullets are poisonous.

591
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:24,690
Don't touch them!

592
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:30,710
Jiao Liqiao.

593
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,230
Your Yulongniuma Gang has been wiped out.

594
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,890
Your plan has failed already.

595
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,710
Just give up.

596
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,700
Then I'll destroy this mountain

597
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,360
and let everyone die with me.

598
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,940
But Li Xiangyi,

599
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:46,060
you must die in my hands today.

600
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:51,310
[Freezing Sky and Closed Earth]

601
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,000
The mechanism is at the southeast of the mountain peak.

602
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,480
Seven-Dipper Formation is in the east,

603
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,990
and the Nine Changes of Heaven and Earth is in the west.

604
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,960
The mechanism's axis cuts through north to south.

605
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,690
In this case,

606
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,780
every section should have a trigger mechanism.

607
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,210
Eight steps east from the north corner of the building behind,

608
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,390
ten inches below the wall.

609
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:20,100
That's the weak point of all the traps.

610
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,270
We can destroy the traps by hitting that point.

611
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,070
Take Shaoshi!

612
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,560

I know.

614
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,180
It's all your fault.

615
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,900
Li Xiangyi!

616
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,240
If I kill you...

617
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:09,030
If I kill you, no one else will

618
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,120
to get in the way of our relationship.

619
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:16,770
Leave first,

620
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,750
and leave things here to me.

621
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,060
I hate you.

622
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,800
Because you are hateful.

623
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:37,150
It has nothing to do with others.

624
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,460
Fine.

625
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,590
Since I can't keep you,

626
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,780
let's die together.

627

I don't kill women.

628
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:09,920
But you

629
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,880
are an exception.

Xiaobao.

631
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,660
You destroyed this trap, right?

632
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,370
Strange.

633
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,060
All the traps we encountered along the way,

634
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,830
all of the weak points are exposed.

635
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:13,630
It's obvious.

636
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:14,910
Logically speaking,

637
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:16,210
everyone who knows how to design traps

638
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:18,500
know that the mechanism should be hidden.

639
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,760
And this mechanism...

640
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,110
someone deliberately

641
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,290
wants to show it to others.

642
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,510
That's right.

643
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:26,950
Could it be...

00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:33,710
I'm fine.

Shan Gudao is controlling my master with the Karmic Bug.

He has the palace under his control.

665

00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,860
I told you the method behind

679
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,790
Windy Poplar's internal power.

680
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:02,480
Although I can't let you go back to how you used to be,

681
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,390
it can still temporarily protect your stamina and pulse.

682
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:05,990
Thank you.

683
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:11,200
â™«I'll fight with my swordâ™«

684
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:10,460
Director Di.

685
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:11,900
I didn't expect that...

686
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:14,860
â™«I enjoy the spring breeze against my swordâ™«

687
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:14,070
you would stay and help us this time.

688
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,460
I was right about you.

689
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:19,770
â™«Stop the carriage in the night forestâ™«

690
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,360
Iâ€™m not interested in helping others.

691
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,940
I just donâ€™t want Li Xiangyi to die here.

692
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:23,670
â™«Headed to Jiangnan on a lonely boatâ™«

693
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:27,470
Ten years ago, during the battle between Sigu Sect and Jinyuan Alliance,

694
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:28,330
â™«Yesterday I lit a lamp to light the four cornersâ™«

695
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,130
both sides suffered terrible losses.

696
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,140
â™«It doesn't dampen the noiseâ™«

697
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:31,980
Ten years later,

698
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,980
we are fighting together.

699
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,960
â™«Today we speak nonsense for ten yearsâ™«

700
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,070
Life is really interesting.

701
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:38,570
Of course I want the person behind the mess back then,

702
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:41,180
â™«Floating like flowers and grassâ™«

703
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:40,100
to pay with their blood.

704
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,500
â™«Every word and phraseâ™«

705
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,750
â™«Have the rules of the martial worldâ™«

706
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,290
â™«I thought making a name for myselfâ™«

707
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:50,240
â™«Was easyâ™«

708
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:54,490
â™«Grit your teeth and live onâ™«

709
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:58,730
â™«I must be invincible tomorrowâ™«

710
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,180
â™«The green mountains beyond, and the towers afarâ™«

711
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:07,370
â™«Cannot be compared to the birds singing in the willow treesâ™«

712
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:11,950
â™«A song on the spring river of the moonlit nightâ™«

713
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:16,390
â™«Discussing swordplay over wine deep in the bamboo forestâ™«

714
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:20,620
â™«Raise a toast to drown our deep sorrowsâ™«

715
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,470
â™«All our martial reputation are swept away with the oceanâ™«
