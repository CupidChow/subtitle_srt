00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Kissing myself thousands of times

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The most reluctant moment is that moment

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Live in the world, travel thousands of miles

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who doesn't wander around

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds and the moon on the cliff

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Live in the world, young love stories

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The whole world is drunk in sorrow

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The journey to the end of the world is like a dream

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Live in the world, travel thousands of miles

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Who doesn't wander around

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds and the moon on the cliff

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Live in the world, young love stories

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The whole world is drunk in sorrow

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000

Episode 16

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Let's go.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What are you thinking about?

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Since no one went out all night,

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
the murderer and the body

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
may not have left at all.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The King of Blaze

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Li'er.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What?

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Li'er, why is there such a big red candle here?

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
These are all ordered by the Second Hall Leader.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The Second Hall Leader likes to be in the

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
room with a warm atmosphere.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So he specially ordered these big red candles.

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
There are more in the cabinet.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You take a look.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
There's none.

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
They're all burnt out.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's just a night of wedding.

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
How can it be burnt so quickly?

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Look at this.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
There's something inside.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What's this?

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This is a piece of red jade bed.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
My mother got some good red jade from the shop a few years ago.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
She made us a bed.

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's good for the winter and summer.

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Red jade bed.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This isn't red jade.

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It is.

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The red jade in the cabinet disappeared.

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The red jade on the table is short and not even.

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It seems that someone broke the bed

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and melted the red jade in the room

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and covered it.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It seems that the broken pieces of red jade

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
have been scattered in every corner of the house.

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
If I'm not wrong,

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
the body is hidden under the red jade bed.

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Why is it a female corpse?

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Judging from the hairstyle and dressing,

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
it should be a maid from Tianji Villa.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
This...

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
This seems to be E'yue.

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
E'yue?

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
How come I don't know her?

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
E'yue just came recently.

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
He didn't come home and we don't know each other.

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
He came recently?

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
On his back!

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
There's a tear on his neck.

69
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The neck is broken.

70
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's a secret wound.

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Such a fine tear

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
means that this thing is strong

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
and can kill people.

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
But in this house,

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
there's no such thing in Tianji Villa.

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
There's no such thing in Tianji Villa.

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
This is a weapon.

78
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It seems that this woman came prepared.

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This murderer used E'yue's own thing

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
to kill her.

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm afraid that she wanted to kill people,

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
but she turned against them.

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But in this house,

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
there were only Master Wei and Master Wei Qing.

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Unless someone

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
knew about your sight

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and broke in last night,

88
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
otherwise,

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
it's only possible that

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Xinlan wouldn't have died.

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Xinlan didn't die at all.

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
She planned all this.

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
She deliberately put the same pattern

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
on the murderer's back

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
and pretended to be killed.

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Then she escaped.

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Look.

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
There are nine characters here.

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
How could there be nine characters here?

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Someone put it here on purpose?

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It means that

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
the murderer

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
is not the murderer.

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It means that

105
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
the murderer is not the murderer.

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It also means that

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Wei Qingchou knew that

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
there was something wrong with the wine,

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
but she didn't tell him.

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's possible that the medicine in the wine

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
was made by E'yue.

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
E'yue took the secret weapon

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
and went into the new house

114
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
to kill Wei Qingchou.

115
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But she didn't expect that

116
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
she was killed by Wei Qingchou.

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But I've been waiting outside.

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
How did E'yue get in?

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
If I'm not wrong,

120
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
there are many people

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
who come to the wedding night.

122
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
There are many people who come to the wedding night.

123
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Maybe E'yue

124
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
never left the new house

125
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
before.

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
E'yue was in the room first

127
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
and put the medicine in the wine.

128
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Then she attacked Wei Qingchou.

129
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But Wei Qingchou found Duan Ning

130
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
after she returned to the room.

131
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So she pretended to drink the wine

132
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
and prepared to save her.

133
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Then she killed E'yue.

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I was thinking

135
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
if the fighter

136
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
hit the bookshelf,

137
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
shouldn't the bookshelf

138
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
fall down

139
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
with the mirror?

140
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Why did the first two

141
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
fall down

142
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
so steadily

143
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
except for the mirror?

144
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You mean

145
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
the mirror

146
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
was used by Wei Qingchou

147
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
to kill E'yue?

148
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Wei Qingchou

149
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
put Miss He on the bed

150
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and tried to kill her.

151
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But she didn't succeed.

152
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
After Miss He

153
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
was on the bed,

154
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
she pretended to use the mirror

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
to clean up.

156
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
E'yue thought

157
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Wei Qingchou had been

158
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
poisoned with the medicine in the wine.

159
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So she was going to do it.

160
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But Wei Qingchou

161
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
had already found

162
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
E'yue's will.

163
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So the mirror

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
was used by Wei Qingchou

165
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
to kill E'yue.

166
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But...

167
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But what?

168
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The traces of the body

169
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
are very clear.

170
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It seems to be a trick.

171
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It proves that

172
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
the murderer

173
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
is not bad at martial arts.

174
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Zhai,

175
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
are you sure

176
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Wei Qingchou's martial arts are bad?

177
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I've tried her martial arts.

178
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I've tried her martial arts.

179
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I've tried her martial arts.

180
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I've tried her martial arts.

181
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I've tried her martial arts.

182
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I've tried her martial arts.

183
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I've tried her martial arts.

184
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
She's good at moves.

185
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
She's good at moves.

186
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
She's good at moves.

187
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
She's good at moves.

188
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
She's good at moves.

189
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Within three or two moves,

190
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
she was defeated.

191
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Within three or two moves,

192
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
she was defeated.

193
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That's strange.

194
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's strange.

195
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Who is Wei Qingchou?

196
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Why can E'yue kill her?

197
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And...

198
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And...

199
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What if she's the one

200
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
who sneaked out

201
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
from under my nose?

202
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
E'yue's headdress

203
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
looks different from yours.

204
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The shape of the film

205
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
carved on the headdress

206
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
seems to be familiar.

207
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The pattern

208
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
is the same as the pattern

209
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
on Xing Ziru's jade.

210
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Could E'yue be

211
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Xing Ziru's mole?

212
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Could E'yue be Xing Ziru's mole?

213
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Did they use this pattern

214
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
to identify the identity?

215
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Oh, no.

216
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
E'yue is also

217
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
coming for Luo Mo Tianbin.

218
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Let's go and see

219
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Xing Ziru's situation.

220
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Let's go.

221
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Young Master,

222
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Xing Ziru is missing.

223
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What's going on?

224
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Didn't I tell you

225
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
to keep an eye on him?

226
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's my fault.

227
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I had sent someone

228
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
to keep an eye on Xing Ziru.

229
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But there was

230
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
an accident in the west.

231
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Many people

232
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
were attracted to the west.

233
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Xing Ziru got lost

234
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
among the crowd.

235
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Did Luo Mo Tianbin

236
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
do anything wrong?

237
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
There was a guard

238
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
watching the secret tunnel.

239
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
He was safe.

240
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But Xing Ziru

241
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
was missing for a while.

242
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
He did

243
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
wander around the secret tunnel.

244
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
He was missing later.

245
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
The entrance to the mountain villa

246
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
was closed.

247
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
He was missing later.

248
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
He was missing later.

249
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
He was missing later.

250
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The entrance to the villa was closed.

251
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
He must not

252
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
escape from the villa.

253
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Take people

254
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
to search for him.

255
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yes.

256
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Let's go.

257
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Since E Yue

258
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
is the one who

259
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
connected Wei Qingchou

260
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
and Xing Ziru,

261
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
let's see

262
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
if he has any other clues.

263
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
E Yue is sleeping in this position.

264
00:10:37,000 --> 00:11:02,660
My carved

265
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,740
create an인을 leeway.

266
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,400
Stop.

267
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,300
In fact.

268
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,620
Really?

269
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:12,620
Really.

270
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,300
I'm curious.

271
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,420
What it says?

272
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:20,580
Look,

273
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:25,240
Ouyang every day

274
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,100
is very nice.

275
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,260
In his rounded manjar,

276
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:35,300
he looks at개es like

277
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:35,900
a?...

278
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,500
Oh,

279
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,460
the book of The Unwilling to Be Afraid of the Moon.

280
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,180
Look.

281
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,620
Xing Zirou

282
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,580
has a chess piece on the book of The Unwilling to Be Afraid of the Moon.

283
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,100
He Yue also hid a book of The Unwilling to Be Afraid of the Moon.

284
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,500
It can't be a coincidence, right?

285
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,500
The Unwilling to Be Afraid of the Moon

286
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,060
The painting of the Angel of the City.

287
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,580
It's true.

288
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,380
What does it mean?

289
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,540
Look.

290
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,060
Every piece of chess piece in this book

291
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,300
has 19 lines and 19 lines

292
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,380
on the right side of the keyboard.

293
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,940
It's exactly the same as the number on the chessboard.

294
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,300
You mean

295
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,140
the position of each word

296
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,220
corresponds to the intersection point on the chessboard?

297
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,340
If I'm not wrong,

298
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,060
every word on the chessboard

299
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,260
represents a corresponding word.

300
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,660
The four lines of the City of Chengdu

301
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,100
with Xing Zirou on them

302
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,020
are indeed two more lines

303
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,140
than the normal chess pieces.

304
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,340
The other three pieces are the same.

305
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,100
Basically, each picture has two or three more lines.

306
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,860
The words that correspond to these positions

307
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,580
are the news that Xing Zirou

308
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,740
wants to spread.

309
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,180
The picture of Xing Zirou

310
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,740
has one more white line

311
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,140
on the seven lines of the three lines.

312
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,980
The seven lines of the three lines

313
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,660
correspond to the word heart.

314
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,020
And one more black line.

315
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,300
The black line corresponds to the wolf.

316
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,100
The star wolf.

317
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,660
The star wolf, the heavenly soldier,

318
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:41,320
the secret

319
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,180
It's impossible.

320
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,380
When he heard that the mountain villa was in trouble,

321
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,620
I guess he guessed

322
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,740
that Luo Yue had an accident.

323
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,460
If we can figure out

324
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,780
how Wei Qingchou left the heart,

325
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,540
we can find his whereabouts

326
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,660
in a flash.

327
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:15,660
Li,

328
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,300
all this time,

329
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,100
you guys were the ones who served outside.

330
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,580
So who found out

331
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,060
that something happened in the room?

332
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,340
We came in together.

333
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,140
This morning, according to the rules,

334
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,740
eight of us were maidservants.

335
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,420
We had to bring a basin to wash the bride and groom.

336
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,140
But no one came to answer the door

337
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,140
after knocking for a long time.

338
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,300
We were afraid that we would be late.

339
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,180
So we came in as soon as we discussed it.

340
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,380
But we saw a lot of wolves

341
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,980
and blood on the bed.

342
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,260
And then?

343
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,540
And then...

344
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,620
And then I was scared at first.

345
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,260
I saw everyone running out.

346
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,620
So I followed them.

347
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,460
Me too.

348
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,380
Me too.

349
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,420
Me too.

350
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,140
Who was the first one to run out?

351
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,300
And who called for help?

352
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,900
It wasn't me.

353
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,060
No.

354
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:58,900
It wasn't me either.

355
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,060
I was so scared that I ran out.

356
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,700
I didn't have time to call for help.

357
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,540
It seemed that you were in front of me.

358
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,540
You were the one who shouted, right?

359
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,420
I didn't shout.

360
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,060
I didn't shout either.

361
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,060
That's it.

362
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,420
Why didn't everyone run out first?

363
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,940
And everyone said they didn't shout.

364
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,380
But I heard it clearly.

365
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:13,900
Indeed.

366
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:14,980
I heard it too.

367
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,380
There was a woman's crying in the room.

368
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,220
That's why I came here.

369
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,980
Since you weren't the first one to run out,

370
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,940
and no one shouted,

371
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,100
that means

372
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,260
the ninth person was calling for help.

373
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,700
The ninth person?

374
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,500
The ninth person?

375
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,740
It wasn't me.

376
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,220
Where did the ninth person come from?

377
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,260
You mean Wei Qingchou disguised as a maid

378
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,900
and ran away in the middle?

379
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,100
Yes.

380
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,020
Since E'e Yue could sneak in when there were many people,

381
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,420
why didn't Wei Qingchou

382
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,820
sneak out in the same way?

383
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,380
That explains

384
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,100
why E'e Yue

385
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,540
didn't sneak in.

386
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,020
It's possible that it was a woman.

387
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,620
But Wei Qingchou is a man.

388
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,500
Even if she disguised as a maid,

389
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,860
her voice wouldn't be heard.

390
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,420
Maybe the groom

391
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,860
was a woman.

392
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,860
Li Lianhua, stop fooling around.

393
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,300
Fang Xiaobao, you forgot

394
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,780
when Su Xiaoyong disguised as a man.

395
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,300
Didn't you recognize it?

396
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:14,980
I...

397
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,340
I didn't see it clearly.

398
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,700
Besides,

399
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,540
there are so many people in Tianyi Mountain.

400
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,220
Can't they be all men and women?

401
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,100
Moreover,

402
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,140
my aunt and Wei Qingchou

403
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,300
have been together for so long.

404
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,740
How could she not notice it?

405
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,780
I just figured it out.

406
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:30,980
Zhan,

407
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,060
Wei Qingchou's martial arts

408
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,180
are so fast and agile.

409
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,860
When she was playing with him,

410
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,140
did you notice

411
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,140
that he was protecting his own sacred blood?

412
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,020
He didn't dare to touch his fist.

413
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,300
How did you know?

414
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,740
That's right.

415
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,300
Have you heard of

416
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,220
a special martial art on the martial arts?

417
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,340
It's called

418
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,820
the Dragon-Cutting Wind.

419
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,300
Dragon-Cutting Wind?

420
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,860
It's said that it's a kind of

421
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,540
sacred skill that temporarily changes a person's gender.

422
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,260
But in fact, this skill

423
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:06,060
only changes the voice and appearance of the practitioner.

424
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,260
So it's hard for ordinary people to notice it.

425
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,500
But this skill is hard to master.

426
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,220
So there are few people in the martial arts world who know it.

427
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,620
I know one person.

428
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,900
The Two-Defiled Immortal.

429
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,980
The Two-Defiled Immortal

430
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,460
was the wife of the first prince of the Three Kingdoms

431
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,020
of the Golden Abyss Alliance.

432
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,700
It's said that he was once a master of the Dragon-Cutting Wind.

433
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,900
The First Prince?

434
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,180
We found it in the female house that day.

435
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,940
Aren't these four Qing Zun

436
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,660
one of the four male and female empresses?

437
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,500
That's right.

438
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,540
Maybe this is the real reason

439
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,540
why the Two-Defiled Immortal

440
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,340
wants to take the Dragon-Cutting Wind.

441
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,340
Master.

442
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,820
The chef is here to get it for you.

443
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,180
I'm coming.

444
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,620
Since Wei Qingchou came here,

445
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,220
do you see the royal family in the kitchen every day?

446
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,940
The chef said that Wei Qingchou told him to do it.

447
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,260
He said it's a physical need.

448
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,620
He needs to come to replenish blood every day.

449
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,060
I'm afraid that replenishing blood is fake.

450
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,580
It's true that the royal family

451
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,900
used it to maintain the Dragon-Cutting Wind.

452
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,460
What does the Dragon-Cutting Wind have to do with this?

453
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,380
The royal family used it to make porcelain.

454
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,860
After it was cut,

455
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,340
it was converted into male.

456
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,180
So it's used to make porcelain.

457
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,180
So the Divine Pillar

458
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,540
is the gate to break through the Purple Palace.

459
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,100
That's right.

460
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,300
So Wei Qingchou is wrong.

461
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,700
It should be the Two-Defiled Immortal.

462
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,700
When you were fighting with him,

463
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,820
his moves were not fast enough.

464
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,620
When he was killing E'e Yue,

465
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,700
he didn't care about his gender.

466
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,020
So he used it to kill him.

467
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,380
Zhao Ling, you're so particular.

468
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,900
The Two-Defiled Immortal is a man of great power.

469
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,740
He can't be killed by a man of great power.

470
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,980
He's a man of great power.

471
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,540
After killing E'e Yue,

472
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,220
the Two-Defiled Immortal was transformed into a female.

473
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,280
LunLaughing Dome

474
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,460
Your Highness.

475
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,860
My Lord Grown-up.

476
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,860
Evil spirit! Ergo!

477
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,660
Help me!

478
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:56,860
components of evil spirit

479
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,620
away!

480
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,660
Emperor Ya Lia was so furious

481
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,580
that הת realized

482
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,420
that he was outnumbered by the thousand soldiers of the Demon of hére

483
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,300
and,

484
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,500
and pretend to be killed.

485
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,180
Cut off the skin on the goose.

486
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,420
Then embroider the same tattoo as yours.

487
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,900
Then hide the corpse.

488
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,660
It should be a good laugh.

489
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,900
So,

490
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,020
Wei Qingchou

491
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,780
is really a fairy of two worlds.

492
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,820
So he can escape

493
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,980
under the eyes of the Guardian of the Fiery.

494
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,700
My poor sister.

495
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,020
Now Tian Bing

496
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,100
must still be in the hands of the two-winged fairy.

497
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,700
The loss of internal force

498
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,140
of the corpse-shedding dragon is great.

499
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,900
I guess the two-winged fairy

500
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,780
must be a weak enemy.

501
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,380
So we must

502
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,060
find her before we can do what we want.

503
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,260
The real place is lost.

504
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,340
Mother.

505
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,580
Do you remember the hot spring in the back mountain?

506
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,260
Did the two-winged fairy know where she was

507
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,260
during this time?

508
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,460
Yes.

509
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,100
How could I not know?

510
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,260
The hot spring is good for health.

511
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,860
It must be a good place for people to repair their true power.

512
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,140
With your temperament,

513
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,260
you know that your husband

514
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,300
is seriously injured.

515
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,660
How can you not take him there?

516
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,860
I'm afraid the two-winged fairy

517
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,100
is there now.

518
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,580
I...

519
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,140
What two-winged fairy?

520
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,100
How dare you lie to me?

521
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,500
I won't let you get caught.

522
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,340
It's really her.

523
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,980
Hand over the Dragon Demon Heavenly Army.

524
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,260
I'll kill you.

525
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,660
Xing Xiang.

526
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,900
Who gave you the guts

527
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,620
to act in my Tianji Hall?

528
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:35,980
Xiaofeng.

529
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,500
I'll settle it later.

530
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,620
Second Hall Leader.

531
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,100
Are you going to

532
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,260
protect your husband?

533
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,340
What's wrong?

534
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,900
He's a person who has been to the Hall with me.

535
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,940
I'm in charge of him.

536
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,380
I'm the only one who can decide

537
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,620
whether to kill or not.

538
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,780
It depends on your ability.

539
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,460
Sure, I'll defeat him.

540
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,020
Be careful.

541
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,460
I was pretending.

542
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,020
It's not recovered yet.

543
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,220
If more Sand Master five metMusic Bow.

544
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,180
I can then defeat him

545
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,860
and triumphantly win my hand again.

546
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,700
That'll work just fine.

547
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,780
Where's Cave Ninja

548
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,780
Let's go together.

549
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,780
Leave here.

550
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,780
I have plenty of time to wait for you to recover.

551
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,780
Qunfei.

552
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,780
Xiao Yi, are you okay?

553
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,780
I'm fine.

554
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,780
You're a bad guy and you're so shy to ask.

555
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,780
You didn't come to save me.

556
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,780
If it wasn't for Yunfei, I would have been

557
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,340
taken by that

558
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,780
criminal as a hostage.

559
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,780
Oh, thank God Zhang Wuwei is here.

560
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,780
Hurry up and find Li Lian Kuan to meet him.

561
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,780
Lian Kuan, how is his injury?

562
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,780
The town is in a bad state.

563
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,780
I'm afraid it's no use going back to the heaven.

564
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,780
It doesn't matter.

565
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:57,780
I've done what I was entrusted with.

566
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,780
The fairy's order is related to the heavenly army.

567
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,780
So Luo Mo's heavenly army is really on you?

568
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,780
Hall Leader He.

569
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,780
Hall Leader He,

570
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,780
Mr. Pi has a grudge against us.

571
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,780
Before he died, he told me to

572
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,780
take Luo Mo's heavenly army into your hands.

573
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,380
It's my and Mr. Pi's duty to plan

574
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,780
exactly to 놓 his death and like him.

575
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,780
I...

576
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,780
Q abortion,

577
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,780
he's sick and in deep danger.

578
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,780
Your Majesty,

579
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,820
till now,

580
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,780
we have never figured this out

581
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,780
and protected Alusannes all along.

582
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,780
I've been

583
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,300
completely lost these years.

584
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,940
I've been living with my husband

585
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,540
for many years.

586
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,620
I was trapped in Dragon Pass.

587
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,580
But my husband was born

588
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,940
and was born again.

589
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,980
I've been helped by Mr. Pi many times.

590
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,860
I don't know why

591
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,620
I got the position of Dragon Pass

592
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,300
and came to attack him.

593
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:21,180
In order to guard Dragon Pass,

594
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,980
I finally

595
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,060
died in the battle.

596
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,740
Before the assassination of Li Qiao,

597
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,540
the woman was 188 years old

598
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,940
just to

599
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,140
find this dead body

600
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,780
and take away the ice in her hand.

601
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,140
That's right.

602
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,300
Unfortunately,

603
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,060
my husband found out that

604
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,380
Zhao Li Qiao had secretly been

605
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,660
sent to the Luo Mo Heavenly Army ten years ago

606
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,340
and had already

607
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,460
started to doubt the Golden Fence.

608
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:03,060
So he handed the Luo Mo Heavenly Army

609
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,780
to Mr. Pi before he died.

610
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,460
When the Dragon Pass was forced,

611
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,220
Mr. Pi knew it was dangerous

612
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,620
and couldn't break it at all.

613
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,860
So he asked me

614
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,820
to take the Luo Mo Heavenly Army

615
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,380
and take it to the Tianji Manor

616
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,780
and hand it to Hall Leader He.

617
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,500
If that's the case,

618
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,820
why did you lie to me?

619
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,780
Xiaofeng,

620
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,940
I didn't mean to lie to you.

621
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,340
It's a pity that

622
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,340
after I came out of the 188th prison,

623
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,860
I was chased by people in the corner

624
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,780
and had to turn around

625
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,180
to lure people into the corner

626
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,220
and turn myself into a man.

627
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:53,980
But

628
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,140
I was too heavy

629
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,540
and I fell down

630
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,380
on the roadside that day.

631
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,700
Then I saved you back to the Tianji Manor.

632
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,500
But Hall Leader He was not in the manor.

633
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,420
Mr. Pi asked me

634
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,020
to hand it to you personally.

635
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,980
I dared not to lie to anyone.

636
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,420
But at that time,

637
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,180
Xiaofeng proposed to marry me.

638
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,100
I thought that if Xiaofeng got married,

639
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,220
Hall Leader He would definitely come back.

640
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,620
So I agreed to it.

641
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:34,980
Xiaofeng,

642
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,780
I'm sorry.

643
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,260
I used you.

644
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,860
So that day,

645
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,380
you put the Luo Mo Heavenly Army

646
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,020
in the box?

647
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,980
I didn't want to expose my identity

648
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,380
and let Jiali Bridge's eyes discover it.

649
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,780
Then I made this plan.

650
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,540
I planned to leave the day before the wedding

651
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:02,580
after Hall Leader He got the Luo Mo Heavenly Army.

652
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,220
But I didn't expect that

653
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,980
and was discovered.

654
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,420
I know that

655
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,500
this is a kind of Qinggong of the Golden Abyss Alliance.

656
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,540
At that time, I realized

657
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,580
that the people of Jiali Bridge

658
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,220
didn't discover my identity,

659
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,420
but they had already come to Tianji Villa.

660
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,940
It really made me realize

661
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,460
that the man in black was looking for something in Ike's room.

662
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,500
I think that the man in black is finally mixed with the spy.

663
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,420
It's not safe enough.

664
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,860
So we have to take the Heavenly Army away first.

665
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,940
So when you entered the new room,

666
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,580
you noticed that someone had already come in

667
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,620
and made a hand in your wine.

668
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,780
You found that someone was following you.

669
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,540
So you killed that spy.

670
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:54,980
That's right.

671
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,900
But E'erhe

672
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,300
wasn't the man in black I saw that day.

673
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,540
The enemy was in the dark and I was in the bright.

674
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,660
I wanted to break through the crisis here

675
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,740
and take the opportunity to save the people.

676
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,100
But I couldn't do it.

677
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,340
I didn't have time to explain to you.

678
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,780
So I hid my body

679
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,780
to complete my plan.

680
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,940
You can't be too anxious.

681
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,940
How do you know that you can complete all the plans

682
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,580
and then retreat?

683
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,420
I was going to use myself as a bait.

684
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,020
I didn't think about retreating completely.

685
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,460
That Heavenly Army wasn't in your hands.

686
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,700
It was in another place.

687
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,420
In Xiaofeng's sachet.

688
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,820
I've done what Mr. Pi asked me to do.

689
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,860
What about the man in black?

690
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,900
Do you have something to tell me?

691
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,100
The pattern on the man's skin

692
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:14,460
was originally embroidered by my husband on my back.

693
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:18,780
It's still in the art of burning night and day.

694
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,780
But I didn't know the meaning of it.

695
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,820
I know.

696
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,620
I've been so vicious

697
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,820
that I embroidered the pattern

698
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,620
on E'erhe's back.

699
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:37,100
I dug it out and kept it in my room.

700
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,620
Remember.

701
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,700
The first step is to be happy.

702
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:51,460
The immortal is less than the qin.

703
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,660
Xiaofeng.

704
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,620
I hope

705
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,700
you won't blame me.

706
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,420
I've never

707
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,300
let anyone down.

708
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,580
I'm not ashamed of my husband's will.

709
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:31,860
I...

710
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,780
I'm sorry.

711
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,700
I'm sorry.

712
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,300
I'm sorry.

713
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,780
You're also a person who knows the qin and the qin.

714
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,220
No.

715
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,220
There's an enemy coming.

716
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,460
Let's go check it out.

717
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:04,780
Yes.

718
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,140
What's up?

719
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,000
不過

720
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,080
我

721
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,380
有事

722
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,460
不好了

723
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:31,460
杀

724
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,660
If you were not here,

725
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,660
my second sister would not have been killed.

726
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,540
I can't die.

727
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,940
If I die,

728
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,500
how can I repay you

729
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,620
for raising my son?

730
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,420
Enough!

731
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,380
What do you want to do

732
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,460
in this state?

733
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,460
What?

734
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,620
It's been so many years.

735
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,860
Tianji Villa

736
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,020
is just teaching you

737
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,140
to talk to your father like this?

738
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,500
Last time, you lied to me

739
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,940
and made me come here with you.

740
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,180
Now you come here

741
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,460
to talk to me.

742
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,540
I'm not lying.

743
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,460
I'm not lying.

744
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,540
I came here

745
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,100
to meet me, Bingrong.

746
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,220
Since you are so stubborn,

747
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,500
I don't need to

748
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,700
have any thoughts about you anymore.

749
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,780
You don't have to be involved in the adult's business.

750
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,780
Go in first.

751
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,420
No need.

752
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,820
I should face

753
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,460
my own business.

754
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,780
Anyone

755
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,300
who dares to disobey the world

756
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,500
and disobey the martial arts world,

757
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,540
I will fight against them

758
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,220
until the end.

759
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,780
My son,

760
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,020
I've been with you for a long time.

761
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,020
I feel like

762
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,580
you were self-righteous.

763
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,060
Am I right?

764
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,380
Xiang Yi.

765
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,340
Xiang Yi?

766
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,700
Is this true?

767
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,900
Is this really Xiang Yi?

768
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,580
I knew it.

769
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,180
Xiang Yi won't die so easily.

770
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,180
That's great.

771
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,780
Senior.

772
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,220
It's been a long time.

773
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,580
You're still so weak.

774
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,420
I guess you came here

775
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,420
for the Heavenly Soldiers today.

776
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,740
Junior,

777
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,220
you still like to play this kind of game.

778
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,580
It seems that your martial arts

779
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,940
hasn't improved much.

780
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,380
But you are my junior.

781
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,780
Whatever I want,

782
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,180
you can have it.

783
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,580
I'm not afraid of you.

784
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,780
I'm not afraid of you.

785
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,780
You are so clear.

786
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,780
Don't worry.

787
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,580
The Heavenly Soldiers won't give it to you.

788
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,580
It's not up to you.

789
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,580
You've seen the day-off.

790
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,980
And the martial arts masters around me.

791
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,540
They've been

792
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,780
in the hands of the devil for a long time.

793
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,780
Wu Ji, the devil monk.

794
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,780
I've been thinking about

795
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,180
the third most famous martial arts master

796
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,180
in the recent years.

797
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,180
Hand over Luo Mo and the Heavenly Soldiers to me.

798
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,380
Then I can spare you.

799
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,380
Senior.

800
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,780
Do you still take me seriously?

801
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,780
Do you think you are still

802
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,780
the same Xiang Yi?

803
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,780
It's not worth mentioning

804
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,380
with such a little skill.

805
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,380
Really?

806
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,780
I'm not a good person.

807
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,780
I'm just a little bit of a bad person.

808
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,780
Really?

809
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,380
Then why do you need so many helpers?

810
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,980
Today,

811
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:03,380
you need to rely on them to take the Heavenly Soldiers.

812
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,380
Shan Gu Dao, Shan Gu Dao.

813
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,980
You are still a weakling.

814
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,380
Okay.

815
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,180
Then today,

816
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,380
I'll have ten moves with you.

817
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,180
If you can win me,

818
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,180
I'll take someone to leave here immediately.

819
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,780
If you lose to me,

820
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,980
I'll not only take Luo Mo and the Heavenly Soldiers,

821
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,180
but also your life.

822
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,180
It's a deal.

823
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,780
Ding Lian Hua, you can't go.

824
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,180
Why are you coming at me?

825
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,980
Don't worry.

826
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,180
He's just a defeated general under my command.

827
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,180
There can't be a time.

828
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,180
I remember that Master and Shiniang used to

829
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,780
always like to let us compete.

830
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,180
It's been more than ten years.

831
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,180
I haven't learned

832
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,180
the martial arts of my senior for a long time.

833
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,580
Then today,

834
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,180
I'll teach you

835
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,380
to see it well.

836
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,180
Ten moves.

837
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,580
I can only take ten moves.

838
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,180
I must win within ten moves.

839
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,380
Senior, I won again.

840
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,380
It seems that Senior has changed.

841
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,380
In the past ten years,

842
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,380
your internal strength

843
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,780
has improved a lot.

844
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,580
Of course, it's thanks to

845
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,780
Master and his senior

846
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,580
that I was able to

847
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,380
take care of each other.

848
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,180
What did you say?

849
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,580
What?

850
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,580
You're not going to take me away?

851
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,580
I'm not going to take you away.

852
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,180
I'm going to take you away.

853
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,380
I'm going to take you away.

854
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,580
I'm going to take you away.

855
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,780
I don't believe it.

856
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,180
That move just now was so impressive.

857
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,580
Only Master's

858
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,380
unique internal strength

859
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,780
can make it happen.

860
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,580
Isn't it surprising?

861
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,980
What did you do to Master?

862
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,380
I just told him

863
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,380
that you, Li Xiangyi, were trapped in the Eastern Sea

864
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,780
and that you were about to die.

865
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,580
But Master

866
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,380
was in the most critical time

867
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,780
when he was practicing in seclusion.

868
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,780
When he heard

869
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,980
that your beloved disciple was in trouble,

870
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,780
he was in a hurry,

871
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:32,180
and he was so anxious that he was scared.

872
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,380
He was turned against by his internal strength.

873
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,180
You're so despicable.

874
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,180
Master really loves you.

875
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,980
He knew that you were in trouble.

876
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,380
To save you, he didn't care that he was hurt.

877
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,580
He even wanted to pass on his life's power to me

878
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,780
so that I could save you.

879
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,580
But he

880
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,860
ended up in a state of

881
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,980
a dead end.

882
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,380
Master was tricked by you

883
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,980
because he wanted to save me.

884
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,380
Why?

885
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,380
Our lives

886
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,180
are not as good as they are now.

887
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,180
Master saved me.

888
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:29,580
Master's wife took us to live in the mountains.

889
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:35,780
Why didn't you let Master go?

890
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,580
It's all because of you.

891
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,780
I...

892
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,380
Because you were so arrogant

893
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,780
and ungrateful.

894
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,180
I...

895
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,980
Ten years.

896
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,180
Ten years.

897
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,780
You finally lost to me.

898
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,380
You still lost to me.

899
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,180
Master.

900
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,580
Master is very grateful to you.

901
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,980
But to me?

902
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,380
Master never thought of me as his disciple.

903
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:31,180
When he left, he still thought of you.

904
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,780
Did he ever think of me?

905
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,780
He asked me to save you in the East Sea.

906
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,980
Did he ever think about my life?

907
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,380
I'm his teacher and I'll be his father forever.

908
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,580
I treated him as my family.

909
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,580
I practiced martial arts every day.

910
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,380
I wanted to win you and prove it to him.

911
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,180
But Master is not only a horse.

912
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,580
He never thought about my feelings.

913
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,580
I have the power of his life now.

914
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,380
I won him.

915
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,780
In fact, I'll avenge Master

916
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,780
by killing the tribe.

917
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,780
Baba, you protect him.

918
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,180
Don't forget him.

919
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,980
Yangzhou refinery is quite amazing.

920
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,260
Even with the definitions

921
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,660
of查 desert khat.

922
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,540
It's still passed ten years,

923
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,780
despite the good黄杂木 blocks.

924
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:17,180
You are indeed as mysterious as the past.

925
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,180
Don't worry.

926
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,180
Unless you find the flower of Wangchuan,

927
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,740
no one can save you.

928
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,580
Think about it.

929
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,620
How long can you live?

930
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:28,620
Didn't you tell me

931
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,060
that the poison had been cured?

932
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:33,940
Don't be so hasty.

933
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,660
I'm too lazy to kill you.

934
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:36,660
Fang Duo Bing,

935
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,700
I'll give you one last chance.

936
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,420
Give me the Luo Mo Heavenly Army.

937
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,060
Don't waste my time.

938
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:43,100
Don't dream!

939
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,380
Okay.

940
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,300
Then don't blame me for being ruthless.

941
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,660
