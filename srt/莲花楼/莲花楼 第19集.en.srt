4
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,710
Director Di, you covered up for me.

5
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,360
I owe you one.

6
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,380
Why did you bring him here?

7
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,360
You believe the Jinyuan Alliance

8
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,820
is to blame for your senior's death, don't you?

9
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,220
Director Di brought me here to tell you

10
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,979
that ten years ago,

11
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,820
Shan Gudao issued a challenge to me,

12
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,750
Four-faced Qingzun, and the King Bai of Fire.

13
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,790
We didn't take it seriously.

14
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,180
When we arrived at the place he told us,

15
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,530
we found Shan Gudao already dead.

16
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,000
It's my senior who issued the challenge.

17
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,950
This is the letter he sent them.

18
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,350
[The Jinyuan Alliance and the Sigu Sect have been at odds for years. A showdown is needed to put an end to the dispute.][I, Shan Gudao from the Sigu Sect, hereby issue a challenge to the Three Great Fighters from the Jinyuan Alliance. We'll fight to the death in the Yangsha Valley with heaven and earth as witnesses.]

This is not my senior's handwriting.

21
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:32,880
My Lord.

22
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,940
How's that possible?

23
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,130
At this point,

24
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,920
there's no need for him to lie.

25
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,980
Shan Gudao's death was very strange.

26
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,790
That's why I took his body away

27
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,250
and let Shi Hun examine it.

28
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,770
Maybe someone deliberately sowed discord

29
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,250
between the Jinyuan Alliance and the Sigu Sect.

30
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,620
And the aftermath

31
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,810
didn't stop with the demises

32
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,810
of the Jinyuan Alliance and the Sigu Sect.

33
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,370
Who is behind it?

34
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,070
The death of my senior

35
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,820
may be the key to answering that question.

36
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,280
So you don't want to die now?

37
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,660
I won't prove you wrong.

38
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,440
Director Di,

39
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,720
don't you want to know what happened

40
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,010
ten years ago?

41
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,550
Of course I do.

42
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,170
The truth will eventually come to light.

43
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,420
But our competition

44
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,660
concerns my dignity.

45
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:15,910
After I find the Styx Flower

46
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,100
and you eat the Yin Grass,

47
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,180
you can regain your strength and fight me again.

48
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,380
I can help you find out the truth

49
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:22,710
after that.

50
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,060
First of all, I need to know

51
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,480
the relationship between the Jinyuan Alliance and Nanyin.

52
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,940
What on earth has the Jinyuan Alliance done?

53
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,130
Nanyin?

54
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,530
Doesn't ring a bell?

55
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,730
You forgot it so soon?

56
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,930
In the Yipin Tomb,

57
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,740
the wooden box you took away

58
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,260
was Princess Nanyin's dowry.

59
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,100
Don't you know that?

60
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,900
I was there for Weeping Guanyin.

61
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,590
Why would I take a wooden box?

62
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,520
I just learned that ten years ago,

63
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,380
it was Nanyin people who bought large quantities of gunpowder

64
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,310
from the Thunder Hall in Jiangnan.

65
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,660
I want to know

66
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,540
what makes you think the Jinyuan Alliance

67
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,940
is involved with Nanyin.

68
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,380
What else do you know?

69
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,420
Why don't you be honest with me?

70
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,550
Someone from Nanyin

71
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,720
bought gunpowder

72
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,250
and blew up everything you had in the East Sea.

73
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,320
Do you know

74
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,660
that Jiao Liqiao is from Nanyin?

75
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,570
Are you sure of that?

76
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,930
Director Di,

77
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:19,269
you got some family issues to attend to.

78
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,230
I'll come to you

79
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,240
after getting to the bottom of it.

80
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,820
I've been looking for you

81
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,180
yet you're hiding here drinking alone.

82
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,720
So you weren't the one who spat up blood

83
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,120
on the ground a while ago?

84
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,890
I'm much better now.

85
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,560
But you're not well enough to drink.

86
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:02,930
Here.

87
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,570
Take the medicine.

88
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,580
You're so clumsy.

89
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,580
I can do it myself.

90
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,110
You saved me despite our dispute.

91
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,680
Your attitude has changed a lot.

92
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,120
Thank you.

93
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,460
Don't thank me.

94
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,840
Maybe I should call you Mr. Glib.

95
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,920
You say lots of pretty things

96
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,380
and have a silver tongue.

97
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,470
But you barely mean

98
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,230
what you say.

99
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,740
You thanked me for saving your life,

100
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,670
but I don't think

101
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,260
you've ever

102
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,820
taken your life seriously.

103
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,760
I'm just afraid of death.

104
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,590
Thank you.

105
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,200
I mean it.

106
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,220
That can't change the fact

107
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,720
that you ratted me out.

108
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,770
Let me tell you something.

109
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,110
When I was in the villa these days,

110
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,330
I read lots of books and did some research.

111
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:55,260
Research?

112
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:57,800
About what?

113
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:58,940
About you.

Don't you have something better to do?

116
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,190
I think

117
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,780
you used to be quite arrogant

118
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,200
and very talented.

119
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,030
Apart from being arrogant,

120
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,240
we're very alike.

121
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,970
You made a lot of friends,

122
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,280
but few of them were true friends.

123
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,260
Later, something big happened

124
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,310
and you ended up all alone.

125
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,460
Maybe you were betrayed by your best friend,

126
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,890
which made you mistrustful

127
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,580
and believe that you're better off being alone.

128
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:30,470
What do you say?

129
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,430
I guessed it right, didn't I?

00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,110
No.

You have no appetite?

I was about to tell Zijin

that there was no need to send for a physician.

162

Zijin cares for you very much.

Is that woman more skilled in martial arts now?

She flicked the Iced Cicada into my mouth.

What's worse

173
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,960
is that the Jinyuan Alliance

174
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,809
is coming for the 188 prisons.

175
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:41,880
I heard that the Baichuan Court has 188 prisons

176
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,650
and the Jinyuan Alliance has broken into many of them recently.

177
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,490
The prison at the old address of the Sigu Sect

178
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,950
has been found by Di Feisheng.

179
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,280
It's not a coincidence.

180
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,160
The locations of the 188 prisons

181
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,310
are only known by me, Biqui, Bai, Shi,

182
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,550
and my most trusted disciples.

183
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,090
Someone must have spilled the beans,

184
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,600
or there wouldn't have been so many breaches.

185
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,240
Do you suspect anyone?

186
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,070
Without evidence,

187
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,120
I don't suspect anyone arbitrarily.

188
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,850
We just need to be more vigilant

189
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,380
and wait for the mole to give themselves away.

190
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:13,960
Mr. Ji.

191
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,560
The Sigu Sect fell into pieces ten years ago.

192
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,080
Only the Baichuan Court

193
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,370
still has its essence.

194
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,880
The last thing I want to hear

195
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,130
is that there's a traitor in the Baichuan Court.

196
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:24,550
If…

197
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,430
If Xiangyi were still alive,

198
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,840
he wouldn't want to see

199
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,670
this branch of the Sigu Sect fall apart.

200
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,200
Wanmian.

201
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,230
Li Xiangyi is gone.

202
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,350
The Sigu Sect is long gone as well.

203
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,620
Just leave this matter to Mr. Ji.

204
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,420
The Sigu Sect is gone.

205
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,450
But

206
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,340
as long as we're still dedicated to maintaining peace in the martial world,

207
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,600
and as long as we can join hands together,

208
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,650
how come the Sigu Sect won't be back?

209
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,380
You want to revive the Sigu Sect?

210
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,160
Is that what the Baichuan Court wants?

211
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,560
No.

212
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,860
That's what many people want.

213
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,660
For many years, Jiao Liqiao

214
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,310
has been causing disturbances everywhere with the remnants of the Jinyuan Alliance.

215
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,140
Di Feisheng has returned

216
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,640
and openly challenged us yesterday.

217
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,270
Everyone present was indignant.

218
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:18,840
They all hope

219
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,310
that the Sigu Sect can get back on its feet

220
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,840
to unite the martial world,

221
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,390
suppress Di Feisheng,

222
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,180
and wipe out the Jinyuan Alliance.

223
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:26,640
It seems

224
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,380
that you support this idea too.

225
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,470
For the Sigu Sect to come back,

226
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,750
a new Sect Leader is needed.

227
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,050
So I came to discuss it with you.

228
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,080
I've thought about it.

229
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,840
Zijin was the Left Guardian of the Sigu Sect.

230
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,740
You're the best suited for this position.

231
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,510
No, he's not.

232
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:53,280
I…

233
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,180
Reviving the Sigu Sect

234
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,290
can't be achieved overnight.

235
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,930
Mr. Ji, let me think about it.

236
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:07,560
OK.

237
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,110
I'll leave now.

238
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,360
Zijin, don't be angry.

239
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,460
You said

240
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,630
you're not interested in the affairs in the martial world.

241
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,300
That's why I…

242
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:35,830
Wanmian.

243
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,550
You seldom lie.

244
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,970
So when you do,

245
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,030
you make small gestures.

246
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,710
I know you very well.

247
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,490
Zijin.

248
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,860
-I don't mean…
-Of course you think

249
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,590
that I can't be the Sect Leader.

250
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,880
Because in your eyes,

251
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,850
only Li Xiangyi can be in that position.

252
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,690
You have never

253
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,050
gotten over him.

254
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,360
When I saved you from Di Feisheng,

255
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,900
you were groggy

256
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,260
but kept

257
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,300
calling Xiangyi.

258
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:22,730
For so many years,

259
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,020
you've been thinking about him

260
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,380
day and night,

261
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,450
haven't you?

262
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,920
It's not like that, Zijin.

263
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,350
Okay.

264
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,070
Let me ask you.

265
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,620
Why did you go to find Li Lianhua

266
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,220
right after you felt better?

267
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,750
Do you find him

268
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,690
familiar too?

269
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,230
You're not the only one.

270
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,290
Sometimes when I looked into his eyes,

271
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,350
I couldn't help but think of Xiangyi.

272
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,030
So,

273
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,280
you tried to see Li Xiangyi

274
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,440
in Li Lianhua,

275
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,140
didn't you?

276
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:52,870
Zijin.

277
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:57,030
I never saw Xingyi in anyone.

278
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,710
My feelings for Xiangyi have changed.

279
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,330
He was a friend from the past.

280
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,830
A memory.

281
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:07,570
He

282
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,740
will never be the obstacle between us.

283
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,950
Trust me.

284
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,100
Okay.

285
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,520
I trust you.

286
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,530
I believe everything you say.

287
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:24,660
But

288
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,070
I have to change too.

289
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,630
Change?

290
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,850
I wasn't interested in reviving the Sigu Sect.

291
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:34,910
But now,

292
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,510
I've decided

293
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,120
to lead the Sigu Sect.

294
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,430
I'll prove to you

295
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,450
that I can do whatever Li Xiangyi could

296
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,140
and I can do better than him!

297
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,440
Share your wisdom,

298
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,230
contribute to the society,

299
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,220
and uphold justice.

300
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:56,970
Yes.

301
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:57,990
Well said.

302
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,950
Yes, well said.

303
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,710
Good.

304
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,140
Mr. Jiang,

305
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,830
are you going to Qingfeng Peak

306
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,570
to attend the reviving ceremony of the Sigu Sect too?

307
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,610
Yes, Fu.

308
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,100
I knew

309
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,730
you'd come for fun as well.

310
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,390
Not for fun.

311
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,590
We're going to shed blood and sweat for the Sigu Sect.

312
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,840
Nothing is more honorable

313
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,030
than dying for justice!

314
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:16,640
Great.

315
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,850
You young people are the future of the martial world.

316
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:19,490
Back then,

317
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,330
when Li Xiangyi became successful,

318
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,700
he was around your age.

319
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,260
The ceremony will start soon.

320
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:24,790
Let's go.

321
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:25,630
Let's go.

322
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:33,770
[Announcement: The martial world is afflicted by nuisances like the Jinyuan Alliance. The revival of the Sigu Sect is imperative.][At this critical moment, we earnestly appeal to all our esteemed friends, both old and new, to share your wisdom, contribute to the society, and uphold justice alongside the Sigu Sect.]

323
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:33,770
[The Sigu Sect, August 25th]

324
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,300
I was waiting in line to buy pork wontons.

325
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,700
Why did you bring me here?

326
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,980
Forget about wontons.

327
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,460
The revival of the Sigu Sect

328
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,670
is a once-in-a-lifetime event.

329
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,600
Without me, you can't even come in.

330
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,050
Hero Zhang, please.

331
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:54,330
Everyone,

332
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,900
during the decade when the Sigu Sect was defunct,

333
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,700
the martial world changed a lot.

334
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,750
The remnants of the Jinyuan Alliance

335
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,520
have bounced back

336
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,390
and become a nuisance again.

337
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,260
It's our duty to eliminate them and restore order.

338
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:10,810
By reviving the Sigu Sect,

339
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,950
we want to unify our friends, new and old,

340
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,540
to get rid of the evil forces together.

341
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,630
I won't flatter myself by thinking

342
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,790
that I deserve to be the Sect Leader.

343
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,920
I'm grateful to those who recommend me

344
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,290
and don't want to let them down.

345
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,490
So I'll lead the Sigu Sect for the time being.

346
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,290
I hereby announce this decision

347
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,310
and expect support from all of you.

348
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,610
Congratulations.

349
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,460
We'll do our best to help.

350
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,250
We want to join the Sigu Sect

351
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,660
to continue our predecessors' legacy.

352
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,790
It's a noble cause that's worth dying for!

353
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,460
Count me in.

354
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,760
-I'm in!
-Count me in.

355
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,820
Count me in.

356
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,710
Me too.

357
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:45,570
Count me in.

358
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,380
I'm in!

359
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,550
Me too.

360
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:50,540
-Great. I'll join…
-Here comes the Wanshen Clan.

361
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:58,240
Director Feng.

362
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,760
Welcome, Director Feng.

363
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,760
You tided us over

364
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,890
at a difficult time.

365
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:13,870
As the leader of the Nanshan Sect, I'm very grateful to you.

366
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:15,690
Everyone,

367
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,060
after Sect Leader Li passed away,

368
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,850
the Sigu Sect fell apart.

369
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,540
It was a great pity.

370
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,270
The news that Sect Leader Xiao and his friends

371
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,140
will pick up the pieces and revive the Sigu Sect

372
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,950
has spread throughout the martial world.

373
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,480
You have the full support of the Wanshen Clan.

374
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,190
We have allies all over the martial world.

375
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,570
Sect Leader Xiao,

376
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,870
if you need any help,

377
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,100
just say it.

378
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,470
Director Feng is right.

379
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,620
Yes.

380
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,460
He's not here to say congratulations.

381
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,590
He just wants to establish dominance.

382
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,370
Thank you, Director Feng.

383
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,960
In the past few years, I've stayed out of the martial world.

384
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,790
When I heard about the rising of the Wanshen Sect,

385
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,920
I was very relieved.

386
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,579
The martial world

387
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,430
needs new forces

388
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:11,950
to uphold justice.

389
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,160
The Wanshen Clan was established at a perilous time

390
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,420
and has since then been doing whatever we can

391
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,349
to keep order in the martial world.

392
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,750
We didn't expect

393
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,220
to get so many people's support

394
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,310
and become stronger and stronger

395
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,099
over the past decade.

396
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,080
More power means more responsibility.

397
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,130
I came here,

398
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,770
first, to congratulate the Sigu Sect.

399
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,360
Second, I want to tell the martial world

400
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,190
that if anyone meets any difficulties,

401
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,590
turn to the Wanshen Clan.

402
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,430
We'll do everything we can

403
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,720
to help you.

404
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,720
Director Feng is so nice.

405
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,620
The Wanshen Clan is a righteous organization

406
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,700
just like the Sigu Sect.

407
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,220
I believe that if we join forces,

408
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,350
we can definitely defeat the strong enemies

409
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,100
and eliminate the Jinyuan Alliance and Di Feisheng.

410
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,700
Of course,

411
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,570
you won't be helping us for nothing.

412
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,630
The Sigu Sect's secret books on martial arts

413
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,890
and exclusive elixirs

414
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,540
will be shared with you guys.

415
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:16,900
That's great.

416
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,380
Great.

417
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,630
That's great.

418
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,620
If Li Xiangyi were still alive,

419
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,360
would he be happy to hear that?

420
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,000
What's wrong?

421
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,030
They're not gathered here for justice.

422
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,880
They just want a share of the profits.

423
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,120
If the revival of the Sigu Sect

424
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,550
can't bring everyone together

425
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,490
for the cause of justice

426
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,250
and makes the martial world even more divided,

427
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,490
what's the point of reviving it?

428
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,490
That's nonsense!

429
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,240
Mind your own business.

430
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,570
You…

431
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:46,940
Am I wrong?

432
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:48,770
Fang Xiaobao.

433
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,640
In my opinion,

434
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:56,560
we now don't know what the Jinyuan Alliance want.

435
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,090
So in the current situation,

436
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,890
if we pit ourselves against them,

437
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,290
many sects will get involved in conflicts.

438
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,980
Therefore, I suggest

439
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,460
staying our hand for now.

440
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,570
Evil forces

441
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,260
must be wiped out.

442
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,170
If we don't do it now,

443
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,350
should we wait until they rule the martial world?

444
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,780
The late Sect Leader Yi Xiangyi

445
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,240
established the Sigu Sect

446
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,060
to keep order in the martial world.

447
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,800
Do you have objections to that?

448
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,000
No.

449
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:38,900
I dare not.

[Yuanbao Villa]

451
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:04,440
[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

452
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:10,980
Are you leaving?

453
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:15,730
Mian.

454
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,910
It's time for me to leave.

455
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,690
The ceremony has just begun

456
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,720
yet you're leaving.

457
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,360
Have you really given up on the Sigu Sect?

458
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,700
I no longer belong in the martial world.

459
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,630
Besides,

460
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,260
the Sigu Sect

461
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,010
has its new leader now.

462
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,430
So,

463
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,650
you have no objection to Zijin being the Sect Leader?

464
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,240
I don't and never did.

465
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:45,620
Mian.

466
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,640
All this time,

467
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,070
I've meant what I said to you

468
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,470
and never lied to you.

469
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,260
Then

470
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,390
where will you go?

471
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,910
No need to worry about me.

472
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,150
Have you forgotten

473
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,610
that I have a mobile house?

474
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,310
I can go wherever I want.

475
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,730
There's such a big world

476
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:10,590
out there.

477
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,040
I can sail out into the sea

478
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,300
or climb up a mountain.

479
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:16,290
I have savings and a dog.

480
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,020
So don't worry about me.

481
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:20,910
That sounds good,

482
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,460
but you're all alone.

483
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,060
You know what?

484
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:31,990
In a blink of an eye,

485
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,880
ten years have passed.

486
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:36,690
Perhaps

487
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,070
it's not so bad an idea

488
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,060
to live like that.

489
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,640
Moreover,

490
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:48,050
it's a little cold on the mountain.

491
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,910
You feel cold?

492
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:50,940
Mian.

493
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,300
I'm a human, not a ghost.

494
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,590
Of course I feel cold.

495
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,950
You never talked about things like this before,

496
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,210
so I was…

497
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,590
I was surprised.

498
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,120
You're so different from Xiangyi.

499
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,080
He never appeared tired.

500
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,100
He was always busy

501
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,300
and barely slept.

502
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,940
Although he was a spendthrift

503
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,280
and liked

504
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,620
to order people around,

505
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:30,440
he could always make great achievements.

506
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,090
And Xiangyi never forgave anyone.

507
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:39,780
Unlike him,

508
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,190
I'm very poor

509
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,830
and just have enough to get by.

510
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,230
I love sleeping somewhere quiet.

511
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:48,750
It's relaxing.

512
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,250
I don't have any enemies.

513
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,830
I forgot to tell you this.

514
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,550
In the past decade,

515
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,010
I've learned to cook,

516
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,120
plant flowers,

517
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,500
and even sew.

518
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,190
I really like my life now.

519
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,390
I…

520
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,410
I need to go help Zijin.

521
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:13,990
Hope I can

522
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,150
get a chance to see your flowers.

523
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,130
I'll be waiting for you.

524
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,060
Yangzhouman.

525
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,360
It's really him.

526
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,370
[Here lies the late Sect Leader of the Sigu Sect, Li Xiangyi]

527
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:30,690
I wrote you a letter in Wanmian's handwriting to invite you here.

528
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:31,620
You really came.

529
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,410
Li Xiangyi.

530
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,580
Li Xiangyi is dead.

531
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,600
His grave is here.

532
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:39,940
Since you're dead,

533
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,140
why did you come back?

534
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,950
Can't you just leave Wanmian alone?

535
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,900
She mourned over you for ten years.

536
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,630
That's ten years of youth.

537
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:49,990
Do you know

538
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,190
how hard it was for her to move on?

539
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:56,490
Do you know how long I waited for her to come around?

540
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,710
Once you came back,

541
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,340
you ruined everything.

542
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:04,810
Zijin.

543
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,440
I'm just here to say congratulations.

544
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,450
I was about to leave.

545
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,880
So don't get me wrong.

546
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:14,930
I know

547
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,920
you and Mian are very close now.

548
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,670
I want to give you two my best wishes.

549
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:22,770
Close?

550
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:24,760
You're alive

551
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,560
and have come back.

552
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,960
How can we still be close?

553
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,020
The moment you let her recognize you,

554
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,120
you took her away from me.

555
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,180
Best wishes?

556
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:39,300
You actually came back to laugh at me, didn't you?

557
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,740
You think too much.

558
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,250
Li Xiangyi.

559
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,840
You're so famous.

560
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,620
People are still telling your story now.

561
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,470
Now that Jiao Liqiao and Di Feisheng have reappeared,

562
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,470
of course you want

563
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,710
to reclaim your reputation too.

564
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,490
That's why you contradicted me

565
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,340
during the reviving ceremony.

566
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,620
I just gave you a piece of sincere advice.

567
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,950
As for what the Sigu Sect

568
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,920
and other martial sects will do,

569
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,420
I won't interfere.

570
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,780
You and Mian love each other.

571
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,560
Even if I'm back,

572
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,560
your relationship won't be affected.

573
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,160
I'm worried

574
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,440
that Mian will abandon me for you.

575
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:21,920
Zijin.

576
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,650
Don't you trust Mian?

577
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,010
As long as you're alive,

578
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,360
I can't trust her.

579
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,500
You said you don't care about anything here.

580
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:31,850
Then promise me

581
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,060
that you'll never come back

582
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,460
and never see Mian again.

583
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,190
If I promise that,

584
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,150
will you believe me?

585
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,120
No.

586
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,800
Li Xiangyi is so willful.

587
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,640
He does whatever he wants.

588
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,770
If you want to steal Mian from me

589
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,110
and take the Sigu Sect back,

590
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,510
how can I stop you?

591
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:54,620
So?

592
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,520
Jump off.

593
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,560
I don't want to kill you.

594
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,780
The cliff is dozens of meters high.

595
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,710
If I jump off it,

596
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:10,690
I'll die for sure.

597
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,490
Bring it on.

598
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,410
Do we have to do this?

599
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:20,970
You know me.

600
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,660
I mean what I say.

601
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,740
Fast and clean.

602
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:44,860
You're still as arrogant as you used to be.

603
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,370
Zijin.

604
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,340
I don't want to fight you.

605
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,200
What if I insist

606
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,290
on fighting to the death?

607
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,120
Wait!

608
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,440
What are you doing?

609
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,410
What are you doing?

610
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,210
Mian.

611
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,040
Zijin recognized me.

612
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,280
It's been so long since I last sparred with him.

613
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,790
So we just had a match.

614
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:09,380
He has improved a lot.

615
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:11,220
Okay.

616
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,110
I see.

617
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:18,320
Zijin.

618
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,440
I wanted to tell you that he's Xiangyi,

619
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:22,840
but he wouldn't stay

620
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,860
and doesn't want to bother us.

621
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:29,380
Yes. It's time for me to leave.

622
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,680
Take care.

623
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:47,830
Zijin.

624
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:50,890
Even if he's back,

625
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:53,770
things have changed.

626
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:55,760
He left,

627
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,360
but I'm still by your side.

628
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,490
Can you be relieved now?

629
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,340
From now on,

630
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,260
let's forget about the past.

631
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,310
Stop seeing him as an enemy,

632
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:13,870
will you?

633
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:40,670
Welcome back.

634
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:43,800
Have you taken this place as your home?

635
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,690
I feel hungry

636
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,150
and saw the Lotus Tower when I went down the mountain.

637
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,390
I seldom cook.

638
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:49,850
You're lucky today.

639
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:50,730
Come, sit down.

640
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,180
Eat while they're hot.

641
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:54,130
What are you waiting for?

642
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,190
Eat before they get cold.

643
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,050
Come. Sit down.

644
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,120
Help yourself.

645
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,150
Come on.

646
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:00,110
Why did you go down the mountain?

647
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,570
The Sigu Sect needs all the help they can get.

648
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,140
I thought you'd stay there,

649
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,340
do your job,

650
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,930
and make some great achievements.

651
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,450
Isn't that your dream?

652
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,310
That's not the Sigu Sect I want to revive.

653
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,820
They should give it a new name.

654
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,150
Maybe the Revenge Sect.

655
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:19,710
You can't expect everyone to meet your standards.

656
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:21,690
I know.

657
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,050
But the Sigu Sect now

658
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,890
is encouraging big sects to merge and expand

659
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,680
in the name of annihilating the Jinyuan Alliance.

660
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,500
No one gives a fig

661
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,880
about those small sects.

662
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,790
It's so unfair.

663
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,590
The Sigu Sect back then would never do this.

664
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,380
In my opinion,

665
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,780
Li Xiangyi and the Sigu Sect

666
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,450
have become empty words they use to justify their wrongdoing.

667
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,970
Li Xiangyi wasn't always right.

668
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,650
I'm older than you.

669
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,730
I've heard a lot about him.

670
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,230
When he was young,

671
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,800
he was very petulant.

672
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:01,030
The downfall of the Sigu Sect

673
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,120
was partly his fault.

674
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,620
Someone said that

675
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,280
to me before.

676
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:11,990
But I've studied him,

677
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,210
he should be proud of himself!

678
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,650
There's a fine line

679
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,540
between proud and arrogant.

680
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,400
"Arrogant" is not a good word.

681
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,940
He was proud

682
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,910
because he had faith.

683
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:28,890
Faith is a great word.

684
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,620
No one is perfect.

685
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:31,590
Neither was he.

686
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:33,170
There are shadows

687
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,590
wherever there is light.

688
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:35,640
Yes.

689
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,640
Maybe Li Xiangyi was too proud.

690
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,380
But he established the Sigu Sect

691
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,040
to make the martial world a better place

692
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,820
where the strong didn't prey on the weak.

693
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,880
Look at those guys.

694
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,740
They're just a bunch of selfish posers!

695
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,630
If Li Xiangyi knew that someone could understand him

696
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:56,960
so well ten years later,

697
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:58,860
he'd be very glad.

698
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,660
Fang Duobing.

699
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,190
It's a pity that you're not a cook.

700
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,790
This is just one of my knacks.

701
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,300
Don't underestimate me.

702
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,300
Cherish me.

703
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,910
I didn't underestimate you.

704
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:31,950
To be honest,

705
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:34,930
I'm determined to make my own way in the martial world.

706
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,890
It's fine that you don't see me as your friend,

707
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,750
but don't see me like a kid either.

708
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,310
I only have one request.

709
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,910
Don't play tricks

710
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,360
to send me back to the Tianji Hall again, will you?

711
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,890
It was hard for me to escape.

712
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,530
Give it to me.

713
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,330
Let's put an end to the past.

714
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,350
Here.

715
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:09,380
To my new friend.

716
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:10,870
What?

717
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,750
Your new friend?

718
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,130
My best friend.

719
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:19,090
Wait.

720
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,920
Did you put something in the wine?

721
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,719
I've drunk it.

722
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,750
You've played me so many times.

723
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,420
I can handle it one more time.

724
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:32,900
You drink like a fish.

725
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,150
Since we're best friends now,

726
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,239
I won't keep anything from you.

727
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,699
I have to tell you something.

728
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:44,139
I just learned that Shan Gudao was not my uncle.

729
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,550
He was my father.

730
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:51,510
You've found out about that?

731
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:54,560
Y-You knew it?

732
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,909
What else are you hiding from me?

733
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,440
I just found it out.

734
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:03,130
When I was investigating the real cause of your father's death,

735
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:04,680
I learned that by accident.

736
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,350
The real cause?

737
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,300
Shan Gudao

738
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,450
was not killed by the Jinyuan Alliance.

739
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:20,910
But his death

740
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,790
started the dispute

741
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:25,450
between the Sigu Sect and the Jinyuan Alliance.

742
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:28,740
I think someone is pulling the strings

743
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,330
for a bigger goal.

744
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:34,220
It involves the Yu City,

745
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,420
the Yipin Tomb,

746
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,640
the Yuanbao Villa,

747
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,690
and the ice shard.

748
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:44,110
Nanyin played an important role in it.

749
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,560
But that's not all.

750
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,040
My biological mother

751
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,770
gave me a painting

752
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,730
of the ice shard.

753
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:00,880
Look.

754
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,200
How did your mother

755
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,760
get the ice shard?

756
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,930
Maybe it had something to do with Shan Gudao.

757
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,280
I've studied it carefully.

758
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,680
It's a key to some device.

759
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,390
There's probably more than one of them.

760
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:20,860
Perhaps someone wants to gather them

761
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,280
to open something.

762
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,080
My Lord.

763
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,960
Since you came back from Qingfeng Peak,

764
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,510
you've been so busy

765
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,240
that you haven't gotten time

766
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,440
to have a proper meal.

767
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:03,910
I prepared those dishes for you.

768
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,150
I've been thinking

769
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,650
if you're so busy

770
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,660
because I didn't

771
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,280
do my job well.

772
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,300
You've been doing great.

773
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,340
You helped me a lot by poisoning Qiao Wanmian

774
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,520
at Qingfeng Peak.

775
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,540
Sorry that I took action

776
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,110
without your permission.

777
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,280
I said you helped me a lot.

778
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,540
Why are you so nervous?

779
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,590
You're a better tactician

780
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,290
than me.

781
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:46,460
With you looking out for me,

782
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,220
I feel at ease.

783
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,380
I'm so happy

784
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:07,740
to get your recognition.

785
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,970
I'd like to drink to you

786
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,480
to thank you for your appreciation.

787
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:24,760
Gongyang Wumen said

788
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,970
only Yangzhouman can detoxify

789
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,600
the Iced Cicada he made.

790
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:33,260
I didn't expect that your inner power could detoxify it too.

791
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:38,360
Are you saying that Li Xiangyi's inner power is stronger than mine?

792
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,240
That came out wrong.

793
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,440
I'll drink as a punishment.

794
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:46,650
How many years have you been with me?

795
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,150
13 years.

796
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:52,900
All these years,

797
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,550
I've never asked you what you want.

798
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,280
I don't want anything.

799
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:01,270
I love you wholeheartedly.

800
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:02,990
But

801
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,920
the time has come for you to get married.

802
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,350
All I want

803
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,160
is to become your last

804
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,780
and only woman.

805
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,510
I'll get married,

806
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:19,250
but not to a woman whose background is a mystery.

807
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,710
You're a descendant of the royal family of Nanyin

808
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,240
but you never mentioned it.

809
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:30,790
How did you…

810
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:31,770
How did I know?

811
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,560
You're smart,

812
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:39,990
but you should know better than to get smart with me.

813
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,750
You misunderstood me, My Lord.

814
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,620
Since I started working for you,

815
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,780
I've believed that I belong with you.

816
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,790
That's why I never mentioned my motherland.

817
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:51,270
Fine.

818
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:52,910
Let me ask you.

819
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,880
Is there anyone else from Nanyin in the Central Plains?

820
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:57,850
My Lord.

821
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,140
I'm loyal to you

822
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:02,810
and have given you all my attention.

823
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,510
I don't know any other people from Nanyin.

824
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,070
Jiao Liqiao.

825
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:09,250
You never learn.

826
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,880
You never understand

827
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,610
what I really want.

828
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,900
From now on,

829
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,290
you can't interfere with anything in the Alliance.

830
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:19,810
My Lord.

831
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,570
Listen.

832
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,110
You don't belong with me,

833
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,180
but you may belong

834
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,680
with the traitors I killed with my sword.

835
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,070
He has found out

836
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,760
that I'm a descendant of the royal family of Nanyin.

837
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,780
What else does he know

838
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,600
besides that?

839
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,880
Don't let me find out who tipped him off

840
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,620
and made him suspicious.

841
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,830
Or I'll make them wish they were dead.

842
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,270
Don't panic, Saintess.

843
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,230
Go tell Feng Qing

844
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,940
to clean up the Thunder Hall.

845
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,000
Director Di can't know anything

846
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,800
about the gunpowder purchase.

847
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:58,850
Saintess,

848
00:40:59,150 --> 00:40:59,700
I think

849
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:02,360
you should look out for yourself now.

850
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,520
Saintess, why don't you

851
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:07,150
rally your supporters in the martial world

852
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,320
and use them as your backup?

853
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,500
You'll have no worries then.

854
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,070
In my eyes,

855
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,410
those people are just a bunch of nobodies.

856
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:16,880
They're useful,

857
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:18,760
but all of them combined

858
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,050
are not comparable to Director Di.

859
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,660
Director Di is very powerful,

860
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,450
but you need to harden your heart

861
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:26,150
to get him under your control.

862
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,220
Just doing whatever he says

863
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,880
may have the opposite effect.

864
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:32,250
Do you know how they tame an eagle

865
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,800
on the prairie?

866
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,900
They crush its pride

867
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:36,990
and shatter its ego

868
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,570
to reinvent it.

869
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:40,940
The eagle will still be aggressive

870
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:41,960
and very fierce

871
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,840
when released,

872
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,250
but it'll only take orders from one person.

873
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:50,710
Snow Master.

874
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,380
Bring me that incense.

875
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:53,450
Yes.

876
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,480
What are you eating, Fox Spirit?

877
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:11,920
Li Lianhua.

878
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,580
You said my father's death

879
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,430
may be related to something he did.

880
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:16,110
I found

881
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,290
that he used to have four capable assistants

882
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:19,790
called Four Tigers with Silver Spears.

883
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:21,090
Two of them died on the battlefield.

884
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,080
One is missing.

885
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,960
The last one Liu Rujing

886
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,640
is a guard at the Ma Fortress in Fengzhou now.

887
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,900
It's not far from here.

888
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,470
If it's not far,

889
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:30,860
why didn't he come to Xiao Zijin's wedding?

890
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,270
Since the Sigu Sect disbanded,

891
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:34,430
he's been holding a grudge against Xiao Zijin.

892
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:36,360
Sounds like we need to go visit him.

893
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:37,850
Now?

894
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:39,260
Can you handle that?

895
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,070
I'm fine.

896
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:41,510
Well,

897
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:45,210
Ms. Qiao hasn't finished her wedding.

898
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:47,120
Won't you stay for her wedding?

899
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,090
No need.

900
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:53,670
Why are you looking at me?

901
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,330
Is there something on my face?

902
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:56,940
Look at you.

903
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,680
You look weak

904
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,350
and are just ordinary-looking.

905
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:02,580
What does

906
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:05,270
the most beautiful woman in the world see in you?

907
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,520
Shut up. You know nothing.

908
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,340
I know a lot!

909
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,220
The way Ms. Qiao looks at you

910
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,310
is very different.

911
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,650
Fang Xiaobao, how old are you?

912
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:16,690
You can already read women's minds?

913
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,640
She's just grateful to me for saving her life.

914
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,350
Understand?

915
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:20,790
Don't you miss Ms. Qiao?

916
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:26,110
If you want to take her away,

917
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:27,810
I can help you.

918
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,670
Let me repeat it.

919
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,540
We're not right for each other.

920
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:34,360
I mean it.

921
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,220
Many people oppose

922
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,170
their marriage.

923
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,100
They all say that Xiao Zijin

924
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:40,700
used to be Li Xiangyi's subordinate.

925
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,440
Everyone thinks the two of them are indebted to Li Xiangyi.

926
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,770
That's what Mian wants.

927
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,840
She deserves the best in the world.

928
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,760
Li Xiangyi

929
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,290
was not a good match for her.

930
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:52,430
Let's go.

931
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,720
Pack your things.

932
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:54,900
Are you a detective or not?

933
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,150
What have you been thinking all day?

934
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:57,600
Mock yourself all you want,

935
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,020
but you can't speak ill of my Master!
