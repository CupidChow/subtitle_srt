Look.

There's a river pebble here.

126
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,460
It's just a pebble.

127

What's so special about it?

128
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,330
There is no underground river under the dry well.

129

Where did the river pebble come from?

130

Look.

135
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,180
This should be the entrance of a mining cave.

136
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,180
But it seems to be sealed on purpose.

137

00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,160
Wait.

139
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,350
When the stagnant air in the mine meets naked flames,

140
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,340
it might trigger an explosion.

141
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,140
I heard it exploded several times before.

142
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:43,980
Be careful.

143
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,730
Take cover for now.

144
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,060
So not all emeralds in Xiaoyuan City

There are still some hidden clusters.

147
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,500
The biggest cluster

148
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,430
is right under the Baishui Garden.

149
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,580
Look.

150
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,680
There is an emerald bed here

151
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,030
and a teapot.

152
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:44,920
Looks like

153
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,980
someone recently practiced martial arts here.

154
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,780
This should be the Hell Mansion.

155
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,280
In the past, when the King of Hell got married,

156
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,130
he only targeted unmarried women.

157
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,590
Now, he abducted my mother

158
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,020
just because we bought this mansion.

159
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,420
He sure went out of his way

160
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,430
to protect the emeralds here.

161
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,100
Something's not right.

162
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,000
Think about it.

163
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,050
If he wanted to keep this mansion,

164
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,420
why did he

165
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,830
pretend to die in the fire?

166
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,580
After he died,

167
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,610
the mansion would naturally belong to someone else.

168
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,100
He won't be able to hide himself like this.

169
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,200
There's no need to do this.

170
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,150
Was an enemy hunting him,

171
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,090
so he left in a hurry?

172
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,330
Even if he wanted to hide,

173
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,450
he wouldn't have

174
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,310
pretended to be the King of Hell looking for a bride.

175
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,890
He must have done it out of lust, then.

176
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,420
I don't think Lian Quan is that kind of person.

177
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,260
Don't think too much now.

178
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,580
Let's go search somewhere else.

179
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,370
Why is the body on the ground missing its lower half?

180
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,570
Where did his legs go?

181
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,940
Maybe he never had legs.

182
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,100
Look.

183
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,080
The bone frame on the wall is complete.

184
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,160
But this one on the ground

185
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,120
was cut off from its waist.

186
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,770
Could they be Niutou Mamian?

187
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,360
Look.

188
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,640
The ribs are black in colour.

189
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,420
It does look like the work of Bizhong Strike.

190
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,330
They must have suffered

191
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,370
a lot when they were alive.

192
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,700
Did the Lord of the Netherworld

193
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,300
fall out with Niutou Mamian,

194
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,430
so he tricked them here to kill them

195
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,460
and cruelly separate their bodies?

196
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,240
The Lord of the Netherworld

197
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,370
is really vicious.

198
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,020
It's strange.

199
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,530
What is?

200
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,410
I think

201
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,560
something is wrong with this body.

202
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,460
If he left Niutou Mamian here to rot,

203
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,640
then who is cooperating with Lian Quan outside?

204
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:05,780
Young Master.

205
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,980
I feel a little dizzy.

206
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:10,620
Oh no.

207
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,220
I think there's poison here.

208
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,420
Let's get out of here.

209
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,850
This is not emerald.

210
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,620
It's a kind of ore that commonly grows alongside emeralds,

211
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,580
called emerald jade.

212
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,200
The two ores you found

213
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,700
look almost identical.

214
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,940
But they have very different effects.

215
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,550
The emerald jade is not only worthless,

216
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,130
but also highly poisonous.

217
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,560
If people stay near the mine long enough,

218
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,430
they may start to cough up blood from the lungs.

219
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,510
This ore will also explode when ignited.

220
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,150
However,

221
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,920
emeralds love to form alongside these jades.

222
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,100
It's inevitable that accidents happen when mining.

223
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,990
Later, people thought of

224
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,510
marking the emerald jades when they stumbled upon them.

225
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,660
This way, if the locals see it,

226
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,100
they will avoid it.

227
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,130
It's really hard to tell them apart.

228
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,270
It's hard for ordinary people to tell.

229
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,090
If it weren't for people like us

230
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,970
who have been miners for decades,

231
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,880
who can tell the difference?

232
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:15,980
Thank you.

233
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,420
Goodbye.

234
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,150
I don't understand.

235
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,150
Why are you wasting your time here?

236
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,420
What does it have to do with us

237
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,350
if this is emerald or emerald jade?

238
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,400
I understand now.

239
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,400
What do you understand?

240
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,710
I know why Lian Quan

241
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,400
had to put up the whole

242
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,960
King of Hell's wedding act.

243
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,090
Actually, when Lian Quan first arrived here,

244
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,090
he couldn't tell the two ores apart.

245
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,700
If he practiced his martial arts

246
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,890
on emerald jades instead of emeralds,

247
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,030
what do you think will happen?

248
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,610
By right, the Bizhong Strike

249
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:58,910
needs to use the emerald

250
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,990
to detoxify.

251
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,710
Doing this will only make the poison seep deeper,

252
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,860
possibly into his bone marrows.

253
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,450
I heard that there's a cruel technique

254
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,110
called Yunuqiao.

255
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,920
It can use one's inner power to transfer

256
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,740
the poison to a girl's body without hurting one's inner breath.

257
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,620
Out of greed, Lian Quan

258
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,300
continued to maintain his power

259
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,690
by using emerald jades.

260
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,460
At the same time, he consistently

261
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,660
transferred the poison to innocent girls.

262
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,850
It's so vicious.

263
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,400
My mother is still in his hands.

We have to save her first.

We'll talk about the rest later.

269

Let's look for clues separately.

Suhua's body?

285
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:46,790
There is a deep cave at the foot of the mountain.

286
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,720
It rained heavily a few days ago

287
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,400
and several bodies were washed out.

288
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,640
They were all the bodies of the girls abducted by the King of Hell.

the poison palm left over by Yunuqiao.

but a criminal?

Their families practiced different trades.

I'm not sure.

Did Suhua see a physician before she died?

That day, S-Suhua's mother had a headache.

eventually led a wealthy life

515
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,310
and didn't want to partake

516
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,750
in such a dangerous venture anymore.

517
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,900
I didn't expect that after all these years,

518
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,700
I escaped the Jinyuan Alliance,

519
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,960
but couldn't escape Baichuan Court.

520
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,820
Many years ago,

521
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,670
I met the Lord of the Netherworld

522
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:03,880
once.

523
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,870
Why do you look so different from him?

524
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:13,530
I accidentally used the emerald jade to practice

525
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:14,770
and was badly poisoned.

526
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,410
My appearance had long changed.

527
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:18,750
If I hadn't used the Sanskrit technique to change my skin,

528
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,410
I wouldn't even appear human.

529
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,070
A Sanskrit technique for changing your skin?

530
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,470
It's a secret technique.

531
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,310
Only a few enlightened monks

532
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:28,090
can acquire the method from the Sanskrit scripts.

533
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:29,390
It can transform a person anew

534
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,190
and completely change one's appearance.

535
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,320
Completely change one's appearance?

536
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:37,780
All right, I've told you everything I know.

537
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,170
You also got the Rama Heavenly Ice.

538
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,370
Please let me go.

539
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,410
Let you go?

540
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:43,860
Have you ever let those girls

541
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,390
who were murdered by you go?

542
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,110
I'll make you pay

543
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,350
for all your crimes.

544
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,660
This is an important matter.

545
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,620
I'm going to ask the All-Knowing Mr. Su

546
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,820
to verify whether the Ice is real or not.

547
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,270
I'll leave you to escort Lian Quan.

548
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:02,630
Let’s split up.

549
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,230
Since the Rama Heavenly Ice is so important,

550
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,430
I can’t let you go off on your own with it.

551
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,760
I should go with you.

552
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,920
You still don't trust me,

553
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,260
right?

554
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,170
It's only right that I don't trust you.

555
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,470
If we go together,

556
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,650
what will happen to Lian Quan?

557
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,380
Should we leave him at the post?

558
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,940
Fang Duobing is here.

559
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,720
It's safer to lock Lian Quan

560
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,420
in the Baishui Garden bought by the Fang family

561
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,790
than in the post.

562
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,000
You need not worry.

563
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,460
Okay.

564
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,290
Come with me then.

565
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,780
Sister Shi.

566
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,880
What are you going to do with Lian Quan?

567
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,270
Three days.

568
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,960
I'll be back in three days.

569
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:50,890
I'll leave Lian Quan with you in the meanwhile.

570
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,740
Alright, I'll interrogate him then.

571
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,070
Interrogate Lian Quan?

572
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,180
Is he hiding something?

573
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,910
I think he is.

574
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:01,180
I'll find a way to make him talk in the next three days.

575
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,070
Bashi.

576
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,940
You're so skilled.

577
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:18,580
You can knead the dough in one hand and cut the dough in the other.

578
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,790
My mother said

579
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,370
if the neighbors saw it,

580
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:24,620
they would think that the dough wasn't kneaded enough.

581
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,140
But I'm strong.

582
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,160
I'm used to it.

583
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,560
I can't change my habit.

584
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,430
Can't change your habit.

585
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,200
The one who intercepted

586
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,380
and the one who used Yunuqiao were both the physician.

587
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,840
He struck with both palms.

588
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,750
But the one who snuck into Baishui Garden

589
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,070
had the habit of using one palm.

590
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,470
There's another person.

591
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:46,820
Who is this person?

592
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,190
Two fried dough sticks.

593
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:48,710
Okay.

594
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,180
I'll put the money here.

595
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:54,730
Bashi.

596
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,870
Why did you put the money

597
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,040
in a bowl of water?

598
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:01,060
M-my hands are greasy.

599
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,410
I dirty the money when I touch them.

600
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:05,710
I see.

601
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,440
Incense ashes.

602
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:44,090
Tianji Hall's products are all the best.

603
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,220
This Liushui octagonal cage

604
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,580
was specially built overnight for you.

605
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:10,710
The flowing water will help you detoxify and keep you alive.

606
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,250
Very considerate, isn't it?

607
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:12,890
But...

608
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,970
If you don't tell us who your accomplice is,

609
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,750
you won't be able to enjoy the life-saving water.

610
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,110
What accomplice?

611
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,440
Stop pretending.

612
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,170
When I chased you that day,

613
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,570
someone covered for you.

614
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,500
Did the poison enter your brain

615
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,630
and make you forget?

616
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,580
That was just a thief I hired.

617
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,880
Every time I abduct someone,

618
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,610
I hire a thief from the underworld to act as a decoy

619
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,070
so I can strike easily.

620
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:46,330
I pay them when the deed is done

621
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,840
and we never associate with each other again.

622
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,450
Never associate with each other again?

623
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,580
That can't be right.

624
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,340
I remember my mother's Bone-breaking Pearl

625
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,460
landed a solid hit on the intruder.

626
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,300
The Bone-breaking Pearl strikes deep into the bones.

627
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,210
But just now,

628
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,330
I saw no trace of such injury on you.

629
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:03,920
The only explanation is,

630
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,220
you were not the one struck by the Bone-breaking Pearl.

631
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:06,980
It's possible that you hired a thief

632
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,610
to abduct someone for you.

633
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:11,400
But to bear the Bone-breaking Pearl for you,

634
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,930
that's not worth the price.

635
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,160
Tell me.

636
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:16,370
Where is your accomplice?

637
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:21,260
You're quite stubborn.

638
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,320
Ms. He, please.

639
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,890
It's been a long time since I made a mechanism overnight.

640
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:31,820
Because of you,

641
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,090
I stayed up all night.

642
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:37,070
These mechanical hands

643
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:40,190
specialize in poking the most itchy and painful acupoints.

644
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,420
It can change its target seven times in two hours.

645
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,310
Sometimes, it'll make you cry out of pain.

646
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:47,120
Other times, it'll make you laugh till you're breathless.

647
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,920
Be sensible.

648
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,290
Just answer

649
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,770
whatever Xiaobao asks.

650
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,870
Otherwise, prepare to suffer.

651
00:35:06,739 --> 00:35:07,219
Tell me.

652
00:35:07,699 --> 00:35:09,100
Where is the accomplice?

653
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:14,389
Looks like you're prepared to die.

654
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,590
Let me tell you.

655
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:18,639
I haven't settled the scores with you for abducting me.

656
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:20,570
Let's see how long you can hold out.

657
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:24,210
By the way,

658
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,550
I haven't named the mechanism yet.

659
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:31,260
Let's call it the Lotus Acupoint Fingers.

660
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,820
Fang Xiaobao.

661
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:33,900
What do you think?

662
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,970
Call me when he confesses.

663
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,070
You brat.

664
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,170
You're good at avoiding work.

665
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,490
[Hanshui Temple]

666
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,510
Master, you're so composed.

667
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,190
The Bone-breaking Pearl must have hurt a lot.

668
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,530
Oh, wait.

669
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,910
I shouldn't call you Master.

670
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:10,790
Should I call you Niutou,

671
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:12,530
or Mamian?

672
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:15,170
Didn't you see

673
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,690
Niutou Manian's bodies in the mine?

674
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:19,920
You're right.

675
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:20,990
Yes.

676
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,690
When I first saw

677
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:24,630
the two bodies in the mine,

678
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,420
I did suspect that they were Niutou Mamian.

679
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:29,670
But out of the two corpses,

680
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,310
one was heavier than the other.

681
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,420
The legless body had

682
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,160
a much wider pelvis bone.

683
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,740
It belonged to a woman.

684
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:41,110
So the people who died in the mine

685
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,620
were not Niutou Mamian,

686
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,940
but Lian Quan and his wife.

687
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,200
Am I right?

688
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,350
Smart people are indeed hard to deal with.

689
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:52,170
But you're only half right.

690
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,360
You killed Lian Quan and his wife,

691
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,060
stole Lian Quan's secret book,

692
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,310
and mastered the Bizhong Strike. But you feared being hunted by his enemies,

693
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:01,940
so you disguised Lian Quan and his wife's bodies

694
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,780
into their current state.

695
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:04,910
Right?

696
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:08,240
We didn't kill Lian Quan for his martial arts.

697
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,830
We did it to protect ourselves.

698
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,330
Many years ago,

699
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:30,970
we were discriminated against by others for our appearance.

700
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:32,960
But Lian Quan thought highly of us.

701
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,690
We were very grateful.

702
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:38,130
So, when the Jinyuan Alliance surrounded Lian Quan's mansion

703
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,810
for the Rama Heavenly Ice,

704
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,160
we risked our lives to help him escape

705

[Niutou, Li Xiao]

[Mamian, Li Xiong]

707
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:45,070
and fled to Xiaoyuan City to live in hiding.

708
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,970
But he married

709
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:49,000
a frivolous woman here,

710
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:50,690
and started to suspect us.

711
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,030
He thought we were preying on that woman.

712
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,040
Lian Quan lured us into the mine

713
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:59,050
with the excuse of teaching us Bizhong Strike.

714
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,580
Then, he made us practice on

715
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,890
the poisonous emerald jade instead of emerald.

716
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:05,690
By the time we found out, we were already poisoned.

717
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,640
He thought we would die down there from the poison.

718
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:12,610
But my younger brother, Li Xiong, reversed the skill

719
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:15,010
and transferred all the toxins to himself.

720
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,890
Then, he separated our bodies.

721
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,940
Although I lost my lower limbs,

722
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,000
I was not poisoned.

723
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,490
I was able to move with the help of mechanisms.

724
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:25,570
But my brother was poisoned and in critical condition.

725
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,150
Brother.

726
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:27,400
Brother!

727
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,150
Don't!

728
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:28,820
Brother!

729
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,210
I was in a hurry to save my brother's life

730
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,500
and tried many ways.

731
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,300
Then, I finally found out that the abbot of Hanshui Temple

732
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,260
owned the Yunuqiao mental codes that could detoxicate and save lives.

[Hanshui Temple]

734
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:43,230
I killed the abbot, stole the book, and kept my brother alive.

735
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,100
After that,

736
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,250
I used the identity of the abbot of Hanshui Temple

737

[Hanshui Temple]

738

-and take revenge on Lian Quan.
-Brother.

[Yunuqiao Mental Codes]

743
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:57,760
Madam.

744
00:38:58,090 --> 00:38:59,020
At last, one day,

745
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:02,110
I managed to lure Lian Quan into the mine

746
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,250
and killed him and that woman.

747
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,570
Then, I disguised the bodies

748
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:07,130
to look like us.

749
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,790
This way, even if the Jinyuan Alliance finds out,

750
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,630
they won't suspect us.

751
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,460
Everything was perfect.

752
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,970
But while we avoided the Jinyuan Alliance,

753
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:26,500
we couldn't avoid you guys.

754
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,790
My brother, Lee Xiong,

755
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:29,250
has been captured, right?

He's in the hands of the Baichuan Court.

757
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,830
Fortunately, I'm not that unlucky.

758
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,320
God gave me

759
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,580
a chance to survive.

760
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,760
Your identity has been exposed.

761
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:41,430
You still want to survive?

762
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,890
With Li Xiangyi, the leader of the Sigu Sect here,

763
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:44,920
of course I can.

764
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,520
That day, you used Whirling Steps when you were chasing me.

765
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,380
Sect Leader Li,

766
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:50,820
you can't fool me.

If it were Lee Xiangyi,

768
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:56,110
do you think you could have escaped?

769
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,520
Sect Leader Li,

770
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,910
you came all the way to Xiaoyan City.

771
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,190
Surely, your goal is the Rama Heavenly Ice,

772
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,990
just like the Jinyuan Alliance.

773
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,480
Promise me one condition,

774
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,460
and I'll happily give you the Rama Heavenly Ice.

775
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,860
The Baichuan Court has already acquired it

776
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,920
from your brother.

777
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,430
That one is naturally a fake.

778
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,840
We have no one to depend on.

779
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:22,220
The Rama Heavenly Ice is our lifesaver.

I have to keep it until the end.

781
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,070
But now I have you, Li Xiangyi.

782
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,770
I can give the Ice away.

783

Sect Leader Li.

784
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:30,070
Promise me,

785
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,880
and the Rama Heavenly Ice is yours.

786
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,260
Otherwise, I'll hand it over to the Jinyuan Alliance.

787
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,180
Although they are not as trustworthy as you,

788
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,580
they're still capable of keeping us alive.

789
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,020
Tell me.

790
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,110
What do you want me to do?

791
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,960
Save my brother Li Xiong

792
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,210
and cure his Bizhong Strike poison.

793
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,120
I know.

794
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:51,760
The Yangzhouman is the best inner power in the world.

795

You're too optimistic.

798
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,810
I'm no longer a member of the Baichuan Court.

799
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:02,290
I'm wanted on the Blade List.

800
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,430
I can't save your brother.

801
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,540
That's your problem now.

802
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,350
It has nothing to do with me.

803
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:11,390
I know you're close to Fang Duobing,

804
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,280
the detective of Baichuan Court.

805
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,720
You might be able to use him for this.

806
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:16,890
Finally,

807
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:18,670
Sect Leader Li, let me remind you.

808
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,930
You only have two days.

809
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:20,860
Once the time is up,

810
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:23,060
I'll ask the Jinyuan Alliance for help.

811
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,730
You better hurry up.

812
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:28,620
Looks like I'll have to offend Fang Xiaobao again.

813
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,480
It's not a big deal to promise you.

814
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,750
But I'm worried.

815
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,170
Sect Leader Li.

816
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,160
What are you worried about?

817
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,710
Your brother's Ice is fake.

818
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,700
I have to check if your Ice

819
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:42,850
is real.

820
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,950
Li Xiangyi is a man of his word.

821
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,560
I believe you won’t take the treasure by force.

822
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,160
You don't have to threaten me with my past reputation.

823
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,420
I'm only confirming its authenticity.

824
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,880
I won't snatch it from you.

825
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:17,850
Deal.

826
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,160
Fang Xiaobao.

827
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,270
Why did you lock the prison?

828
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:25,890
The physician hasn't confessed yet.

829
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:27,740
Your mechanism poked him

830
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,790
till he was frothing in the mouth, yet he was silent.

831
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:31,850
It means he won't tell on his partner.

832
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,440
It's useless to force him.

833
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:37,290
Even the mechanism made by me, the Tianji Hall Sect Master,

834
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:38,490
can't get him to fess up?

835
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:39,860
I refuse to admit defeat.

836
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:40,300
Go.

837
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,480
Open the door.

838
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,760
Let me improve

839
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:44,260
the Lotus Acupoint Fingers.

840
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:44,900
No need.

841
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,580
Let's try another way.

842
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,980
He's willing to protect his partner's identity with his life.

843
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,180
It means they are very close.

844
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,620
He will definitely come to save him.

845
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,460
I've set up traps

846
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,480
all around Bashui Garden.

847
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,540
If he dares to come,

848
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:54,850
I won't let him escape.

849
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,520
What are you doing here again?

850
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,340
I thought about it.

851
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:20,630
Since I'm on the Blade List,

852
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,540
there's no point in hiding.

853
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:26,420
So,

854
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:28,940
you're here to turn yourself in?

855
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,620
I have no other choice.

856
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,660
Why don't we work together again?
