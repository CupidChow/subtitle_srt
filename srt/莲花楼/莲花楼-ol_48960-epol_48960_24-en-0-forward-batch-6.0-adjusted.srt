4
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:46,930
Do you remember the rose of Sharon that was covered in mud?

5
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:49,830
The ten-foot-tall rose of Sharon was also covered in mud.

6
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,910
It was because the mud splashed a little high.

7
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,210
There is nothing special.

8
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,729
The whereabouts of the rest of Yu Louchun's body

9
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:55,800
is still unknown.

10
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,320
So the guards dug deep

11
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,350
for the antidote.

12
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,660
That reminded me.

13
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:02,800
They dug holes everywhere

14
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,200
and splashed a lot of mud.

15
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,620
Connect the two things

16
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,020
and think about it again.

17
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,139
Someone dug a hole under the tree

18
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:17,820
and splashed mud on the rose of Sharon.

19
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,180
That is to say,

20
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,750
Yu Louchun was buried here.

21
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,320
I guess the murderer

22
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,260
had already prepared this burial place

23
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,720
before the Mountains Red.

24
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,260
The darkest place is under the candlestick.

25
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,140
Dig.

26
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:42,210
Look.

27
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,450
It's really here.

28
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,550
Let me have a look.

29
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,250
The reason why they threw the stump out to attract attention

30
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,860
and hid the corpse secretly

31
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,530
is that they wanted to hide the real cause of Yu Louchun's death.

32
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,590
It looks as if he was bitten by a snake.

33
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,740
Could it be that a venomous snake bit him to death?

34
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,200
Brown-spotted pit viper.

35
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,450
His blood contained snake venom.

36
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,900
That's why the blood on the stump didn't coagulate or dry.

37
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,600
It made people believe that Yu Louchun died in the morning.

38
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,710
In fact, he was killed

39
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,110
between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m.

40
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,830
Xinjue didn't stay at the foot of the mountain at that time.

41
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,090
Then who is Bihuang's accomplice?

42
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,300
Bihuang will come and tell us

43
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,560
who her accomplice is.

44
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:33,300
Let's hear what she will say then.

45
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,980
She'll come to us?

46
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,450
Judging by the personality of Qing'er,

47
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,010
she'll tell Bihuang because she's worried about her.

48
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,110
So let's go back and wait for her.

49
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,820
She came earlier than expected.

50
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,480
I got a valuable thing by chance.

51
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,980
I heard it's exactly what you've been looking for.

52
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,110
If you two show mercy

53
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,630
and stop investigating Girls' Mansion,

54
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,870
I'll give it to you

55
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,520
to show my gratitude.

56
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,580
This letter was written by Bihuang.

57
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,780
She has the ice shard.

58
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,620
Finding out the truth

59
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,380
and punishing criminals are the duties of detectives.

60
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,840
But Bihuang was abducted,

61
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,079
imprisoned, and maltreated.

62
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,540
She's really a poor woman.

63
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,230
The law is objective,

64
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:27,269
but if Bihuang hadn't killed Yu Louchun,

65
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:29,930
her miserable life wouldn't have come to an end.

66
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,930
I don't know

67
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,370
if I should continue the investigation.

68
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,610
If you stop, you're a kind person.

69
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,890
If you keep investigating, you're a detective.

What happened?

97
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,140
I heard you suspected Bihuang.

98
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,360
I was worried.

99
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,110
So I came and told her.

100
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,980
But she asked me to go to the kitchen and cook porridge for her.

101
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,500
When I came back, I saw the room was on fire.

I wanted to save her.

But the fire spread too fast.

105
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,659
Even I was trapped inside too.

106
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,900
Why did it happen?

107
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,260
Isn't it said that karma is real?

108

Sister Bihuang.

110
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,230
People who believe in God and worship deities always say karma is real.

111
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,820
But if they really want to redress an injustice,

112

they have to rely on people.

We've been looking for it for so long.

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,530
It was hidden by this thing.

125
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,500
This is similar to the Jinyun Fabric at the banquet.

126
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,340
It was woven into the shape of the wall.

127
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,290
It managed to evade the search.

128

The person is really good at embroidery.

129

Why is the treasure here?

130
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,340
Could it be

131
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,380
that Xinjue colluded with Bihuang in the murder?

132
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,180
Bihuang committed suicide to escape punishment.

133
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,780
All you need to remember is

134
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,210
that there is no escape from the long arm of the law.

But no matter how difficult it is,

157
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,050
it's time to tell the truth.

Hasn't the case already been solved?

162
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,880
Xinjue and Bihuang colluded in the murder, right?

163
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,660
Why did you call us here?

164

A person's left side is cut into the shape of hashes.

165

It doesn't mean the person's right side is also cut into the shape of hashes.

166
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:30,880
This means

167
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,850
his left body was cut into the shape of hashes

168
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,610
for some reason.

169
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,760
It's hard to understand what you're saying.

What reason is it?

00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,900
If Bihuang had killed Yu Louchun directly,

172
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,430
she couldn't have escaped.

173
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,040
In order to be safe after killing people,

174
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,760
she could only frame someone else.

175
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,660
After thinking about it,

176
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,390
she thought the best candidate is Machete Ghost.

177
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,300
Simply put,

178
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,580
Bihuang and Xinjue are not accomplices.

179
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,820
Yu Louchun wasn't killed by Machete Ghost?

180
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,080
You can take a look

181
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,430
at the shoulders of Yu Louchun's body.

182
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,580
How come?

183
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:25,680
Snakes?

184
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,060
Yu Louchun was bitten to death by a snake?

185
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:28,860
That's right.

186
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,200
He died from snake venom.

187
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,150
But the cut seemed to be caused by a single slash.

188
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,490
The murderer is very skilful.

189
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,270
A skill that can cut people with a single slash.

190
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,600
If you have a right tool,

191
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,020
it's not difficult.

192
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:39,990
Guards!

193
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,300
Black iron.

194
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,460
Yu Louchun's bookcase

195
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,700
is made of black iron.

196
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,720
The edge was even ground and became a blade.

197
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,290
Was the body dismembered with this thing?

198
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,510
That's right.

199
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,710
Someone chose the hash-shaped shelves from the bookcase,

200
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,170
ground the edge as a blade,

201
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,990
and pressed it against Yu Louchun's body.

202
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,150
This is Hash Slash.

203
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,480
What a nice touch.

204
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,650
But why is there only half of Hash Slash

205
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,780
on the rest of Yu Louchun's body?

206
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,300
It's rare to find something that is as hard as black iron in the world.

207
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,730
If they wanted to grind it and make it a blade,

208
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,240
even if they spent two hours a day,

209
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,790
they could only grind half of the hash-shaped shelves in six months.

210
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,660
But the day of the Mountains Red was coming.

211
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,790
The murderer could only deceive people with a fake.

212
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,830
If no one found

213
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,120
Machete Ghost,

214
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,010
the rest of the body couldn't be found either.

215
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,840
Bihuang was so scheming.

216
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,900
Apart from Yu Louchun,

217
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,250
only one maid can go up

218
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,250
to his Kanyun Peak

219
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,850
once a day.

220
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,950
And that maid can only clean here for two hours.

221
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,810
During the time when she had to clean the entire house,

222
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,510
it was really not easy for her

223
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,060
to not be noticed

224
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,760
when she ground the black-iron bookcase.

225
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,040
How did she succeed?

226
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,010
Only the person who was cornered

227
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,810
and risked her life to save herself could succeed.

228
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,410
Miss Bihuang

229
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,330
really wanted to escape from Girls' Mansion where she suffered terribly.

230
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,350
But Bihuang was dancing at the Zhaixing Stage the night before.

231
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,870
Yu Louchun was at Kanyun Peak.

232
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,440
She couldn't go to two places at the same time.

233
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,200
How did she kill him?

234
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,000
That's right.

235
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,970
A snake was manipulated to kill Yu Louchun.

236
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,830
So she must have a helper who can manipulate snakes.

237
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,600
Miss Chilong.

238
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,070
You're quite awesome.

239
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,650
Physician Li, you must be kidding.

240
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,190
Chilong is only good at dancing.

241
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,420
We've never seen her

242
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,780
learn any snake-manipulation skills.

243
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,620
Miss Chilong.

244
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,100
You're the Chehu people, right?

245
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,860
Chehu belongs to Blood Realm.

246
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,920
Do I look like the Chehu people?

247
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,010
The Chehu people have yellow hair and a Roman nose.

248
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,410
You don't look like them.

249
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,130
So I guess

250
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,850
you are the Han people who was born in Chehu,

251
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:14,380
right?

252
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,900
Most girls from Chehu have a tattoo of snake teeth.

253
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,370
It's well hidden.

254
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,100
But when you fought against the guards yesterday,

255
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,900
I accidentally saw your tattoo.

256
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,640
Chehu is a small country in Blood Realm.

257
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,130
The Chehu people hunt for a living.

258
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,690
Snake bites are the least harmful to fur.

259
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,990
So you've been training snakes to hunt since childhood.

260
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,790
Miss Chilong.

261
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,600
You must have learnt it.

262
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,630
Even so,

263
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,510
Yu Louchun didn't allow anyone

264
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,750
to bring snakes to Girls' Mansion.

265
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,510
Of course.

266
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,320
But snake eggs are different.

267
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,710
[Celebrate with Light]

268
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,740
Miss Chilong.

269
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,170
I found these in the jade drum.

270
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,070
The jade drum

271
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,300
was sent up to the mountain ten months ago.

272
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,720
After the jade drum was put in a warm place for some time,

273
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,100
the baby snakes slithered out of the hole.

274
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,170
My next question is

275
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,370
who sent the jade drum up to the mountain.

276
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,170
Chilong.

277
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,310
This brown-spotted pit viper has just grown.

278
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,770
It can't hurt many people.

279
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,780
Besides, investigating cases is their duty.

280
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,740
What's wrong with that?

281
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,800
As I said before, you two are wise.

282
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,690
I'm more convinced today.

283
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,480
Mr. Murong, you're a smart person.

284
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,100
Yu Louchun was so cautious,

285
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,440
but he still died.

286
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,270
Why did you think

287
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,280
the snake eggs were hidden in the jade drum?

288
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,960
I couldn't guess it at first.

289
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,330
When I found you're the Chehu people

290
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,640
and that you told a lie that you're the Yueqian people,

291
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,970
everything became clear to me.

292
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,570
Then why do you think I'm also the Chehu people?

293
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,110
Because what you said was self-contradictory.

294
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,670
Yueqian is covered by yellow sand.

295
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,860
People there are afraid of water.

296
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,140
But you were handsome on the bamboo raft.

297
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,290
You were not afraid.

298
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,360
It's reasonable that you don't like taking a bath because you are new here.

299
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,290
But there is another possibility.

300
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,810
You're trying to hide your hair color.

301
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,240
So after we suspected you,

302
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,720
we went to your room and found something.

303
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,430
The end of the hair is black,

304
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:07,970
but the root is yellow.

305
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,910
Did you dye your hair?

306
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,430
You two are indeed intelligent.

307
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,770
So the three of you conspired together to murder him?

308
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,339
No.

309
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,470
I forced them.

310
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,300
They dared not disobey me.

311
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,310
You...

312
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,250
I coveted Yu Louchun's treasure,

313
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,619
so I coerced you and Bihuang.

314
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,890
It has nothing to do with you.

315
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,140
Now that the truth was exposed,

316
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,270
I'll take the blame.

317
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:36,770
From now on,

318
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,820
no one will force you and hurt you anymore.

319
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,520
Go down the mountain

320
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,370
and live a good life.

321
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,060
I...

322
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:51,620
Chilong.

323
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,600
Do as you're told.

324
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,670
If you had coveted the treasure,

325
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,680
you wouldn't have gone this far.

326
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,530
You mean I was too cruel to Yu Louchun?

327
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,590
You were too cruel to yourself.

328
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,670
I don't understand what you said.

329
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,400
Of course you don't understand.

330
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,330
Because you don't want to admit it.

331
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,520
I want to ask you a question.

332
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,490
When did you throw the first broken arm

333
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,970
to Guanri Pavilion?

334
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,270
I threw it after I killed Yu Louchun at night.

335
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:33,690
No.

336
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,710
Guanri Pavilion is outside Girls' Mansion

337
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,470
and is guarded.

338
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,470
You had no chance.

339
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,270
Your only chance

340
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,710
was when we climbed the mountain to watch the sun rise early in the morning.

341
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:45,230
But we went and watched the sun rise together that day.

342
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,760
I didn't see him bring bags.

343
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,280
I don't think he could hide a broken arm.

344
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,140
That's why I asked

345
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,820
why you went this far.

346
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,140
When did your arm

347
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,730
get broken?

348
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,200
When you were dancing at the Mountains Red,

349
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,530
your arm was not broken.

350
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,150
I guess after his last dance

351
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,690
at the Mountains Red,

352
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,850
he went back to his room and cut his arm off.

353
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,640
Before we went to Guanri Pavilion,

354
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,800
you disguised your broken arm

355
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,260
as Yu Louchun's broken arm

356
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,500
and then threw it when we didn't notice.

357
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,270
We were all in cloaks that morning.

358
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,200
Everyone gave their attention

359
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,440
to the stump.

360
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,720
No one noticed

361
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,020
that Mr. Murong

362
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,600
already lost his arm.

363
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,620
You cut your arm off

364
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,370
to cover up the fact

365
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,310
that Yu Louchun was poisoned with snake venom,

366
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:43,780
right?

367
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,210
You're indeed smart.

368
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,150
But don't go too far.

369
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,380
My arm was broken in an accident many years ago.

370
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,350
To frame Xinjue,

371
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,340
I could throw the body away.

372
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,620
Why did I do this in public?

373
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,970
Because you had to throw the body

374
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,370
to a place where Chilong couldn't go.

375
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,550
To frame Xinjue,

376
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,230
you could throw the body anywhere.

377
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,390
Guanri Pavilion

378
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,840
is outside Girls' Mansion.

379
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,240
It was impossible for the girls to go there.

380
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,320
Only in this way

381
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,340
wouldn't Chilong be suspected.

382
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:17,990
Enough.

383
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,490
I'm greedy for money.

384
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,940
It has nothing to do with Chilong.

385
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,340
Mr. Murong.

386
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:28,130
Do you remember the Eagle Dance?

387
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:33,070
A year ago, Dancing Devil, Murong Yao, performed the Eagle Dance.

388
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,450
He spread his arms high as if he was trying to reach the sky.

389
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,830
That dance became famous in the capital.

390
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,700
But now?

391
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,080
Murong Yao, you used a dancer's arm

392
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,190
in exchange for Chilong's innocence.

393
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:46,840
You can't even raise your left arm in greeting like other Chehu people.

394
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,320
A greedy man can't do these.

395
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,810
I know what kind of statement you want.

396
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:55,470
I'm sorry.

397
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,570
It was I who did all these.

398
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,330
Yu Louchun, the head guard,

399
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,530
and Dongfang Hao were all killed by me.

400
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,780
Please don't blame others.

401
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,320
I'll compensate with my life.

402
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,620
No!

[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

405
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,040
Don't jump on my head if you want to die.

406
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:40,660
Fei.

407
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,450
You came just in time.

408
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,170
Here is the thing you want.

409
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,030
We're even now.

410
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:55,170
The donation to the temple opposite was recorded on it.

411
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,550
You donated 100 taels of gold ten days ago

412
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:00,740
and asked them to make the clock strike midnight in advance.

413
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,710
You lost your arm and money.

414
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,720
In this world, there is no one

415
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,270
who is as greedy as you.

416
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:10,950
Mr. Murong.

417
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,110
You want to use your own death

418
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,970
in exchange for all the girls' life.

419
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,250
I really admire that.

420
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,750
But those girls killed Yu Louchun.

421
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,480
Are they going to

422
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,800
live in the dark forever?

423
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,540
Physician Li.

424
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:33,200
You mean Yu Louchun's death

425
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,310
has something to do with all the girls in Girls' Mansion?

426
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,030
Of course.

427
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,640
If they hadn't used their deceased friends

428
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,840
to deliver messages,

429
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,010
Murong Yao wouldn't have known

430
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,640
where Chilong was locked up.

431
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,040
Before yesterday,

432
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,520
I had a question that I couldn't solve.

433
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,840
No one knew

434
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,560
the girls were imprisoned here.

435
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,750
How did Mr. Murong know

436
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,370
the whereabouts of Chilong?

437
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,230
It was recorded in the government's casebook

438
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,870
that there always were many female corpses floating on the nearby river

439
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,200
who dressed strangely.

440
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,210
I didn't realize it until yesterday

441
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,070
when I attended Bihuang's funeral.

442
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,550
The girls put their things

443
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,230
on their deceased friends.

444
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,110
It looked as if they were expressing their sorrow.

445
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,240
In fact, they were seeking help from outsiders

446
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,700
in this way.

447
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,630
They hoped the corpses that floated out could be recognized

448
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,620
so that their families could know their whereabouts.

449
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,820
But after a long time,

450
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:22,030
only one girl's jewelry

451
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,220
was recognized by her old friend.

452
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,420
Chilong?

453
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,380
So when Yu Louchun

454
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,950
received the Thunder Dance Notation,

455
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,030
Chilong knew

456
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,920
Mr. Murong found her.

457
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,600
So Mr. Murong

458
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,500
became every girl's only hope.

459
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,670
So it was Murong Yao who made all the plans?

460
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,170
The girls just cooperated with him?

461
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,360
It was the other way around.

462
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,250
Girls' Mansion has been closed all these years.

463
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,580
They sent letters through the waterfall.

464
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,220
But Murong Yao couldn't write back.

465
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,280
So all the things

466
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,960
were planned by the girls,

467
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,060
except one thing.

468
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,240
That is Murong Yao's broken arm.

469
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,450
I guess it happened like this.

470
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,490
After the Mountains Red that night,

471
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,650
in order to clear the girls,

472
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,070
Murong Yao cut his arm off

473
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:15,570
to prepare himself to throw Yu Louchun's body the next day.

474
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,560
Chilong didn't expect Murong Yao

475
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,090
to hurt himself in this way.

476
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,740
They made a noise.

477
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:28,410
But the lascivious head guard was attracted there.

478
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,680
At first, they only wanted to kill Yu Louchun

479
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:49,550
and put the treasure and the antidote in Xinjue's room

480
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,390
to frame him.

481
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,950
But the head guard appeared.

482
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,110
They had no choice but to kill him.

483
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:59,220
But the head guard has nothing to do with Machete Ghost.

484
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,420
To clear themselves,

485
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,590
they had to kill one more person

486
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,870
to frame

487
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,330
Xinjue.

488
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,350
Am I right?

489
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,070
Dongfang Hao.

490
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,310
They didn't want to kill innocent people.

491
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,040
Only by killing those who deserve to die

492
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,640
could they feel less guilty.

493
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,580
So after thinking about it,

494
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:15,950
they thought the best candidate

495
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,150
was Dongfang Hao.

496
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,130
Coincidentally,

497
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,390
Dongfang Hao was Machete Ghost's enemy.

498
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,940
So the second time when he cut the body into the shape of hashes,

499
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,190
he did it better

500
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,330
because he practiced it before.

501
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,470
If I'm right,

502
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:27,610
that's the truth.

503
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:30,500
You're right.

504
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:35,260
Chilong and I grew up together.

505
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,600
We already got engaged a long time ago.

506
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,450
Seven years ago,

507
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,170
she came to Central Plains for a dance competition and suddenly disappeared.

508
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:45,830
Since then,

509
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,540
I hadn't heard from her.

510
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:49,980
That's why I came to Central Plains

511
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,380
to find her whereabouts.

512
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,680
One day,

513
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,060
I found her hair stick on a corpse.

514
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,990
Then I started looking for people.

515
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:10,590
I investigated the whereabouts of many girls.

516
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:13,670
Later, I found out

517
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,600
she had fallen into someone's hands.

518
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,710
You won't understand how I felt

519
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,350
when I knew the person I love

520
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,720
was in such a situation.

521
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,080
At that day, I vowed

522
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,410
that no matter what the price was,

523
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:37,820
I would rescue Chilong.

524
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:41,770
Over the years,

525
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,620
the Mountains Red has been quite famous in the martial arts world.

526
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,220
Good.

527
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,320
But it was mysterious.

528
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,430
Good.

529
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,750
In order to become Yu Louchun's guest,

530
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:53,170
I performed the Eagle Dance in the capital.

531
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:55,070
[I'd like to invite Murong Yao to admire beautiful maple leaves with me on September 19.]

532
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:55,070
[September 7, the year of Renzi. Yu Louchun.]

533
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,910
I finally got an invitation from Yu Louchun.

534
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,270
I found an excuse to send a gift to Girls' Mansion in advance.

535
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,270
Chilong knew my plan when she saw it.

536
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:05,690
That night,

537
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,410
at the Mountains Red,

538
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,940
we finished the last dance together.

539
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,140
When the clock struck midnight in advance,

540
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,520
we took action.

541
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,650
Yu Louchun didn't expect

542
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:25,590
that he would be killed by a venomous snake.

543
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:29,210
This is the retribution for his evil deeds.

544
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,850
I've rescued Chilong.

545
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,740
My wish already came true.

546
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,460
No matter what I'll face,

547
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,450
I'll never regret it.

548
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,100
I admire your good deeds.

549
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:44,140
But if you bear the blame alone,

550
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,540
not only will you not be able to save Chilong,

551
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,740
but all the girls here

552
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,830
will never have peace.

553
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,190
All the girls here?

554
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,390
Did they also...

555
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:52,940
The rotating tray weighs about 500 kilograms.

556
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,670
The three of them can't turn it.

557
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,470
This is the first reason.

558
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,320
You fell asleep yesterday.

559
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:00,870
It was because the girls added opium

560
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,030
to their lipsticks.

561
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,420
You'll know if you test it.

562
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,880
This is the second reason.

563
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:07,810
There is a lot of treasure in the rooms of Xinjue and Bihuang.

564
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,020
It's hard for the three of them

565
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,350
to move it down the mountain in a few hours.

566
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,950
This is the third reason.

567
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,140
Even if I don't tell others,

568
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:17,100
do you think you can really hide it from the Baichuan Court

569
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,700
and the Supervision Bureau?

570
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:25,730
Physician Li and Young Hero Fang are indeed smart.

571
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,790
It seems that we can't hide it from you anymore.

572
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:30,780
You're right.

573
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,820
We killed him together.

574
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,470
But there's one thing

575
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,280
you guessed wrong.

576
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,720
This black-iron bookcase wasn't ground by Bihuang alone.

577
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,320
Yu Louchun had a suspicious mind.

578
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:45,670
So the girls who went and cleaned Kanyun Peak

579
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,130
must be changed every day.

580
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,680
This black-iron bookcase

581
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,610
was ground by every girl

582
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,420
in Girls' Mansion.

583
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,190
While grinding this murder weapon,

584
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,720
we were surprisingly calm.

585
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,200
Seeing it getting sharper and sharper,

586
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,030
we thought

587
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,400
maybe we could soon get out of

588
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,050
the hell

589
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,100
and live the life we yearned for.

590
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,540
This black-iron bookcase

591
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,920
is the Deadly Machete

592
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,150
we gave to Yu Louchun.

593
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,010
Ladies.

594
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,930
You wanted to kill Yu Louchun to get rid of the nightmare.

595
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,190
It's understandable.

596
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,630
But the gold bricks you hid

597
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,230
will put you in danger again.

598
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,620
We only found jewelry

599
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,330
in the rooms of Bihuang and Xinjue.

600
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:40,860
We didn't find gold bricks.

601
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,170
Yu Louchun is in the opium business.

602
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:51,470
He recorded the gold bricks he earned on this ledger.

603
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,370
But where are the gold bricks?

604
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,770
We've never seen gold bricks either.

605
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:01,630
Xifei.

606
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,380
Just relying on yourselves,

607
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:07,100
you girls couldn't cut Yu Louchun who practiced Jade Bone Technique.

608
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,630
Do you have the gold bricks?

609
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,030
The answer is here.

610
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,250
Every gold brick is extremely heavy.

611
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,900
Only by stacking the gold bricks together could the Jade Bone be cut.

612
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,760
But the gold bricks are too heavy.

613
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,970
It's impossible for you to carry them down the mountain.

614
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:29,390
So you had no choice but to hide them here.

615
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:33,890
Ladies.

616
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,430
Yu Louchun sold opium.

617
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,000
His business partners are evil.

618
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:40,770
Now he's dead.

619
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,790
If those villains can't find the gold bricks,

620
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,990
they won't let you go.

621
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,760
You've tried so hard

622
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,420
to live a new life.

623
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,180
But if you keep the dirty money,

624
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,760
you will never recover.

625
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:55,140
Well...

626
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,630
Please give yourself a way out.

627
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,450
Let the Baichuan Court

628
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,880
protect you above board.

629
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,380
Come with me.

630
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,300
All the gold bricks are here.

631
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,770
You put all the gold bricks in the wall.

632
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:33,010
We hid gold bricks

633
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,520
because we've been here for years.

634
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,180
We have nowhere to go.

635
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,690
We wanted to keep them as souvenirs

636
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,150
and gave some to the parents

637
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,970
of our deceased friends.

638
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,600
We know we were wrong.

639
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,690
But Mr. Murong did nothing wrong.

640
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,260
They just wanted to save people.

641
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,730
For the sake of it,

642
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:53,500
please forgive their sins.

643
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,000
All the girls in Girls' Mansion

644
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,590
are willing to take the blame.

645
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,510
Please spare Mr. Murong.

646
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:04,190
Please spare Mr. Murong.

647
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,080
Please get up.

648
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:10,100
I'll definitely tell the Baichuan Court

649
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,320
your suffering and Murong Yao's intention.

650
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:12,670
Yes.

651
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,680
The Baichuan Court will give you justice.

652
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:16,530
Please get up.

653
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:24,560
What justice?

654
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:26,150
This is not fair at all.

655
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:30,790
Why did you hide it from me?

656
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,960
I was also harmed by Yu Louchun.

657
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,890
I also wanted to escape from here.

658
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,660
Why didn't you tell me?

659
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,820
Why am I the only one who was kept in the dark?

660
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,960
Because we treat you as our younger sister.

661
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,560
You've been here for less than two months.

662
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,620
But we've been here

663
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,490
for at least two years.

664
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,760
A woman's youth is short.

665
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,120
We were locked up in this dark place.

666
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:58,170
We already regarded ourselves as people who're half dead.

667
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,230
Every time when we saw you

668
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,960
cry and try to escape from here,

669
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:04,940
we remembered the person who we used to be.

670
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:08,250
So we couldn't let you know it.

671
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:09,880
If we failed,

672
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,700
you wouldn't know it.

673
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,120
If we succeeded,

674
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,490
you wouldn't become a murderer.

675
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,780
After you leave here,

676
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,500
you can still

677
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,610
be a smart and happy girl.

678
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:36,910
Sister.

679
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,380
I'm ashamed.

680
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,970
Yesterday, I even had bad intentions

681
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:58,430
towards these poor girls.

682
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,810
I deserve to be beaten.

683
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:01,600
Yu Louchun.

684
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,600
This wretch deserved to die.

685
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,080
People from the Baichuan Court will be here soon.

686
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,350
The girls can air their grievances.

687
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:09,660
Young Hero Fang.

688
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:11,420
Your family is rich.

689
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,440
Why don't you help them more?

690
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,469
Don't worry.

691
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,969
I've given the order.

692
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:17,340
If they have nowhere to go,

693
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,330
Tianji Mountain Manor will take them in.

694
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:20,330
I'll stay away

695
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,719
from the activities which hurt others.

696
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,250
I should focus on drinking.

697
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:28,540
Yesterday, in the cave

698
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,270
where Miss Qing'er was hiding,

699
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,800
another place where Yu Louchun hid his treasure was found.

700
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,550
Unfortunately, I'm in no mood to see it.

701
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:40,820
Forget it.

702
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,580
I'm in no mood to look for treasure.

703
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,830
Let the Baichuan Court investigate it.

704
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,040
You must be disappointed.

705
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,480
I was just curious.

706
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,850
I didn't know you were joking.

707
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,840
You tricked me.

708
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,300
We were joking?

709
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,700
Are you looking for this?

710
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,530
What is this?

711
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,690
I've never seen it before.

712
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:48,950
Of course you haven't.

713
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,920
Because when Bihuang died,

714
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,630
she didn't give it to you.

715
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,410
I don't understand

716
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,120
what you're saying.

717
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,710
Li Yifu, you don't understand?

718
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:07,860
You were looking for the ice shards for the Jinyuan Alliance.

719
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:11,810
You didn't expect that Yu Louchun was killed and that the treasure was missing.

720
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:13,060
You temporarily hid.

721
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,060
You finally found out that Bihuang sent us a letter.

722
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,230
So you forced her.

723
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,530
But Bihuang refused to give it to you.

724
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:20,140
What did you do when you didn't find the ice shard?

725
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,540
So you wanted to kill her.

726
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,600
That's an amazing touch.

727
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:29,130
Here you go.

728
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:29,840
Take a look.

729
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,460
She had long attached the ice shard

730
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,190
to the dragonfly's wing.

731
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,610
So she tricked you.

732
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:47,360
People who want to condemn someone always trump up a charge.

733
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:48,890
Do you have any evidence?

734
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:52,890
Evidence?

735
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,930
You're so stubborn.

736
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,960
Bihuang wrote letters with her right hand.

737
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:01,890
But there is an ink stain in the palm of her left hand

738
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,980
in which she held this ice shard.

739
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,670
This is the evidence.

740
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,670
Among the guests, only you have something to do

741
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:08,650
with ink.

742
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:11,380
One-word Poem, Li Yifu.

743
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:17,980
In the end, I was found out.

744
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,460
Thundering fire bombs.

745
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,010
If I'm not mistaken,

746
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,150
the inkstone you brought is sulfur.

747
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:53,320
You used the four treasures of the study to make this weapon.

748
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,960
Unfortunately, you're so bad at martial arts.

749
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,560
Wait.

750
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,280
How about this?

751
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,090
Let's make a deal.

752
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:11,670
How dare you make a deal with me?

753
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,140
If you hadn't killed Bihuang,

754
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,940
her miserable life would have come to an end.

755
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,180
Are you disregarding the big picture

756
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,090
for a woman?

757
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,770
Life is the most important thing.

758
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,060
Unfortunately, people like you and Yu Louchun

759
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,390
will never understand.

760
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,540
I've put a mark.

761
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:29,230
People from the Jinyuan Alliance will be here soon.

762
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,860
If you want to live, hand the ice shard to me.

763
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,700
Are you talking about this iron windmill?

764
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,930
It was stuck into the mountain outside the suspension bridge.

765
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:44,950
It made sounds very often.

766
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:45,680
It was noisy.

767
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,870
I pulled it out on my way here.

768
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:52,750
We heard what you said.

769
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,930
Now it's my turn to make conditions.

770
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,020
Tell me.

771
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,190
Apart from the ice shards which Yu Louchun and Jin Mantang had,

772
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,120
where are the other two ice shards?

773
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:05,070
Do you think I'll betray the Jinyuan Alliance?

774
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,310
I just said it casually.

775
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,680
No matter whether you tell me or not,

776
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,340
Fang Xiaobao won't let you go.

777
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,950
So Li Yifu is the boss of the Jinyuan Alliance?

778
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:18,120
The boss's face is going to be swollen.

779
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,120
One-word poem?

780
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,740
He succeeded at the first attempt?

781
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,030
He's a beast.

782
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,120
You're right.

783
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,260
By the way, Physician Li,

784
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,230
what are the ice shards they talked about?

785
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:31,290
Why is the Jinyuan Alliance looking for the ice shards?

786
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,870
The ice shards

787
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:35,080
are the rare pieces of jewelry.

788
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,910
Maybe Di Feisheng wants to give them

789
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,380
to the people around him.

790
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:39,390
Well,

791
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,200
don't tell anyone about it.

792
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,550
Otherwise, your life will be in danger.

793
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:43,900
OK.

794
00:39:51,160 --> 00:40:00,190
[Girls' Mansion]

795
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:08,050
[Shuixie Zhilan]

796
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,270
Congratulations, Fang Duobing.

797
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:15,870
You solved another big case.

798
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:22,060
The girls of Girls' Mansion will be interrogated by the Supervision Bureau.

799
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,370
It's a black-and-white situation.

800
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:24,510
We'll do justice to you.

801
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,240
We won't let anyone be wronged.

802
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:27,730
Yang Yunchun.

803
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,370
Take all the girls you're in charge of away.

804
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:31,880
As Miss Shi said,

805
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,240
go with me.

806
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,170
Who dares?

807
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,900
Yang Yunchun, the executive in the Supervision Bureau.

808
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,560
Why don't you kneel before me?

809
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,730
Princess Zhaoling.

810
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:51,900
Princess?

811
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,300
Zhaoling?

812
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:55,900
Princess?

813
00:40:58,690 --> 00:40:59,730
Your fiancée?

814
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,800
Princess, may I ask why you're here?

815
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,270
Who are you to ask me questions?

816
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,940
Obey my orders.

817
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:13,690
Pardon all the girls in Girls' Mansion

818
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:15,270
and Murong Yao.

819
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:16,870
Release them immediately

820
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:18,410
and escort them home.

821
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:20,220
If anything goes wrong,

822
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,070
I'll punish you.

823
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:22,750
Princess.

824
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,230
Murong Yao belongs to the martial arts world.

825
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,590
The case about him should be judged by the Baichuan Court.

826
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,300
I want them to be safe.

827
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,580
If you can't do it, I'll tell my father what you have done.

828
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:31,860
Yes.

829
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,010
I will negotiate with the Baichuan Court

830
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,410
in the name of the Supervision Bureau.

831
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,020
Get up.

832
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,800
Thank you, Princess.

833
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:38,710
Qing'er.

834
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,080
You are a princess.

835
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:44,650
Thank you, Princess.

836
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,370
Thank you, Princess.

837
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,230
Get up.

838
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,520
Get up.

839
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,390
We are friends who suffered together.

840
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:52,790
Don't stand on ceremony.

841
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:53,980
I'll always remember

842
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,110
your kindness to me.

843
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,930
If anyone bullies you again,

844
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:57,700
just tell me.

845
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,580
I'll take revenge on them.

846
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:15,340
Qing'er.

847
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:17,560
Princess.

848
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:19,770
I know what you're thinking.

849
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,750
You think I was stupid enough to get caught.

850
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,410
You're laughing at me, right?

851
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:24,480
I don't dare.

852
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:26,620
You said you don't dare,

853
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,910
but in fact, you think it's right to escape from the wedding, right?

854
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:31,120
Look carefully.

855
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,060
Am I eight-foot tall?

856
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,120
Is my waist as thick as a giant barrel?

857
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,220
Forget it.

858
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,120
Since you saved me,

859
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:40,430
I'll forgive you.

860
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,590
I've been out for so long.

861
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,700
Father must be worried about me.

862
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:50,820
The people from the Supervision Bureau will escort me back to the palace.

863
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,880
See you, Princess.

864
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,580
Why are you in such a hurry to say goodbye to me?

865
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,580
Am I a jinx?

866
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:01,630
I said goodbye because you said you were leaving.

867
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:03,720
You only know how to investigate cases.

868
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,250
All right, I'm leaving now.

869
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,760
Don't worry about your escape from the wedding.

870
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,090
I will go back and beg for leniency for you.

871
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,500
Princess, you're so understanding.

872
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,530
Thank you so much.

873
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,100
For what?

874
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:16,870
What's the difference between the early date and the late date of the wedding?

875
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:18,220
We'll hold it after you travel around the martial arts world.

876
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,060
It's the same.
