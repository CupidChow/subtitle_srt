00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Ask

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
After thousands of times

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Thousands of times

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The most reluctant moment is that moment

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
On the earth

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A thousand miles of madness

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who doesn't wander

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
On the edge of the cliff

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
On the earth

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
A thousand times

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The most reluctant moment is that moment

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
On the earth

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
A thousand miles of madness

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Who doesn't wander

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
On the edge of the cliff

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
On the earth

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
A thousand times

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The most reluctant moment is that moment

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
On the earth

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
A thousand times

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The most reluctant moment is that moment

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
On the earth

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
A thousand miles of madness

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Who doesn't wander

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
On the earth

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
A thousand miles of madness

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Who doesn't wander

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
On the earth

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The body of the rest of Yulou Village

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's still unknown

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So the guards

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Dig a three-story hole to find the antidote

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This reminded me

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
They dug holes everywhere

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And saw a lot of mud

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
These two things are connected

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Think about it again

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Someone dug a hole under the tree

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The mud sand that was raised

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Met the woodwork

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So Yulou Village is buried here

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Before the Manchurian Red

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This murderer has prepared

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This burying place

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's really a dark place

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Dig it

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Look

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's here

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Take a look

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Throw the silk out to attract attention

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The body is hidden

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Just to hide

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yulou Village's real death

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
This looks like a snake's teeth

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Was it bitten by a poisonous snake?

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Iron head

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The blood in the snake's mouth

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So the blood on the silk is not dry

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Let everyone think that Yulou Village died in the morning

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
In fact, the time he was killed

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Is between purple and silver

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The star is not at all

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Hiding under the mountain

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:44,280
Then who is the accomplice of this

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
This is earlier than expected

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I have a treasure

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I heard that it was a thing you were looking for

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
If you are sorry

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Don't investigate the matter of the woman's house

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I would like to offer this treasure

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Brave grace

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
This letter is for the emperor

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The letter is in her hand

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Find out the truth

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's a criminal offense to know the evil

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But the emperor was dragged here

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
For the sake of the soul

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
He is also a pitiful person

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Although the law is hard to tolerate

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But if the emperor doesn't kill Yulou Village

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
His hard days will not come to an end

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I don't know this time

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Should I investigate

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
If you don't investigate, you are a good person

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
If you investigate, you are a criminal

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Fire

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Come on, come on

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Fire

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Come on, come on

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Fire

96
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Come on

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Come on, come on

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Come and save the fire

99
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Hurry up

100
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Hurry up

101
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Hurry up

102
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Hurry up

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Come here

104
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Hurry up

105
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Come here

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Come here

107
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Save the fire

108
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Water

109
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The fire is still in it

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Don't be afraid

111
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Hurry up

112
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's okay

113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Hurry up

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Qing, come on

115
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Get up

116
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Brother Minghu

117
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Sister Minghu

118
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Sister Minghu

119
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Sister Minghu

120
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Get in

121
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Sister Minghu

122
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Sister Minghu

123
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Sister Minghu

124
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Sister Minghu

125
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Sister Minghu

126
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What's going on?

127
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I heard that you doubted the emperor

128
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I was a little worried

129
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The emperor told him

130
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But he also asked me to go to the kitchen to cook porridge for him

131
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
He took me back and saw the fire inside

132
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Brother Minghu

133
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I want to save him

134
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But the fire burned too fast

135
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I even got myself trapped in it

136
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Why would this happen?

137
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Didn't they all say that the upper body has a hug?

138
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Sister Minghu

139
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Sister Minghu

140
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The one who believes in the gods and worships the deities

141
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
They often say that the gods and demons have a hug

142
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But if you really want to be innocent

143
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You have to rely on humans

144
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Li Lianzhi

145
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
He was right

146
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
I've made up my mind

147
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
I will investigate

148
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,400
Okay

149
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,900
Within the orbit

150
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600
Once the truth is found

151
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,160
Don't go

152
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,020
If him you

153
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,500
If his brother located it

154
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,100
Then you will also be dead

155
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,180
Sometimes it seems that the truth

156
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,780
has been found by the person who hurt Liang Shan.

157
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,300
But only in this way

158
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,260
can we not indulge in

159
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,580
the smuggling of the hidden things.

160
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,020
The treasure! The treasure!

161
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,180
Yue Luo Chun

162
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,140
actually hid the treasure here.

163
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,820
We've been looking for it for so long.

164
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,660
It turned out to be hidden like this.

165
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,060
This is the same as the scene

166
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,260
in the restaurant.

167
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,180
It looks like a wall.

168
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,340
It's really a good work

169
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,460
to hide from the search

170
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,980
by pretending to be real.

171
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,380
Why is the treasure here?

172
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,380
Could it be

173
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,860
that Xin Jue and Bi Huang

174
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,820
are working together?

175
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,580
Now Bi Huang is committing suicide for his crime.

176
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,300
You just need to remember

177
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,940
that the evil will never escape from the net.

178
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,580
Leave these treasures here

179
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,420
and let Bai Chuan Court handle them.

180
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,300
You...

181
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,260
Please go back, everyone.

182
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,260
Mr. Fang, Li Shen Yi.

183
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,940
We all know that Bi Huang is guilty.

184
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,380
But she has been with us for years.

185
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,780
Please show mercy

186
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,060
and let us follow the rules of the house

187
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,620
to bid farewell to Sister Bi Huang.

188
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,860
Perfect Body

189
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,420
As the purple clouds

190
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:07,220
cylinder me on such hard day

191
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:14,220
I will meet you again and again

192
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:20,220
I am a little butterfly

193
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:28,220
Lian Hua, let the truth be revealed tomorrow morning

194
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,220
Have you thought it through?

195
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,220
There was still some confusion before

196
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,220
Now everything is clear

197
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,220
This is the most difficult case I have ever encountered

198
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,220
But no matter how difficult it is

199
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,220
It's time to tell the truth

200
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,220
Then let the truth be revealed

201
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,220
I won't let you know

202
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,220
You are out!

203
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,220
Li Shenyi, Mr. Fang

204
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,220
Did you find the other bodies?

205
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,220
This case has been broken

206
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,220
Is it a joint case between Xinjue and Bi Huang?

207
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,220
Why should I call us

208
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,220
It's hard to understand what Doctor Li said.

209
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,900
What's the reason?

210
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,820
If Bihuang killed Yulou Chun directly,

211
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,100
he definitely couldn't escape.

212
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,940
He wanted to be safe after killing people.

213
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,820
I think he could only teach others.

214
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:52,060
The best choice to go is to kill the Ghost King.

215
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,340
Simply put,

216
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,660
Bihuang and Xingjue are not allies.

217
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,500
Yulou Chun was not killed by the Ghost King?

218
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,060
You can come and have a look.

219
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,500
Yulou Chun's shoulder is so thin.

220
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,780
Snake?

221
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,780
Yulou Chun was killed by a snake?

222
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,700
Yes.

223
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,260
He died of snake poison.

224
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,020
But the cut is like a knife.

225
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,220
The technique is very advanced.

226
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,740
It's not difficult to use a knife as a weapon.

227
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,140
Come.

228
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,460
Black iron?

229
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,780
Why did Yulou Chun use black iron?

230
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,860
And he grinded it into a sharp blade?

231
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,780
Is it the stone used to grind the blade?

232
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,460
Yes.

233
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,220
He used black iron to find the cut.

234
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,100
Then he used black iron to grind the blade.

235
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,620
And he used it on Yulou Chun.

236
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,220
This is the cut.

237
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,420
Good idea.

238
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,740
But why does Yulou Chun only have half of the cut

239
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,820
on the body of the other stone?

240
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,060
There are few black iron in the world.

241
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,500
To grind the blade,

242
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,100
even if it takes an hour every day,

243
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,420
it can only grind half of the cut in half a year.

244
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,500
And the red is coming.

245
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,540
The killer can only use his feet to find it.

246
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,060
If no one can find the knife,

247
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,180
then the other half of the body can't be found.

248
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,980
The emperor's intention is too deep.

249
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,940
Yulou Chun is a good-for-nothing.

250
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,260
Except for himself,

251
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,940
he only needs one maid to go up and down every day.

252
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,820
And he can only clean an hour.

253
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,540
He is responsible for the whole house.

254
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,660
He also has to grind the black iron.

255
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,380
It's really different if he doesn't get noticed.

256
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,180
How did this girl do it?

257
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,620
She was forced to the extreme.

258
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,740
Only those who are close to life can do it.

259
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,700
This girl Bihuang

260
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,860
wants to escape from this deep and cruel woman.

261
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,300
But Bihuang danced at Zhai Xing House last night.

262
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,980
Yulou Chun was watching the clouds.

263
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,100
How could he kill someone by cutting the body?

264
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:27,900
That's right.

265
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,660
To kill Yulou Chun,

266
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,780
you need to have a way to control the snake.

267
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,980
Miss Chi Long, you're amazing.

268
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,260
The Doctor Li is joking.

269
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,820
Chi Long is only good at martial arts.

270
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,420
We've never seen him

271
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,380
learn any control of the snake.

272
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,780
Miss Chi Liang,

273
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,540
are you from the car-tree?

274
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,620
The car-tree is in the blood region.

275
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,140
Do you think I look like a car-tree?

276
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,340
The car-tree has yellow hair and black nose.

277
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,260
You don't look like one.

278
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,340
So I guess

279
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,500
you're a Han from the car-tree, right?

280
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,220
The car-tree woman Changwen

281
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,020
has a sharp tongue and a sharp tongue.

282
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,500
She hides very well.

283
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,820
But when you were fighting with the guards yesterday,

284
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,740
I accidentally saw your shape.

285
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,300
The car-tree is a small tree in the blood region.

286
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,820
It's a god of hunting.

287
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,580
The wound of the snake bite

288
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,740
is the least hurt.

289
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,900
So you want to

290
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,500
train the snake to hunt.

291
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,780
Miss Chi Long,

292
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,460
you must have learned it.

293
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,780
Even so,

294
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,340
Yulou Chun will never allow anyone

295
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,580
to bring a snake into the woman's house.

296
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,620
Of course.

297
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,260
But the snake's egg is different.

298
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,860
If you want to chain the snake,

299
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,660
we'll help her create an egg,

300
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,580
and then you can%,

301
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,900
yes.

302
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,820
Miss Chi Long,

303
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,820
you found this in the Dendi.

304
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:21,180
This is

305
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,180
meals sent to the mountains ten months ago.

306
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,780
Next, I want to ask who sent the jade bone to Shi'an?

307
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:57,180
Chi Long, this steel head of the steel city can't hurt a few people.

308
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,380
Besides, the investigation is their duty.

309
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,380
What's wrong with that?

310
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,580
I said before that the two of you are wise.

311
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,580
Today, you are more like a man of the moon.

312
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,180
Mr. Murong is a smart person.

313
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,580
The jade tower spring has reached this stage.

314
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,580
In the end, it's still hard to escape death.

315
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,580
Why do you think the snake egg is hidden in the jade bone?

316
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,980
I couldn't guess it.

317
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,380
When I learned that Mr. Murong is a carer,

318
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,780
but he lied that he was a jade fairy,

319
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,180
I understood everything.

320
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,980
Then how do you think I am a carer too?

321
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,980
Because you have contradictions with each other.

322
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,580
The moon is ten thousand miles in yellow sand,

323
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,980
the people are not watered.

324
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,580
But you are in the bamboo boat,

325
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,580
you are elegant and unwavering.

326
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,380
It's reasonable to go into a woman's house and not take a bath.

327
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,580
But I think you should be careful.

328
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,980
I think it's reasonable to take a bath in the bamboo boat.

329
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,980
But there is another possibility.

330
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,580
You are hiding your hair color.

331
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,780
So we suspect you.

332
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,780
Then we go to your room and find something.

333
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,380
The hair is black and the root of the hair is yellow.

334
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,980
Your hair is dyed, right?

335
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,580
You two are really thoughtful.

336
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,980
So you three are trying to kill people.

337
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,980
It's not trying, I forced them.

338
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,980
They dare not to do it.

339
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,980
You...

340
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,380
I am addicted to Yulou Spring's treasure,

341
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,580
so I will frame you and Bi Hua.

342
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,580
This has nothing to do with you.

343
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:35,180
Now the matter is over, the crime is mine.

344
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:39,580
In the future, no one will force you to harm me.

345
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:43,580
You go down the mountain and live a good life.

346
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,080
OK.

347
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,780
I believe it.

348
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,240
Cbase

349
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,240
I'm afraid that you'll be too harsh on yourself.

350
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,840
I don't understand.

351
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,840
Why would you be harsh on yourself?

352
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,840
I don't understand.

353
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,240
You don't understand?

354
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,840
Because you're not willing to admit it.

355
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,440
I have a question for you.

356
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,240
When did you lose Guan Yuting in the first cut?

357
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,040
After you killed Yulou Chun last night.

358
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,040
No.

359
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,840
Guan Yuting was in the female house.

360
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,640
She was in the female house.

361
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,240
She was in the female house.

362
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,840
She was in the female house.

363
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,640
She was in the female house.

364
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,640
There was no chance for you to guard her.

365
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,040
There was no chance for you to guard her.

366
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,840
The only chance you had

367
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,640
was to go to Guan's house with us this morning.

368
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,240
But we went there together that day.

369
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,040
We didn't see her with her bag.

370
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,840
I'm afraid that she can't hide it.

371
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,440
That's why I said

372
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,640
you don't have to go to this extent.

373
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,040
I...

374
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,040
When did you lose that arm?

375
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,040
You were dancing in the Manchurian Festival.

376
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,640
You were clearly fine.

377
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,240
After Manchurian Festival,

378
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,840
after she did her last dance,

379
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,040
she returned to her room and cut herself.

380
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,440
Before the Guan Yuting is here,

381
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,240
you used your arm as a disguise for Yulou Chun.

382
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,040
And you abandoned her while she's still alive.

383
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,640
That morning, we were all wearing dougats.

384
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,640
We all paid attention to her.

385
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,440
No one will find out that Mr. Murong's arm has been lost.

386
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,840
You cut off one arm of your own

387
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,920
to cover up the fact that Yulou Shun was poisoned, right?

388
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,320
Young Master Fang is really smart.

389
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,240
But don't be too much.

390
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,600
I broke my arm.

391
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,560
It was an accident many years ago.

392
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,440
I was so worried.

393
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,200
I can just throw the body away.

394
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,800
Why do you have to do this under the guise of being a mother?

395
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,080
Because you have to throw the body away in a drawer.

396
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,840
It's impossible for girls to go to the place where Chilong won't go.

397
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,000
If you just give it to Xingjue,

398
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,080
it's the same wherever you throw it.

399
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,960
This Guan Yuting is outside the girl's house.

400
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,120
Girls won't go to that place.

401
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,680
In this case, Chilong won't have any suspicion.

402
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,440
Enough.

403
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,440
I'm greedy.

404
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,400
It has nothing to do with Chilong.

405
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,800
Mr. Murong,

406
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,560
do you remember the dance of Yin Xiang?

407
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,520
A year ago, Murong Yao danced Yin Xiang.

408
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,360
Her arms were so tall and her body was so weak.

409
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,760
She was famous in the capital.

410
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,880
But now?

411
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,480
Murong Yao,

412
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,080
you exchanged Chilong's innocence with Wu Zhe's arm.

413
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,720
You can't even do it in the left hand of the car.

414
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,560
People who are greedy can't do these things.

415
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,360
I know what you want.

416
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,640
But I'm sorry.

417
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,640
I did all of this.

418
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,320
Yulou Chun,

419
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,040
Division Commander, Dong Fang Hao,

420
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,400
I killed them all.

421
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,880
I beg you not to blame others.

422
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,520
I'll just give them my life.

423
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,600
No.

424
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,640
You did it.

425
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,000
You want to die?

426
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,560
Don't come up to me.

427
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,000
Fei, you are really punctual.

428
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,280
What you want is cleared.

429
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,640
That's why I asked them to pay the money in advance.

430
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,960
I lost my arm and my family.

431
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,080
I'm afraid there's no other greedy person in this world.

432
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,800
Mr. Murong, you want to exchange your death for all the girls' lives.

433
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,160
I really admire that.

434
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,360
But after the girls killed Yulou Chun,

435
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:25,600
do you plan to live in a life without light?

436
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,080
Doctor Li, you mean Yulou Chun's death

437
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,480
has something to do with all the girls in this house?

438
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,760
Of course.

439
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,080
If it wasn't for the death of their companions,

440
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,760
how would Murong Yao know where Chi Long is locked up?

441
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,560
I've been having doubts about it since yesterday.

442
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,640
No one knows about the girls' imprisonment.

443
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,760
How did Mr. Murong know where Chi Long is locked up?

444
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,000
In the Yaman Pavilion,

445
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,240
there are always many strange women in the river.

446
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,080
I was sent to the grave yesterday,

447
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,840
and I just got here.

448
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,200
The girls put their things on the dead girls.

449
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,920
It looks like a sign of death.

450
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,800
In fact, it's a way to send a signal to the outside world.

451
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,440
I hope the floating bodies can be recognized

452
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,480
so that the family can know where they are.

453
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,080
But it's been so long.

454
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,920
Only one girl's body was recognized by her old friend.

455
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,000
Chi Long?

456
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:52,200
So when Yulou Chun received the thunder and the

457
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,240
But Murong Yao couldn't reply.

458
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,880
So it was all planned by the girls.

459
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,480
Only one thing is the broken arm of Murong Yao.

460
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,240
I guess it's like this.

461
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,440
After the evening event,

462
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,240
Murong Yao will let the girls make up her mind

463
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,240
and make her own decision

464
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,360
to throw the body to Yulou Chun.

465
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,360
Chi Long never thought that Murong Yao would hurt herself.

466
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,440
So they made a move.

467
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,640
But they hid the body of Chun Si.

468
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,840
They wanted to kill Yulou Chun

469
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,440
and put the treasure and antidote in Xinjue's room

470
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,320
to frame her.

471
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,240
But the body of the bodyguard

472
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,640
made them kill one person.

473
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,200
The bodyguard has nothing to do with the Ghost King Sword.

474
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,360
If you want to eliminate suspicion,

475
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,560
you need to kill one more person

476
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,440
to make sure that the body of the bodyguard

477
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,720
is Xinjue's.

478
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,240
Right?

479
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,760
Dong Fang Hao?

480
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,240
Only the one who should be killed

481
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,000
can be killed.

482
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,840
Only then can they be at peace.

483
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,640
So the best person to choose

484
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,480
is Dong Fang Hao.

485
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,560
Dong Fang Hao is the enemy of the Ghost King Sword.

486
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,880
So when they cut the body of the bodyguard,

487
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,120
he practiced it before

488
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,240
and he was much more skilled.

489
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,600
If I'm right,

490
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,360
it's like that.

491
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,080
You're right.

492
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,920
Chi Long and I

493
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,440
have been childhood friends since we were kids.

494
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,680
We've been engaged for a long time.

495
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,200
Seven years ago,

496
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,640
he came to the Central Plains to participate in a competition

497
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,120
but disappeared suddenly.

498
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,160
After that,

499
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,480
I cared about his whereabouts.

500
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,960
So I came to the Central Plains

501
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,800
to check his whereabouts.

502
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,360
Until one day,

503
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,840
I found his hairpin

504
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,000
on a clothes rack.

505
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,960
I started to look for people

506
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,400
and checked a lot of whereabouts

507
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,600
of the missing woman.

508
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,520
Then I found out

509
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,080
that he had fallen into someone else's hands.

510
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,400
You don't understand

511
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,720
how it feels

512
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,280
to be in the same situation

513
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,240
with someone you love.

514
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,560
Since then,

515
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,480
I've sworn

516
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,920
that no matter what the price is,

517
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,400
I will save Chi Long.

518
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,360
All these years,

519
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,840
Man Shan Hong has been making great achievements in the martial arts world.

520
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,800
It's very mysterious.

521
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,000
In order to become

522
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,200
a guest in Yulou Village,

523
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,480
I've been in the capital for a year.

524
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,600
I've done a performance of the

525
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,040
Yin-Yang Dance.

526
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,840
Finally, I got the invitation of Lv Liu Chun.

527
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,000
I found an excuse to send the gift to the woman's house in advance.

528
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,080
Chi Long knew my plan at a glance.

529
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,680
Until that night,

530
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,200
Man Shan Hong and I

531
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,320
finished the last dance together.

532
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,600
When the bell rang in advance,

533
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,720
Lv Liu Chun had made countless calculations.

534
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,280
He didn't expect that he would die in a poisonous snake's mouth.

535
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,120
This is the retribution he has done.

536
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,040
I'm willing to do anything

537
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,440
to save Chi Long.

538
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,800
No matter what the result is,

539
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,240
I won't regret it.

540
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,440
I admire your determination.

541
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,840
But you can't save Chi Long

542
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,120
by yourself.

543
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,080
All the girls here

544
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,680
will have a peaceful life.

545
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,120
All the girls here

546
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,160
are also...

547
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,600
The money is so big.

548
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,760
They can't make a profit.

549
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,440
This is one of them.

550
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,200
You slept well last night.

551
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,560
It's because you added

552
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,800
aphrodite powder to the girls' lipsticks.

553
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,080
You'll know it at a glance.

554
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,600
This is the second one.

555
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,160
Xing Jue and Bi Huang's room

556
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,480
is full of treasures.

557
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,760
It's hard for them

558
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,160
to move down the mountain

559
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,240
in a few hours.

560
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,240
This is the third one.

561
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,000
Even if I don't say it,

562
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,760
can you really hide from Bai Chuan Yue

563
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,480
and the Supervisory Department?

564
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,040
Of course.

565
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,920
I'll tell them.

566
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,560
Li Shen Yi and Young Hero Fang

567
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,160
are really smart.

568
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,760
It seems that

569
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,040
we can't hide from them today.

570
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,320
Yes.

571
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,280
We killed them together.

572
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,080
But there's one thing

573
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,440
that you both are wrong.

574
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,920
The Black Iron Armor

575
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,480
wasn't made by Bi Huang alone.

576
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,560
Yu Lou Chun is suspicious.

577
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,680
So the girls who go to see Yun Feng

578
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,200
clean it every day

579
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,400
have all

580
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,680
the girls

581
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,360
in our house

582
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,760
rubbed it.

583
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,880
When we rubbed the murder weapon,

584
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,040
we felt extremely calm.

585
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,320
When we saw it getting more and more secretive,

586
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,600
we thought

587
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,800
maybe we could get rid of it as soon as possible.

588
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,200
We could live a life

589
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,520
that we've been longing for

590
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,120
in this hellish world.

591
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,520
This Black Iron Armor

592
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,960
is the life-threatening knife

593
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,560
that we gave to Yu Lou Chun.

594
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,880
Girls,

595
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,960
you want to kill Yu Lou Chun to get rid of the evil dreams.

596
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,200
It's possible.

597
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,640
But the gold bricks

598
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,320
will put you in danger again.

599
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,320
Bi Huang and Xing Jue only found jewelry there.

600
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,800
They didn't find the gold bricks.

601
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,960
This Yu Lou Chun

602
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,440
is a high-end business.

603
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,680
This war book

604
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,880
has recorded a lot of income of gold bricks.

605
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,800
But where is the gold brick?

606
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,080
We've never seen any gold bricks.

607
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,120
Xi Fei,

608
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,800
I think you can't cut off

609
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,880
the Yu Lou Chun that you've practiced Yugu Jue.

610
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,480
Whether there are gold bricks or not

611
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,280
is the answer here.

612
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,840
The answer is here.

613
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,120
The answer is here.

614
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,440
The answer is here.

615
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,720
Gold bricks are heavy.

616
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,840
Only when they are put together

617
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,040
can you cut off the Yugu Jue.

618
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,160
But the gold bricks are too heavy.

619
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,040
It's impossible to carry them down the mountain.

620
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,240
So,

621
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,960
they can only be hidden here.

622
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,040
Ladies and gentlemen,

623
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,160
Yu Lou Chun sells ointment.

624
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,080
His business partners

625
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,080
are all evil men.

626
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,640
If he dies,

627
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,440
those evil men

628
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,480
won't let go of the gold bricks.

629
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,240
You've put so much effort

630
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,600
to get back to life.

631
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,600
But if you get these money,

632
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,400
you'll never get back to life.

633
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,360
I beg you to give yourselves a way

634
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,280
to call the Bai Chuan Garden to make a decision.

635
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,600
We will protect you with our lives.

636
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,000
Other women

637
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,080
prefer to use the free world.

638
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,280
You can follow me.

639
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,040
All the gold bricks are here.

640
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,080
So,

641
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,520
you put them all in the walls?

642
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,120
Let's hide the gold bricks

643
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,120
because we planned to be here for years.

644
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,760
to leave some memories for yourself.

645
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,840
So that the dead parents

646
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,640
can have some money to live a better life.

647
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,000
We know our mistakes.

648
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,400
But Mr. Murong didn't do anything wrong.

649
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,480
We beg you to forgive them

650
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,760
for their intention to save people.

651
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,840
We girls of the female house

652
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,320
are willing to bear all the blame.

653
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,120
Please let Mr. Murong go.

654
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,960
Please let Mr. Murong go.

655
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,720
Please get up, ladies.

656
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,120
I'll tell Bai Chanyun

657
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,920
about the sufferings of everyone

658
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:12,760
and Murong Yao.

659
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,280
Yes. Bai Chanyun will give you justice.

660
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,600
Please get up.

661
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,560
What justice?

662
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,080
It's not justice at all.

663
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,600
Why are you holding me up?

664
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,800
I was also killed by Yulong Chun.

665
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,320
I want to get out of here, too.

666
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,720
Why didn't you tell me?

667
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,400
Why am I the only one

668
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,640
who is kept in the dark?

669
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,040
Because we thought you were our sister.

670
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,240
You were here for less than two months.

671
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,640
And we, the least,

672
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,520
have been here for two years.

673
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,680
The girls are short-lived.

674
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,080
They are locked up in this dark place.

675
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,840
We have long considered

676
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,360
ourselves as half-dead people.

677
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,000
Every time we saw you

678
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,000
crying and trying to get out of here,

679
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,600
we thought of ourselves back then.

680
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,720
So we can't let you know

681
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,440
about this.

682
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,480
If you fail, you won't know.

683
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,240
If you succeed,

684
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,720
you won't be killed.

685
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,880
After you leave here,

686
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,600
you can still be

687
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,840
a happy girl.

688
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,920
Sister.

689
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,400
I'm ashamed.

690
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,960
I was so mean to these poor girls yesterday.

691
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,320
I deserve it.

692
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,680
Yulong Chun is a bastard.

693
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,640
He deserves to die.

694
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,600
The ship is about to arrive.

695
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,360
The injustice you suffered

696
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,480
is also a serious one.

697
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,480
Mr. Fang.

698
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,480
Your Fang family is a big family.

699
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,480
Why don't you help them?

700
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,480
Don't worry.

701
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,680
I've told them.

702
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,200
If they have nowhere to go,

703
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,120
the Heaven and Earth Villa will take them in.

704
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,360
These bad guys

705
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,360
are far away from the old road.

706
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,840
It's best to drink.

707
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,480
Yesterday, in the cave

708
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,040
where Qingran hid,

709
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,800
we found another place

710
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,400
in Yulong Chun.

711
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,560
It's a pity that we don't have the mood to visit it.

712
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,480
Forget it.

713
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,800
Now we don't have the mood to look for treasure.

714
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,760
Let's leave it to the Baichuan Courtyard.

715
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,480
Let's check it.

716
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,840
No one else can enter.

717
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,040
Are you disappointed?

718
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,240
I was just curious.

719
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,840
I didn't expect you two to be joking and fooling me.

720
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,920
Joking?

721
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,920
Are you looking for this?

722
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,400
What is this?

723
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,200
I've never seen it.

724
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,720
Of course you haven't seen it.

725
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,720
Because when Bi Huang died,

726
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,120
he didn't give it to you.

727
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,360
What are you talking about?

728
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,720
I don't understand.

729
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,040
It's very strange.

730
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,760
You don't understand?

731
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,680
You were looking for the ice sheet for the Golden Agreement Alliance.

732
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,600
Who knew that Yulou Chun was killed and the treasure was missing?

733
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,040
You hid it for the time being.

734
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,120
Finally you found out that Bi Huang sent a letter to us.

735
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,080
You went to force him.

736
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,320
But Bi Huang didn't give it to you.

737
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,960
What if you can't find the ice sheet?

738
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,840
So you wanted to kill him.

739
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,800
This is a good move.

740
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,840
Come, look.

741
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,320
He had already embroidered the ice sheet into Qing Ting's wings.

742
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,920
So he lied to you.

743
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,320
The two of you are guilty of no punishment.

744
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,680
Do you have evidence?

745
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,400
Evidence?

746
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,360
You're so stubborn.

747
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,720
Bi Huang wrote the letter to the right hand.

748
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,600
But the left hand's palm

749
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,280
is covered with ink and the ice sheet.

750
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,600
This is the evidence.

751
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,600
Only you, Yi Zishi,

752
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,200
who is related to ink,

753
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,720
made the clothes.

754
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,240
Mo Liao was found out.

755
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,680
attaq

756
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,000
Ennia

757
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,920
Calamity

758
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,720
No

759
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,760
No

760
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,080
Thunder and Fire Yangtze

761
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,720
If it's not wrong

762
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,320
only to lose two of our lives at this moment in time.

763
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,320
You will do best.

764
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,280
If we do get it over with,

765
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,080
let's talk about dealings.

766
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,880
If you want to live, give me the ice.

767
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,680
You mean the iron windmill?

768
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,680
It's stuck on the hillside of the bridge.

769
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,480
It's noisy when there are few people.

770
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,680
I pulled it out when I came here.

771
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,280
I heard it.

772
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,480
It's the iron windmill.

773
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,880
It's the iron windmill.

774
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,280
It's the iron windmill.

775
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,480
I heard it.

776
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,080
Now it's my turn to make a condition.

777
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,280
Tell me.

778
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,080
Where are the two ice pieces

779
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,480
except for Yulou Village and Golden Pond?

780
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,280
Do you think I'll betray the Golden Pond Alliance?

781
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,480
I just said it casually.

782
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,480
You can't say it.

783
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,480
Fang Xiaobao won't let you go.

784
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,880
So, Li's Mansion is the devil of the Golden Pond Alliance.

785
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,880
The devil is going to be beaten to a pig's head.

786
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,280
It's a single hit.

787
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,480
It's a single hit.

788
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,080
It's a beast.

789
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,080
Right.

790
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:25,880
Right, Shen Yi.

791
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,080
They said what the ice piece is.

792
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,280
Why did the Golden Pond Alliance find the ice piece?

793
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,880
The ice piece is an invaluable jewel.

794
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,480
Maybe the person who Di Feishan wants to give it to

795
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,680
is not a person.

796
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,280
Don't tell anyone.

797
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,880
I'm afraid it's a life-threatening thing.

798
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,280
Okay.

799
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,680
Go.

800
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,680
Congratulations, Fang Dubing.

801
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,880
You broke the big case again.

802
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,680
The girl in the girl's house is interrogated by the Supervisory Department.

803
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,080
The Golden Pond is divided into two groups.

804
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,880
The one who is clear and clear will not be blamed.

805
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,680
Yang Yunchun.

806
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,480
Take all the girls in charge of you away.

807
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,080
As you said,

808
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,280
let's go.

809
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,280
I dare not.

810
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,480
Supervisor Supervisor Yang Yunchun.

811
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,480
You should kneel down when you see me.

812
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,480
Yang Yunchun.

813
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,880
Greetings to Princess Zhaoling.

814
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,880
Master.

815
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,080
Princess Zhaoling.

816
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,880
Your fiancee.

817
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,880
May I ask why you are here?

818
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,480
When did you ask me?

819
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,080
Now I order you

820
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,480
to release all the girls and the evil spirits in the girl's house.

821
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,480
And protect them from the evil spirits.

822
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,280
If there is any mistake,

823
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,080
I will punish you.

824
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:22,680
Princess.

825
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,680
The evil spirits are the leaders of the Jianghu.

826
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,480
It's the duty of the Baichuan Courtyard.

827
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,280
I want them to be safe.

828
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,480
If they can't be caught,

829
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,280
I will go to tell father about you.

830
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,080
Yes.

831
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,680
I will report to the Supervisory Department

832
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,080
and talk to the Baichuan Courtyard.

833
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,080
Get up.

834
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,280
Thank you, princess.

835
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:38,880
Qing.

836
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,080
You are the princess.

837
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,280
Thank you, princess.

838
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,280
Thank you, princess.

839
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,280
Get up, everyone.

840
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,480
Get up.

841
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,280
We are all in danger.

842
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,280
Why do you stand on the edge?

843
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,080
I remember your kindness to me.

844
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,880
If anyone bullies you,

845
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,680
just tell me.

846
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,080
I will be mad at you.

847
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,280
Qing.

848
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,680
Princess Jing'ou.

849
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,480
I know what you are thinking.

850
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,680
You think I am stupid and a traitor.

851
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,880
You think I am a laughing stock.

852
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,680
I dare not.

853
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,480
You dare not.

854
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,480
You think you are right.

855
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,280
Look carefully.

856
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,080
I am a tall and strong man.

857
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,280
Forget it.

858
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,080
Since you saved me,

859
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,480
I won't bother you.

860
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,680
I have been out for so long.

861
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,280
Father must be worried about me.

862
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,680
The Overwatch Department is sending me back.

863
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,880
Goodbye, princess.

864
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,480
You are in such a hurry.

865
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,680
Who are you sending me to?

866
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,480
You said you were leaving.

867
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,480
I sent you back.

868
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,480
You are so stupid.

869
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,080
I am leaving now.

870
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,680
Don't worry about the wedding.

871
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,480
I will go back and ask for your favor.

872
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,080
You are so generous.

873
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,680
I am very grateful.

874
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,280
Grateful for what?

875
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,880
The wedding is just a few days away.

876
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,080
What's the difference?

877
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,280
We will do it after you get married.

878
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,280
It's the same.

879
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,480
The old days are long to come.

880
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:23,480
Let's change our destiny.

881
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,280
The world is in a dream.

882
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:31,680
The long journey is short.

883
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,680
Who doesn't want to

884
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,480
walk on the road?

885
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:53,280
The long journey is short.
