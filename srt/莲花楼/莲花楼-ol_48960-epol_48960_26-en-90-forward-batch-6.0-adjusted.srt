4
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,759
Where did all these people go?

5
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:47,460
After fighting, no matter the outcome,

6
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,330
they'd naturally have to leave.

7
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,900
Even if they left right after beating people up,

8
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,229
this is an inn after all.

9
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:53,460
It has been deserted all these years.

10
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,340
You mean no one would have cleaned this up?

11
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,740
So many people died here.

12
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,300
There are also so many talismans downstairs.

13
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,500
They dare not come in?

14
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,590
Is there a ghost?

15
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,630
This place is weird and eerie.

16
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,290
Let's just go.

17
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:18,980
Wait.

18
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:26,570
Wait.

19
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,820
There seems to be a hidden door here.

20
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,420
There are only three of us here.

21
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,500
Why are there a pair of footprints here?

22
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,880
There really is a ghost, huh?

23
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:07,770
What was that?

24
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,370
After him!

25
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,670
Let's stop chasing.

26
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,360
What on earth was that?

27
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,260
I've never seen this kind of creature before.

28
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,330
This is not a normal creature.

29
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,540
That's right.

30
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,000
Its power and speed are both extraordinary.

31
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,250

-We're in the wrong place.
-We're just passing by.
-We're staying the night.

35
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,079
There's a ghost inside.

36
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,660
We all dare not come in.

37
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,930
So there is really a ghost after all.

38
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,870
S-so there really is a ghost.

39
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,840
Since it was getting quite late,

40
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,880
we wanted to stay the night here.

41
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,870
But we didn't expect that it was pitch dark in here.

42
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,180
It's really scary.

43
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,220
Yes, indeed.

and he even helped them?

63
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:55,990
The lord?

64
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,580
I've sent people to look for him everywhere these few days.

65
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,040
Why is he with them?

66
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,960
He didn't seem to recognize us.

67
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,380
What did you say?

68
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,790
The lord asked us who we were,

69
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,090
and who he was.

70
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,520
He was ruthless when fighting us.

71
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,520
Could it be that the Wuxin Huai

72
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,380
made him lose his memory?

73
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,700
That day when the man in black injected the Wuxin Huai into the lord's body,

74
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,230
I felt something was wrong.

75
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,380
After that, I sent people to look but couldn't find him anywhere.

76
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,710
I felt even more uneasy.

77
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,160
Looks like something really went wrong.

78
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,350
Where are you going, Saintess?

79
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,070
I was just about to settle things out with you.

80
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,890
You lied to me.

81
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,540
You didn't just give Di Feisheng any regular Wuxin Huai,

82
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,870
but the pure Wuxin Huai.

83
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:45,280
You're planning to overthrow him.

84
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,030
So what?

85
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,050
If you dare to hurt him,

86
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,570
I'll make you pay.

87
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,220
Di Feisheng only lost his memory for now.

88
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,620
He's not seriously hurt.

89
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,690
On the contrary,

90
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,140
you let the Rama Heavenly Ice fall into others' hands,

91
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,340
and caused our plan to fail terribly.

92
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,420
Saintess,

93
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,260
can you give me an explanation?

94
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,200
It was just a one-off mistake.

95
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,940
I'll take care of it.

96
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,050
It's none of your business.

97
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:13,620
Sure.

98
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,140
I won’t worry.

99
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,060
I came here today

100
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,970
to give you a surprise.

101
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,880
Do you want to know where Li Xiangyi is?

102
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,280
Li Xiangyi?

103
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,970
You tried so hard

104
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,870
to find out where Li Xiangyi is.

105
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,140
The spy I planted beside Qiao Wanmian

106
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,490
sent a message back recently,

107
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,900
saying that they discovered the inner breath of

108
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,960
Yangzhouman in Qiao Wanmian's body.

109
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,240
There was no such inner breath before.

110
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,260
It was after Qiao Wanmian was poisoned

111
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,580
by your Iced Cicada and got cured,

112
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,600
that it suddenly appeared.

113
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,000
Yangzhouman?

114
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,030
No.

115
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,830
The Iced Cicada in Qiao Wanmian's body

116
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:56,330
was cured by Di Feisheng.

117
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:58,120
Was it really Di Feisheng?

118
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,659
In this world, the Iced Cicada's poison

119
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:03,020
can only be cured by Yangzhouman's inner breath.

120
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,590
You know that best.

121
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,470
If it's not Di Feisheng,

122
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,360
then there's only one person who was in contact with Qiao Wanmian.

123
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,000
Li Lianhua.

124
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,980
It really is him.

125
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,310
Li Lianhua

126
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,380
is Li Xiangyi.

127
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,870
Di Feisheng is still trying his best to cover up for them.

128
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,990
I was devoted to him,

129
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,600
and tried to do everything to help him get rid of Li Xiangyi.

130
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,820
Not only did he not tell me anything,

131
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,980
but also helped him to lie to me and deceive me.

132
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,110
My beautiful Lady Jiao.

133
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,409
It seems that your way to win people's hearts

134
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:44,100
isn't anything worth mentioning.

135
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,830
And you don't know a thing about

136
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,700
what they're doing by joining forces.

137
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,980
You're really useless as

138
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,080
the Saintess of Jinyuan Alliance.

139
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,409
How dare you say anything about me?

140
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,810
If it weren't for your master's sake,

141
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,470
you would have been long dead.

142
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,409
Please calm down, Saintess.

143
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:04,409
It was my mistake.

144
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,650
Actually, I'm doing this

145
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,890
for your sake too.

146
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,380
Di Feisheng has found out about us working together.

147
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,840
He couldn't tolerate you.

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,270
Isn't it better for him to lose his memory now?

149
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,860
He won't pay attention to both of us,

150
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,190
and after you bring him back in the future,

151
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,660
you can train him however you want.

152
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,380
According to Master's orders,

153
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,660
what is most crucial now

154
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,900
is to first confirm if that person is Li Xiangyi.

155
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,030
Then, take back the Rama Heavenly Ice.

156
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,020
Your master only asked me to help

157
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,000
and work together with him.

158
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,530
Who is he to order me around?

159
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,300
I'll take care of my own matters myself.

160
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,100
Since you are his dog,

161
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,220
go back and tell him this.

162
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,120
When I come back,

163
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,299
I will settle scores with him properly.

164
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,419
All of Wansheng Clan is at your disposal.

165
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,310
Thank you for letting us stay here tonight, Elder Shi.

166
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,820
No one has come to our village for years.

167
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,880
It’s a fateful coincidence that you three are here.

168
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,820
Elder Shi,

169
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,100
have the villagers always been living in seclusion here?

170
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,160
It has been more than a hundred years.

171
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,300
Our ancestors moved here back then

172
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,580
when fleeing from war.

173
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,340
It was only when an outsider came in more than ten years ago

174
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,460
that our village had contact

175
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,500
with anyone from outside the village.

176
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,300
Come this way.

177
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,160
Please have a seat.

178
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,070
This is the wild donkey meat that we usually eat in our village.

179
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,940
I don't know if you will like it.

180
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,550
I didn’t expect the food in the village to be so abundant.

181
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,330
Thank you, Elder Shi.

182
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,980
But I’ve been praying to Buddha recently.

183
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,210
I heard that wild donkeys in the mountains

184
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,500
understand humans very well.

185
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,670
I really can't bear to eat them,

186
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,130
so I'll politely decline.

187
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,000
I see.

188
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,980
In that case,

189
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,770
please try this Rouchang wine

190
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,470
brewed with cold spring water from our village.

191
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,560
This young hero here, why don’t you sit down?

192
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,990
Elder Shi.

193
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,180
To be honest with you,

194
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,220
my two brothers here with me

195
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,580
are also fasting just like me.

196
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,910
So we won't be able to partake in the delicious food and wine.

197
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,500
I see.

198
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,000
Yes.

199
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,200
It is indeed a pity.

200
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,410
Elder Shi,

201
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,230
this Rouchang wine you just mentioned.

202
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,460
Is it the legendary wine that will

203
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,700
boost the inner power of

204
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,970
martial arts practitioners after drinking it?

205
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,770
You are right.

206
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,390
The person who accidentally

207
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,620
entered the village more than ten years ago

208
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,280
found that this Rouchang wine

209
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,740
could enhance his power.

210
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:45,810
So,

211
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,840
it attracted many people to come.

212
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,860
But when they knew

213
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,440
the Rouchang wine was made from the cold spring in the village,

214
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,400
they started to fight for the cold spring

215
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,460
and cut down fruit trees to make wine.

216
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,790
The spring dried out,

217
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,220
all the trees were cut down,

218
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,700
and the village was left in a complete shambles because of them.

219
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,950
After they left,

220
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,380
we blocked off the road to the village.

221
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,530
All these years, besides the three of you today,

222
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,540
no one else has ever been here.

223
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,480
If the cold spring has dried out for so many years,

224
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,860
[Rouchang wine]

225
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,880
where is this bottle from then?

226
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,460
After so many years,

227
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,940
no one is fighting for the cold spring anymore.

228
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,790
So the spring water in the mountain

229
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,520
slowly revived a little.

230
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,580
The inns in the village were built

231
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,310
back then for those martial arts practitioners.

232
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,590
After they left,

233
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,970
no one has stayed there since,

234
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,770
which is why it's been deserted.

235
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,510
I see.

236
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,140
Elder Shi,

237
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,690
what happened in this inn?

238
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,350
To be honest,

239
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,950
more than ten years ago,

240
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,200
those people from the martial arts world

241
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,280
started a fight in the inn

242
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,050
over a little bit of cold spring water.

243
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,620
Much blood was shed.

244
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,970
It's been so long.

245
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,680
Why did no one clean it up?

246
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,440
There's a ghost inside.

247
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,170
The villagers were intending

248
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,000
to collect the bodies for burial.

249
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,880
But who knew,

250
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,230
all the bodies disappeared overnight.

251
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,500
It must be those people who transformed.

252
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,760
They will hurt people.

253
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,340
So no one dares to go in.

254
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,860
So that was what happened.

255
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,350
Fortunately, we left fast then.

256
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:23,970
By the way,

257
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,010
among the people who came here then,

258
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,820
was there someone who often wore a mask

259
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,860
looking like the King of Hell

260
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,260
and was called the Lord of the Netherworld?

261
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,120
Lord of the Netherworld?

262
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,550
There were too many of them coming here back then.

263
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,070
It's been so many years.

264
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,560
I can't remember.

265
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,650
Are you looking for someone?

266
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,460
That man is an old master that

267
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,160
my brother here has admired for a long time.

268
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,960
He hasn't met him before either.

269
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:58,590
Yes.

270
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,450
I heard that Master Lian Quan

271
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,380
also drank the Rouchang wine here before.

272
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,110
I want to pursue his footsteps,

273
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,220
so I'm just taking the chance to ask.

274
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,180
I can't help you much there.

275
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,090
It's getting late.

276
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,940
Please rest early.

277
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,180
I'll send you out of the village tomorrow morning.

278
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,360
Thank you.

279
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,780
Are you hungry?

280
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,730
I'm fasting.

281
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,800
I had to find an explanation you know.

282
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,390
On our journey here,

283
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,640
don't you think it's strange?

284
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,170
Yes.

285
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,930
It's strange indeed.

286
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,980
The villagers hide when they see us

287
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,740
and avoid us.

288
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,830
But yet they prepared so much food for us now.

289
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,510
It's better not to touch it.

290
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,700
So in my opinion,

291
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,170
this must be...

292
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,190
A clip joint?

293
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,860
You're not being serious again.

294
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,420
A clip joint should be located in a place with people,

295
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,420
not in this kind of secluded corner.

296
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:05,940
Fang Duobing.

297
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,560
Have you heard?

298
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,800
Many mountains are inhabited by cannibalistic tribes

299
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,840
who only eat humans.

300
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,440
Then the villagers here...

301
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,840
This won't do.

302
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,400
Let's go to the kitchen to have a look.

303
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,590
There's nothing here either.

304
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,350
Where did they hide the meat?

305
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,620
Since there's something wrong with the food in the village,

306
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,910
do you think the Lord of the Netherworld

307
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,840
got ambushed after eating the meat

308
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,620
and drinking the wine here?

309
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,980
I remember Su Xiaoyong said

310
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:58,450
they found his last tracks in Shishou Village.

311
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,700
We haven't heard any news about him since then.

312
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,560
Did something happen to him here?

313
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,820
Indeed, many highly-skilled people

314
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,380
were in that inn earlier,

315
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,930
and there were traces of a fight.

316
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,180
But I didn't find any traces of Lian Quan's martial arts.

317
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:09,700
Maybe,

318
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,110
he never entered the inn.

319
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,580
People usually stop in the inn temporarily.

320
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,440
If someone were really

321
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,440
cutting trees and making wine here,

322
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,920
they'd have to stay here for a while.

323
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,140
But when we entered the village this afternoon,

324
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,220
there were only houses where long-time villagers lived.

325
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,580
I didn't see any new houses built

326
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,580
by any outsiders.

327
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,620
Could it be the elder that's making things up?

328
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,620
In reality, no one was willing

329
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,480
to stay and fight for the spring water to make wine.

330
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,690
Why would she lie?

331
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,600
We've all heard stories about this Rouchang wine.

332
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,380
But have you ever thought about

333
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,580
whether someone really drank this wine

334
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,680
and came to this Shishou Village?

335
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,020
You're right.

336
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:48,840
In this world,

337
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,740
there's only ever been tales of this Rouchang wine.

338
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,900
But I've never heard anyone claim that

339
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,960
he drank this wine.

340
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,540
If Elder Shi is speaking the truth,

341
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,660
and many martial artist practitioners have been here,

342
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,200
there should be many people going around

343
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,410
bragging about it.

344
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,560
The Rouchang wine can boost your internal power.

345
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,970
Where did this saying come from?

346
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,040
Many people came here in search of it,

347
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,540
but no one has ever returned successfully.

348
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,060
I have heard that

349
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,790
Tianying Gang once sent disciples

350
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,520
to look for this Rouchang wine.

351
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,000
But we don't know what happened after that.

352
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:18,930
Think about it.

353
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,980
Everyone who came to this village disappeared.

354
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,980
Where did they go?

355
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,410
This won't do.

356
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,640
We'll have to be more alert tonight.

357
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,500
We can't sleep.

358
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,490
I've always stayed awake in an unfamiliar environment.

359
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,430
Fang Duobing.

360
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,100
I'll leave standing guard tonight to you.

361
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,880
I'm going to bed.

362
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,740
Not like I can do anything if I stay awake anyway.

363
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,650
If something really happens,

364
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,650
please act smart.

365
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:43,670
Wait.

366
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,940
Earlier at the inn,

367
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,100
you could tell at a glance

368
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,570
the different martial skills from each sect.

369
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,460
You're very well-versed in martial arts.

370
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,990
Stop pretending to be modest.

371
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,120
Stay and guide me.

372
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,150
Maybe you can even protect me.

373
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,540
If you really want to hear about

374
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,000
the secret martial art manuals of sword-fighting

375
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,930
of all the sects,

376
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,290
pick a time when the sun is out

377
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,070
and I'll recite everything for you.

378
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,620
As for martial arts and fighting,

379
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,100
and protecting everyone's safety, I'll leave it to you.

380
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,430
You're the best at this.

381
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,540
This sly old fox.

382
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,170
Stop badmouthing me behind my back.

383
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,030
You darned fox!

384
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:08,820
Here.

385
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,130
I soaked it in water before.

386
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:11,950
Just make do with it for now.

387
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:12,680
It's edible.

388
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,910
Forget it if you're not eating.

389
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:20,600
Thanks.

390
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,270
You actually took it.

391
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,260
I thought a dark-faced fiend like you didn't need any care from others

392
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,920
and didn't care about others.

393
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,810
You're better after losing your memory.

394
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,860
You better not touch anything here.

395
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,580
Thanks.

396
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,960
He's not that bad at heart.

397
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,810
Maybe we can change him for the better

398
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,410
while his memory is lost.

399
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:04,780
Fei,

400
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,500
do you have any aspirations in your life?

401
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,300
Martial arts.

402
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,620
Martial arts aren't an aspiration.

403
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,460
Practicing the highest form of martial arts.

404
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,500
There are two types of martial arts practitioners.

405
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,380
One of them helps the weak,

406
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,410
and the other takes advantage of the weak.

407
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,460
You can become a hero everyone admires,

408
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,060
or become a demon

409
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,860
that everyone wants to get rid of.

410
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,300
Which one will you choose?

411
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,360
It doesn't matter.

412
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,380
Let me rephrase my question then.

413
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,900
What will you do if someone

414
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:33,990
accidentally offends you?

415
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,900
I will kill him.

416
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,220
How can you do that?

417
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,380
As the old saying goes,

418
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,970
the best thing of a gentleman is to be kind to others.

419
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,460
Acts of kindness need to be accumulated,

420
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,520
and acts of evil...

421
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,770
What are you trying to say?

422
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,970
I just want to tell you

423
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,540
martial arts practitioners

424
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,740
should be righteous.

425
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,970
You shouldn't kill for your own selfish desire.

426
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,200
We should help the weak,

427
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,130
and get rid of...

428
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,100
I know you once went astray.

429
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,010
But who hasn't erred in their life before?

430
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,700
The most important thing is to turn over a new leaf.

431
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,660
It's fine if you don't want to listen.

432
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,590
But how can you attack me like this?

433
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,340
What's that smell?

434
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,110
It's the candle.

435
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,150
Something is hidden in the candle.

436
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:45,950
It's too late.

437
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,450
We inhaled some of it.

438
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:53,980
It's the Wuxin Huai.

439
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,100
Are you okay?

440
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,450
How are you?

441
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,760
What are these things?

442
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:17,840
I don't know.

443
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,080
It's the Jade Cloud Bagua Mirror.

444
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,360
Could it be the Chief of Cuihua Mountain

445
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,090
who went missing ten years ago?

446
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,160
It's the Iron Door.

447
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,740
Blue Wolf Whirlwind Shu Tianhua,

448

and Redface Flying Dagger Zhu Mofei!

449
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,150
Are we having a martial arts showdown?

450
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,480
How do you know them all?

451
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,380
They are martial art experts who've been missing for years.

452
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,260
I can still fight them if it's one by one.

453
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,190
But they're coming in hoards.

454
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,610
We'll be ripped to shreds.

455
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:50,070
Channel your energy to force out the poison.

456

It's really him.

462
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,190
I was scared to death just now.

463
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,560
Luckily I hid in time.

464
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,440
A few monsters came here just now.

465
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,360
Who are they?

466
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,590
Are you okay?

467
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,660
What could happen to me?

468
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:44,830
No, you...

469
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,400
What are you doing?

470
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,940
Stop getting your hands

471
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,870
all over me.

472
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,890
Ridiculous, seriously.

473
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,400
You're like a lunatic.

474
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,880
I'm just worried about you.

475
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,220
There's something wrong with the candle.

476
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,780
Luckily you didn't light it.

477
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,520
Luckily for Fei and I...

478
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,790
the master in white from last time helped us.

479
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:03,500
Master in white?

480
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,700
What master in white?

481
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,550
Have you seen the master in white?

482
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,480
What master in white?

483
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,150
When those monsters came over earlier,

484
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,230
I was scared to death.

485
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,810
I immediately hid behind this door

00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:17,410
and didn't even dare to look.

487

Why didn't you come earlier?

Oh, I see.

489
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,600
When those people ran away earlier,

490
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,590
they were shouting.

491
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,660
I'm afraid he's summoning his companions.

492
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,920
We'd better leave now.

00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,500
Young Hero Lu.

509
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,260
So it's you all.

510
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:46,150
Let's kill off these monsters first.

511
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:05,210
Stop chasing.

512
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,570
Wrap up your wounds first.

513
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:09,030
They are more excited after smelling blood.

514
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,810
Thank you for your help earlier, Brother Lu.

515
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:16,670
I was passing by

516
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,340
and heard sounds of fighting.

517
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,600
So I came to take a look.

518
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,520
I didn't expect it was you all.

519
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,300
This village is very secluded.

520
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,140
Why are you here, Brother Lu?

521
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:26,990
To be honest,

522
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,770
three years ago, I made plans with a friend of mine,

523
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,900
Kunlun Sect's Cosmos Fortune Palm, Jin Youdao,

524
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,460
to compete in the tournament at Bahuang Hunyuan Lake nearby.

525
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,980
But I waited for him here for a month,

526
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,220
and still haven't met him.

527
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,090
After going to Kunlun Sect to find him,

528
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:41,590
I found out that there was no news of him for a month.

529
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:44,200
I've been looking for him since then.

530
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,930
Was the old friend you were reminiscing about

531
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:48,620
at the Girls' Mansion Jin Youdao?

532
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,130
The day we agreed to compete together

533
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:51,950
is exactly three years ago from today.

534
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,120
From then, on this day every year,

535
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,900
I would come here to wait for him.

536
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,900
I believe he's not a person who will break his promise.

537
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,600
Competition?

538
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:04,040
Cosmos Fortune Palm has always been a renowned hero.

539
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,840
Good people are always blessed.

540
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,750
When I came here before,

541
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,410
it was surrounded by cliffs here.

542
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:11,350
But today I found that

543
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,640
a path opened up at the original location of the cliff.

544
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,490
I thought it was strange, so I walked in,

545
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,800
and found this village.

546
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,530
A path that suddenly opened up?

547
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,540
I don't think it's a path that suddenly appeared.

548
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,490
I'm afraid this village has always

549
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,750
kept a path to contact the outside world.

550
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,840
It's not any hidden place.

551
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,000
They even have the Wuxin Huai.

552
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,250
Could this be related to Nanyin too?

553
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:35,370
Nanyin?

554
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,460
The foreign tribe that's been extinct for over a hundred years?

555
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,200
If that's the case,

556
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,200
it would be worse.

557
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,740
I don't know where Lianhua is brought to now.

558
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,150
He can't even hold a sword now.

559
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:45,980
If anything happens,

560
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,380
he won't be able to fight.

561
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,530
I won't let anything happen to him.

562
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:54,250
Why are you suddenly caring about his safety?

563
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,650
In any case, he can't die.

564
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,510
We made such a big ruckus.

565
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,550
But yet the elders and villagers

566
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:00,920
didn't react at all.

567
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:04,080
Are these villagers hiding from these monsters?

568
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:06,700
Kiddo.

569
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:07,710
Let me ask you.

570
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:08,740
It's dark now,

571
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,270
I told you not to run around!

572
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,720
No wonder they never go out after dark.

573
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,980
It was to avoid these people.

574
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,180
These monsters are all martial experts

575
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,710
who suddenly disappeared.

576
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,080
I can't believe they're all here.

577
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,420
Jin Youdao also disappeared suddenly.

578
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,750
He even made plans to meet you around here.

579
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,950
Could it be related to this village too?

580
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:30,990
That inn is full of traces of

581
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,530
martial experts fighting.

582
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,300
It must have been moves made by them

583
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,220
when they were still sober.

584
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:40,360
But those people obviously already lost their consciousness.

585
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:43,420
Could they have been lured to this village

586
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,670
and got poisoned

587
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,650
or came down with some illness,

588
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,450
that caused them to be like this?

589
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,560
If that's the case,

590
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:50,850
did that also happen to Brother Jin?

591
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,040
This is bad.

592
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,290
Looks like Lianhua also...

593
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:58,290
Since the people who fought in the inn are still normal,

594
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:00,020
something must have happened.

595
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,790
Is the monster you fought with earlier

596
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,350
the same as those in the inn?

597
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,960
Let's go take a look.

598
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:08,170
We should be able to find some clues.

599
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,620
Heaven never bars one's way,

600
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,230
or there'd really be no way out.

601
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,030
Now it seems that

602
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,990
there are so many talismans here.

603
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,090
These were probably placed by the people living here

604
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,360
to chase away those who lost their consciousness,

605
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,370
and repel the evil spirits.

606
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,070
Those people are covered in blood,

607
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,540
and they're even faster than humans.

608
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,740
It's likely that they're treated as ghosts.

609
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,470
Could it be that the martial experts staying here

610
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,900
suddenly got attacked by those who came previously

611
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,100
and already lost their consciousness?

612
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,470
So that's why

613
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,100
such a fierce fight happened here.

614
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:03,960
That means that

615
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,510
people kept coming here

616
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,180
and kept getting turned into monsters.

617
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:11,940
Li Lianhua once said

618
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,870
there are traces of Kunlun Sect's martial arts here.

619
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:19,910
It's him.

620
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:21,140
I recognize it.

621
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,990
The heavens as palms, and the earth as claws.

622
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,660
Is this really Brother Jin's unique skill,

623
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,940
the Cosmos Fortune Palm?

624
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,270
Did he really come here?

625
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,680
Where is he now?

626
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,540
Brother Lu,

627
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,500
there are rumors that you are an alcohol fanatic.

628
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,700
Do you like drinking?

629
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:35,800
Yes.

630
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,540
But what does it have to do with this?

631
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,580
Have you ever heard of

632
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,710
the Rouchang wine in Shishou Village?

633
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,980
This is the legendary Shishou Village?

634
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,410
If not?

635
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,350
I once told Brother Jin about this Rouchang wine.

636
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,430
Although I don't believe that

637
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,260
the wine can boost internal power,

638
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,570
I heard this wine was made with spring water.

639
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:58,500
It must be fragrant and delicious.

640
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,380
I've always wanted to taste it.

641
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:07,860
Brother Jin!

642
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,380
I'm here

643
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,510
to remind you

644
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,450
[Cosmos Fortune Palm, Jin Youdao]

645
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,300
about the competition next month.

646
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,430
Next month, at the Bahuang Hunyuan Lake at Mount Chrysanthemum.

647
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,490
I'll see you there.

648
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,820
Bahuang Hunyuan Lake.

649
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:20,650
Why there?

650
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,070
You'll know when you get there.

651
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,460
After the competition,

652
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,170
I'll gift you something good.

653
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,980
Could it be that the gift

654
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,390
Brother Jin wanted to give me

655
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,720
was this Rouchang wine?

656
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,770
So he ran into an accident here

657
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:36,380
because of this Rouchang wine.

658
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,620
This Rouchang wine

659
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,200
is actually a trick to lure people here.

660
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,220
The reason why no one has said they came to this village

661
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,280
and drank this wine

662
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,860
is because everyone who's come here before never made it out.

663
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,060
I remember there was a secret door here.

664
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,030
There must be something fishy if they have a secret room here.

665
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,630
Maybe we can find some clues.

666
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,610
The mechanism is up there.

667
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:14,670
Fei...

668
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,920
I already knew you were good friends with Brother Li.

669
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,180
I didn't expect you and Brother Fei to work together so well too.

670
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,380
I don't know him well.

671
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,260
Me neither.

672
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:21,990
Suiyan.

673
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,340
It's Nanyin again.

674
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,220
Looks like he died after being decapitated.

675
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,660
These clothes are covered with dust.

676
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,610
There's no blood on them

677
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,020
and they are dressed neatly.

678
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,700
There are obvious tearing marks where the head was severed off.

679
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,890
This corpse was decapitated

680
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:52,950
after it dried out.

681
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,500
There's no trace of blood around.

682
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,960
And the part where the head was severed is also like torn paper.

683
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:05,520
What is this?

684
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,760
A ghost entered my house.

685
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,220
These are my last words.

686
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,420
They didn't manage to

687
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,150
finish writing this last word.

688
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,790
This handwriting...

689
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:20,969
is the same as that in the room she hung herself.

690
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:23,370
Looks like this female body was moved here.

691
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,159
But she's already dead.

692
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:26,739
Why did they dry out her body,

693
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:27,670
cut her head off,

694
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:29,199
and hide her body here?

695
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,600
And where did her head go?

696
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,130
Is this some kind of Nanyin sorcery again?

697
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,030
It's the monster from before.

698
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:00,510
I seem to have seen this monster somewhere.

699
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,060
Elder!

700
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:26,880
Elder!

701
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,350
Elder.

702
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,120
We only caught one of the Head God's emissaries.

703
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,780
We didn't manage to get rid of all of them at once.

704
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,390
I didn't expect these people to be so capable.

705
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,280
But don't worry.

706
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:45,390
The inn is the site of nirvana for the Head God.

707
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,040
We kept it there for so many years

708
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,500
to lure these people in.

709
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:55,230
We have already prepared the Head Bane there.

710
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:59,030
Once these people come into contact with the Head Bane,

711
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:02,670
they will become the Head God's emissaries

712
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,560
just like those martial artists from before.

713
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:09,030
Is this the Head Bane

714
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,050
that you're talking about?

715
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,270
Nothing happened to you three?

716
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:36,200
What is this?

717
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:38,090
So disgusting.

718
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,460
It's human skull bone.

719
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,120
The brown liquid on the ground

720
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,410
outside is this.

721
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,280
Mind control bugs?

722
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,030
Once they breed these bugs successfully,

723
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:55,300
they will use it to create all kinds of sorcery.

724
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,500
Nanyin people are good at these things.

725
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,620
So they cut off the corpses' heads

726
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,250
to breed these bugs?

727
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,060
Mind control bugs...

728
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,660
The mark of the fiend.

729
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,990
This is indeed Nanyin's sorcery.

730
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,030
Did they become monsters

731
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,420
after getting attacked by these things?

732
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,060
First, it was the Rama Heavenly Ice,

733
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,010
then the Karmic Bugs.

734
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:14,470
And now it's these things.

735
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,460
What exactly are the Nanyin people up to?

736
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:18,820
In any case,

737
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,410
we must find those villagers behind this

738
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:22,010
and quickly save Li Lianhua.

739
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:26,690
When we were surrounded by those monsters,

740
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,480
they seemed to avoid the heads that were severed.

741
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,900
It's also the human heads that turn people into monsters.

742
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,590
Are they afraid of human heads?

743
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:38,610
I got it.

744
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,270
Do you remember those skeleton shadows

745
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:42,820
we saw at the Bahuang Hunyuan Lake?

746
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,730
The reflection of the strange stones on the cliff?

747
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:45,170
Yes.

748
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,580
We always thought

749
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:48,530
those were just stones that looked like skeletons.

750
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,070
I suddenly realized something.

751
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,130
They're using monsters to attack us.

752
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,760
But these monsters can't tell what are humans.

753
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:55,900
How can they be sure

754
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,130
they won't get hurt by mistake?

755
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:58,660
Of course they have to hide.

756
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,570
And they have to hide in a place

757
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,880
where these monsters are afraid of.

758
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,610
Seems like it's not a coincidence.

759
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:05,260
Those stones

760
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,580
are not naturally occurring strange stones,

761
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,940
but are actually human heads covered in mud

762
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,070
and hung on the cliff

763
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,860
to ward off the monsters.

764
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,290
Yes.

765
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,670
They must be hiding nearby.

766
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,230
You didn't get struck by the Head Bane?

767
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,430
Do you want us to also become neither human nor ghost?

768
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,580
You...

769
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,960
How dare you insult the Head God!

770
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:32,940
Head God?

771
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:34,980
It's just a corpse that breeds the mind control bugs,

772
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,430
and yet you worship it as a god.

773
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,280
How foolish.

774
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:38,950
Go!

775
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,970
Get back the Head God!

776
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,520
Get it back now!

777
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,580
Looks like you're really afraid of these ceramic pots.

778
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,180
If the emissaries of the Head God find you here,

779
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,770
they will tear you apart.

780
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:57,970
Let us go now!

781
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,100
Those Head Gods of yours

782
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,700
are afraid of the human skulls here.

783
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,410
They won't come in.

784
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:02,010
Am I right?

785
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:02,980
Tell me.

786
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,050
Where did you take Lee Lianhua?

787
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,550
What's the point of asking that now?

788
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,130
As long as they are captured by the Head God's emissaries,

789
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,860
they won't live for more than two hours.

790
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:14,510
I'm afraid he's already dismembered by now.

791
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:15,360
You...

792
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,330
If you want to know where the Head God's emissaries are,

793
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:20,360
dream on.

794
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:24,940
If you don't tell me,

795
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:27,170
I'll put this on you

796
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,950
and make you the Head God's emissary too.

797
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,140
What do you think?

798
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,740
Wait.

799
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,090
Don't go any further.

800
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,290
Don't go any further.

801
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,540
That is where the Heaven and Earth Pit is.

802
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:04,900
It's where they make the Head Bane.

803
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,010
The Head God's emissaries have taken over the place.

804
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,410
How can we control them?

805
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:11,710
There's nothing we can do.

806
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,350
Only when the sun shines into the cave,

807
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:16,070
they'll become dull-witted.

808
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,420
Otherwise...

809
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,710
Otherwise, there's no way.

810
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:20,950
Just wait for a bit more.

811
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:22,550
When the sun shines into the cave,

812
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,280
you can go in.

813
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,600
This is Li Lianhua's bag.

814
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,900
With every minute of delay,

815
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,030
Li Lianhua will be in even more danger.

816
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:34,590
Let's go.

817
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:48,800
Li Lianhua!

818
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,330
Li Lianhua, wake up!

819
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:58,750
Li Lianhua!

820
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,110
Why is there so much blood?

821
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,770
Please be okay.

822
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,030
I still have a lot to ask you.

823
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:06,560
Lianhua,

824
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,020
don't die.

825
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,420
I still have a lot to ask you.

826
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,280
Stop making so much noise.

827
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,590
I'm not dead yet.

828
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,270
I'm just sleepy.

829
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,180
You're fine?

830
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,060
You even fell asleep?

831
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,620
Why are you sleeping here?

832
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,220
Don't shout. Come on.

833
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:22,820
Help me up.

834
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,570
Where's all the blood from?

835
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:31,570
How can there not be blood when I was dealing with so many monsters?

836
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:32,090
Come on.

837
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:33,670
Help me.

838
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:37,700
Thank you.

839
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,050
Thank you too.

840
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,480
What's wrong with your hand?

841
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,340
It's wrapped up so terribly.

842
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,600
If I knew you were fine,

843
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:50,180
