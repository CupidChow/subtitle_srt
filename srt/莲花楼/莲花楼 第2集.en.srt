00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,860
Since I can't prove myself innocent,

173
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,460
I hope you can give me a chance

174
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,360
to find out the truth.

175
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,090
Mr. Fang is from the Baichuan Court.

176
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,880
Of course we trust him.

177
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,790
But whether this guy named Happy

178
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,110
is innocent too,

179
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,230
it's hard to say.

180
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,200
He should stay.

181
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,860
After the test is over,

182
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,180
we'll find out the truth

183
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,270
and then give him back to you.

184
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:12,710
Wait.

185
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,020
We haven't found out who did it.

186
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,390
How can you resume the test?

187
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,430
What if

188
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,820
the guy behind it

189
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,150
hurts these kids again?

190
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,460
Let me explain.

191
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,580
The date of the test was set

192
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,490
by Leader Wang before he died.

193
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,450
The Lingshan Sect needs a new leader.

194
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,220
No.

195
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,990
Easy, everyone.

196
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,910
I have an idea

197
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,070
but don't know whether I should say it.

198
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,580
You're arguing

199
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,950
because Leader Wang

200
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,240
didn't specify how to identify the Spiritual Child.

201
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,770
That's the source of the problem.

202
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:50,410
How about

203
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,860
I talk to Leader Wang

204
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,280
to find out what he thought?

205
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,980
What are you talking about?

206
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,300
Our master has passed away.

207
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,830
How can you talk to the dead?

208
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:02,980
Wei Bai.

209
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,340
Who are you?

210
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,340
I'm Li Lianhua.

211
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,050
Many people call me the miracle physician.

212
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,400
So you're the physician

213
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,700
who resurrected Master Tiexiao.

214
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,550
Yes, it's me.

215
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,630
I've heard a lot about you.

216
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,010
It's such a great honor

217
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,110
to meet you here.

218
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,510
What are you up to this time?

219
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,310
Look.

220
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,730
This is not a simple case.

221
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:32,800
If I find out who's behind it,

222
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,920
can you let me go?

223
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:34,620
No.

224
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,780
You're a detective from the Baichuan Court.

225
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,580
Do you have no conscience at all?

226
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,550
Look at them.

227
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,420
Look at these innocent boys.

228
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,190
Look how much they've suffered.

229
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,450
Can you bear to let them suffer even more?

230
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:51,980
Besides,

231
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,980
catching a murderer

232
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,980
can bring you more recognition than catching a quack.

233
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,420
Leader Wang

234
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,620
is six feet under now,

235
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,220
but I know how to summon ghosts.

236
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,180
If you trust me,

237
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,190
can you let me give it a try?

238
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,100
How can we know if you're just playing tricks

239
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,980
and pretending to be our master?

240
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,170
Don't be rude to the miracle physician.

241
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,410
We trust you.

242
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,630
Let's do it your way, Physician Li.

243
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:23,730
Well,

244
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:27,100
please send Leader Wang's body back to his room.

245
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,220
I also need some of his belongings

246
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,580
to summon his ghost.

247
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:36,770
Sir,

248
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,340
this is where our master lived.

249
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,510
[Qinglan Residence]

250
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,460
Tell me.

251
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,290
What tricks did you play

252
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,940
to resurrect Master Tiexiao

253
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,670
and the heir to the Tiejia Sect?

254
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,720
Master Tiexiao was cornered by his enemy

255
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,540
and jumped off the cliff.

256
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,300
Everyone thought he was dead

257
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,580
and buried him.

258
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,950
I happened to pass by

259
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,360
and heard his voice.

260
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,860
So I dug him out.

261
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,950
As for Shi Wenjue,

262
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,450
he was determined

263
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,380
to start a career in public service

264
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,990
but his family didn't support him.

265
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,150
His story is even more interesting.

266
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,280
He faked his suicide

267
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,100
but

268
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,890
I could tell

269
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,980
that he was acting.

270
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,270
I didn't expose him.

271
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:25,940
These two guys

272
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,870
naturally won't reveal the truth.

273
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,340
That's what happened.

274
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,430
Word travels fast.

275
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,440
Now I'm famous.

276
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,420
As I expected,

277
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,270
you earned your reputation

278
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,910
through hanky-panky.

279
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,500
I'm just more observant than most people.

280
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,980
To make my own way in the world,

281
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,220
I have to have some strengths.

282
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:42,940
Strengths?

283
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,860
You call that a strength?

284
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,050
You're just lucky.

285
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,710
You have to admit it.

286
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,030
Good luck is a kind of strength too.

287
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,130
I'm indeed lucky.

288
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,870
Let me make it clear.

289
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,700
After I help you,

290
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,940
we'll be even.

291
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,960
It depends on how much your help is worth.

292
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,500
You said you're observant.

293
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,420
Then let's see

294
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,320
who can find out the cause of his death first.

295
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,360
[Humble and Disciplined]

296
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,800
[The heir is a sixteen-year-old Spiritual Child born in early April in the southwest of the city. He has a lotus-shaped mole on his right foot.]

297
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,560
Not only do I know how he died,

298
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,280
but I also know that the murderer

299
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,680
is among his steward and three disciples.

300
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,070
Why…

301
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,740
Look.

302
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,790
Does that hand gesture

303
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,990
look familiar to you?

304
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,190
Breath Stopping Skill.

305
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,030
No need to check.

306
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,220
That skill could only stop his breath for three days at most.

307
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,200
Three days later,

308
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,660
he needed someone to hit his acupoints

309
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,590
Baihui and Tanzhong three times to come back to life.

310
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,250
It's been over ten days.

311
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,700
He's long dead.

312
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,500
Wang Qingshan used Breath Stopping Skill to fake his death

313
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,960
and needed someone he trusted to wake him up.

314
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,760
But that guy didn't do it.

315
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,370
So he was suffocated.

316
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,040
No wonder you said

317
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,500
the murderer is among those four guys.

318
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,110
He needed the help of someone very close

319
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,060
to practice this secret skill.

320
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,620
Those four guys

321
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,700
were the closest to Wang Qingshan

322
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,340
in the Lingshan Sect.

323
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,940
You figured it out right away

324
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,140
because you used the same trick before.

325
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,330
I haven't finished my words.

326
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,690
Haven't you noticed that the gold leaf on his lips is very thick?

327
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,120
He was injured before he died.

328
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,300
So the murderer used thick gold leaf

329
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,360
to cover the blood.

330
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,100
Go scrape off the gold leaf on his back.

331
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:18,500
You…

332
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,750
I'll do you a favor.

333
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,230
Is it Five Poison Palm?

334
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,470
You know it?

335
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,620
Xin Lei, the Thunder Chaser of the Jinyuan Alliance,

336
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,220
is famous for his Five Poison Palm.

337
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,190
Ten years ago, the Jinyuan Alliance was wiped out.

338
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,410
Most of its disciples were arrested by the Baichuan Court,

339
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,530
but some escaped.

340
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,720
Xin Lei is one of those who escaped.

341
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,570

he can't have his father's surname,

the Thunder Chaser seized the opportunity

513
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,650
to replace his body.

514
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,770
It was such an easy trick

515
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,540
but fooled you all.

516
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,510
Do you mean

517
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,420
Leader Wang didn't turn into a full-body sarira?

518
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,970
It was all arranged by Leader Wang.

519
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,370
I just did what I was told.

520
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,940
You can't blame me.

521
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,830
Piao Erhuang,

522
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,620
stop playing dumb.

523
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:55,790
By the way,

524
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,600
should I call you Happy's father?

525
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,120
Or Xin Lei, the Thunder Chaser of the Jinyuan Alliance?

526
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,060
You can go check Leader Wang's body now.

527
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,490
There is a black palm on his back

528
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,500
which was caused by the skill that made the Thunder Chaser famous.

529
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,260
I guess

530
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:30,770
that Leader Wang

531
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,970
had an affair with a girl named Helan Yan.

532
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:33,610
Later,

533
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,450
they had an illegitimate son.

534
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,220
Because he wasn't allowed to get married and have children,

535
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,460
Helan Yan threatened to leave.

536
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,070
But Leader Wang

537
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,910
didn't want to leave his child,

538
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,130
so he decided to put on a show.

539
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:49,030
You found out his plan by chance.

540
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,780
You also found that Leader Wang had noticed

541
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:55,470
the remnants of the Jinyuan Alliance in Jia Province.

542
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,880
So you decided to get rid of him

543
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,090
by giving him this idea.

544
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,350
Will it work?

545
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,030
That woman came to make a fuss again and again.

546
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,260
Unless she gets what she wants,

547
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,940
I'm afraid the whole sect

548
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,280
will find out about it sooner or later.

549
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,890
Not only will your reputation be ruined,

550
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,160
but the disciples may also join hands to topple you.

551
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:25,900
You'll lose everything by then.

552
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,090
Leader Wang wanted both the assets

553
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,100
and his son.

554
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,730
So he colluded with you

555
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,700
to use the mirrors

556
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,830
to fake his death in front of everyone.

557
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:37,490
Three days later,

558
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,590
instead of waking him up,

559
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,170
you gave him a fatal blow.

560
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,300
After that,

561
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,250
you covered his body with gold

562
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,380
to conceal the print left by your Five Poison Palm.

563
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,280
There's really a palm print on Leader Wang's back.

564
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,560
You killed our master.

565
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,450
Why do you believe him so easily?

566
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,720
Let me tell you.

567
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,440
It's all just his imagination.

568
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,500
I haven't finished yet.

569
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,540
Wang Shouqing.

570
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,350
Can I borrow the letter

571
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,420
Leader Wang left?

572
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,320
[The heir is a sixteen-year-old Spiritual Child born in early April in the southwest of the city. He has a lotus-shaped mole on his right foot.]

573
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,300
Leader Wang

574
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,460
intended to

575
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:26,620
leave the Lingshan Sect to his six-year-old illegitimate son.

576
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,860
So the suffix "teen"

577
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,750
is in a different handwriting.

578
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,170
Moreover, part of this letter was cut out.

579
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,420
I guess

580
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,220
the missing part contains the most important information

581
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,180
that the kid's mother's surname is Helan.

582
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:42,040
You deliberately leaked the news to Happy's cousin

583
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,880
and caused a mysterious fire in the ancestral hall

584
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,250
because you didn't want

585
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:49,620
these three disciples to get suspicious.

586
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:52,180
You've never thought of Happy in the past decade

587
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,710
but after killing someone,

588
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,980
you suddenly remembered the son you abandoned.

589
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,440
What a good father you are.

590
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,650
You just want to use him as a puppet

591
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,970
to control the Lingshan Sect.

592
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,090
Father.

593
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,490
Did you do it?

594
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,720
You're a good storyteller.

595
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,470
But unfortunately…

596
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,510
Unfortunately, I don't have any evidence, right?

597
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,650
After seeing the surname Helan last night,

598
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,330
you were worried that your cover might be blown.

599
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,740
So you went to her house in the middle of the night

600
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,200
to kill the mother and son.

601
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,000
But we had smeared Baihong juice

602
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,960
on their quilt.

603
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,480
If you wash your hands, they'll turn black.

604
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:36,980
Show us your hands.

605
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,600
Avenge our master!

606
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,320
You talk too much.

607
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,640
Go to hell!

608
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:04,410
Fang Duobing.

609
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,460
Please keep him under control.

610
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,900
I'll send out a letter immediately

611
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,850
and have him brought back to the Baichuan Court.

612
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:32,420
Wait.

613
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:36,730
Do you have anything else to say to Happy?

614
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,060
I got nothing to say

615
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,650
to a good-for-nothing.

616
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,270
-You trash!
-Move.

617
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,670
Happy.

618
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:49,990
Young Master.

619
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:51,660
Don't be sad.

620
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,320
After you grow up,

621
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,140
I'll give you money and land.

622
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:58,960
It's fine.

623
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:06,860
You're welcome.

624
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,000
What do you mean?

625
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,440
This is the first case I solved for you.

626
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,300
I know you're grateful to me.

627
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,020
I'm grateful to you?

628
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,460
Don't you remember shouting my name just now?

629
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,820
I saved your life.

630
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,190
Lower your voice.

631
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,190
After we leave here,

632
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,300
we'll go our separate ways.

633
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,160
So who saved who is not important.

634
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,230
Why are you…

635
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:27,850
By the way,

636
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,420
I left something in Leader Wang's room.

637
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,380
I'll go get it.

638
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,310
So rude.

639
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:35,660
Young Hero Fang.

640
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,420
We want to ask you for a favor.

641
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:57,310
I heard that the 188 prisons of the Baichuan Court

642
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,830
are like hell.

643
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,890
What are you doing here?

644
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,740
I'm here to give you a chance.

645
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,940
If you tell me one thing,

646
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,270
I'll let you go.

647
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,889
You captured me and then offer to release me.

648
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,250
What do you want?

649
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,460
I didn't want to capture you.

650
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:15,770
The guy named Fang Duobing wanted.

651
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:17,460
I don't care

652
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,060
whether you live or die.

653
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:20,460
Go ahead.

654
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,010
What do you want to know?

655
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,199
Ten years ago,

656
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,030
the Three Great Fighters of the Jinyuan Alliance

657
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,949
killed Shan Gudao of the Sigu Sect

658
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,260
and took away his remains.

659
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,780
Where are his remains now?

660
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,670
You used to work for Medicine Demon.

661
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:45,179
You should know that.

662
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,310
How did you know

663
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:49,840
I used to work for Medicine Demon?

664
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:52,290
Who are you?

665
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,090
You don't need to know that.

666
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,699
Just answer my question.

667
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,980
There are three holes in your earlobe.

668
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,210
When I tested poisons on people for Medicine Demon,

669
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,720
I saw the same mark

670
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,270
on their ears.

671
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,010
It's a mark left by Bicha Poison.

672
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,540
That poison is lethal

673
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,570
and has no cure.

674
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:18,190
The victims' bones and joints will rot in one month

675
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,710
and their fresh will peel off until they die.

676
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:26,460
Most victims will die within a month

677
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:30,390
unless they can force the poison out with strong inner force.

678
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,810
You're standing in front of me now.

679
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,620
The only explanation

680
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,340
is that you're him.

681
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,430
It's been ten years.

682
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,300
You're still alive.

683
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,420
I don't have time to waste on you.

684
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,100
People from the Baichuan Court should be on their way.

685
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,690
You've become a coward.

686
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,420
You don't even dare to say who you are.

687
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:56,660
I got it.

688
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,890
It's not that you don't know martial arts.

689
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,900
You lost all of your skills.

690
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:03,820
Li Xiangyi.

691
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,320
I guessed right.

692
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:15,170
You were once the invincible Master of Sword

693
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,750
but ended up like this.

694
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:23,020
You challenged the Jinyuan Alliance for your senior back then

695
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,170
but now,

696
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,270
you're searching for his remains.

697
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,630
Everyone says you're heartless,

698
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,270
but they're wrong.

699
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,030
At least you care about your senior very much.

700
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,390
Unfortunately, I can't help you.

701
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,630
I don't know where his remains are.

702
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:46,970
You're dead.

703
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,480
I'll kill you for the Director!

704
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:04,000
Li Lianhua!

705
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:16,540
Are you okay?

706
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,030
I'm fine.

707
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,900
Luckily, you appeared in time.

708
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,680
How dare you strangle me?

709
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,740
I was too quick.

710
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:27,420
We haven't gotten anything out of him yet.

711
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,420
He died too soon.

712
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,460
Yes.

713
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:30,730
Thank you.

714
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:35,920
Li Lianhua.

715
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,550
You said you needed to fetch something.

716
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,480
Why are you here?

717
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,440
I took the wrong turn.

718
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,780
Why are you here?

719
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,380
The three disciples of the Lingshan Sect

720
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,380
are grateful to us

721
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:47,850
and invited us to dinner.

722
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:48,940
So I came to tell you about it.

723
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,320
Man,

724
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,690
I saved you again.

725
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:51,280
Thanks.

726
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,180
Aren't you going?

727
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:53,710
No.

728
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,060
Fox Spirit is waiting for me at home.

729
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,030
Fox spirit?

730
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,050
A little bit of salt.

731
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,310
A little bit.

732
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,100
A-A little bit.

733
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,860
You must be hungry, Fox Spirit.

734
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,610
Sit down.

735
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:29,710
Go ahead.

736
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,380
So you're Fox Spirit.

737
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:38,040
So cute.

738
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:46,690
So you're not only a quack

739
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,410
but also a bad cook.

740
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,720
So this is the Lotus Tower.

741
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,770
What is this?

742
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:59,110
You grow vegetables here?

743
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,540
If I remember correctly,

744
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,060
we're even now.

745
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,090
Even if we are,

746
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,480
there are questions I need to ask you.

747
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,990
Why did you steal the manual of sword fighting from the Hall of Flames?

748
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:13,910
That manual

749
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,800
belonged to the Shi family in Henan in the beginning.

750
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,650
Several years ago, it was taken away by the Hall of Flames.

751
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:22,270
So I paid Master Thief a lot of money to get it back.

752
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,150
Why did you do that?

753
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,140
He helped me once.

754
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,510
Years ago,

755
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,450
I had heart disease.

756
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,340
He came to steal things from me

757
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,340
and gave me some medicine.

758
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,720
I had to pay him back.

759
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:41,060
I didn't expect you to be a grateful man.

760
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:41,860
I'm not.

761
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,050
I didn't want to pay him back.

762
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:44,940
But that guy

763
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,790
told the Hall of Flames about my whereabouts.

764
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:48,790
I had no choice.

765
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,750
Why are you still here?

766
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,140
Do you expect to have dinner with me?

767
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,320
I saved you twice today.

768
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,780
I brought wine with me.

769
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,840
Can't you let me stay for dinner?

770
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,210
I'll help myself.

771
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:18,840
Let me try it.

772
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,610
The beef is great.

773
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,250
Why did you ruin it

774
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:28,400
with so much pepper?

775
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:29,250
Also,

776
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,810
look at this artemisia selengensis.

777
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:32,040
It looks so plain.

778
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,530
The next time you cook,

779
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:34,660
add some bacon to it.

780
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,630
The fragrance of bacon goes perfectly with its refreshing taste.

781
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:37,660
It'll be very delicious.

782
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,100
Well,

783
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,340
look at the chicken stewed with chestnuts.

784
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,350
It must taste gamy.

785
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:41,900
The next time you make it,

786
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,170
try using broth to get rid of the gamy taste.

787
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:43,630
Really?

788
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,310
Yes.

789
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,880
If you like cooking,

790
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,920
I can teach you.

791
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:47,820
I'm an expert.

792
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,960
I won't bother you.

793
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:50,820
Bro,

794
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:52,770
do you have to be so cold?

795
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,410
You're the first friend I made

796
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,730
after leaving home.

797
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,350
To tell you the truth,

798
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,580
I ran away from home to escape an arranged marriage.

799
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,860
My father wanted me to marry the princess,

800
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,290
but I'm not interested in politics at all.

801
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:09,260
Compared to the court,

802
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,060
I prefer the wide world outside.

803
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,200
What does that have to do with me?

804
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,040
I have to solve three cases

805
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,570
to be admitted to the Baichuan Court.

806
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:22,330
Look at us.

807
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,180
We finally

808
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,380
solved the case of the Spiritual Child,

809
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:27,200
but I promised to keep it quiet.

810
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,020
Lucky for you.

811
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,500
You saved your reputation as the miracle physician

812
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,350
and the Lingshan Sect saved its dignity.

813
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:32,150
What about me?

814
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,560
I still need to solve three cases.

815
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:37,610
How about this?

816
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,120
You're sly and I'm good at martial arts.

817
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,430
Why don't we work together

818
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:42,380
to solve more cases?

819
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,420
I can pay you a salary.

820
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,410
What do you think?

821
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:44,870
Salary?

822
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,860
Do you have money?

823
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,150
I…

824
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,090
You're so poor that you came to me for a free meal.

825
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:50,780
Besides,

826
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:53,200
I'm not interested in being a hero.

827
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,410
I prefer solitude to venturing into the perilous world.

828
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:57,940
I just want to

829
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,480
travel around the world.

830
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:01,430
Living on the edge

831
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,390
is not suitable for me.

832
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:02,790
You…

833
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,940
Give it a thought.

834
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,530
If I can't enter the Baichuan Court,

835
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:15,590
my master will be disappointed in me.

836
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,320
Get your hands off me.

837
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:25,990
Master.

838
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,930
You started the Sigu Sect and the Baichuan Court single-handedly.

839
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:32,500
I swear to make them thrive!

840
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:38,640
Wait.

841
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:41,300
Who is your master?

842
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,530
Li Xiangyi, the Master of Sword.

843
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:51,590
I'm fine.

844
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,430
Li Xiangyi, the Master of Sword.

845
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:59,090
I never knew

846
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,820
that Li Xiangyi had a disciple like you.

847
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:04,050
No one knows about it.

848
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:05,420
I bet.

849
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,900
I guess he doesn't know it either.

850
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,960
You don't believe me?

851
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:16,930
Then I'll tell you the truth.

852
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:20,190
I was weak when I was young.

853
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:23,690
My mother didn't even give me a serious name

854
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:26,620
because she thought I wouldn't make it to adulthood.

855
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:27,980
When I was ten,

856
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:30,120
my mother found

857
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:33,730
her younger brother who went missing at a young age.

858
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,940
He's the deputy leader of the Sigu Sect,

859
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,140
Li Xiangyi's senior,

860
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,680
Shan Gudao.

861
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,840
Shan Gudao is your uncle?
