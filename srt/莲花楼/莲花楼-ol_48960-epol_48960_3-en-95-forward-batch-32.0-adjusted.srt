4
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,320
I'll tell you the truth.

5
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,190
I've been sickly since I was young.

6
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,270
My mother didn't even give me a first name.

7
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,270
She was afraid that I wouldn't live to become an adult.

8
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,590
When I was ten,

9
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,740
my mother found

10
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,259
her long-lost younger brother.

11
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,580
He's the Deputy Sect Leader of the Sigu Sect,

12
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,780
Li Xiangyi's senior,

13
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,420
Shan Gudao.

14
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,470
Shan Gudao is your uncle?

15
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:43,710
My mother has never liked the martial arts world,

16
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,050
so she didn't want Uncle

17
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,770
to disclose their relationship.

18
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,430
Uncle wanted to teach me martial arts in secret.

19
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,440
But at that time,

20
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,360
I was too sickly.

21
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,260
Uncle always scolded me for being useless.

22
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,430
How many times have I taught you?

23
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,540
Why can't you remember?

24
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,480
You can't even hold a sword.

25
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,210
How can you learn martial arts?

26
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:02,630
Again.

27
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,100
This sword is too heavy for you.

28
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,490
It's not suitable for you.

29
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,090
Take this.

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This wooden sword suits you better.

31
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,420
If you can learn the hundred foundational moves

32
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,820
with this wooden sword,

33
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,060
come to me.

34
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,560
I will take you as my disciple.

35
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:30,180
Before he left, he told me

36
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,960
not to lose my sword again.

37
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,030
A swordsman

38
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,960
must wield his sword firmly

39
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,900
in order to redress injustice in the world.

40
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,600
That was the only time I met Li Xiangyi.

41
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:48,740
Now,

42
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,829
I don't even remember his face.

43
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,310
But because of what he said,

44
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,970
I tried my best to cure myself.

45
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,660
I took medicine, no matter how bitter it was.

46
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,660
I bathed in cold springs, no matter how hard they were.

47
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,730
Now, I can finally stand up.

48
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,520
I can hold my sword firmly.

49
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,060
But he's gone.

50
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,120
You won't understand someone as noble

51
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,800
as my master.

52
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,930
So it was you.

53
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,060
To think the brat has grown up.

54
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,180
Your martial arts are alright.

55
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,640
You haven't really embarrassed your uncle.

56
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,320
It's just that there are some things

57
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,390
you don't need to remember too clearly.

Where is he?

71
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,530
I told him everything.

72

How can he run away?

73
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,200

came earlier than expected again.

Where is my senior, Shan Gudao's body?

76

Your biggest weakness

77
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,710
is that you want to be a hero.

78
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,690
A swordsman

79
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,610
should not have weaknesses.

Give it to me. I'll handle it.

how could we have fallen into the Jinyuan Alliance's trap?

174
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,840
I'm afraid you will not live long.

175
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,370
Monk,

176
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,340
how long more can I live?

177
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,420
Ten years, at most.

178
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:47,910
Ten years?

179
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,170
You helped me regain 10 years

180
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,380
from King Yama.

181
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,720
It's not a loss.

182
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,570
But please keep this secret for me.

183
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,180
If anyone asks,

184
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,510
you have never met Li Xiangyi.

185
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,260
Li Xiangyi and Sigu Sect

186
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,900
do not exist anymore.

187
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,620
I won't go back.

188
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,400
I'll be off.

189
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,470
Sect Leader Li,

190
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,270
you're so young,

191
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,230
but you'll let yourself die?

192
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,620
Isn't it a pity?

193
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,030
Besides, the poison of the jade tea

194
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,760
have entered into your organs.

195
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,880
It will torture you from time to time.

196
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,460
If one day, it cannot be suppressed and enters your brain again,

197
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,830
you might get trapped in illusions.

198
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,220
In the end...

199
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,200
In the end, I'll become a lunatic.

200
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,180
It's good to die crazy.

201
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,460
I won't know anything

202
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,280
and won't feel pity.

203
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:57,220
I don't know what you want to hide from,

204
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,350
to make you so determined to leave.

205
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,550
"The heart attains peace with a single thought,

206
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,410
lotus flowers bloom all around."

207
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:06,780
Monk,

208
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,120
your incantation

209
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,070
is very good.

210
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,090
I understand.

211
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,280
Sect Leader Li.

212
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,360
Li Xiangyi has died in the East Sea.

213
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,000
From now on, Li Lianhua is the one left.

214
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,580
Master.

215
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,740
Did you send that brat to me on purpose

216
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,510
to remind me?

217
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,620
But don't worry.

218
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,210
Before I die,

219
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,020
I will definitely find Senior.

220
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,070
Otherwise,

221
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,230
I wouldn't be able to face you.

222
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:29,620
It's indeed the secret insignia of the Jinyuan Alliance.

223
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,090
This jade is rare.

224
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,510
Kunlun Jade City?

225
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:50,570
Young Master.

226
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,200
Why don't you sit down and eat something?

227
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,340
The rice looks bad.

228
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,480
I'm not destitute enough

229
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,080
to treat my mouth that badly.

230
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,170
If you don't, your stomach will suffer.

231
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:01,900
Young Master,

232
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,790
we really have nothing left.

233
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:04,880
We don't know if there will be another meal

234
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,400
after this one.

235
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:08,330
Happy.

236
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:09,860
Is there really

237
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,300
nothing left on you?

238
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,280
Yes.

239
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:17,890
Young Master,

240
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,570
are you going to pawn this jade pendant?

241
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,170
No, no.

242
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,040
You have been carrying this

243
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,970
since you were born.

244
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,240
I can't touch it even if I go performing in the streets.

245
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,170
Otherwise, my mother will kill me.

246
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:28,590
Happy.

247
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,440
Check the package again.

248
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,680
This letter...

249
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,800
The Lingshan Sect threw out

250
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,180
everything that belonged to Piao Erhuang.

251
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,090
I picked up some paper he wrote on

252
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,870
to burn as offerings to my mother,

253
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,980
so she can stop thinking about him.

254
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,100
I'll write some for you next time.

255
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:54,990
Let me see.

256
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:02,680
Wait.

257
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,160
Why is this letter so messy?

258
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,510
"Your subordinate has failed.

259
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,030
The Jinyuan Alliance's whereabouts in Jia Province were exposed.

260
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,230
I must bear the blame.

261
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:31,330
I should personally head north to atone for my crime.

262
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:32,860
But for the sake of my loyalty,

263
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,730
please spare me.

264
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,500
I will be sure to help the Demon King

265
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,040
and the Jinyuan alliance return to your former glory.

266
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,089
I will go to any length."

267
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,040
Young Master.

268
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,599
What does this mean?

269
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,990
This is obviously the apology letter

270
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,450
Piao Erhuang hasn't had time to send out yet.

271
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:53,060
The only person in the Jinyuan Alliance who might be called "Demon King"

272
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,460
must be the great demon, Di Feisheng's right hand man, the Medicine Demon.

273
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,859
Piao Erhuang works for the Medicine Demon?

274
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,000
Young Master,

275
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,680
what does the Medicine Demon look like?

276
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,070
Li,

277
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,160
take out the manual of the key members of the Jinyuan Alliance

278
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,290
that has been in the Tianji Hall's collection for years.

279
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:11,740
Medicine Demon.

280
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,400
His age and background

281
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,150
are unknown.

282
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,620
He is good at making poison and using medicine.

283
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,460
He first became famous in the martial arts world for healing the dead.

284
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,720
He has a heart disease.

285
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,160
He has close to no inner skills

286
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,560
and is not good at martial arts.

287
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,110
Sly and cunning.

288
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,900
Why does this sound familiar?

289
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:31,790
I've got it!

290
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,590
Young Master,

291
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,300
don't you think this Medicine Demon

292
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,100
sounds like that fake miracle doctor, Li Lianhua?

293
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,250
His reputation as a living dead is not coincidental.

294
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,420
Because he is the Medicine Demon.

295
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,220
Then it wasn't a coincidence that he was at Lingshan Bodhimanda.

296
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,140
Piao Erhuang's death was not a coincidence either.

297
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,340
He exposed the Jinyuan Alliance's whereabouts,

298
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,670
so the Medicine Demon came to silence him.

299
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,640
There are too many coincidences.

300
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,730
If he really is a remnant of the Jinyuan Alliance,

301
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,700
I can't let him

302
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,070
get away from me.

303
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,000
Where can we find him?

304
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,610
There's only one way out of the mountain on the north side.

305
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,740
He can't travel that fast with a house.

306
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:11,520
Let's go.

307
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:12,970
Le's go after him.

308
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,610
Y-Young Master, slow down.

309
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,550
What's wrong?

310
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,430
It's a ghost!

311
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,070
This is not a ghost.

312
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,920
It's a corpse.

313
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,900
It's more important to find Li Lianhua.

314
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,570
Let's go.

315
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,870
I've finally found it.

316
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,610
What's that smell?

317
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:25,490
I smell it too.

318
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,970
Who knows?

319
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:30,900
If he is really the Medicine Demon

320
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,540
and spends his days with corpses,

321
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,340
nothing he does can surprise me.

322
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:35,940
Young Master,

323
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,140
you’d better stop.

324
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,080
Yes, Young Master.

325
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,290
We've checked this area.

326
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,810
There's nothing special.

327
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,700
Are you stupid?

328
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,180
The most important things are always

329
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,440
hidden in the least conspicuous places.

330
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,860
This is the strongest silk that's as thin as insects' wings.

331
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,130
This is so rare.

332
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,920
How can he use it to cover a pot?

333
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,540
This is the Yingzhu Armor worn by Di Feisheng.

334
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,460
It seems that this fake miracle physician

335
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,700
really has something to do with the Jinyuan Alliance.

336
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,930
C-Could it be that

337
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,300
he realized Young Master was catching up to him,

338
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,570
so he abandoned the building and ran away?

339
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:25,920
There are no signs at all here

340
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,380
that he ran away in a hurry.

341
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:28,760

Please forgive us.

If you want to stay here,

348
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,620
you need to step over a fire basin to ward off evil spirits.

W-Ward off evil spirits?

You may not know,

nearby.

I couldn't wait for you to sober up.

did you leave in such a hurry

390
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,100
because of Piao Erhuang?

391
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:44,400
What does it have to do with Piao Erhuang?

392
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,540
How did you get into the locked shed?

395

I saw Piao Erhuang screaming.

396
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,260
So,

397
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,280
as a benevolent doctor,

398
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,730
I went in

399
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,270
to have a look.

400
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,520
And picked the lock along the way.

401
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,130
I have some skills.

402
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,590
Your lie is pretty airtight.

403

Unfortunately, you left in a hurry

404
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:09,530
and didn't check if Piao Erhuang was dead or not.

405

Isn’t it better

408
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,230
that Piao Erhuang didn't die?

409
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,950
You could send him to Baichuan Court to take credit.

410
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:21,890
I thought so too.

411
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,990
Unfortunately, Piao Erhuang only told me about you.

412

Your background and identity,

413
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,450
need I make them clear here?

414
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,420
Come back to Baichuan Court with me.

415

416
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,610
What background can I have?

417
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,340

421

there was someone who got famous for reviving the dead.

422
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,980
You said all that

423
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,280
because you suspect

424
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,940
I'm the Medicine Demon of the Jinyuan Alliance?

425
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,490
It seems Piao Erhuang really is dead.

426
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:03,350
Otherwise, you wouldn't have guessed so absurdly.

Is it a crime to pick up things?

433

How coincidental.

434
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:27,980

439
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,230
It rains every night.

440
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,220
The bones of dead people are everywhere.

441
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,940
This place is so ominous.

442
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,510
If this weren't the fastest way to the harbor,

443
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,970
I wouldn't have come here.

444
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,000
No wonder the shops are so particular.

445
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,170

446

450
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,810

She ran away from home for some reason,

They're serving melon that's almost rotten.

479

Why don’t they serve some side dishes?

480
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,510
How about I give you a suggestion?

481
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,440
The noodles here cost two coins plain,

482
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,630
and three coins with meat.

483
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,130
They come with a side dish too.

484

I'm not hungry.

You're in such a state now.

487
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,670
You can't even afford a bowl of plain noodles.

488
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,680
Go home now.

489
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:02,920
We haven't finished talking yet.

If a detective of Baichuan Court makes a wrongful arrest,

493
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,450
they will be stripped of their badge

494
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,850
and never be hired again.

495

if you want to arrest me,

497
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,560

00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,450
Do you want to be whipped?

513
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,430
I-It's because Madam has been looking for Second Young Miss.

514
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,710
She couldn't find you for days,

515
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,710
so she asked us to put up the posters.

516
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,550
My sister sent you here?

517
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,460
Madam went to Shannan.

518
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,700
She'll be back in a few days.

519
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,110
Miss Yun Jiao brought us here to look for Second Young Miss.

520
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,570
She's on the second floor.

521
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:21,620
Second Young Miss.

522
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,590
Second Young Miss.

523
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,650
Second Young Miss.

524
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,110
Second Young Miss.

525
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,710
Why are you following me so closely?

526
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,770
I'm already upstairs.

527
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,170
I can't run away anymore.

528
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,150
Shuang.

529
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,540
You're finally back.

530
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,680
If you hadn't put up all those posters on the mountain,

531
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,880
I would've made you wait a few more days.

532
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,470
Fortunately, they found her.

533
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:52,780
Otherwise, when people from Yu City get angry,

534
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,780
things turn ugly.

535
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,380
That's a good idea.

536
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,970
If any suspect disappears,

537
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,150
I can put up posters along the way

538
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,810
and force him to show himself.

539
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:05,540
Young Hero Fang,

540
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,020
your servant disappeared after he entered the inn.

541
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,850
Maybe you can use this method

542
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:11,950
to find him.

543
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,240
Waiter.

544
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,220
Is the hot water for the bathroom ready?

545
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:47,860
Yes, Miss.

546
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:48,970
This is the place.

547
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,480
[Yu City, Yun Jiao]

548
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,630
I have calmed Qiushuang down.

549
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,900
We can return to Yu City tomorrow morning.

550
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,030
Thank you, Miss Yun.

551
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,520
Miss Yun Jiao and Second Young Miss are close like sisters.

552
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,340
With her around,

553
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,270
I can finally report back to Madam.

554
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,380
Let's go up.

555
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,510
It's raining again.

556
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:21,290
Ghost!

557
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:22,640
Ghost!

558
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,260
Ghost!

559
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,250
Ghost! Ghost! Ghost!

560
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:30,500
What's going on?

561
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:44,850
Blood!

562
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:46,420
Blood!

563
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,860
It's blood!

564
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,650
There's blood there!

565
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,010
There's blood there!

566
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:26,700
Blood!

567
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,600
He's dead?

568
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:44,650
Happy!

569
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:45,470
Happy!

570
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:56,330
Young Master.

571
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:57,720
Happy was fine just now.

572
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,380
He became like this as soon as he entered this room.

573
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,020
Happy.

574
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:16,110
It was him.

575
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,560
It must have been him.

576
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,250
He must have killed Happy.

577
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:27,770
Did you do it?

578
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,450
W- What could I have done?

579
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,880
You knew Happy came to your room.

580
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,480
So you killed him with sorcery.

581
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,490
Young Hero Fang,

582
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,590
I understand

583
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,280
you're sad about Happy's death.

584
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,200
But you don't have to

585
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:54,650
frame me.

586
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,570
You are the Medicine Demon.

587
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,230
You have many tricks.

588
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,470
If you've really been wronged,

589
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,790
come back to Baichuan Court with me for an investigation.

590
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,930
If you leave now,

591
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,590
your Happy would have died in vain.

592
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:08,190
His neck is fractured.

593
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:10,300
Obviously, he was strangled to death.

594
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,300
I was sitting opposite you just now.

595
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,370
How could I have strangled him

596
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:15,030
from all the way there?

597
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,350
Young Hero Fang,

598
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:18,350
if you keep wasting your time,

599
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,720
the murderer will really escape.

600
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,390
Young Master.

601
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:24,740
You can't believe him.

602
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,980
It must have been him.

603
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:31,920
Li, don't worry.

604
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,770
No matter who the murderer is,

605
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,350
we need evidence.

606
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,710
If you are the murderer,

607
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,719
I will avenge Happy.

608
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,610
I'll give you a chance now.

609
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,000
Who is the murderer?

610
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,150
I really don't know.

611
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,460
But a servant being killed for no reason

612
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:00,150
is merely a lead-in.

613
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,880
But as long as we follow this trail

614
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,020
and keep looking,

615
00:35:04,909 --> 00:35:08,150
we'll get to the point.

616
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:10,889
Second Young Miss.

617
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:13,469
Second Young Miss.

618
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,280
Where is Second Young Miss?

619
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,719
Where is Second Young Miss?

620
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,090
We were guarding at the stairs.

621
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:24,420
We didn't see her go out.

622
00:35:26,929 --> 00:35:28,060
Where is Qiushuang?

623
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,360
Where is Qiushuang?

624
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,690
Someone just died.

625
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:32,760
Second Young Miss is missing too.

626
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,740
Did she get caught by the person who left the bloody footprint?

627
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,200
Search!

628
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,200
-Yes.
-Yes.

629
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:45,450
Who are you?

630
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:46,580
What do you want?

631
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,880
So many people.

632
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,900
I'm Chief Escort Cheng Yunhe of Hexing Escort Agency.

633
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,330
Judging from your attire,

634
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,020
you must be guards from Yu City.

635
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,320
We have never intruded into each other's business.

636
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,960
What brings you

637
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,140
to our room?

638
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,580
Our Second Young Miss is missing.

639
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,110
That's why we're searching the inn.

640
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,110
Please forgive us

641
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,070
for our offense.

642
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,430
Second Young Miss?

643
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,500
As you can see,

644
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,430
there are only armed escorts in this room.

645
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,740
Your Second Young Miss isn't here.

646
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:29,900
Open it.

647
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,220
My friend.

648
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,790
We're just trying to make a living in the martial arts world.

649
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,740
We can't open the goods until they've been delivered.

650
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,820
This is our rule.

651
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:42,980
Besides, look.

652
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,430
They have been sealed by wax by our client.

653
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:48,360
The dates inscribed on them show they have never been tampered with.

654
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,490
The Second Young Miss you mentioned

655
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,330
couldn't have gotten past these wax seals

656
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,460
to crawl into the box,

657
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:52,990
right?

658
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,370
Our Second Young Miss is missing.

659
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:58,020
Your delivery box is very suspicious.

660
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,320
If you don't open it,

661
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:01,490
we can't let it go today.

662
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,340
Who dares to do it?

663
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:05,450
Chief,

664
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,000
this is Yu City's territory.

665
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,740
If we get into a fight now,

666
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:11,520
we might have to die here.

667
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,860
A head?

668
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,270
Escort Cheng,

669
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:20,980
you promised us

670
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,300
you wouldn't bring ominous items to the store.

671
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,300
We trusted you because you're a regular customer.

672
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,060
Why did you bring a head in?

673
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,380
He's a prisoner who was beheaded by the magistrate's office.

674
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,630
His family asked me to bring him back with his body intact.

675
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,150
T-That won't do either.

676
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,940
As long something ominous enters the inn,

677
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,250
there will be vengeful ghosts.

678
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,230
S-See, a vengeful spirit came.

679
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:39,760
Look.

680
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,110
A ritual has been performed on it.

681
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,910
There won't be any evil spirits.

682
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:46,860
Second...

683
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,210
Second Young Miss!

684
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:51,970
Excuse me!

685
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,370
Second Young Miss!

686
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,060
Qiushuang.

687
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:00,710
Qiushuang.

688
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,140
Qiushuang.

689
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,970
W-What's going on?

690
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,560
How is this possible?

691
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:22,100
Is there really a ghost?

692
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:28,220
My Second Young Miss died at Xiaomian Inn.

693
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,650
None of you are innocent!

694
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,250
Take them back to Yu City.

695
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:31,970
Yes.

696
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:44,010
[Yu City]

697
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,510
[A Tall Pavilion Reaches the Clouds]

698
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,560
Castellan.

699
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,180
This is Second Young Miss.

700
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,550
[Castellan of Yu City, Yu Mulan]

701
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,430
Lock them up.

702
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,860
Lock everyone in Xiaomian Inn up!

703
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,240
Madam will deal with them when she comes back.

704
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:30,740
Yes.

705
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,010
Brother,

706
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,460
ask your Castellan to see me.

707
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,570
Do you know who I am?

708
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,500
I'm a detective from Baichuan Court!

709
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,900
Why should I be locked up?

710
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:48,030
Are you pretending not to hear me?

711
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,090
I'm talking to you!

712
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:52,150
Stop yelling.

713
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,990
The Castellan of Yu City is not here.

714
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,010
She will see you when she comes back.

715
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,380
Didn't we see the Castellan, Yu Mulan,

716
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,110
when we were getting locked up?

717
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,700
Yu Mulan has no real power.

718
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,560
He doesn't have a say over major issues.

719
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,490
How did you know?

720
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,980
Why don't you think about

721
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,050
why the guards at the inn

722
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,460
only mentioned their Madam and not the Castellan?

723
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,750
And Yu Qiushuang

724
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,910
mentioned a Sister,

725
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:15,960
not a Sister-in-law.

726
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,960
You can infer that

727
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,840
Yu Mulan changed his surname after he married into the family.

728
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,700
He's only the Castellan in name.

729
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,340
So in this city,

730
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,210
the one who's really in power is Yu Hongzhu.

731
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,340
You're still not in the clear

732
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,740
about what happened last night.

733
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,430
Don't focus too much on me.

734
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:38,420
You need to listen more and question more as a detective.

735
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,680
Do your work properly.

736
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,510
I don't need you to tell me that.

737
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,130
Chief Envoy Cheng,

738
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:45,970
what happened to your goods?

739
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,050
I also want to know what happened.

740
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,160
The boxes originally contained

741
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,780
yellow jade to be sent from Beishan Mine to the capital.

742
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,660
Everyone saw them being sealed.

743
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,390
Yes.

744
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,080
And they never left our sight.

745
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,300
How did Second Young Miss get in there?

746
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,940
It's all because you accepted that private order in secret.

747
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,020
Don't slander me.

748
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,810
Rituals have been performed on that head,

749
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:05,260
right?

750
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,260
So what?

751
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:08,660
Yu City clearly wants our lives.

752
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,480
Chief Envoy Cheng.

753
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,320
What is this private order about?

754
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,310
On the day we set off,

755
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,540
someone came to me

756
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:18,520
and asked me to smuggle this head.

757
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,760
He said the criminal was beheaded for robbing official silver,

758
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,390
but his family wanted to keep his body intact.

759
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:25,190
They gave me 100 taels of silver.

760
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:26,730
I...

761
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,430
I was blinded by greed.

762
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:29,770
So I agreed.

763
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,280
Manager.

764
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,980
Anything unusual with Xiaomian Inn?

765
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,710
No.

766
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:38,340
It's just that rituals have to be performed during the Ghost Festival,

767
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,870
but we skipped it this year.

768
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,750
Something really happened.

769
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,040
It was a ghost.

770
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:44,620
The blood footprints led towards the second floor.

771
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,700
We all saw it.

772
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,250
Don't be nervous.

773
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,980
You can't believe in ghosts.

774
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,480
Who else

775
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:53,020
could have killed Second Young Miss Yu

776
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,860
and put her in our sealed box?

777
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,980
It's strange.

778
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:59,320
How was Yu Qiushuang killed?

779
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,900
How was she sealed in the escort box?

780
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,360
Doesn't it sound like a ghost did it?

781
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,750
Maybe the ghost didn't want

782
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,380
Second Young Miss Yu's body.

783
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:08,830
You...

784
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:13,590
Second Young Miss's body was burned.

785
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:14,970
Madam was very angry when she came back.

786
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:15,880
Take everyone away.

787
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,230
Yes.

788
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,090
Blood?

789
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:28,780
Where did the blood come from?

790
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,660
This blood should belong to the guards of Yu City.

791
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,000
What’s happened to these guards?

792
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,410
As the guards of Yu City,

793
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,420
they failed to protect their master.

794
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,220
They were sent to guard the body,

795
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:43,410
but someone knocked over the candle

796
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,110
[Wife of the Castellan of Yu City, Yu Hongzhu]

797
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,660
and damaged my sister's body.

798
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,550
It's already merciful

799
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,400
that I asked them to kill themselves.

800
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,760
You are Madam Yu?

801
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,480
You killed the guards

802
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,850
before we figured it out?

803
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,180
The life and death of servants of Yu City

804
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,710
have nothing to do with you.

805
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:03,900
They were incompetent.

806
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:07,150
There is no place for no good-for-nothings in Yu City.

807
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:07,790
Madam Yu.

808
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:08,970
We had nothing to do with

809
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:10,620
Second Young Miss being killed.

810
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,000
Yes.

811
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:13,040
It was the work of an evil spirit.

812
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,440
Yes.

813
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,940
We're here to testify.

814
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,380
It had nothing to do with us.

815
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,710
I've never seen a ghost.

816
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,390
Then tell me

817
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:23,840
what this evil spirit looks like.

818
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:29,740
What?

819
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,510
You don't remember?

820
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:32,750
Or did you forget?

821
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:36,270
I heard people on the verge of death always see ghosts.

822
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:38,660
I'll help you remember.

823
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:41,870
Are you crazy?
