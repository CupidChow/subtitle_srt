00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Ask

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
After four thousand times

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Thousands of times

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The most reluctant

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Is that moment

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
On the earth

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A thousand miles of madness

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who doesn't wander

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Who doesn't know

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The faraway sky is separated from the earth

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
On the moon

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
On the earth

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The youth is wild

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The young are drunk like a wine

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The world is like a dream

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The faraway sky is separated from the earth

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The youth is wild

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The young are drunk like a wine

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The world is like a dream

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000

On the earth

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
On the earth

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Little brother

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm not thirsty, I'm not hungry

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm angry

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The previous day, that good guy

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Come to fight with me, I didn't play well

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You call him to me now

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'll fight again

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What's the point of fighting?

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I don't know the master

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What's the use of keeping you blind

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Don't think about it, that good guy has already gone down the mountain

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Down the mountain

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That turned out we are now

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Live on this mountain

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's not very convenient to go down the mountain and enter the city

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It would be nice if I could really enter the city

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's a dozen miles from Ruyi City

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's only a day to buy it

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's a dozen miles from Ruyi City

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's still a bit of a distance

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Forget it

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It seems that I am with the good guy

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
No way to fight

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Why don't you put me and others

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Locked together

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Is it boring if someone fights with you?

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
There is really one person except you

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But he was locked in the master's room

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Master treats him differently

69
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I have to see him every day

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Master doesn't allow us to talk about him

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What's going on?

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Governor, Governor, Governor

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Governor, Governor, Governor

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Governor, Governor, Governor

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Governor

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
His Majesty has never delayed the morning court

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I and the party ask to see the emperor

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Governor follows the emperor every day

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
His Majesty is fine

80
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I have something important to report to the emperor

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Please see the emperor

82
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Please tell the emperor

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I am here to see the emperor

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What is this?

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This is

86
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Governor, what are you doing?

87
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Governor, why are you doing this?

88
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Are you going to rebel?

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What?

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Xue Yuanxiang dared to arrest the court's important officials

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Minister of War, Minister of Rites

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Minister of remaining investigation

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Minister of Ministry of Defence

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:00,940
Minister of져

95
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,940
Is coming

96
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,940
kicking up troubles

97
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,040
¡€€t

98
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,040
Nothing can stop the Emperor

99
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,140
Just one nail

100
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,580
There are people from the Imperial City Hall guarding the door.

101
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,140
We can't let anyone in.

102
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,260
There must be something wrong with the school.

103
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,380
Even if it's a risk,

104
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,020
I must see my father.

105
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,820
Li Lianhua gave me a lot of good things before.

106
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,740
It must be useful.

107
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,260
His Majesty ordered that no one should be seen.

108
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,660
I have to see him.

109
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,140
Father.

110
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,060
Father.

111
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,140
Father.

112
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,260
Father, what's wrong?

113
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,180
Three days ago,

114
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,060
I was out of the south.

115
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,140
Xuan Yuanxiao came to see me.

116
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,060
He said that I was weak and needed to rest.

117
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,980
I don't believe that he would try to kill me.

118
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,020
He must be a traitor.

119
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,060
Xuan Yuanxiao is a traitor.

120
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,620
Father, what should we do?

121
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,660
Xuan Yuanxiao is no longer Xuan Yuanxiao.

122
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,780
There will be a big change

123
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,220
if we keep the secret.

124
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,340
Princess, please let His Majesty rest.

125
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,060
Take her back to Zhaohua Hall.

126
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,220
She can't be ordered or come out.

127
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,980
Father.

128
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,180
Father.

129
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,500
Don't be afraid.

130
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,660
Father.

131
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,620
The medicine in the white porridge

132
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,740
is so strong that it's hard to take.

133
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,420
The medicine is for porridge.

134
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,500
It seems that the cook

135
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,380
is a drug dealer.

136
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,300
Li Xiangyi,

137
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,140
you are blind.

138
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,060
But your nose is sharp.

139
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,700
It was Chief Jiao.

140
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,100
Chief Mi?

141
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,660
He was so powerful back then.

142
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,940
Look at you.

143
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,180
You must have suffered a lot these years.

144
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,780
I have suffered a lot.

145
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,180
I know better than I do

146
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,180
about Chief Jiao's spy.

147
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,740
Li Xiangyi,

148
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,420
I won't kill you.

149
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,100
I know you know why.

150
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,620
It doesn't matter

151
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,420
if Li Lianhua is a son or a daughter.

152
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,220
But Li Xiangyi is not.

153
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,660
I have two good news

154
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,460
to tell you today.

155
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,420
Nimo.

156
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,220
I am going to find Miss System.

157
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,660
Put Li Xiangyi

158
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,980
to sleep in the exam room first.

159
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,020
Yes,

160
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:52,980
Chief Mi.

161
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,340
I will go first.

162
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,180
I want to ask Li Xiangyi

163
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,780
what did she do to Li Lianhua?

164
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,100
made by the same person.

165
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,420
Here, for you.

166
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,700
Then you don't have to give it to me.

167
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,740
It should be for Shan Gu Dao.

168
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,100
This is what Shan Gu Dao

169
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,620
asked me to make for you.

170
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,340
On the day of his attack,

171
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,900
you will be in this war robe

172
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,300
bowing to him

173
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,300
and kneeling at his feet.

174
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,900
Then he will be disappointed.

175
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,700
Now my eyes can't see clearly.

176
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,900
No matter how bright he is,

177
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,100
I can't see it.

178
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,460
No wonder Shan Gu Dao hates you so much.

179
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,740
You have a sharp tongue.

180
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,660
But now you look like this.

181
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,660
What's the use of having a sharp tongue?

182
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,220
Then

183
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,260
let's use it to drink.

184
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,060
Now let's talk about the second happy thing.

185
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,180
Then let me guess.

186
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,580
Could it be a wedding wine?

187
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,140
You got it right.

188
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,060
This is the wedding wine between me and my superior.

189
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,620
You have to drink it.

190
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,220
I don't know if the Chief of the enemy is happy or not.

191
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,660
Now the taste of the Chief of the enemy

192
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,580
has become like this.

193
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,340
What do you know?

194
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,740
I used the world as a bait

195
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,500
and gave him all my sincerity.

196
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,500
Isn't he satisfied?

197
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,700
So you want this world too.

198
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,420
You got it right again.

199
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,220
I think now

200
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,540
no one is your opponent anymore.

201
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,380
You can't just do it.

202
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,940
So you want to be the emperor now.

203
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,580
I was a man of the royal family.

204
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,860
Why can't I be the emperor?

205
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,380
Why can't I do what those men can do?

206
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,820
But there is only one emperor.

207
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,700
It seems that you and Shan Gu Dao

208
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,820
are not on the same side.

209
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,940
The emperor is mine.

210
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,780
What about Di Feisheng?

211
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,460
Is he

212
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,340
you want to make her the empress?

213
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,700
Empress?

214
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,860
Li Xiangyi.

215
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,340
You are getting more and more interesting.

216
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,980
You are getting more and more interesting.

217
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,980
I can marry you, too.

218
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,100
What do you think?

219
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,380
But three days later

220
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,420
is the wedding day of my marriage with Di Feisheng.

221
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,180
You have to be my mistress.

222
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:04,700
You're so sure that you're the one who will win in the end?

223
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,700
Does Shan Gu Dao think that with the Night Fire Peony in his hand,

224
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,100
he can take the big step and be at ease?

225
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,700
He doesn't know that the peony can be destroyed completely.

226
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,900
I'm talking to you like a real man.

227
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,300
You were so careless just now and caused me to tell you so many secrets.

228
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,300
Do you believe that I'll kill you?

229
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,900
If I die, who else will attend your wedding with Di Fei Sheng?

230
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,500
I'm afraid that no one will sing you a wedding song.

231
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,900
It's not appropriate to sing a wedding song in such a cold and quiet place.

232
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,700
Li Xiang Yi, you're so smart.

233
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,100
Let's wait and see.

234
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,100
I want to pass it back to you.

235
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,100
Di Fei Sheng.

236
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,300
Your fourth sense... You really like having secrets?

237
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,900
Please go back.

238
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,220
I want to go out.

239
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,780
Let me out!

240
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,980
I just want to take a walk.

241
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,260
Say something! Let me out!

242
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,140
No!

243
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,900
My father is sick.

244
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,180
I can't see him.

245
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,500
Your Imperial City Bureau is so cruel.

246
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,500
You are so cruel.

247
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,740
The court is being chased by you.

248
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,340
All the officials and generals in the capital are being arrested.

249
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,020
What else do you want?

250
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:23,740
Master.

251
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,780
Master, what's wrong with you?

252
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,220
You are...

253
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,300
You are bewitched by them.

254
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,780
It's the Night Fire Hall.

255
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,620
Master has been so worried all his life.

256
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,100
How could they treat you like this?

257
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,580
Master.

258
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,700
Go to Li Xiangyi and save His Majesty.

259
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,940
Go.

260
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,340
Go.

261
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,620
Go.

262
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,940
Go.

263
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,500
Master.

264
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,020
Go.

265
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,260
Go!

266
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,780
Master.

267
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,340
Go!

268
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,780
Go!

269
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,500
I want to eat.

270
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,660
You haven't been here for two days.

271
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,740
Why are you yelling?

272
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,980
I should eat even if I haven't been here for two days.

273
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,900
Why?

274
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,020
Why?

275
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,620
Younger brother.

276
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,140
You are so ungrateful.

277
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,500
I helped you make the palace.

278
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,700
But you didn't eat.

279
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,780
I just want to eat.

280
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,860
What are you doing?

281
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,940
You are so cruel.

282
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,020
You are so evil.

283
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,100
You are so cruel.

284
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,180
You are so cruel.

285
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,700
I helped you make the palace.

286
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,620
Don't you want to give me a bite to eat?

287
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,620
You agreed to wear that tent?

288
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,700
Yes.

289
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,380
Your master is so beautiful.

290
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,140
If you don't wear it, you will make him angry.

291
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,380
You really want to see the beauty of our master.

292
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,060
I thought you were so brave.

293
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,140
How can you say that?

294
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,260
I wonder how your master

295
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,100
treats this Di Peisheng.

296
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,020
He was tied up by his master.

297
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,100
He can't go anywhere.

298
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,140
Di Peisheng used to kill a lot of people.

299
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,700
He is just a prisoner of his master now.

300
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,020
Eat.

301
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,260
It smells so good.

302
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,900
I don't want to see it. I'll eat a little first.

303
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,900
Okay.

304
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,100
I don't think

305
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,500
you can escape from people's heart.

306
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,220
If you go and call him directly,

307
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,300
how can you show your power?

308
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,220
If I wear this tent,

309
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,420
and you go and call him again,

310
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,900
it will be your credit, right?

311
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,900
I'm sorry, little guy.

312
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,380
You should have a good rest.

313
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,820
I'm just an old friend.

314
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,580
This is the place

315
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,340
where Qiao Lixiao lives.

316
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,980
How are you doing today,

317
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,660
my master?

318
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,380
Look.

319
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,900
This is the first time you see me like this.

320
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,260
Do you remember?

321
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,660
The day after tomorrow is our big day.

322
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,900
Are you happy?

323
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,940
After the wedding,

324
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,860
I will officially call you husband.

325
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,100
Shouldn't you change your mind?

326
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,420
You should say you love me.

327
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,700
Don't worry.

328
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,140
As long as you say it,

329
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,940
I'll let you go.

330
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,100
This hot spring is so dangerous.

331
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,140
Look at your wound.

332
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,980
It's not healed.

333
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,740
I feel so bad for you.

334
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,940
It hurts so much.

335
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,740
You're still so shy.

336
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,020
You don't even want to look at me.

337
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,940
I can only play the old game with you for these days.

338
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,900
If you don't answer,

339
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,820
I'll be angry.

340
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,020
And I'll hit you hard.

341
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,620
Then, let's start.

342
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,460
Di Weisheng,

343
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,740
do you love me?

344
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,740
Do you love me?

345
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,540
Do you love me?

346
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,940
Well.

347
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,620
This game should be played differently.

348
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,340
Do you know

349
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:41,420
that Li Xiangyi is also locked up here?

350
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,380
I know you'll care so much about his name.

351
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,820
I'll kill you.

352
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,820
How could you do this to me?

353
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,060
Your hands and feet are broken.

354
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,220
You have no strength.

355
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,300
You just want to kill me.

356
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,940
You want to kill me.

357
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,860
You want me to die.

358
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,740
The day after tomorrow,

359
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,740
our marriage will be fixed.

360
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,060
After the wedding ceremony,

361
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,100
even if you become a hostage,

362
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,220
you'll be my husband.

363
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,260
My husband.

364
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,980
My husband forever.

365
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,820
My husband.

366
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,700
Does it look good, Li Xiangyi?

367
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,060
Yes.

368
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,460
Of course, it looks good.

369
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,940
I'll give it to you if you like it.

370
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,660
But,

371
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,420
you don't look good.

372
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,020
Are you here to talk nonsense?

373
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,460
Ridiculous.

374
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,380
Don't you understand?

375
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,460
I don't need your help.

376
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,820
You want to save me without figur carbines.

377
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,180
I'll attack you if you dare to go.

378
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:01,700
!!!

379
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,460
Ou Ar disagrees

380
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,060
Please leave it to li qiao.

381
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,940
Have I visited Digibo?

382
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,740
You cooperate with Courtesan ofjewellery

383
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,980
to earn your own بعoos,

384
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,500
You're the same.

385
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,740
I asked Wu Yan to find you,

386
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,100
but you got caught here.

387
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,460
It seems that Shan Gu Dao has done it.

388
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,620
We're both in such a situation now.

389
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,260
We don't have to be so hard on each other.

390
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,420
I used the blood salt Wu Yan sent

391
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,100
to kill Ye Huo Ziteng.

392
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,740
I didn't expect that

393
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,940
Shan Gu Dao

394
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,700
got the peony.

395
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,460
Let's not talk anymore.

396
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,420
Let's leave here.

397
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,060
Let's go.

398
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,860
Let's hide from the wind.

399
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:00,700
Where?

400
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,700
The most dangerous place

401
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,060
is the safest place.

402
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:04,940
The wedding room.

403
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,300
The wedding room?

404
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,420
Your wedding room.

405
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,220
Oh, no.

406
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,660
The one who was caught ran away.

407
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,220
Hurry.

408
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,700
Go and block all exits.

409
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,420
Chase them.

410
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,100
You're starting to practice now.

411
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,620
You don't have to be so anxious.

412
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,260
I can't watch 생존

413
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,620
that I tried to avoid.

414
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,420
Lordlection ceremony.

415
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,020
You're strengthening the meridians grow faster.

416
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,900
Looks like I underestimated

417
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,980
your bravado removed.

418
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,140
Your Yangzhouês

419
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,100
are SV for instance.

420
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,860
The bravado removed

421
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,020
is the actsIR biter than taker's.

422
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,900
It's azt checked in countless ways.

423
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,340
After Jiao Li Qiao

424
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,460
, pulverised my martial art skills,

425
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,580
the bravine removed my cliente's harness.

426
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:13,620
I didn't get the reward I got back then.

427
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,620
What about now?

428
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,620
It depends on luck.

429
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,620
I still...

430
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,620
90 percent?

431
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,620
I'll die.

432
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,620
If you die,

433
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,620
wouldn't that be a waste of my time saving you?

434
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,620
Forget it.

435
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,620
It's kind of a debt.

436
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,620
Fine.

437
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,620
I'll go see what kind of clothes they have.

438
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,620
I'll go check on something.

439
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,620
It's not easy to save you.

440
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,620
You can't die.

441
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,320
She places her hands on his ear,

442
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,500
and does not protect all followers.

443
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,120
How vile.

444
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,620
Tianming Cannibal wasn't the emperor's carbohydrate volume at first,

445
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,700
Wang 1960

446
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,700
Robert Marx

447
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,660
Who are you?

448
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,220
Big Head.

449
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,140
You've gained some power.

450
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,180
Are you here to get into my office?

451
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,220
Yes.

452
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,220
and win.

453
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,140
Chief Di,

454
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,580
you're so lucky.

455
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,540
You won the bet with nine.

456
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,580
Congratulations.

457
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,860
You helped me just now.

458
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,900
I'll pay you back.

459
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,540
I don't like to owe people.

460
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,820
Don't talk about that.

461
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,940
It's tiring.

462
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,020
I'm afraid of

463
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,940
paying back people.

464
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,620
How about this?

465
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,980
If you really want to pay me back,

466
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,700
don't fight with me in the future.

467
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,020
How to pay back people?

468
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,340
I don't need your money.

469
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,700
It seems to be today.

470
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,220
The East China Sea war ten years ago

471
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,420
is today.

472
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,500
That's right.

473
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,500
The 27th of the last month is today.

474
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,820
I didn't expect that

475
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,380
we would fight with each other.

476
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,460
Ten years later,

477
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,860
we will win again.

478
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,860
Come on.

479
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:19,460
That day...

480
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,460
That year...

481
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,620
That year, the color of the moon is not as good as today.

482
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,220
That year, the color of the moon is as good as today.

483
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,460
As good as today.

484
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,340
What are you going to do

485
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,900
after today?

486
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,260
Take back my sword.

487
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,860
Find Wang Chunhua.

488
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,860
Save your life and fight again.

489
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,460
Lord Di.

490
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,300
Li Xiangyin is dead.

491
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,460
Li Lianhua is dying soon.

492
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,580
You go to the Heaven to clear the sky.

493
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,860
Let me go.

494
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,060
Li Xiangyin is dead.

495
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,780
Her sword is dead.

496
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,380
It's easy to get rid of the world.

497
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,180
But Xiangyin is too despicable.

498
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,780
You have forgotten your sword.

499
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,580
Let's drink.

500
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,900
So you also noticed the weirdness of this wall.

501
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,900
Yes.

502
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,780
enemy

503
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,500
This should be the place.

504
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,460
No one can stop me now.

505
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:54,860
Go.

506
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,860
Wait.

507
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,940
The pretty girl hides the thing here.

508
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,100
Maybe she also had some other things.

509
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,220
there must be a way to control the night fire.

510
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,220
Maybe it's hidden here.

511
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,620
If you change it,

512
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:17,540
do you know what Qiao Liqiao said before?

513
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,220
No.

514
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,140
Still no.

515
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:21,860
Pretend.

516
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:25,460
Qiao Liqiao said he would marry you with this world.

517
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,460
So with his personality and rank,

518
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:31,300
how can he be more suitable to keep the marriage gift than this new house?

519
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:53,860
Let's see.

520
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,820
Yes.

521
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:08,580
Nicholas III,

522
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,740
catch the climbed general.

523
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,760
Yes, lord.

524
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,020
Get him.

525
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,840
Check this way.

526
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,680
Those are valid sex records.

527
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,220
This is only 100 years ago.

528
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,420
Consort Xuan is left

529
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,040
with the records of eating strict reality host.

530
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,640
Which Cr anar occur not in a single moment.

531
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,720
Look up here,

532
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,400
what they're doing is incorrect.

533
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,080
They're on site.

534
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,180
This is bad.

535
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,500
After we closed the door,

536
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,620
his Majesty sent him here.

537
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,540
Telled us that

538
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,220
Go go escape?

539
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,360
Keep up!

540
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,340
Who loads the weapon?

541
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,460
I can't get rid of it.

542
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,420
Chief Di,

543
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,220
you can provoke anyone.

544
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,340
But it's him.

545
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,780
He can even leave.

546
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:36,940
Li Lianhua,

547
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,740
do you think this trap is not for you?

548
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,420
Then look,

549
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,700
who is this?

550
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,500
This trap

551
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,780
was designed by Bi Qiu.

552
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:55,900
How about it?

553
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,300
The first mechanical teacher of the Four Gu Sect,

554
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,460
such a wonderful mechanical formation,

555
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,580
even Tianji Hall has never had it.

556
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,220
Bi Qiu,

557
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,420
I like it very much.

558
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,020
Li Lianhua,

559
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,500
it's a coincidence.

560
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:15,060
It was Yun Bi Qiu who brought you here from Lotus Pavilion.

561
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,140
Now he wants to help me keep you.

562
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,900
Ten years ago,

563
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,620
he used a cup of tea

564
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,460
to turn Li Xiang Yi into Li Lianhua.

565
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,980
Now it's him again.

566
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:32,140
He wants to turn Li Lianhua into a lonely ghost.

567
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,300
Saintess.

568
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,740
Saintess, bad news.

569
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,500
There's a white stone outside the bridge.

570
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,340
It led the four disciples of the Four Gu Sect to the bottom of the mountain.

571
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:48,940
Why are you so nervous?

572
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,180
Bi Qiu,

573
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,540
open all the mechanisms on the mountain

574
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,380
and let them all come up to die.

575
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:03,820
Go.

576
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,580
Di Feisheng,

577
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,620
at this point,

578
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,220
you can only choose one.

579
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,340
Are you choosing to be my husband

580
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,660
or to be a ghost with Li Xiang Yi?

581
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,060
You are the ghost.

582
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,180
I cannot stand you!

583
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:29,580
Kid,

584
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,380
I'll kill you!

585
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,820
sheer Y peution.

586
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,980
You don't know much about industy.

587
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,380
might be very dangerous.

588
00:32:52,820 --> 00:33:07,320
Then,

589
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,420
a cat tree literate

590
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,100
will create the most dangerousWhat is this?

591
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,100
I caught it again.

592
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,100
Why don't I let it

593
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,100
be locked in this wall forever?

594
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,100
I can control it forever.

595
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,100
Let it be a

596
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,100
a good, good, good,

597
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,100
moving zombie.

598
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,100
Hey, pretty girl.

599
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,100
You're joking again.

600
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,100
This poison

601
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,100
has nothing to do with you.

602
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,100
I've escaped from the poison of tea.

603
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,100
The other poisons to me

604
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,100
are nothing to me.

605
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,100
Okay, okay, okay.

606
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,100
What's the big deal?

607
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,100
I can't help you

608
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,100
with the poison of tea.

609
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,100
It's a paper tiger.

610
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,100
Then you should die

611
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,100
and give me a chance to live.

612
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,100
What's going on?

613
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,100
The door of the temple is locked.

614
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,100
How did the officials of the Western Pass

615
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,100
get in?

616
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,100
I can't stop them.

617
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,100
Go down.

618
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,100
Yes.

619
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,100
Useless.

620
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,100
Your big deal is confirmed.

621
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,100
I'll go to the temple

622
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,100
and get the poison of tea.

623
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,100
I'll go to the temple

624
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,100
and get the poison of tea.

625
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,100
Go.

626
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,100
Where's Li Lianhua?

627
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,100
Li Lianhua is waiting for you

628
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,100
in the hell.

629
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,100
You want to open the trap?

630
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,100
It's too late.

631
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,100
Li Lianhua.

632
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,100
Li Lianhua.

633
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,100
The poison is in the bowl.

634
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,100
Lian Shan.

635
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,100
Xiao Liqiang.

636
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,100
Your dragon-slaying bull rider gang

637
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,100
has been destroyed.

638
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,100
Your plan has been ruined.

639
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,100
Stop it.

640
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,100
Then I'll break this mountain

641
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,100
and let everyone die with me.

642
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,100
But Li Xiangli.

643
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:50,100
You must die in my hands today.

644
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,100
The mechanism is located in the northeast of the mountain.

645
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,100
There are seven formation in the east.

646
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,100
The west wind is blowing in the nine directions.

647
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,100
The north and south of the bamboo boat are spread.

648
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,100
In this way,

649
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,100
there must be a mechanism snake every time.

650
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,100
The dragon's tail is in the north corner.

651
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,100
There are eight steps in the east.

652
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,100
Ten centimeters under the wall.

653
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,100
It's the sign of all the mechanisms.

654
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,100
It's all possible.

655
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,100
Go.

656
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,100
Li Lianhua.

657
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,100
I know.

658
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,100
It's all because of you.

659
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,100
Li Xiangli.

660
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,100
Li Xiangli.

661
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,100
Li Xiangli.

662
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,100
Li Xiangli.

663
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,100
Li Xiangli.

664
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,100
Li Xiangli.

665
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,100
Kill you.

666
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,100
Kill you.

667
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,100
No one will ever

668
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,100
provoke me to be with him.

669
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,100
You go first.

670
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,100
Leave this to me.

671
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,100
I hate you.

672
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,100
You are ungrateful.

673
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,100
It has nothing to do with others.

674
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,100
Okay.

675
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,100
Since I can't keep you,

676
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,100
then we'll die together.

677
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,100
I won't kill women.

678
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,100
But you are an exception.

679
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,100
Li Xiangli.

680
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,100
Li Xiangli.

681
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,100
Li Xiangli.

682
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,100
Li Xiangli.

683
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,100
Li Xiangli.

684
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,100
Li Xiangli.

685
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,100
Li Xiangli.

686
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,100
Li Xiangli.

687
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,100
Li Xiangli.

688
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,100
Li Xiangli.

689
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,100
Li Xiangli.

690
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,100
Li Xiangli.

691
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,100
Li Xiangli.

692
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,100
Li Xiangli.

693
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,100
Li Xiangli.

694
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,100
Li Xiangli.

695
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,100
Li Xiangli.

696
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,100
Li Xiangli.

697
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,100
Li Xiangli.

698
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,100
Li Xiangli.

699
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,100
Li Xiangli.

700
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,100
Li Xiangli.

701
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,100
Li Xiangli.

702
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,100
Li Xiangli.

703
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,100
Li Xiangli.

704
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,100
Li Xiangli.

705
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,100
Li Xiangli.

706
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,100
Li Xiangli.

707
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,100
Li Xiangli.

708
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,100
Li Xiangli.

709
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,100
Li Xiangli.

710
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,100
Li Xiangli.

711
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,100
Li Xiangli.

712
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,100
Li Xiangli.

713
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,100
Li Xiangli.

714
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,100
Li Xiangli.

715
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,100
Li Xiangli.

716
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,100
Happy birthday.

717
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,100
Zhibang.

718
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,100
Did you ruin this mechanism?

719
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,100
It's strange.

720
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,100
All the mechanisms I encountered along the way

721
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,100
were exposed and obvious.

722
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,100
In theory,

723
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,100
as long as people with a good understanding of the design

724
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,100
know that this mechanism should be hidden.

725
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,100
Besides, this mechanism...

726
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,100
Xiang Yi!

727
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,100
Xiang Yi!

728
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,100
Are you okay?

729
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,100
I'm fine.

730
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,100
Is everyone okay?

731
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,100
Sect Leader.

732
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,100
He really is our Sect Leader.

733
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,100
Greetings, Sect Leader.

734
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,100
Greetings, Sect Leader.

735
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,100
Everyone, get up.

736
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,100
I'm no longer your Sect Leader.

737
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,100
Thank you, Young Master Fang, for saving everyone from a bloody battle.

738
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,100
The crisis is temporarily resolved.

739
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,100
Everyone, get out of here.

740
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,100
Brother Yu!

741
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,100
Brother Fang!

742
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,100
Brother Yu.

743
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,100
Brother Fang.

744
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,100
Something happened in the capital.

745
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,100
The mountain palace has used the Night Flames Pavilion to control my master.

746
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,100
They have already taken control of the situation in the palace.

747
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,100
They also captured Princess Zhao Ning and many important officials.

748
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,100
Tomorrow, they will be in the Golden West Zhongyong Hall to perform a ritual.

749
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,100
His Majesty is still worried.

750
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,100
Okay.

751
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,100
Everything will be done according to Mr. Li's arrangement.

752
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,100
We will split up and perform the ritual.

753
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,100
Yes.

754
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,100
Li Lianhua.

755
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,100
This time, it's a tough battle.

756
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,100
We must be careful.

757
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,100
Yes.

758
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,100
We must be careful.

759
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,100
Yes.

760
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,100
Yes.

761
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,100
Yes.

762
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,100
Yes.

763
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,100
Yes.

764
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,100
Yes.

765
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,100
Yes.

766
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,100
Yes.

767
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,100
It's a tough battle.

768
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,100
Can you hold on?

769
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,100
I have told you the inner power of the North Wind and the White Sun.

770
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,100
Although it can't restore you to the past,

771
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,100
it can also keep you in good health and energy.

772
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,100
Thank you.

773
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,100
Chief Ding.

774
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,100
I didn't expect you to stay and help us this time.

775
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,100
I really didn't see you wrong.

776
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,100
I'm not interested in helping others.

777
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,100
I just don't want to die here.

778
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,100
Ten years ago,

779
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,100
the Four Ancient Gates and the Golden Moon Alliance were at war.

780
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,100
They were defeated and won.

781
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,100
Ten years later,

782
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,100
you and I fought side by side.

783
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,100
It's really interesting.

784
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,100
Of course, we want to make the person behind it

785
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,100
pay for it.

786
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,100
I'm sorry.

787
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,100
