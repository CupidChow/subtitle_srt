00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Kissing myself thousands of times

00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The most reluctant moment is that moment

00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Live in the world, travel thousands of miles

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who doesn't wander around

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds and the moon on the cliff

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Live in the world, young love stories

The whole world is drunk in sorrow

The journey to the end of the world is like a dream

Live in the world, travel thousands of miles

Who doesn't wander around

Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds and the moon on the cliff

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Everyone, return to the mountain town first!

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Go!

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Mother, open the trap. Leave this to me.

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Okay.

23
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Hurry!

24
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Go!

25
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Go!

26
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Go!

27
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Kill them all!

28
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Kill them all!

29
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Good!

30
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I didn't expect a magnet sword

31
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
to turn your idle face into a pile of scrap metal.

32
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You learned the skill of the sky chicken hall's chase car

33
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and turned it into a murder weapon.

34
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Do you think I can't find its core?

35
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I started to study this thing

36
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
when I came back from the stone beast village.

37
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What else do you want now?

38
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Good.

39
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You are indeed the good son of the sky chicken hall.

40
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Five-storied Demon Monk!

41
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Go!

42
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Go!

00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,840
Li pasado

46
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:23,620
Gee.

47
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,940
Li Xiangyi.

48
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,340
Bai詠音!

00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,220
Xiaofeng.

50
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,380
Leader Di.

51
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,140
What takes you so long?

52
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,940
What do you mean?

53
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,380
intense your Onunition

54
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,140
to get back himself?

55
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,660
Have you recovered your memory?

56
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:47,900
You traitor!

57
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,060
Someone with high position

58
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,980
who lured me intoovr b a loyalty?

59
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,500
Just your luck.

60
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,020
I'm not patient enough to hand over the item.

61
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,220
A tiger is a tiger.

62
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,540
It won't get what you want.

63
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,820
Stop talking nonsense.

64
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,540
Xiaofeng.

65
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,420
Xia Yan.

66
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,900
Shen Gu Dao.

67
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,940
Why do you care about the trifle

68
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,820
if you want to achieve great things?

69
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,340
Take out the item.

70
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,100
Huang Xiaofeng.

71
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,260
Give Tianming to her.

72
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,140
I...

73
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,700
Where's the other one?

74
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,620
Xia Yan.

75
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,500
I'll leave it to you.

76
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,860
Let her go at the same time.

77
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,420
My son.

78
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,740
Tianji Villa didn't teach you well.

79
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,380
But your father wants to make a deal.

80
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,540
You have no right to bargain with me.

81
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:01,780
Xiaofeng.

82
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,380
Xia Yan.

83
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,620
Give it to me.

84
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,300
Xiaofeng.

85
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,380
Are you okay?

86
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,980
Thanks to the help of the Chief of the Di Alliance.

87
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,060
It's much easier

88
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,580
to have the Chief of the Di Alliance.

89
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,060
Xiaofeng.

90
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,980
This is the last time I call you.

91
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,300
I've never

92
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,020
earned anything from you.

93
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:41,740
From now on,

94
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,500
I want you to

95
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,740
return your life to me.

96
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,900
It depends on whether you have that life

97
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,860
or not.

98
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,460
Finally.

99
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,420
At last,

100
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:36,260
all the Army of다고

101
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,060
has been burned to ashes

102
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,020
to kick the Devil's soul.

103
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,380
The fire of the Chili Family

104
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,280
Go, go, go.

105
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,560
Go.

106
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,220
Go.

107
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,180
If you open this lo 좀,

108
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,680
everything in this world is mine now.

109
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,860
I've done my job for you.

110
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,180
I'll take this away.

111
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,620
Di Feisheng,

112
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,860
don't be so arrogant.

113
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,380
This is my way of life.

114
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,380
You can come and go as you like.

115
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,820
Now, the martial arts ranking is really a game on the 10,000-man list.

116
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,260
You're right, Chief Di.

117
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,660
You two did a good job.

118
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,700
In this world,

119
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,100
who can beat you in martial arts?

120
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,260
So I'm very sincere

121
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,300
to cooperate with you.

122
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,340
If you really need it,

123
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,500
I'll have Luo Moding and Luo Moding's

124
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,780
heavenly army lent to you.

125
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,500
There's one more thing.

126
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,860
I heard that

127
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,100
you sent people to search for the whereabouts of the Wangchuan Flower.

128
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,540
It's a coincidence.

129
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,340
This flower is in my hands.

130
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,540
I think you must be very interested.

131
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,900
Is this true?

132
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,780
This night is very important.

133
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,500
This night is the flower of the Wangchuan Flower.

134
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,780
You can ask the demon to identify it carefully.

135
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,580
As long as you

136
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,220
return the two things in your hands to me,

137
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,380
I'll give the flower to you.

138
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,620
What do you think?

139
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,780
Good idea.

140
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,980
Keep your flower and wait for me.

141
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,180
Only I know

142
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,980
how to hold my man.

143
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,180
How is it?

144
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,380
I told you about the Wangchuan Flower.

145
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,580
Is it really useful?

146
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,380
I sent people to search for it.

147
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,380
I'll take the flower

148
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,980
and put it in my hands.

149
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,380
Chief Shan,

150
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,980
I'm not going to let you go this time.

151
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,980
I'll go with you.

152
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,780
I'll go with you.

153
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,380
Chief Shan,

154
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,980
I don't remember the previous time I cooperated with you.

155
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:46,580
You should know what I want.

156
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,780
Don't worry.

157
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,380
After using Di Feisheng,

158
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,580
he's yours.

159
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,980
Don't worry.

160
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,980
I still have the sword of the front car.

161
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,780
Last time it was just a chance.

162
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,980
You saw it.

163
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,580
Di Feisheng forced me to do it.

164
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,180
I can only follow him.

165
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,380
If we both

166
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,980
break our faces,

167
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,380
it's not good for the business of our South India.

168
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,580
I think

169
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,780
we should keep this knife for now.

170
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,580
Chief Shan, you don't have to

171
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,380
say that so nicely.

172
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,180
If I didn't send the message

173
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,780
to let Xue Gong save you,

174
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,380
who would know where you were locked up?

175
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,780
Besides,

176
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,380
we're from the same clan.

177
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,180
We're the descendants of the South Indian royal family.

178
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,780
We should be more careful.

179
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,380
I have to protect Desula now.

180
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,420
Match making is a tiger'sla Today,

181
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,780
we should make a peaceful union with our master.

182
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,780
Let's make peace.

183
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,380
Very good.

184
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,780
I'll find it out

185
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,300
when Trials of Poetry

186
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,500
are done.

187
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:25,780
There're more

188
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,180
You're quite good at martial arts lately.

189
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,500
When did you start to move your hands and feet?

190
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,140
Isn't it just now?

191
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,540
When I was patting your water waves back.

192
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,980
How is it, Master?

193
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,580
Am I the champion this time?

194
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,580
Fine.

195
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,780
Go down the mountain with your senior.

196
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,060
Thank you, Master.

197
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,060
I'll go now.

198
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,060
Thank you, Master.

199
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,820
I will definitely use this sword in my hand

200
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,180
to remove the strong and the weak

201
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,780
and become a great person who can take on the world.

202
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,180
I will be the one who will be the master.

203
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,500
I don't want you to be a great person.

204
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
I just want you and your senior

205
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,860
to eat well and drink well

206
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,780
and live well.

207
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,180
Remember, when you come back,

208
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,860
bring me a pot of good wine.

209
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:25,580
Master, I've repaired your wine pot.

210
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,580
I promised to drink with you.

211
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,780
I don't think I have a chance.

212
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,860
Master, I'm sorry.

213
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,860

I'm sorry.

360
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,860
Everything

361
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,860
should be ended.

362
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,500
I am afraid something might happen to you.

363
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,300
So I am ready to help you defend Lots's Army.

364
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,040
No worries.

365
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,540
I know how Lulu feels.

366
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,720
She knows that I will be跟 keeper.

367
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,460
Good luck.

368
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,620
No love.

369
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,100
No love?

370
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,580
When you were in Cloud Mountain,

371
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,140
you told me that the poison had been cured.

372
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,780
I actually believed it.

373
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,060
You put everything

374
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,180
on yourself again.

375
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,020
You said it wasn't your fault.

376
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,460
Because I don't know how to use people and I don't know how to check them.

377
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,020
That's wrong.

378
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,220
Since you forgot your identity as Li Xiang Yi,

379
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,740
you should face your current self.

380
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,140
Why don't you just let go of the past?

381
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,220
I've been doing it for too long.

382
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,740
Li Lian Hua

383
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,420
has been on a ten-year drug-reducing life.

384
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,500
It's time to end it.

385
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,180
End what?

386
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,380
From Cloud Mountain until now,

387
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,660
you've been on the poison of the Pan Yi Jing.

388
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,340
The Pan Yi Jing is less than a month old.

389
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,460
The most important thing right now is to find a way to save you.

390
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,300
Do you know that?

391
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,660
Fat Xiao Ma,

392
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,220
the poison of the tea is incurable.

393
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,020
Who said it's incurable?

394
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,500
I've already thought of a way

395
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,020
to make people go around and look for flowers.

396
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,580
There must be a way to save you.

397
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,260
I only know that

398
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,900
you're the only one who can help me in this matter.

399
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,740
I won't let you die.

400
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,540
Don't worry about anything else.

401
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,220
Xiao Meng,

402
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,620
I don't have much time left.

403
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,820
So I have to do what I want

404
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,700
before I die.

405
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,420
I have to stop

406
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,860
Shan Gu Tao.

407
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,400
Yao Freak

408
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,900
I can't persuade you, can I?

409
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,860
If you really want to go,

410
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,020
I have to be with you.

411
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,300
You have to promise me

412
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,700
that you won't use your inner power

413
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,180
to protect you.

414
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,940
Okay, I promise.

415
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,700
You're so straightforward.

416
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,460
It's hard not to suspect that you have a ghost in your heart.

417
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,460
I'm wrong even if I'm straightforward.

418
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,460
Where are you going now?

419
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,420
I'm going to the hospital.

420
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,580
You can't go there.

421
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,660
Where are you going?

422
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,620
I need to figure out

423
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,180
what Di Feisheng is going to do.

424
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,340
I don't think

425
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,340
he'll cooperate with the valley of the mountains easily.

426
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,700
If we find him,

427
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,820
maybe we can get the heavenly soldier.

428
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,140
Give me some clues.

429
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,940
Ten years ago, I've already checked

430
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,540
the origin of this Di Feisheng.

431
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,180
He comes from a place in the southwest

432
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,340
that specializes in the secret of death.

433
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,380
Do you remember when he just lost his memory,

434
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,620
we met him?

435
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,580
Why?

436
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,180
Why?

437
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,340
Why do we have to kill each other?

438
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,420
Why?

439
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,340
You suspect that Di Feisheng did this

440
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,020
because of his background?

441
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,700
This Di Feisheng

442
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,780
has been living in the Jiangwu for so many years,

443
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,140
but he never mentioned his background.

444
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,860
Don't you think it's strange?

445
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,220
Let's go to the southwest.

446
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,100
Stand up.

447
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,620
Stand up and fight with me.

448
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,220
Stop. Stop.

449
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,700
Don't run.

450
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,380
You've really used

451
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,260
a similar kernel to control her.

452
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,080
Flaming Kitchen is our enemy now.

453
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,380
Now the knot in her body

454
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,580
is finally broken.

455
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,860
I'm going to take revenge now.

456
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,020
I'm sorry.

457
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,140
I'm sorry.

458
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,300
I'm sorry.

459
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,060
I'm sorry.

460
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:14,860
I'm sorry.

461
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,660
I'm sorry.

462
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,420
I'm sorry.

463
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,180
I'm sorry.

464
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:17,980
I'm sorry.

465
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,780
I'm sorry.

466
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,740
I'm sorry.

467
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,620
I'm sorry.

468
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,460
I'm sorry.

469
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,500
I'm sorry.

470
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,500
I'm sorry.

471
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,380
I'm sorry.

472
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,180
I'm sorry.

473
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,180
I'm sorry.

474
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,180
I'm sorry.

475
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,180
I'm sorry.

476
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,180
I'm sorry.

477
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,180
I'm sorry.

478
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,180
I'm sorry.

479
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,180
I'm sorry.

480
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,180
I'm sorry.

481
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,180
I'm sorry.

482
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,180
I'm sorry.

483
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,180
I'm sorry.

484
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,180
I'm sorry.

485
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,180
I'm sorry.

486
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,180
I'm sorry.

487
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,180
What's wrong?

488
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,180
It's you.

489
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,180
When you were in the Golden Flame Alliance,

490
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,180
you had no choice.

491
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,180
No matter how many times you sent someone,

492
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,180
they couldn't kill you, you traitor.

493
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,180
Today you came to me.

494
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,180
Don't even think about going out alive.

495
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,180
Dijia killed her dead.

496
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,180
You came to collect money to do things.

497
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:08,180
Today, I'll buy your life.

498
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,900
You don't know the consequences of your life.

499
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,100
Today, I'll let you know

500
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,540
what will happen to my Di Jiabao.

501
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,380
Are you surprised?

502
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,540
You...

503
00:27:37,420 --> 00:28:01,300
With these

504
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,740
Don't kill me.

505
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,860
Please don't kill me.

506
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,900
I'll give you the Dijia treasure.

507
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,860
Kill you?

508
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,860
You're too cheap.

509
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,940
I've used up all your energy.

510
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,780
There are so many useless people in this world.

511
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,340
I can't let you live.

512
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,020
I can't let you die.

513
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,020
I'm so scared.

514
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,100
From now on,

515
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,980
there will be no more Dijia bloodshed.

516
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,300
The sky is high and the sea is far.

517
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,580
I hope you can be together.

518
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,540
Thanks to you,

519
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,100
Xia Lin,

520
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:19,800
I can listen to other people's conversation and

521
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,040
learn from Xuer Pass К.

522
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,680
Master.

523
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,880
to find the thing.

524
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,400
I've checked it.

525
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,160
The flower is real.

526
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,040
The box and the flower are not poisonous.

527
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,400
Shan Gu Dao

528
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,800
wants to use the flower to threaten me.

529
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,200
Now the flower and the loam top are in my hands.

530
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,080
Let's see what tricks he can play.

531
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,160
Go find Li Lian Hua.

532
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:51,960
Honorable Superior,

533
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,440
guess

534
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,680
if you can walk or not.

535
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,720
Call Li Qiao.

536
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,520
What's wrong?

537
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,280
Don't come over.

538
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,800
The flower is not poisonous.

539
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,680
That's because I put the poison

540
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,680
on the body of Lord Yan.

541
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,760
Otherwise, how can I fool my Honorable Superior?

542
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,960
I'm stupid.

543
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,280
I've made you suffer.

544
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:45,240
Digital

545
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,120
Impossible.

546
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,960
The penalty needs three points first.

547
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,320
It's really a big scene,

548
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,920
Chinese zobaczyver Di

549
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:26,960
Last time you said

550
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,640
Last time you said

551
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,760
Marquis of Five Peers

552
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,840
They really did not match up with you

553
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,260
You didn't Although you saw him

554
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,640
and attacked his senior

555
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,840
You didn't

556
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,380
Karna

557
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,260
have the deals

558
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,580
If they haven'tzić

559
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,900
seen this poison

560
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,540
Then you are

561
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:52,720
essentially

562
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,060
You should understand

563
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,580
Siワ reci

564
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,020
You've spent all your money.

565
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,140
How can you be so generous?

566
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,940
I've spent a lot of money

567
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,420
to find a suitable mask like this.

568
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,620
Don't worry.

569
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,460
Although you don't have a conscience,

570
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,580
I don't blame you.

571
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,980
I will leave

572
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,260
as long as you're in shape.

573
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,740
My hands were broken.

574
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:52,900
venture monster bre сумrang

575
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,340
What should I do?

576
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,340
Then I have to ...

577
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,580
I...

578
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:15,580
Oligo, if you don't kill me,

579
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:18,580
you'll regret it.

580
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:25,580
King, how can I bear to kill you?

581
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,380
Enough.

582
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:30,780
You're a great beauty. Stop playing around.

583
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,180
Don't worry.

584
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,580
She can't be arrogant for a few days.

585
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,180
She wants to use your hand to suppress me.

586
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,180
But I'm not as stupid as you.

587
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:05,500
The outsiders are always outsiders.

588
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,460
She wants to dominate the world.

589
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,620
And let her make troubles.

590
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,220
When she's most satisfied,

591
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,580
she'll be dead.

592
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:43,880
The

593
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,220
Help me.

594
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,580
Help me.

595
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:52,820
The lugar

596
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,220
So Di Jiabao

597
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,980
used a similar sweet tree

598
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,780
to prevent people from fighting against the family.

599
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,380
So Di Feisheng agreed to cooperate with Shanggu Dao

600
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,260
just to get the Night Fire Hall

601
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,860
to extract the sweet tree in the body.

602
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,820
Now that Di Feisheng

603
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,340
has solved the matter of Di Jiabao,

604
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,020
why didn't he go to me?

605
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,620
Did something happen?

606
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,540
Or did Di Feisheng

607
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,060
really walk with Shanggu Dao?

608
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,540
It seems that we can only study that person first

609
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,260
and find out the resistance.

610
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,380
We can't use the Night Fire Hall's method.

611
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,060
Sect Leader,

612
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,060
since you know how to make sweet trees,

613
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,180
do you know how to control them?

614
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,460
Sweet trees

615
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,780
are also of different levels.

616
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,140
Big and small,

617
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,460
some are small,

618
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,060
Night Fire Hall

619
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,500
is more respected.

620
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,620
As far as I know,

621
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,380
all sweet trees

622
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,820
will be cut by the machine.

623
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,740
The word Moke

624
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,180
is the way to control the Night Fire Hall

625
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,580
and the mother hall itself?

626
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,900
Is the carved human skin left by the two fairies

627
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,180
the only place where the Night Fire Hall is located?

628
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,100
It seems that

629
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:14,300
I can't find the same thing.

630
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,220
Sect Leader,

631
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,700
now the rest of you,

632
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,220
please leave

633
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,780
and rest.

634
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,380
House Mistress!

635
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,700
Please get up.

636
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,780
How is it?

637
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,380
I, Gang of Niu Ma from Yulong University'

638
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,500
is more exciting than Today Alliance, right?

639
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:55,380
I didn't expect that this wish would finally come true.

640
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,380
Come on, let's drink with me.

641
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,380
This is my first time drinking with you.

642
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,380
Come on, let's drink.

643
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,380
What's this?

644
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,380
What a silly thing.

645
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,380
What's this?

646
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,380
I can drink this.

647
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,380
Let's drink with me.

648
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,380
Brothers,

649
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:19,380
this girl wants to steal our family's treasure and practice martial arts.

650
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,380
It's a pity that she's not as good as others.

651
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,380
You're making a mess for me.

652
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,380
You want to touch me?

653
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,380
Go to hell.

654
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,380
Poison woman, go to hell.

655
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,380
Go to hell.

656
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,380
The ghost hand is sealed.

657
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,380
Who are you?

658
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,380
The tenth place is just like this.

659
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:29,380
Now, I'm the tenth place.

660
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,380
I want to marry you.

661
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,380
Do you want to see me?

662
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,380
I'll respect you.

663
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,380
You don't want me?

664
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,380
Then don't.

665
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,380
From now on,

666
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,380
I'll be your wife.

667
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,380
I'll be your wife.

668
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,380
I'll be your wife.

669
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,380
From now on,

670
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,380
you'll be my wife.

671
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,380
Okay?

672
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,380
Take her to my room.

673
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,380
Take her to my room.

674
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,380
Take good care of her.

675
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,380
Don't.

676
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,380
Don't.

677
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,380
Don't.

678
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,380
Don't.

679
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,380
Don't.

680
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,380
Don't.

681
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,380
Don't.

682
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,380
Don't.

683
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,380
Don't.

684
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,380
Why don't you show up?

685
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,380
Ten years ago, I would.

686
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,380
Since your sword is broken,

687
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,380
why did you stay?

688
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,380
A sword is not old,

689
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:04,380
but a man does not seek for a new one.

690
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,380
It is a good sword,

691
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,380
but I do not deserve it.

692
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,380
Why?

693
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,380
A sword is a gift to a hero,

694
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,380
but I am not a hero.

695
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,380
Then tell me,

696
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,380
what is a hero?

697
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,380
A sword is a gift to a hero,

698
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,380
but I do not deserve it.

699
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,380
Where is your master?

700
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,380
Do not take it back.

701
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,380
Some people

702
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,380
have a strange sword,

703
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,380
some people do not give up forever.

704
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,380
People's beliefs

705
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,380
are always different.

706
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,380
People's beliefs

707
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,380
are always different.

708
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,380
I was wrong.

709
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,380
You have changed.

710
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,380
I would not say that.

711
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,380
You are different, Zhan Yunfei.

712
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,380
It has been ten years.

713
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:29,380
People change.

714
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,380
Moreover,

715
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,380
you have changed

716
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,380
from before.

717
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,380
You have changed.

718
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,380
I feel uncomfortable

719
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,380
when I see your hair.

720
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,380
I will take it.

721
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,380
I will buy you a drink.

722
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:07,380
The last circle of this pattern

723
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,380
looks like a wall.

724
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,380
What is inside?

725
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:15,380
I have almost

726
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,380
empty my books.

727
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,380
Only these books

728
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,380
are left from the Western countries.

729
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,380
Let's see if we can use them.

730
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,380
Look at this book.

731
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,380
It is the same as

732
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,380
the one written by Nan Ying.

733
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,380
This is the best.

734
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,380
This symbol

735
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,380
should be a symbol of the gods.

736
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:48,380
Is this pattern

737
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,380
saying that

738
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:50,380
the Night Fire Pond and the Pond

739
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,380
are related to the gods?

740
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,380
The shape is very beautiful.

741
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,380
The body is fresh and has a jade crystal.

742
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,380
This poem

743
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,380
is related to the gods.

744
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,380
What does it mean?

745
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:03,380
Is it

746
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,380
related to the gods?

747
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,380
It is likely that

748
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:06,400
the

749
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,400
pattern is a building,

750
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,400
a temple,

751
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,400
a temple.

752
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,400
The circle outside

753
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,400
looks like a wall.

754
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,400
The carving is amazing.

755
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,400
Is it a city wall?

756
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,400
I have a map of Chengyu.

757
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,400
Let's check it.

758
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,400
We have searched everywhere

759
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,400
but we didn't find

760
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,400
the map that matches

761
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,400
the shape of the human skin.

762
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,400
Did we guess the wrong direction?

763
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,400
Xiaobao.

764
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,400
Dad.

765
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,400
You...

766
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,400
You took all the books

767
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,400
I collected carefully

768
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,400
and put them here.

769
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,400
Don't worry.

770
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,400
I will put them back

771
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,400
in a few days.

772
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,400
You...

773
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,400
I will think about it.

774
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,400
Why do you want the city map?

775
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,400
Mr. Wang.

776
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:07,420
Do you know this map?

777
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:08,420
This is the map

778
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,420
of the imperial city a hundred years ago.

779
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:07,420
The rain falls,

780
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:08,420
the sound is loud,

781
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:10,420
the sound is sweet.

782
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:14,420
I can't help feeling warm in my hands.

783
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:16,420
The wine is drunk,

784
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:18,420
the moon is in the sky.

785
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:21,420
The dust is like dust.

786
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,420
If I can't turn around

787
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:26,420
and I can't find the old film.

788
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:29,420
The broken glass is a blink of an eye.

789
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:34,420
The love is like a show.

790
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:38,440
I just hope we can meet and not be apart.

791
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,440
Life is too hasty.

792
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,440
I can't wait to see the old sky.

793
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,440
The rain is strong.

794
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,440
I want to change my life.

795
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,440
Life is too hasty.

796
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:57,440
I have experienced it in the long journey.

797
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:04,460
Who doesn't want to part with the story?

798
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:09,460
Life is too hasty.

799
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:12,460
I can't wait to see the old sky.

800
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:14,460
The rain is strong.

801
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,460
I want to change my life.

802
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:20,460
Life is too hasty.

803
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:25,460
I have experienced it in the long journey.

804
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:32,480
Who doesn't want to part with the story?
