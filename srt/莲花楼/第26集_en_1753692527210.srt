00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Ask

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
After four thousand times

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Thousands of times

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The most reluctant

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Is that moment

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Live in the world

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A thousand miles of madness

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who never wanders

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Who doesn't know the distance between the two worlds

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
On the edge of the cliff

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Live in the world

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
A thousand times

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The most reluctant

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Is that moment

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Live in the world

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
A thousand miles of madness

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Who never wanders

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Who doesn't know the distance between the two worlds

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
On the edge of the cliff

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Live in the world

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
A thousand miles of madness

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Who doesn't know the distance between the two worlds

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
On the edge of the cliff

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,700
The world is a dream

26
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,200
The world is a dream

27
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,800
The King of Blaze

28
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,000
Where are these people?

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,400
No matter who they are, they will leave

30
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,000
They leave after they finish fighting, but this is a hotel

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's been a mess here for years, is there no one to clean up?

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,500
So many people died here

33
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,500
There are so many talismans under the stairs, I dare not come in

34
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,500
There must be a ghost

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,300
This place is strange and creepy

36
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,300
Let's go

37
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,300
Wait

38
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,300
Wait, it seems to be a secret door

39
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,300
There are only three of us here

40
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,300
Why are there footprints here?

41
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,300
There really is a ghost

42
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,300
There is a ghost

43
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,300
I'm going to go to the next room

44
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,300
Go

45
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,300
What is it?

46
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,300
Go

47
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,300
Don't touch it

48
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,300
What is it?

49
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,300
I've never seen something like this

50
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,300
This is not an ordinary thing

51
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,300
That's right, both power and speed are not ordinary things

52
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,300
We have to be careful

53
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,300
Who are you?

54
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,300
We made a mistake

55
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,300
There is a ghost in here

56
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,300
We dare not come in

57
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,300
There really is a ghost

58
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,300
There really is a ghost

59
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,300
We saw that it was already very late

60
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,300
I wanted to take a night off

61
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,300
I didn't expect that there was a blackout here

62
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,300
It's really scary

63
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,300
Yes, yes

64
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,300
Many people died in this inn many years ago

65
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,300
You guys come out quickly

66
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,300
I am the elder of the village

67
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,300
All guests are guests

68
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,300
If you are hungry and sleepy, come to my house for a night

69
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,300
Then I'll disturb you

70
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,300
It's okay

71
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,300
Useless

72
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,300
A ghost who doesn't know martial arts

73
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,300
A little kid who can't kill a little kid in the martial arts world

74
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,300
What's the use of you?

75
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,300
Please punish me

76
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,300
Saintess, if there are only the two of them

77
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,300
We will never make a mistake

78
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,300
I didn't expect the Honorable Superior to be here

79
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,300
And help them

80
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,300
Honorable Superior

81
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,300
These days, I've been sending people to find his traces

82
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,300
Why is the Honorable Superior with them?

83
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,300
The Honorable Superior doesn't seem to know us

84
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,300
What did you say?

85
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,300
The Honorable Superior asked who we were

86
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,300
Who is he?

87
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,300
It's not kind to start

88
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,300
Is it Wu Xinhuai?

89
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,300
He lost his mind

90
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,300
That day, when the man in black dressed

91
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,300
Hit Wu Xinhuai

92
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,300
I feel wrong

93
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,300
Later, I sent people to find the trace of the Honorable Superior

94
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,300
I feel more uneasy

95
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,300
It seems that there is a problem

96
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,300
Where is the Saintess going?

97
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,300
I'm looking for you to settle

98
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,300
You lied to me

99
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,300
I'm not ordinary Wu Xinhuai

100
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,300
It's Zhichun Wu Xinhuai

101
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,300
You want to destroy him

102
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,300
So what?

103
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,300
If you dare to hurt him

104
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,300
I'll let you pay a price

105
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,300
The enemy is not only losing their memory

106
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,300
There is no major damage

107
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,300
Instead, you put the Luo Mo Tian Bing

108
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,300
Into the hands of others

109
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,300
This is the truth of our plan

110
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,300
Saintess, are you giving me an explanation?

111
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,300
It's just a moment of failure

112
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,300
I will solve it

113
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,300
I don't need you to worry

114
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,300
Okay, I don't worry

115
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,300
I came here this time

116
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,300
To give the Saintess a surprise

117
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,300
Do you want to know

118
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,300
The whereabouts of Li Xiangyi?

119
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,300
Li Xiangyi?

120
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,300
You have made great efforts

121
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,300
To find out the whereabouts of Li Xiangyi

122
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,300
And I sent the secret agents around Qiao Anmen

123
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,300
Recently, I sent back the news

124
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,300
In Qiao Anmen's body

125
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,300
The secret agent of Yangzhou Man

126
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,300
This secret agent was not there before

127
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,300
Since Qiao Anmen was poisoned by your ice-summoning

128
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,300
After being cured

129
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,300
It's inexplicably generated

130
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,300
Yangzhou Man

131
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,300
No

132
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,300
The ice-summoning in Qiao Anmen's body

133
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,300
It was obviously

134
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,300
Settled by Di Feisheng

135
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,300
Is it really Di Feisheng?

136
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,300
The poison of ice-summoning

137
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,300
In this world, only Yangzhou Man's secret agent

138
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,300
Can be dissolved

139
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,300
If it wasn't for Di Feisheng

140
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,300
The person who has been exposed to Qiao Anmen

141
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,300
Only one

142
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,300
Li Lianhua

143
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,300
It's really him

144
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,300
Li Lianhua

145
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,300
Is Li Xiangyi

146
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,300
Di Feisheng is still

147
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,300
Trying to cover up for them

148
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,300
I'm dedicated to him

149
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,300
I want to help him

150
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,300
To get rid of Li Xiangyi

151
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,300
He not only doesn't tell me anything

152
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,300
But also helps him to hide it from me

153
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,300
And lie to me

154
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,300
Little beauty

155
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,300
It seems that your means of

156
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,300
To win people's hearts are really ordinary

157
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,300
And what they are doing together now

158
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,300
You don't know

159
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,300
You are the saintess of the Golden Abyss Alliance

160
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,300
You are really perfect

161
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,300
You dare to come to me

162
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,300
If it wasn't for your master

163
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,300
You are already a dead person

164
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,300
Saintess, calm down

165
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,300
I'm sorry

166
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,300
Actually, I'm doing this

167
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,300
To think for you

168
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,300
Di Feisheng has found out

169
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,300
The reason we cooperated

170
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,300
He can't tolerate you

171
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,300
Now he's lost his memory

172
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,300
He won't keep an eye on us

173
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,300
And after you take him back

174
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,300
You can teach him

175
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,300
Master's order

176
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,300
The priority is to make sure

177
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,300
Is that person Li Xiangyi

178
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,300
Your master is just asking me

179
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,300
To cooperate with me

180
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,300
When will he order me

181
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,300
I will arrange my own things

182
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,300
Since you are his dog

183
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,300
Then go back and tell him

184
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,300
When I come back

185
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,300
I will settle the account with him

186
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,300
The people of the ten thousand lives

187
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,300
Are all yours

188
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,300
Thank you, master

189
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,300
Let us stay overnight tonight

190
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,300
No one has been in the village for many years

191
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,300
It's fate that the three of you are here

192
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,300
May I ask you

193
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,300
Have the villagers been living here?

194
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,300
It's been more than a hundred years

195
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,300
In order to avoid the war

196
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,300
The ancestors moved here

197
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,300
Until a foreigner entered a few decades ago

198
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,300
Our village

199
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,300
Only then did we get in touch with outsiders

200
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,300
Please

201
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,300
Please sit

202
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,300
This is the wild donkey meat we often eat in our village

203
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,300
I don't know if it suits your taste

204
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,300
I didn't expect the village to be so rich

205
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,300
Thank you for your kindness

206
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,300
It's just that I've been doing the ceremony recently

207
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,300
I heard

208
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,300
I heard that this high mountain wild donkey is very humane

209
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,300
I really can't bear it

210
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,300
I'd better not eat it

211
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,300
So that's it

212
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,300
If so

213
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,300
Then try our village

214
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,300
Soft and soft wine made with cold spring

215
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,300
Why don't you sit down?

216
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,300
Master Shi, to be honest

217
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,300
My two little brothers

218
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,300
Like me, they are all in Bigu

219
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,300
This beautiful wine and this delicious food

220
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,300
It's really not far

221
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,300
It turns out to be like this

222
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,300
Yes, it's a pity

223
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,300
Master Shi, you just said

224
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,300
This soft and soft wine

225
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,300
Is it the legend

226
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,300
The martial arts master can get a lot of energy after drinking it

227
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,300
Wine

228
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,300
Yes, a dozen years ago

229
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,300
People who are not willing to enter the village

230
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,300
Found that this soft and soft wine can increase the power

231
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,300
So

232
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,300
Many strangers came

233
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,300
But when they know

234
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,300
The wine that the factory brewed was brewed with the cold spring in the village

235
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,300
Then start to read the cold spring

236
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,300
Cut the fruit tree to make wine

237
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,300
The spring also cried and the tree was also cut off

238
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,300
The village was also made into a group

239
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,300
After they left

240
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,300
We blocked the road of the village

241
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,300
These years

242
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,300
Only the three of us are here today

243
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,300
No one has ever come here

244
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,300
Then this cold spring

245
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,300
I've been crying for so many years

246
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,300
Then where does this bottle come from?

247
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,300
After so many years

248
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,300
No one is grabbing this cold spring

249
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,300
So the spring water in the mountains

250
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,300
Gradually have some

251
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,300
The inn in the village

252
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,300
Was built for those Jianghu people

253
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,300
After they left

254
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,300
No one lived

255
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,300
So I was always panicking

256
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,300
It turns out to be like this

257
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,300
Master Shi, then this inn

258
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,300
What happened?

259
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,300
To be honest

260
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,300
Ten years ago

261
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,300
Jianghu people

262
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,300
In order to grab such a little cold spring

263
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,300
In the inn

264
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,300
It's bloody

265
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,300
It's been so long

266
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,300
No one cleaned up

267
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,300
There's a ghost in there

268
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,300
The villagers

269
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,300
Are going to clean up

270
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,300
But who knows overnight

271
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,300
The corpse is gone

272
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,300
It must be those people

273
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,300
They will hurt people

274
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,300
Dare not go in

275
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,300
This is actually the case

276
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,300
Fortunately, we left fast

277
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,300
By the way

278
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,300
Among those people who came here

279
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,300
There is one person who often wears a ghost mask

280
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,300
Dressed as King Yan and was called

281
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,300
People of the imperial family

282
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,300
Imperial family

283
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,300
There are too many Jianghu people

284
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,300
I can't remember

285
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,300
For so many years

286
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,300
Are you looking for someone?

287
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,300
That person is my little brother

288
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,300
All the way

289
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,300
An old senior who has been watching

290
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,300
He has never seen

291
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,300
Yes, I heard that Lianquan Senior

292
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,300
I also drank the soft tea here

293
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,300
I want to ask about his foot

294
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,300
By the way

295
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,300
Really can't help

296
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,300
It's getting late

297
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,300
Three of you rest early

298
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,300
I'll send you out of the village tomorrow morning

299
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,300
Thank you

300
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,300
Hungry

301
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,300
I'm a B-file

302
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,300
Isn't that a word?

303
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,300
This way

304
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,300
Don't you feel weird?

305
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,300
Yes, it's really weird

306
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,300
The villagers saw us and hid

307
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,300
No one saw

308
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,300
Now I have prepared such a rich meal

309
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,300
It's best to be touched

310
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,300
So I think

311
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,300
This must be a black shop

312
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,300
Not serious again

313
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,300
This black shop is not open in a place with people

314
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,300
Why do you open in the corner of the secret?

315
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,300
Fang Dongbin

316
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,300
Have you ever heard of it?

317
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,300
There are ten people living in the mountain

318
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,300
Special for eating people

319
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,300
The villagers here are not serious

320
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,300
No way

321
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,300
Let's go to the kitchen

322
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,300
There is nothing

323
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,300
Where is Ruoduo hiding?

324
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,300
Since there is a problem with the food in this village

325
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,300
You say

326
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,300
Will the owner of the imperial house eat the meat here?

327
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,300
Drink the wine here and be settled

328
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,300
I remember Su Xiaoyang said

329
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,300
Find out his last whereabouts

330
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,300
Is his stone temple

331
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,300
There will be no more news of him

332
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,300
Is it about this?

333
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,300
There were indeed many martial arts masters in that inn

334
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,300
There was also a fight

335
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,300
But I didn't find the power of the lotus

336
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,300
But I didn't find the traces of the martial arts

337
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,300
Maybe he didn't enter the inn

338
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,300
The inn is usually a short stop

339
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,300
If someone really

340
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,300
If there is a tree here to make wine

341
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,300
I'm afraid it will take a while

342
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,300
But when I entered the village this afternoon

343
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,300
Only villagers who live in the house this year

344
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,300
I didn't see any new houses built by foreigners

345
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,300
Is the elder talking nonsense again?

346
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,300
In fact, no one is willing to stay

347
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,300
Stay to grab the mountain spring wine

348
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,300
Why did he lie like this?

349
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,300
I've heard rumors in the world

350
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,300
This soft and long-lasting wine

351
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,300
But have you ever thought about it?

352
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,300
Really someone has drunk this wine

353
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,300
To this stone temple

354
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,300
Yes

355
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,300
There has always been a legend of soft and long-lasting wine in this world

356
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,300
But I never heard anyone buy it

357
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,300
If according to what the stone temple said

358
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,300
Many martial arts masters have been here

359
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,300
There should be a lot of people in the world

360
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,300
It's all about the bull

361
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,300
Soft and long-lasting wine

362
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,300
Can increase your inner strength

363
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,300
Where did it come from

364
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,300
Many people come unknowingly

365
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,300
But no one has ever believed it

366
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,300
I heard people say

367
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,300
Tianyin Gang sent disciples

368
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,300
Come to find this soft and long-lasting wine

369
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,300
But what happens next is not known

370
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,300
You think

371
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,300
People who came to this village are all gone

372
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,300
Where did they go

373
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,300
No, it's a little bit closer tonight

374
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,300
Can't sleep

375
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,300
I always keep my eyes on the strange environment

376
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,300
Hey, Fan Dongbin

377
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,300
I'll leave the night thing to you

378
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,300
I'll go to sleep first

379
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,300
Anyway, I can't do anything when I wake up

380
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,300
You can be smart

381
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,300
Wait

382
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,300
I see you in the inn

383
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,300
You can see the outside skills of the various sects

384
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,300
You have a good martial arts craft

385
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,300
Don't be modest

386
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,300
Stay and give me some advice

387
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,300
Maybe you can protect me

388
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,300
What martial arts secret skills did Brother Tao send?

389
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,300
Knife and sword

390
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,300
You pick a big day

391
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,300
I don't even let you hear it

392
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,300
But practice martial arts fighting

393
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,300
And protect everyone's safety

394
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,300
You are the best in this area

395
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,300
Don't scold me behind my back

396
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,300
Dead fox

397
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,300
I'm sorry

398
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,300
I'm sorry

399
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,300
I'm sorry

400
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,300
I'm sorry

401
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,300
I'm sorry

402
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,300
I'm sorry

403
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,300
I'm sorry

404
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,300
I'm sorry

405
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,300
I'm sorry

406
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,300
I'm sorry

407
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,300
I'm sorry

408
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,300
I'm sorry

409
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,300
I'm sorry

410
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,300
I'm sorry

411
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,300
I'm sorry

412
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,300
I'm sorry

413
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,300
I'm sorry

414
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,300
I'm sorry

415
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,300
To

416
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,300
Soak the water first

417
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,300
Can eat

418
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,300
Don't eat

419
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,300
Thank you

420
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,300
He knew how to pick it up

421
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,060
He doesn't care about people

422
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,460
It's better to be like this now

423
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,540
Don't touch things here

424
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,860
Thanks

425
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,740
Besides,

426
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,780
Allah gives more than an exterior

427
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,620
Human being who faces desconcern

428
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,540
A good man's nature

429
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,740
is not really bad

430
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,220
Maybe I must mention him

431
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,900
and re-build it

432
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,540
Fei

433
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,740
has any dream in your life?

434
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,500
Moi

435
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,580
Your dream is not a dream

436
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,860
You can be a hero who is admired by everyone

437
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,220
You can also be a demon who is known by everyone

438
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,460
Which one will you choose?

439
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,580
Not important

440
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,660
Then I will ask you another question

441
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,580
If someone accidentally offended you

442
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,500
What will you do?

443
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,500
Of course I will kill him

444
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,700
How can that be?

445
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,740
As the saying goes

446
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,380
A gentleman should not be too generous with others

447
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,900
Being generous is not enough to become famous

448
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,140
Being ignorant is not enough to

449
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,020
What do you want to say?

450
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,540
I just want to tell you

451
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,340
A man who knows martial arts is full of spirit

452
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,580
You can't kill people for selfish reasons

453
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,780
You should eliminate the strong and the weak

454
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,420
Eliminate

455
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,700
I know you once insulted Qi Tu

456
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,380
But people are so tender and innocent

457
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,260
In the end, you can change your confidence

458
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,180
If you don't listen, then don't listen

459
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,380
Why do you still hit people?

460
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,140
What smell?

461
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:20,940
It's a candle

462
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,060
Madam

463
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,820
The thing hidden in the candle

464
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:45,980
It's too late

465
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,180
The thread is in

466
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,100
It's Wu Xinhua

467
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,100
Are you okay?

468
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,500
How are you?

469
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,140
Madam

470
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,420
What is this?

471
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,900
I don't know

472
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:18,580
Scared

473
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,260
Who dare to make such akun?

474
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,220
Who the hell avoir done this?

475
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,060
dividing

476
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,220
It's a gossip

477
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,100
They all disappeared ten years ago

478
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,780
Can theин Tuihua legend

479
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,360
Beat her.

480
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,900
Li Xiangying

481
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,900
Li Xiangying

482
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,500
Li Xiangying

483
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,100
Li Lianhua

484
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,100
Li Lianhua

485
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,900
It's really her

486
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,900
Fang Dubing

487
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,100
You scared me just now

488
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,700
Fortunately, I hid in time

489
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,300
Just now, several monsters came over

490
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,700
Who are they?

491
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,900
Are you okay?

492
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,300
What's wrong with me?

493
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,100
No, you

494
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,300
What are you doing?

495
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:47,900
Don't touch it

496
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,900
Touch it

497
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,900
It's so strange

498
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,100
What's wrong with you?

499
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,300
I'm afraid something will happen to you

500
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,100
The candle is broken

501
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,100
Fortunately, you didn't light it

502
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,300
I and Fei

503
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,500
Fortunately, the white-clad hero helped us last time

504
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,500
White-clad hero?

505
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,300
What white-clad hero?

506
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:04,900
Yes

507
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,900
Have you seen

508
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,700
White-clad hero?

509
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,500
White-clad hero?

510
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,900
Just now, several monsters came over

511
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,100
I was so scared

512
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,700
I hid behind this door

513
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,300
I didn't dare to look at a ghost

514
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,900
You didn't come here earlier

515
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,300
That's it

516
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,500
When those people ran away just now

517
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,500
There was a scream

518
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,700
I'm afraid they are calling for companions

519
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,900
We'd better leave now

520
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,500
Have you seen the light in your eyes?

521
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,300
Nonsense

522
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,300
Do it

523
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,100
Do you think the white-clad hero will do it again?

524
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,300
Li Yunhuang, help me

525
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,300
Did I think wrong?

526
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,900
He can't even get a sword

527
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,300
It can't be the white-clad hero

528
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,900
I've been fighting for a long time

529
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,900
I can't help it

530
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,500
Li Yunhuang

531
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,500
Young Hero Lu

532
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,300
It's you

533
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,500
Kill all these monsters together

534
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,300
The blood is not good

535
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,500
Cover the wound

536
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,900
Their blood is more intense

537
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,300
Come here

538
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,500
Thank you for helping me just now

539
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,980
I went to Kunlun Sect to find him.

540
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,020
He hasn't heard from me for a month.

541
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,500
Since then,

542
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,500
I've been looking for Jin Xiong's whereabouts.

543
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,020
Was the old friend you missed

544
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,540
in the woman's house

545
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,940
Jin You Dao?

546
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,300
The day we agreed to fight

547
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,660
was today three years ago.

548
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,340
Since then, every year,

549
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,660
I'll come here to wait for him.

550
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,820
I believe

551
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,740
he won't break the promise.

552
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,820
Don't be so stubborn.

553
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,780
Qian Kun is a man of the law.

554
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,420
He has his own destiny.

555
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,060
But before I came here,

556
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,180
there were mountains nearby.

557
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,340
Today, I found

558
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,340
a path

559
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,340
that led to the mountain.

560
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,340
I felt strange, so I walked in

561
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,660
and found this village.

562
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,100
A sudden path?

563
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,180
I don't think it's a sudden path.

564
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,580
I'm afraid this village

565
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,500
has a path

566
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,820
that connects with the outside world.

567
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,980
It's not a place for the hidden world.

568
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,980
They still have Wu Xin Huai on their back.

569
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,620
Could it be

570
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,460
related to Nan Ying?

571
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,580
Nan Ying?

572
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,660
The one who killed Bai Yu Nian?

573
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,140
If that's the case,

574
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,100
it would be worse.

575
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,420
Lian Hua doesn't know

576
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,420
where she was taken to.

577
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,060
She can't even hold a sword.

578
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:45,980
She can't even

579
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,980
stop what happened.

580
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,900
I won't let anything happen to her.

581
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,620
Why are you suddenly

582
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,780
concerned about her safety?

583
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,460
She can't die anyway.

584
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,540
We made such a big move.

585
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,180
There's no one

586
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,060
who can react to this.

587
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,740
Could it be that these villagers

588
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,220
are hiding from these weirdos?

589
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,500
Kid, ask them.

590
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,900
It's dark. Don't run around.

591
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,860
No wonder they're so dark

592
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,820
that they can't go out.

593
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,700
They're hiding from these people.

594
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,780
These monsters are

595
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,540
the masters of the disappearances in the martial arts world.

596
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,580
They're all here.

597
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,020
The path of Jin You is also missing.

598
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,180
It's also related to this village

599
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,500
that I made an appointment with you.

600
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,820
The rooms in that place

601
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,700
are the traces of martial arts masters fighting.

602
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,380
It must be the moves of the person

603
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,340
who is awake

604
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,380
who didn't stay.

605
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,780
But those people

606
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,300
have obviously lost their minds.

607
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,300
Could it be that

608
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,660
they were led to this village

609
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,780
and got poisoned

610
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,740
or got infected

611
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,860
and ended up like this?

612
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,580
If that's the case,

613
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,980
did Jin You also find this path?

614
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,100
Oh, no.

615
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,860
It looks like Lotus Robe.

616
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,180
Since the people in the inn

617
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,500
who fight are all normal,

618
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,700
what happened?

619
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,620
The monsters I had with you

620
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,580
are the same as the people in the inn, right?

621
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,780
Let's go and check again.

622
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,460
We should be able to find some clues.

623
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,500
The path of the disappearances in the martial arts world

624
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,180
is really missing.

625
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,660
It seems that

626
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,180
there are so many talismans here.

627
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,540
The people who live here

628
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,620
are forced to use them

629
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,820
to catch the people who lost their minds.

630
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,380
Those people are half-blood,

631
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,020
and their moves are faster than human.

632
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,620
They are likely to be treated as ghosts.

633
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,300
Could it be that

634
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,100
the martial arts masters living here

635
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,940
were attacked by the martial arts masters

636
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,300
who had been here before

637
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,620
but had already lost their minds?

638
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,540
That's why such a cruel fight

639
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,540
is taking place here.

640
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,660
That means

641
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,660
there are more and more people

642
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,660
who are here.

643
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,300
That's why

644
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,300
the martial arts masters

645
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,300
are fighting here.

646
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,180
That's why

647
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,180
that means

648
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,580
there are more and more people who are here.

649
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,180
They are becoming monsters.

650
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:11,980
Lü Lian Hua once said

651
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,980
there are traces of Kunlun Sect's martial arts here.

652
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,140
It's him.

653
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,180
I recognize him.

654
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,580
The leader of Tian Wei and Zhang Kun.

655
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,660
This is really the only martial arts master

656
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,580
of Jin Xiong, Qian Kun.

657
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,180
He really came here.

658
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,940
Where is he now?

659
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,620
Brother Lu,

660
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,140
there is a rumor in the martial arts world

661
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,180
that you are a drinker.

662
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,780
Do you like drinking?

663
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:35,940
That's right.

664
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,300
But what does this have to do with it?

665
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,540
Have you ever heard of

666
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,260
the soft and smooth brewing of the Shishou Village?

667
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,380
You mean

668
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,980
this is the Shishou Village in the rumor?

669
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,620
What else?

670
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,020
I once talked to Jin Xiong

671
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,020
about this soft and smooth brewing.

672
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,380
Although I don't believe

673
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,980
that the wine can increase internal force,

674
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,180
I heard that this wine is brewed by the Qing Quan.

675
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,020
I think it must be delicious.

676
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,700
I've always wanted to taste it.

677
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,420
Brother Jin.

678
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,140
I'm here

679
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,980
to remind you

680
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,260
about the martial arts competition next month.

681
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,580
Next month,

682
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,180
the Bahuang Hunyuan Lake in Juhua Mountain

683
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,780
will be in full swing.

684
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,300
Bahuang Hunyuan Lake?

685
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,300
Why are we going there?

686
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,260
You'll know when we get there.

687
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,980
After the competition,

688
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,180
there will be something good for you.

689
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,380
Could it be

690
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,540
what Brother Qing said he would give me

691
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,220
is this soft and smooth brewing?

692
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,900
It seems that he is really going to give it to me.

693
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,900
I don't think so.

694
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,100
I think it's a good thing.

695
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,100
Soft and smooth brewing?

696
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,380
It seems that he is here

697
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:36,580
because of this soft and smooth brewing.

698
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,260
This soft and smooth brewing

699
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,420
is really a trick to lure people here.

700
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,980
No one has ever been here

701
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,580
to drink this wine.

702
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,060
It's because no one has been here.

703
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,060
I remember there was a secret door here before.

704
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,260
There must be something wrong with the secret room.

705
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,980
Maybe you can find some clues.

706
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,340
Oh, yeah, the secret room?

707
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,740
The futureMat80Kayu

708
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,260
sent to the Japanese intelligence agency

709
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,500
is not safe under Japanese control.

710
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,900
It can't be Congressman Nianqiao.

711
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,020
There is a switch over there.

712
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:30,060
Southern

713
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,540
I also found out that Brother Fang and Brother Li are best friends.

714
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:35,900
I didn't expect that they are also so in sync with Brother Fei.

715
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,140
I'm not familiar with him.

716
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,140
I'm not familiar with him either.

717
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,060
slit

718
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,560
One thousand slip

719
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,320
Standing up

720
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,060
Slip

721
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,620
Jiura

722
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,160
Jiura

723
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,780
Xiachi

724
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,380
Broken eyes

725
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,540
It is indeed Nan yi

726
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,340
Do not run with us.

727
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,340
Looks like followed by a headanairope.

728
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,900
The clothes are dirty.

729
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,740
No blood marks.

730
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,660
Besides, you should dress neatly.

731
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,180
And a splint of departing blood traces.

732
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,280
It removed itsiałem

733
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,280
What is this?

734
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,720
The ghost entered the room and stole the pen.

735
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,720
The last pen

736
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,360
doesn't seem to have the chance to be written.

737
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,080
This handwriting

738
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,080
is the same as the one in the room before.

739
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,680
It seems that this female corpse

740
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,080
was moved here.

741
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,880
But she's already dead.

742
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,080
Why did she still seal her body

743
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,280
and cut her head off

744
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,680
and hide her body here?

745
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,280
She's already dead.

746
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,680
Why did she still seal her body

747
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,880
and cut her head off

748
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,080
and hide her body here?

749
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,680
Where did her head go?

750
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,680
What kind of hard-to-read blood spell is this?

751
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,680
It's the monster from before.

752
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,880
Where did I seem to have seen this monster?

753
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,880
You're here.

754
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,880
I'm here.

755
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,880
I'm here.

756
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,680
Elder!

757
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,480
Elder!

758
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,680
Elder!

759
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,880
The messengers of Human Head God

760
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,080
only caught one

761
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,680
and didn't clean it up.

762
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,880
I didn't expect these people

763
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,680
to be so capable.

764
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,680
But don't worry.

765
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,680
The inn is the place of the Demon God.

766
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,080
You stayed there for so many years

767
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,880
just to lure these people in.

768
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,080
They've already prepared

769
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,280
Human Head God over there.

770
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,080
Once these people

771
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,880
get to Human Head God,

772
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,680
they'll become the messenger of Human Head God

773
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,280
just like those martial arts masters.

774
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,080
The Human Head God you're talking about

775
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,480
is this thing.

776
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,880
You're fine?

777
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,880
I'm fine.

778
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,680
What is this?

779
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,480
It's disgusting.

780
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,480
It's the human skull.

781
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,480
The black liquid on the ground

782
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,880
is these things.

783
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,280
A thorn?

784
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,880
Once a thorn is raised,

785
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,880
it will be used as a shield

786
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,280
to form various evil powers.

787
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,280
The people of South Ying are good at this.

788
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,880
So they cut off the head of the body

789
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,680
just to raise the thorn?

790
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,080
Thorn.

791
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,080
The evil body is marked.

792
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,280
This is indeed the evil tree of South Ying.

793
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,080
Could it be that they were attacked by this thing

794
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,280
and became monsters?

795
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,880
First, it was the Demon God's heavenly army.

796
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,880
The Night Fire Thorn.

797
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,080
Now, it's this kind of thing.

798
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,280
What on earth do the people of South Ying want?

799
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,280
No matter what, we have to find

800
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,480
those evil villagers

801
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,080
and save Li Lian Hua.

802
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,680
When those monsters attacked us,

803
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,680
they seemed to be

804
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,680
so desperate to cut off the head of the body.

805
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,680
It's also the human's way

806
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,080
to turn people into monsters.

807
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,680
Are they afraid of the head?

808
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,080
I know.

809
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,280
Do you remember the Eight Wilderness Lake?

810
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,880
We saw those shadow of the pit.

811
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,680
The monster stone shadow on the cliff?

812
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,680
Yes.

813
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,680
We always thought

814
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,680
it was just a stone that looked like a pit.

815
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,080
I suddenly want to understand one thing.

816
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,080
They want to attack us with monsters.

817
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,080
But these monsters

818
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,880
clearly can't tell us apart.

819
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,880
How do they ensure

820
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,080
that they won't be hurt?

821
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,480
They naturally hide.

822
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,080
And if they want to hide,

823
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,080
they hide in a place

824
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,880
where these monsters are afraid of.

825
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,480
It doesn't seem like a coincidence.

826
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,280
Those stones

827
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,480
are not some weird natural thing.

828
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,880
They are the heads of people

829
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,880
wrapped in mud

830
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,480
and laid on the cliff

831
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,880
to drive away monsters.

832
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,880
Yes.

833
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,880
They must be hiding around there.

834
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,480
You didn't get hit by the head.

835
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,520
Do you want us to become

836
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,680
a monster too?

837
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,880
You...

838
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,080
How dare you poison the head?

839
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,080
The head?

840
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,080
It's just that the body

841
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,280
is fed by you.

842
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,480
It's really stupid.

843
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,280
Go!

844
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,080
Get the head back!

845
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,680
Hurry up!

846
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,480
It seems that you are really afraid of being a monster.

847
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,080
If the messenger of the head of the head is found here,

848
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,880
he will definitely tear you apart.

849
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,080
Hurry up and release us!

850
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,080
Those of you who are the head of the head

851
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,680
are afraid of getting hit by these head-skeletons.

852
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,080
You won't come in, right?

853
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:02,680
Yes.

854
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,280
Speak!

855
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,680
Where is Li Lianhua?

856
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,680
What's the point of asking these now?

857
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,080
As long as the messenger of the head of the head

858
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,880
is caught, he won't live more than an hour.

859
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,880
I'm afraid that

860
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,680
he's been torn into pieces now.

861
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,280
You...

862
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,280
If you want to know

863
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,680
the location of the messenger of the head of the head,

864
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,680
just think about it!

865
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,080
If you don't say it,

866
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,680
I'll put this thing on your head

867
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,680
and be the messenger of the head of the head.

868
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,280
What do you think?

869
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,280
Wait!

870
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,280
Don't go any further!

871
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,680
Don't go any further!

872
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,880
Over there...

873
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,880
That's the sky pit and the ground.

874
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,080
It's where the messenger of the head of the head is made.

875
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,680
The messenger of the head of the head

876
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,280
is all piled up over there.

877
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,480
How do we control them?

878
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,480
This...

879
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,080
There's no way.

880
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,480
We can only wait until the sun rises and sets in the cave.

881
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,480
Then they will become incessant.

882
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,480
Otherwise...

883
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,080
Otherwise, there's no way.

884
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,080
There's no way.

885
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,080
There's no way.

886
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,080
There's no way.

887
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,080
There's no way.

888
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,680
Otherwise, there's no way.

889
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,880
Wait a little longer.

890
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,480
We can only wait until the sun rises and sets in the cave.

891
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,480
This is the cloth bag of the lotus.

892
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,480
If we go in there,

893
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,280
it will be more dangerous for the lotus.

894
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,880
Let's go!

895
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,080
Lian Lian Hua.

896
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,280
Lian Lian Hua, wake up.

897
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,080
Lian Lian Hua.

898
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,080
Why is there so much blood?

899
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,080
Don't be in trouble.

900
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,080
I still have a lot of things to ask you.

901
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,080
Lian Hua.

902
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,080
Don't die.

903
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,480
I still have a lot of things to ask you.

904
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,080
Stop arguing. I'm not dead yet.

905
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,480
I'm just sleepy.

906
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,680
You're actually fine.

907
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,080
You're asleep?

908
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,680
Why are you sleeping here?

909
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,280
Don't scream. Come on, help me up.

910
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,480
Where did you get so much blood?

911
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,280
I've dealt with so many monsters.

912
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,280
How can I not be angry?

913
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,680
Come on.

914
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,280
Help me up.

915
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,280
Thanks.

916
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,480
Thanks too.

917
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,080
What's wrong with your hand?

918
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,080
What's wrong with your hand?

919
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,280
You're so ugly.

920
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,680
If I knew you were fine,

921
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,080
who would save you?

922
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,280
Be careful.

923
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,080
Be careful.

924
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,080
Be careful.

925
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,080
Be careful.

926
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,080
Be careful.
