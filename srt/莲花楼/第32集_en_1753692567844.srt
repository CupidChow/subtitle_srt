YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Kissing myself thousands of times

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The most reluctant moment is that moment

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Live in the world, travel thousands of miles

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who doesn't wander around

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds and the moon on the cliff

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Live in the world, young youth

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,280
Feel no

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,280
The views before you

10
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,880
Live in the world, young youth

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,040
The view before you

12
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:26,740
Four

13
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:32,940
The journey to the end of the world is like a dream

14
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:38,940
The end of the world

15
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,940
Episode 16

16
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,940
I thought that the concept was different

17
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,340
and it wouldn't affect the brotherhood

18
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,540
but I didn't expect that he hated me so much

19
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,940
The descendant of Xuan Fei has been found by that man

20
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,340
Episode 16

21
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,340
It turns out that this Xuan Fei

22
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,340
has always wanted to restore Nan Yin

23
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,340
and has built such a powerful foundation

24
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,340
But this Shushifeng A'luo

25
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,340
didn't receive the son of Xuan Fei

26
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,340
The wealth of the restored Nan Yin

27
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,340
and the fallen soldiers

28
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,340
were all lost by the four of them

29
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,340
Maybe something happened at that time

30
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,340
But now, the descendant of Xuan Fei

31
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,340
has been found by the Nan Yin people

32
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,340
Otherwise, these people

33
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,340
wouldn't have appeared here

34
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,940
You mean

35
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,340
my father is the descendant of Xuan Fei

36
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,340
and Nan Yin is the blood of the royal family

37
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,740
There are other letters in this box

38
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,740
Open it and have a look

39
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,140
You are right

40
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,540
This Shushifeng A'luo

41
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,540
is very loyal to the whole family

42
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,540
They lost the whereabouts of Xuan Fei's son

43
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,540
but they still searched everywhere

44
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,540
Even if this Shushifeng A'luo

45
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,540
disappeared, his descendants

46
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,540
didn't stop looking for him

47
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,540
So in the end, they used

48
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,540
Xuan Fei's old mother and birth mother

49
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,540
to prove that the brother

50
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,540
is the descendant of Fang Ji Wang and Xuan Fei

51
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,540
and Wan Sheng Dao's Feng Qing

52
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,540
is the descendant of the Feng A'luo

53
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,540
Obviously, my father didn't object

54
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,540
but he and Wan Sheng Dao

55
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,540
secretly planned all this

56
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,540
Senior

57
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,540
You are hiding too much

58
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,540
Even though he is ambitious

59
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,540
he didn't expect

60
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,540
that he would die in the fire

61
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,540
All these plans

62
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,540
are still in vain

63
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,540
Maybe he has already calculated it

64
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,540
Fang Doubin

65
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,540
I want to open the coffin to examine the body

66
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,540
What's going on?

67
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,540
Why is it a skeleton?

68
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,540
Did the medicine light go out?

69
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,540
When we were looking for the body

70
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,540
we examined the body

71
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,540
and the body was also wearing this armor

72
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,540
The small finger on the right

73
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,540
was also broken in half

74
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,540
When we were in the chaos

75
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,540
we didn't know

76
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,540
If The Imperial Enchantment hunting was over

77
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,540
why did you bringeing a knife

78
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,540
into my room and事情

79
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,540
to solve the problem

80
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,540
What kind of story would it be?

81
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,540
I will tell you

82
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,540
Peopleed an alliance

83
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,540
with the Imperial Enchantent

84
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,540
Fe Wak clicking his finger

85
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,340
to defend Zhu Jin

86
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,040
to regret

87
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,640
But this little finger is cut off.

88
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,400
Isn't this my father's stone sea?

89
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,920
This is another person.

90
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,400
It's just that he was changed into the appearance of a senior

91
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,160
by the wrong step, peeling, and living.

92
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,240
This technique is extremely cruel.

93
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,560
Because he has a bad heart,

94
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,880
it's to reduce his pain.

95
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,280
So he didn't die at all.

96
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,520
After he got his identity,

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,200
he wanted to return to the south and conquer the world.

98
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,780
He wanted to cooperate with the court and then fight against the private

99
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,480
government.

100
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,360
But he never thought that you would firmly oppose the

101
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,440
government's involvement.

102
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,560
And he was found out by Liu Ru Qing when he was looking for

103
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,880
the hard-to-get benefits.

104
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,160
He was in a daze.

105
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,760
He just pretended to be dead.

106
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,360
He even expected that you would revenge for him.

107
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,160
So he colluded with Jiali Xiao early on.

108
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,080
He used his obsession with Di Feisheng,

109
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,480
which is a cup of tea and a batch of thunder,

110
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,160
to make the two big gangs in the world quickly surrender.

111
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,040
But he hid in the dark and took the power of the fish.

112
00:05:48,240 --> 00:06:04,060
This

113
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,640
power chose to learn this.

114
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,400
The secret weapon is very fast.

115
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,400
It's a pity that I have protective armor.

116
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,400
Shark Taunt, you really didn't die.

117
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,600
I let you guys escape.

118
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,400
The analysis is not bad.

119
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,000
I don't need to hide anymore.

120
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,400
It's very similar to what I dreamt.

121
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,400
What is the difference?

122
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,600
It's very similar to what I dreamt.

123
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,200
I'm already a handsome young man.

124
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,600
I still have a few of my old style.

125
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,400
Today, you and I, father and son,

126
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,400
should drink together.

127
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,000
Father and son.

128
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,200
When you were sorry for my biological mother,

129
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,600
when you saw me being weak and sick and abandoned me,

130
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,600
when you were my uncle,

131
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,200
have you ever thought about the father and son relationship?

132
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,000
I have.

133
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,200
I've been dead for so many years.

134
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,600
But now I'm here to be your relative.

135
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,600
What's your purpose?

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,800
A man should be a man.

137
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
You should be a man of your own.

138
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,800
You always think about what you can do.

139
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,000
For so many years,

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,800
Tianji Villa has taught you this?

141
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,000
Tianji Villa taught me to be a man of my own.

142
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,600
To be honest.

143
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm a traitor.

144
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm a traitor.

145
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,400
When you and Li Xiangyi

146
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,400
established the Su Gu Sect,

147
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,400
you said you wanted to establish a fair world.

148
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,000
What is the red line in your heart?

149
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,200
Is it the same as this?

150
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,800
You can't see the light and hide.

151
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,800
You're so cold and cold.

152
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,600
When the Su Gu Sect was

153
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,800
a time of great prosperity,

154
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,800
it was destroyed in my hands.

155
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,000
Li Xiangyi, who was arrogant and arrogant,

156
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,400
was also destroyed in my hands.

157
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,800
My former half

158
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,000
was with the brilliant Li Xiangyi.

159
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,600
Who cares about me?

160
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,400
Who has ever seen me?

161
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,400
Maybe one day,

162
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,200
someone will find me and tell me

163
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,400
that I have the blood of the South Night Emperor

164
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,600
and the Imperial Family.

165
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,200
I just realized

166
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,800
what the meaning and value of living is.

167
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,600
You asked me what I was planning.

168
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,800
What I was planning was something that should belong to me.

169
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,400
The dragon is in the abyss.

170
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,600
That's to gain strength.

171
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,400
Now it's time for the dragon to smile in the sky.

172
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,800
Everything is the will of the heavens.

173
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
Do you understand?

174
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,000
This place where thousands of people are surprised and no one is able to see the moon

175
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,400
is the place where I live.

176
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,400
Stop it.

177
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,000
What heaven?

178
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,400
It's just your own ambition.

179
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,600
Your crazy obsession

180
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,000
is only to kill the evil in this peaceful and stable world.

181
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,600
Why are you as stable as you were when you were a child?

182
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,000
You can't get anything.

183
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I should be the one to get back

184
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,800
the one I gave back.

185
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,200
You have to remember one thing.

186
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,200
You are my only family in this world.

187
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,000
You have my blood on you.

188
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,200
We are blood and flesh.

189
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,600
Think about it. When I achieve my ambition and take control of the world,

190
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,600
I will leave everything to you.

191
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,400
Don't you want that?

192
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,200
As long as you come back to me,

193
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,000
bring your Demon-Devouring Heavenly Army with you.

194
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,200
Let's find the last Demon-Devouring Heavenly Army together.

195
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,400
But I don't have the Demon-Devouring Heavenly Army.

196
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,400
You do.

197
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,400
I will never give it to you.

198
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,400
The King of Nan-Yin has been dead for a hundred years.

199
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,600
Now the world is peaceful. It's a blessing for all people.

200
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,400
I will never let you destroy everything.

201
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,200
You?

202
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,800
You should be glad that you have my blood on you.

203
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,200
I can't bear to kill you.

204
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Come back with me.

205
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,800
You are still so cautious.

206
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,600
It's been ten years.

207
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,000
You are still alive.

208
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,800
Shouldn't you find a place to celebrate?

209
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,400
I will.

210
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,800
Celebrate.

211
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,600
It's been ten years.

212
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,400
I've been looking for you for ten years.

213
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,200
Ten years.

214
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,000
I never thought that my junior

215
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,600
would look for me for ten years

216
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,600
so that he wouldn't ruin my good to you.

217
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,000
Li Xiangyi was deceived by someone.

218
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
He was deceived by someone you don't value for ten years.

219
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,000
Isn't that very sad?

220
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,600
I don't want to be deceived by someone.

221
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,000
I don't want to be deceived by someone.

222
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,200
I don't want to be deceived by someone.

223
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,600
What about my hands?

224
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,600
Let's go and show this aíng a close-up of what you left behind.

225
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
Hey, hey, hey, you.

226
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,200
Hey, what are you doing?

227
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,600
Let's go and show it to customers.

228
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,200
Let's go and show it to customers.

229
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,600
Go.

230
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,520
Why do I look so happy?

231
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,520
Ridiculous.

232
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,080
It's just that the ants bit the elephant's leg.

233
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,440
Is this worth the training?

234
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,600
Shut up.

235
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,600
You are my son. How can you speak for him?

236
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,720
He has nothing good to say.

237
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,040
He just came to flatter him.

238
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,280
No matter how powerful he is,

239
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,720
he lost to me.

240
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,960
He didn't even know that I played with him for ten years.

241
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,920
Li Xiangyu is just a joke.

242
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,640
Li Xiangyi

243
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,880
is indeed a joke.

244
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,280
If you really want to lose to him,

245
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,000
Li Xiangyi

246
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,120
has already lost to you.

247
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,920
Am I right?

248
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,920
Don't be stubborn anymore.

249
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,920
I'm not.

250
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,920
I'm not.

251
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,920
I'm not.

252
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,920
I'm not.

253
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,920
I'm not.

254
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,520
Don't be stubborn anymore.

255
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,960
Stop pretending to be a righteous man

256
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,920
and a hero.

257
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,640
You didn't even look back when you started the construction.

258
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,600
What's the point of winning you over?

259
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,320
I want everyone to be at my feet.

260
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,480
If you've made up your mind,

261
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,080
go to Wan Shengdao to find me.

262
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,080
Don't chase after him.

263
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,240
It turns out that everything he had speculated before

264
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,560
was true.

265
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,080
I don't know when

266
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,560
I've come this far.

267
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,880
Xiaobao,

268
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,160
if you hadn't come in,

269
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,880
you wouldn't have known this.

270
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,720
You think I regret it

271
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,280
and I regret it.

272
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,280
I regret it.

273
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,280
I regret it.

274
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,920
You think I regret it.

275
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,720
The clearer you see it,

276
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,520
the more you know what you should do.

277
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,840
I'm glad

278
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,600
I've seen everything clearly now.

279
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,880
This is the news I just received.

280
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,040
The wife of the Four-Head Immortal,

281
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,840
the Fairy of the Two Ways,

282
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,360
was locked in the Ninth Prison.

283
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,520
Di Feisheng took someone to break through yesterday.

284
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,600
Di Feisheng and Shan Gu Dao

285
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,280
must have gone after the last Luo Mo Tian soldier.

286
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,840
I didn't expect that Di Feisheng

287
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,880
was saved by you

288
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,720
and was released from prison.

289
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,920
He actually stared at the Luo Mo Cauldron.

290
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,720
He shouldn't have been interested in the Luo Mo Cauldron.

291
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,440
Maybe

292
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,560
I was wrong about his thoughts.

293
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,720
Anyway,

294
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,360
they have Luo Mo Cauldron

295
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,160
and the Three-Medium Heavenly Soldiers.

296
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,920
They will try their best

297
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,520
to get the Mei we have.

298
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,320
Young Master,

299
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,040
the owner of Tianji Villa has a letter

300
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,600
asking you to return to the villa immediately.

301
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,960
Ye Lianhua,

302
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,360
I'm in a hurry to take you back to Tianji Villa.

303
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,080
You said you gave the ice to your mother.

304
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,240
Did something happen?

305
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,960
You didn't find the Luo Mo Heavenly Soldiers

306
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,800
in the hands of the Four-Head Immortal?

307
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,800
The Four-Head Immortal was seriously injured

308
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,240
and died early.

309
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:39,960
Luo Mo Heavenly Soldiers

310
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,640
should have been kept in the hands of the Seven-Head Immortal and the Fairy of the Two Ways.

311
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,000
They were released from prison.

312
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,200
After the Qingzun died,

313
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,160
the Fairy of the Two Ways also disappeared.

314
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,000
But the strange thing is,

315
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,880
I found the whereabouts of the Fairy of the Two Ways

316
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,440
in the inn where Mr. Pi stayed.

317
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,160
The Fairy of the Two Ways is still alive?

318
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,560
Then where do you think

319
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,280
she hid herself

320
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,880
with the Luo Mo Heavenly Soldiers?

321
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,440
Mr. Pi was born in Tianji Hall.

322
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,960
Anyway, we're going to Tianji Villa.

323
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,440
Let's go.

324
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,240
Holy Lady.

325
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,160
You're too slow.

326
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,160
Holy Lady.

327
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,080
This is...

328
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,360
Is it scary?

329
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,200
Holy Lady.

330
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
Holy Lady.

331
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,200
Holy Lady.

332
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,200
Holy Lady.

333
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,200
Holy Lady.

334
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,200
Holy Lady.

335
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,200
Holy Lady.

336
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,760
Holy Lady.

337
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,400
Holy Lady.

338
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
Holy Lady.

339
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,520
Holy Lady.

340
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,440
Holy Lady.

341
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,320
Oh, my God.

342
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,620
Holy Lady.

343
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,360
Have you gathered all the people?

344
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,160
Thanks to you,

345
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,160
I've been training my own power secretly.

346
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,160
I'm looking forward to it.

347
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,160
I'm waiting for you.

348
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,160
Di Feisheng.

349
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,760
He loved me and wanted to kill me.

350
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,760
The game.

351
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,560
We should change the game.

352
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,960
You asked me to come back so hastily.

353
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,760
You said you had something important to do.

354
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,760
But...

355
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,360
You got married?

356
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,160
What?

357
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,960
Can't I?

358
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,360
What are you talking about?

359
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,760
Mr. Li.

360
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,560
You came back late.

361
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,960
You're not meant to be with Feng.

362
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,160
Chief He, stop joking.

363
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,960
Your marriage is so sudden.

364
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,760
I know what Feng thinks.

365
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,160
He still can't let go of Mr. Li.

366
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,760
He just knows he has no hope with Mr. Li.

367
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,360
He's just cold-hearted.

368
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,160
Don't take it to heart.

369
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,360
Feng is just like that.

370
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,560
He's a good man.

371
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,560
He comes and goes fast.

372
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,560
A few days ago, he found a young man

373
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,360
who was injured.

374
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,360
He's so handsome.

375
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,760
He fell in love with him after a few days.

376
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,560
He's going to be a man forever?

377
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,160
That's too fast.

378
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,560
He's a bit hasty.

379
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,760
But they're married.

380
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,960
They're in love.

381
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,760
They want to settle things as soon as possible.

382
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,160
They wanted to invite you to a wedding.

383
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,160
But Feng,

384
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,760
when he heard Mr. Li was coming,

385
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,360
he insisted on getting the wedding done.

386
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,760
He cares about Mr. Li.

387
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,560
So,

388
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,560
he insisted on getting the wedding done before it got dark.

389
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,960
He went to the bridal chamber.

390
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,960
He also said

391
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,560
he wanted me to bring Mr. Li.

392
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,360
With my aunt's temperament,

393
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,560
you must ask her.

394
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,760
You'll regret it.

395
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,960
And then tell her,

396
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,560
it's no use regretting it now.

397
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,960
Feng and I have a good relationship.

398
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,360
We can live together.

399
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,160
You know your aunt's temperament.

400
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,560
You're so straightforward.

401
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,760
By the way, mom,

402
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,360
actually, last night...

403
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,960
That young man is making a scene outside.

404
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,160
Get out of here.

405
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,360
Master, let me introduce you.

406
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,960
This is Xiaobao's good friend, Li Lianhua.

407
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,360
Greetings, Mr. Fang.

408
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,160
Look at you.

409
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,160
You're so arrogant.

410
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,360
You're so arrogant.

411
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,760
You're so arrogant.

412
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,160
What did you do?

413
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,360
Today, I...

414
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,560
What are you doing?

415
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,560
Let go of me.

416
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,560
Let go of me.

417
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,960
It's embarrassing.

418
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,760
I'm embarrassed.

419
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,760
I'm embarrassed.

420
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,760
I'm embarrassed.

421
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,160
I'm embarrassed.

422
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,160
Mr. Fang,

423
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,160
I've never been a good father to you.

424
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,160
But in my heart,

425
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,760
you're the best father.

426
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,960
Did you make trouble

427
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,760
outside?

428
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,560
You're here to sell your organs.

429
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,560
Listen,

430
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,560
don't make such a mess in front of me.

431
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,760
And

432
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,160
don't think about your marriage with the princess.

433
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,960
After your aunt's thing is done,

434
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,960
you'll be in charge of your own business.

435
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,560
You're so generous.

436
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,960
You can't avoid it.

437
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,560
Look. Look.

438
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,760
Mr. Fang is bullying me again.

439
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,560
I'm not tired of talking to the princess.

440
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,760
How many times have I told you?

441
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,560
Who's son

442
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,760
talks to his father like that?

443
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,560
He's so stubborn.

444
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,760
I can't stand it.

445
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,360
Madam.

446
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,360
Madam.

447
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,560
Why don't you care about your son?

448
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,760
Enough.

449
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,160
There's a guest.

450
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,360
Don't talk to him.

451
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,960
By the way,

452
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,760
the people from the Ministry of Works are here to congratulate you.

453
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,360
I've invited Xi Yan in.

454
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,560
Go and greet him.

455
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,960
Tell your mother to teach you a good lesson.

456
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,560
By the way, Bao.

457
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,760
Mr. Li.

458
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,160
I have an urgent matter to discuss.

459
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,960
Xiaofeng got married.

460
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,960
Tianji Villa sent out a wedding invitation a few days ago.

461
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,760
These days,

462
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,760
we've received gifts from friends from all sides.

463
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,160
I don't know who sent this gift box.

464
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,560
I saw it was the setting of

465
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,960
the old machine-gun box of Tianji Villa.

466
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,360
It caught my attention.

467
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,960
When I opened it,

468
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,360
I found a dragon demon ice ice.

469
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,560
It's exactly the same as the ice sheet

470
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,560
you asked me to keep.

471
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,160
Why is it empty?

472
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,760
How is that possible?

473
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,960
It was still there just now.

474
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,160
Chief He.

475
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,360
When did you see the ice sheet

476
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,560
being kept?

477
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,560
About half an hour ago.

478
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,960
I saw the ice sheet

479
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,760
and found it was here in time.

480
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,360
So I put it back in the box

481
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,360
and locked the machine-gun box.

482
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,160
Then I sent my bride and groom into the bridal chamber.

483
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,160
It was so fast

484
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,960
that it was gone.

485
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,160
It seems that the person who took the ice sheet

486
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,360
had a clear goal.

487
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,960
He came prepared.

488
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,960
There is only one way to Tianji Villa.

489
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,560
When we went up the mountain,

490
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,960
we didn't find anyone going down the mountain.

491
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,560
The person who stole the ice

492
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,960
was still in the villa.

493
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,160
Maybe he was among the guests.

494
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,360
Come on.

495
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:44,960
Come on.

496
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,960
Cheers.

497
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,760
Cheers.

498
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,560
Come on.

499
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,160
Cheers.

500
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,160
Come on.

501
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,960
Cheers.

502
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,560
Cheers.

503
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:55,960
Cheers.

504
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,560
Cheers.

505
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,160
So many guests.

506
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,560
It's hard to find anyone

507
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,760
who is suspicious

508
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,560
just by staring at them.

509
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,560
Chief He.

510
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,160
I wonder if there is a wedding banquet

511
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,360
with Zhu Xin?

512
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,960
What do you mean?

513
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,160
Since someone came for the ice sheet,

514
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,760
why not give her a surprise?

515
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,760
You want to use the ice sheet

516
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,760
that you gave my mother

517
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,960
to lure the snake out of the hole?

518
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,960
You guessed it right.

519
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,160
There are not many people who know about the ice sheet.

520
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,760
If you let it go,

521
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,560
the reaction of those who know it and don't know it

522
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,160
will be different.

523
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,560
Is it too risky?

524
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,560
Don't let it take away your stuff.

525
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,360
You're a bad boy.

526
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,360
You think our family is a place.

527
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,160
No matter what you are,

528
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,760
it's not easy to get out of the door

529
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,960
of Tianji Hall.

530
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,760
Thank you, Chief He.

531
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,560
Okay.

532
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,160
Just in case,

533
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,360
I'll invite the guard to come here.

534
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,560
Who is this guard?

535
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,560
He even asked your mother to invite him.

536
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,360
He's just a weird guy.

537
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,360
But Wu Hong is quite good.

538
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,760
My aunt came in a lot of years ago.

539
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,560
Except my aunt,

540
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,360
the others don't really care about it.

541
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,960
You'll know when you get there.

542
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,560
Let's go.

543
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,360
Guard.

544
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,960
Don't stay in the sky.

545
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,760
Come down.

546
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,960
My mother wants to see you.

547
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,760
I'll go with you.

548
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,760
Okay.

549
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,560
Let's go.

550
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,160
Your arms are a little big.

551
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,160
You'll get used to it.

552
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,760
Let me introduce.

553
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,560
This is Li Shen Yi, the owner of Lotus Tower.

554
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,560
Nice to meet you.

555
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,960
Guard Zhan, nice to meet you.

556
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,960
I'm Li Lian Hua.

557
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,160
Zhan Yunfei.

558
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,760
That's the general situation.

559
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,160
We'll take out a treasure

560
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,160
and lure out the thief.

561
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,560
To make sure there's no problem,

562
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,560
we need you to take care of the mountain villa.

563
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,360
Okay.

564
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,160
Guard Zhan,

565
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,160
I'm a little curious.

566
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,960
You are so good at martial arts.

567
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,160
Why did you stay in Tianqi Villa as a guard?

568
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,360
It's all my sister's fault.

569
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,960
She made a bet with Guard Zhan.

570
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,760
But Guard Zhan lost by accident.

571
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,560
So she kept her promise and stayed in the villa.

572
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:54,960
A bet?

573
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,760
Oh.

574
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,960
Guard Zhan is a famous martial artist.

575
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,360
How could he lose to the second hall master?

576
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,760
I was injured.

577
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,760
I did lose.

578
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,560
I was saved by the second hall master.

579
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,760
Goodbye.

580
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,960
Everyone.

581
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,760
Today is my sister's wedding day.

582
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,360
Thank you for coming.

583
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,360
I heard that you are very interested in

584
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,560
the treasures in Tianqi Villa.

585
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,960
So I have someone to pick some for you.

586
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,960
I hope you can enjoy it with me.

587
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,160
Please give us your advice.

588
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,560
Okay.

589
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,560
So kind of you.

590
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,360
Okay.

591
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,760
Let's see the first one.

592
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,960
Good stuff.

593
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,760
It's really good stuff.

594
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,960
It's really good.

595
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,560
It's the Night Pearl of Qionghai.

596
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,760
It's said that the Night Pearl

597
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,360
is drawn by the eyes of the Heaven Fairy.

598
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,560
It can be found in the night.

599
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,360
It's really good stuff.

600
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,960
What's this?

601
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,960
What's this?

602
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,960
The next treasure

603
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,760
is a ice sheet

604
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,760
from the luck of Tianqi Villa.

605
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,760
What's this?

606
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,760
What's this?

607
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,760
I didn't know.

608
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,160
What's this?

609
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,160
What's this?

610
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,560
Listen to me.

611
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,760
Don't look at this ice sheet.

612
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,160
It can make you feel good.

613
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,160
There are also

614
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,760
the words of the Southern Kingdom

615
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,160
which have been destroyed for years.

616
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,760
I don't know what it is.

617
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,960
It's a rare item.

618
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,960
It's really rare.

619
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,360
Do you see it?

620
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,360
Who is the most calm person?

621
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,360
The boss of Ruyi Money Store.

622
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,960
His name is Xing Ziruo.

623
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,560
You have some business

624
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,760
with us in Tianqi Villa.

625
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,760
By the way,

626
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,760
the person who recommended my mother

627
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,760
to buy a house in Xiaoyuan City last time

628
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,760
is him.

629
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:19,960
What?

630
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,160
Is there a problem?

631
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,760
Think about it.

632
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,960
He is involved in Xiaoyuan City.

633
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,760
This time,

634
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,760
he is involved in the loss of Luo Mo Tian Ting.

635
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,360
I'm afraid it's not so coincidental.

636
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,160
Boss Xing.

637
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,960
Why are you here alone?

638
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,360
Why don't you go in and drink?

639
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,760
I'm not good at drinking.

640
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,960
I came out to have a look.

641
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,560
I see.

642
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,160
Go and make some good tea.

643
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
Yes.

644
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,360
How about inviting Boss Xing to come in

645
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,760
and taste my new tea this year?

646
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,960
I'm honored.

647
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,360
Please.

648
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,760
Please.

649
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,760
Thank you.

650
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,760
Thank you.

651
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,760
Thank you.

652
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,760
Please.

653
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,360
Don't worry.

654
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,960
My mother's tea is unbeatable.

655
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,960
Let's split it.

656
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,160
Are you arranging theelastic Asian class for another wife this time?

657
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,560
I'm interested.

658
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,760
I didn't see Tian Bin.

659
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,560
There is nothing wrong with the room.

660
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,960
Is he having Tian Bin along the way?

661
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,360
typical of woman.

662
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,360
Xing Ziru is a rough guy.

663
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,360
But he's also a ambiguous person

664
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,760
who didn't expect it.

665
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,120
Xing Ziru couldn't have fooled you

666
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,920
by seeing Luo Mo's eyes.

667
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,160
If he came to Tian Bing,

668
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,840
and saw another one,

669
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,240
he must have tried his best to get it.

670
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,560
How could he turn around and leave

671
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,240
instead of

672
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,040
staring at the place where Tian Bing is?

673
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,000
Tianji Villa is guarded by the villagers.

674
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,360
If you're a bad guy,

675
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,920
and want to take something away,

676
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,120
tell me,

677
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,120
do you need any help?

678
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,440
Are you suspecting that he has a mole?

679
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,240
I'll tell the village head

680
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,880
to kill Xing Ziru.

681
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,200
He must be punished

682
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,280
and be buried alive.

683
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,880
Okay, I'll leave it to you.

684
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,880
Over the years,

685
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,640
I still can't stand your

686
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,360
being unkind.

687
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,840
Bro Zhan,

688
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,840
I feel sorry for you.

689
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,080
Even if I have to follow things around,

690
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,840
I must get신 your support.

691
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,880
Do you like to target people?

692
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,440
I'm a little tired,

693
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,600
Brother Zhan, how are you?

694
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,000
You're doing great now.

695
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
You're not bad.

696
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,880
It would be better if you could tie your hair up.

697
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:02,240
I'll do as my old friend says.

698
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,880
But looking at you,

699
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,880
if you have a girl you love, how can she be with you?

700
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,040
Aren't you watching Luo Mo?

701
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,880
Yes.

702
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,440
I've already collected it and asked someone to take care of it.

703
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,880
There won't be any problem.

704
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,120
Xie Lang,

705
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,040
that one who was a man of his own,

706
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,800
who was a wanderer,

707
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,120
now,

708
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,400
he's willing to stay in this heaven and earth.

709
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,520
He's really a big bet.

710
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,400
Hey, who's the groom?

711
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,040
A young man.

712
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,560
His name is Wei Qingchou.

713
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,520
He was injured in the mountains not long ago.

714
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,160
He was rescued by the Second Master.

715
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,400
He seems like a man of his own.

716
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,840
He's just a man of his own with poor martial arts.

717
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,760
He's useless except for his looks.

718
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,920
He doesn't deserve the Second Master.

719
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,560
Then why are you...

720
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,880
The Second Master's love is the most important.

721
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,760
Fine.

722
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,200
Do you want to drink a few glasses?

723
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,680
No.

724
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,280
I didn't expect to see you again.

725
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,080
I'm very happy.

726
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,360
You really know Zhan Yunfei?

727
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,520
He's an old friend.

728
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,200
Which old friend?

729
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,160
The one who beat up Di Feisheng?

730
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,520
Or the one who showed Li Chenyin

731
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,200
the way to beat up and hurt people?

732
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,560
You have to tell me in advance.

733
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,960
I have to figure out the situation

734
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,160
and hide away in advance.

735
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,440
Zuo Xiaobao,

736
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,160
this tea is good.

737
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,600
You're late.

738
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,760
Do you want to hear the story?

739
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,080
Pour a cup of tea.

740
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,840
Thanks.

741
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,400
Drink it first.

742
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,120
This is the story.

743
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,200
Zhan Yunfei and others

744
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,600
joined hands

745
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,560
and broke the Lianhai Gang.

746
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,640
The leader, Jiang Dafei,

747
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,120
wanted to kidnap Jiang Dafei to Yanzhou,

748
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,360
but he missed a rope.

749
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,640
So,

750
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,920
someone wanted to borrow

751
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,280
something from Zhan Yunfei.

752
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,400
What is it?

753
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,680
Headband.

754
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,760
Zhan Yunfei used headband?

755
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,720
He never combed his hair.

756
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,560
This guy not only loves to comb his hair,

757
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,320
but also cares about it.

758
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,400
But this guy

759
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,800
is a little stubborn.

760
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,440
He doesn't want to see me off.

761
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,320
And then?

762
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,840
And then...

763
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,400
What did you say?

764
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,480
Take your headband and bet.

765
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,400
Whoever loses

766
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,040
will never comb his hair again.

767
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,480
Then this headband

768
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,640
is mine.

769
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,280
I admit.

770
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,040
I admit defeat.

771
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,240
A man's promise

772
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,760
is never a lie.

773
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,200
I won't comb my hair again.

774
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,520
Then it's better to tie this headband

775
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,240
with this hair.

776
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,920
So Zhan Yunfei never combed his hair

777
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,640
because he bet with you.

778
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,400
Li Xiangyi was so boring back then.

779
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,720
How dare you say that?

780
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,840
It's not the same as you.

781
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,600
The youth is too weak.

782
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,880
They all compete with me.

783
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,440
They are all trying to trick me.

784
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,680
Wasting your inner power

785
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,320
is not important.

786
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,040
But Li Xiangyi didn't expect

787
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,720
that he had died for so many years.

788
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,920
Zhan Yunfei still

789
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,520
keeps his promise.

790
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,080
He's really a fool.

791
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:04,840
Yes.

792
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,080
He's a man who always bet and always lose.

793
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,000
Yes.

794
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,720
But he did lose

795
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,200
to Li Xiangyi.

796
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,040
But to your aunt,

797
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,080
I don't know.

798
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,080
He...

799
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,440
To my aunt?

800
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,440
Young Master.

801
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,000
Young Master.

802
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,040
I've checked.

803
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,880
The 17 people who contacted Xing Ziru and Zheng Wan

804
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,400
are all local merchants.

805
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,400
They've been in contact with us for many years.

806
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,120
It's not a problem.

807
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,480
What else did you do

808
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,720
besides talking with the guests?

809
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,400
I went out to take a breath

810
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,080
when I was in contact with people.

811
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,640
I went to the courtyard

812
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,800
to play chess.

813
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,480
I played it myself.

814
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,680
I played it myself.

815
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,960
Chess?

816
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,400
I don't know how to play chess.

817
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,560
But I've been trained in Tianji Hall.

818
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,480
I won't remember

819
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,400
what I've seen.

820
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,520
A few of my men

821
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,960
followed Xing Ziru

822
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,720
and saw him playing chess.

823
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,440
He went back to his room

824
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,440
after playing for a million times.

825
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,680
He didn't come out again.

826
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,160
Keep watching Xing Ziru.

827
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:12,460
Don't disturb the

828
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,000
gold snake.

829
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,280
Look.

830
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,280
This is the map of Shangqing.

831
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,600
This is the map of the four fairies of the Chendu Prefecture.

832
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,440
This is the map of Baozhen.

833
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,880
This is the map of Jinming.

834
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,080
Minister Fang

835
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,040
really doesn't care about

836
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,040
your son.

837
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,120
I'm not good at

838
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,120
playing chess.

839
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,640
My father taught me

840
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,120
with great care when I was a kid.

841
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,440
But I was still young

842
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,440
and I was against him everywhere.

843
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,040
Now I think

844
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,280
it's lucky.

845
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,600
Minister Fang,

846
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,440
you've grown up.

847
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,480
Take a good look.

848
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,760
What do you think of

849
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,640
chess?

850
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,320
I don't have a clue about the war.

851
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,360
But the dragon demon Tian Bin is still in charge.

852
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,680
Xing Ziru is still

853
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,640
in the mood to play chess.

854
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,800
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

855
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,040
You study the chess book first.

856
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,240
I'll go to Liangjing to find clues.

857
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,880
I poisoned.

858
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,840
Didn't I ruin other people's Impermanence?

859
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,720
I have to

860
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,520
go back

861
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,480
as soon as possible.

862
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,040
I've got to go back

863
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,480
The blood!

864
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,280
Come and help!

865
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,080
The blood!

866
00:39:59,080 --> 00:39:59,920
There's blood!

867
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,960
Li Lianhua,

868
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,120
something happened to the bride.

869
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,640
Father, mother.

870
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,040
What happened to the bride?

871
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,760
Father, mother.

872
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,960
Father, mother.

873
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,760
Father, mother.

874
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,480
Father, mother.

875
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,000
Father, mother.

876
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,640
Father, mother.

877
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,360
Father, mother.

878
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,400
Young Master,

879
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,920
Young Master, you scared me to death.

880
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,280
Last night, the groom was in trouble.

881
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,400
His corpse was also missing.

882
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,400
Now, there's only one body left.

883
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,160
Xiaobao,

884
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,760
aren't you a detective?

885
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,920
This time, you must help me find the murderer

886
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,440
and get justice for my dead husband.

887
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,960
Miss He,

888
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,240
how do you know

889
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,080
that this body is the groom's?

890
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,080
When Prince Wei was injured,

891
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,360
I saw him when he was taking the medicine.

892
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,720
On his back,

893
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,400
there's a tattoo of the tattoo.

894
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,040
I feel sorry for my husband.

895
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,880
He died in a bad accident

896
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,880
on his wedding night.

897
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,960
There's only this body left.

898
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,040
A living person must see a dead person.

899
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,880
The groom is not a water statue.

900
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,560
How could he disappear in the air?

901
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,800
The back and clothes are all intact.

902
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,320
There's no traces of the corpse.

903
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,720
It doesn't look like a water statue.

904
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,120
Miss He,

905
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,200
do you remember

906
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,280
what happened last night?

907
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,240
Last night...

908
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,640
Don't worry.

909
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,960
Tell us about it.

910
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,840
Last night,

911
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,680
after the wedding ceremony,

912
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,680
I went back to the yard.

913
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,520
It was still early today.

914
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,040
We sat in the yard for a while.

915
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,200
At the end of the night,

916
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,960
we went back to the room

917
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,360
and drank the wine.

918
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,800
I felt a little sleepy.

919
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,800
Wei Lang helped me to get up and rest.

920
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,200
I didn't know anything after that.

921
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,560
When I woke up,

922
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,560
I saw him become

923
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,400
a human skin.

924
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,520
You felt sleepy after drinking the wine?

925
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,760
Aunt,

926
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,960
think about it.

927
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,160
Is there anything suspicious?

928
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,600
Something suspicious?

929
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,800
Dejile of Flip Wow and

930
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,040
Immortal Shang Yu Jing.

931
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,960
I've never heard

932
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,720
Wei Lang love poems before.

933
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,720
Me, neither.

934
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,240
the incident happened tens of thousands of years ago.

935
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,360
The Demon Lord.

936
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,560
The Soul Stealer Holder.

937
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,800
The patterns on the Soul Stealer

938
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,400
don't seem to be ordinary.

939
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,760
What meaning does it have?

940
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,800
I think

941
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,800
this groom's DUO is strange.

942
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,880
Strange?

943
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,360
It's certain that

944
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,240
no one else

945
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,320
in Tianji Villa

946
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,520
has killed or been attacked.

947
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,520
So,

948
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,560
the murderer came for Wei Qingchou?

949
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,080
After he killed the person,

950
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,440
he took the body away?

951
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,200
Impossible.

952
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,840
After I sent the treasure back last night,

953
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,080
the second hall master and the two of them

954
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,760
even sent me a box of wedding candies.

955
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:39,720
After that,

956
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,120
no one else

957
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,240
entered the letter room.

958
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:43,880
Otherwise,

959
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,800
I can't escape.

960
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,480
Here.

961
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:50,960
So that means

962
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,160
Wei Qingchou

963
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,320
died after

964
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,560
Vai��라 came as he returned.

965
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,640
But I

966
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,720
stayed

967
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,880
in the room

968
00:43:59,200 --> 00:43:59,720
the whole night.

969
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,320
Then the murderer

970
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,720
couldn't have entered through here.

971
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,720
The cell behind the window

972
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,040
caused Hast ella.

973
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,600
profanitiesㅎㅎ

974
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:07,800
Tian microphone

975
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,600
seems to be very well-known.

976
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,600
Perhaps

977
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,200
there are other

978
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,160
machines here?

979
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,640
The small building

980
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,360
It's just a normal place.

981
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,040
There's nothing else.

982
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,760
Where's the body?

983
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,800
Only a human skin was left here.

984
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,680
If the murderer killed Wei Qingchong

985
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,200
for the human skin,

986
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,960
why didn't he take it away?

987
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:30,640
Madam,

988
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,920
I'm sure Third Sister is frightened.

989
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,000
Why don't you go to another place and rest?

990
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,120
Leave this to me.

991
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:38,640
All right.

992
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,120
Li,

993
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,360
you've been serving outside the door

994
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,640
since last night.

995
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,040
Then you should stay.

996
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,720
Yes, Young Master.

997
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,720
Yes.

998
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,160
Let's go.

999
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,760
What are you thinking?

1000
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,120
Since no one went out all night,

1001
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,040
the murderer and the body

1002
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,720
may not have left at all.

1003
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,840
The love story of the past life.

1004
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:52,200
Who doesn't want to tell the story?

1005
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,800
Let's go.

1006
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,480
People live in the past.

1007
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,320
They can't wait to see the old days.

1008
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,800
The day will come again.

1009
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,800
The wish will come true.

1010
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,640
People live in the past.

1011
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:16,760
The love story of the past life.

1012
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,800
Who doesn't want to tell the story?

1013
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,560
Let's go.
