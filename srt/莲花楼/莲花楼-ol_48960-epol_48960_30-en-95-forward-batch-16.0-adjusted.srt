[Episode 30]

4
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,420
I thought about it.

5
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,770
Since I'm already on the blade list,

6
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,789
there's no point in hiding.

7
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,600
So,

8
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,170
you're here to turn yourself in?

9
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,229
I don't seem to have any other option.

10
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,550
Why don't we continue to work together as a team?

11
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:11,990
Work together?

12
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,400
We agreed that we'd let each other know when we find clues.

13
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,530
Why did you go alone?

14
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,670
What were you up to?

15
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:18,920
Cut it out.

16
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,180
Or I'll change my mind.

17
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:20,940
Fine.

18
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,400
This is it?

19
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,930
Why didn't you send me to prison?

20
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,480
You're so delicate, Young Master Li.

21
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,740
How can I mistreat you?

22
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,650
There must be something behind this weird situation.

23
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,090
You want to be sent to prison,

24
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,620
but I'd rather have you kept in this woodshed.

25
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,150
Have you figured out who the doctor's accomplice is after interrogation?

26
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:49,880
How about you

27
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,150
let me see him?

28
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,650
Maybe I can pry some clues out of him.

29
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:54,460
No need.

30
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,820
Detectives will handle the case.

31
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,000
You're here to turn yourself in.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,930
So just be a prisoner as you should.

33
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,300
Young Master Li.

34
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,310
Would you like some tea?

35
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:02,820
No, thanks.

36
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,820
I can do it myself.

37
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,170
Fang Xiaobao.

38
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,850
What's wrong with you?

39
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,090
How can you let Young Master Li stay in the woodshed?

40
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,640
Invite him to the superior guest room now.

41
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,100
Mother.

42
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,730
He's turning himself in.

43
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,390
I only did things as he wishes.

44
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,160
What nonsense are you talking about?

45
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,240
You're getting more and more ridiculous.

46
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,770
Young Master Li.

47
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:20,330
Ignore him.

48
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,850
-This way, please./N-Mother.

49
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,580
Don't worry.

50
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,550
I won't do anything to him.

51
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:25,850
I just want to

52
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,830
ask him something face to face.

53
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,930
Don't worry, Master He.

54
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,100
As friends, we have to solve the problem between us.

55
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,970
You've really grown up.

56
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,100
You've grown out of my control.

57
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,250
Still, Fang Xiaobao.

58
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,180
I'm telling you.

59
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,010
The martial world is dangerous.

60
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,540
It's not easy to make a real friend.

61
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,140
There's no need to make it so serious.

62
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,950
Ask me what you want to know.

63
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,300
I just want to ask you three questions.

64
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,170
First.

65
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,090
Why didn't you burn the smoke that day,

66
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,280
and went after Lian Quan alone instead?

67
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,740
Second.

68
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,440
Why did you come to turn yourself in today?

69
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:17,940
Third.

70
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,780
Why did you suddenly show yourself

71
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,270
after having endured for ten years?

72
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,650
Don't speak.

73
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,930
I don't want to hear your explanation now.

74
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,090
Come find me

75
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,940
when you come to your senses

76
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,220
and would like to tell me the truth.

77
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,260
Keep an eye on him.

78
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,060
Let me know if anything happens.

79
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:41,480
Yes.

80
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:48,890
Young Master.

81
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,950
Li Lianhua asked me to tell you

82
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,300
that he's injured.

83
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,659
What kind of injury?

84
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,780
I don't know.

85
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,030
Anyway, he said

86
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,240
he was injured accidentally,

87
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,320
and he can't lift his hands,

88
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,580
so he needs to be taken care of.

89
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,659
Tell that old fox

90
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,300
to stop playing tricks.

91
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:04,900
Yes.

92
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,970
Could it be an internal injury?

93
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,180
What is this?

94
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,480
It was burned by a candle just now.

95
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,530
Is this what you meant by "being accidentally injured",

96
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,380
"can't lift my hands",

97
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,370
and "need to be taken care of"?

98
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,490
It really hurts.

99
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,600
You get mad so easily.

100
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:35,830
Fang Duobing.

101
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,820
I'm hungry.

102
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,590
Get me some food first.

103
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,330
Didn't you say your chef is pretty good?

104
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,760
Let me see.

105
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,150
My chef doesn't cook for prisoners.

106
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,420
Then get me a quilt.

107
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,340
This room is cold at night.

108
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,290
The cold toxin inside my body may take effect anytime.

109
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,440
It's hard to bear.

110
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,920
What you have is a heart disease, right?

111
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,850
What cold toxin?

112
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,240
Sect Leader Li, your Yangzhouman is invincible.

113
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,040
Stop playing this kind of trick.

114
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,430
Anyone?

115
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,520
Give me a pot of warm wine.

116
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,960
Give me a pot of warm wine.

117
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,670
Young Master.

118
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,240
Where is he hurt this time?

119
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,810
Li Lianhua doesn't seem to be pretending this time.

120
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,140
He seems to be truly ill.

121
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,659
How are you?

122
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,840
Li.

123
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,010
Go get some blankets.

124
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:02,490
Yes.

125
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:09,690
Come on.

126
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,890
Careful, it's hot.

127
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:20,970
Drink slowly.

128
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,450
Li Lianhua, you're awake.

129
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:58,070
What is it about the cold toxin inside your body?

130
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,340
Why couldn't Yangzhouman suppress it?

131
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,080
Slowly.

132
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,050
Yangzhouman consumes too much inner power.

133
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,470
I have the warm wine

134
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,900
and the quilt you sent me.

135
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,970
Come to think of it,

136
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,050
you'd be okay anyway, right?

137
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:49,720
Fang Duobing.

138
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,890
What trick are you trying to play this time?

139
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,150
About the three questions you asked.

140
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,179
The first one is easy to answer.

141
00:08:58,409 --> 00:08:59,940
I'll answer that one first.

142
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,330
I didn't burn the smoke that day

143
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,370
because I knew how powerful Bizhong Strike is.

144
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,280
You're fast.

145
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,180
If you met Lian Quan first,

146
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,990
you'd have been taken advantage of.

147
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,200
What about the other two questions?

148
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,890
I'll let you know

149
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,310
the answers to them later.

150
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,550
Let me tell you a story.

151
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,170
The story of

152
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,720
a pair of fellow apprentices who only have each other.

153
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,900
This pair of fellow apprentices have been street beggars since their childhood.

154
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,540
They were lucky to meet Master,

155
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,490
and they started learning martial arts.

156
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,650
Time flies.

157
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,330
In the blink of an eye,

158
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,010
the junior turned 15.

159
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,950
He was on his first trip down the mountain with his senior

160
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,440
when he encountered the massacre of the He family of the Changma Blade Sect.

161
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,980
[He's Residence]

162
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,040
The He family took the low road to make their fortune.

163
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,120
-It's been years since they retreated from the martial world./N-Father!

164
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,340
There hadn't been many people giving them trouble.

165
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:14,860
Father!

166
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:16,290
Father!

167
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,490
-But not long ago.../N-Wake up, Father!

168
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,920
There were rumors that there was a piece of cloud iron in their household

169
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,280
which had spread throughout the martial world.

170
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,790
Many people coveted it.

171
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:28,240
When that pair of fellow apprentices arrived at He's Residence,

172
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,570
only the father and the son of the He family were still alive.

173
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,580
The father knew he was seriously injured and he couldn't make it,

174
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,730
so he kneeled down and begged the fellow apprentices

175
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,710
to escort the only offspring of the He family

176
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,330
to his ancestral home for refuge.

177
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,100
[Luoyang]

178
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,120
When they arrived in Luoyang,

179
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,370
the senior asked the junior to buy some specialties,

180
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:48,630
saying he'd send the offspring to the He family by himself.

181
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,490
Of course the junior didn't think much about it.

182
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:51,960
But soon,

183
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,270
word spread that the child was killed by the enemy.

184
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,700
Three years later,

185
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,440
the senior gave the junior

186
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,600
an extraordinarily sharp soft sword as a birthday gift.

187
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,290
It had been too long,

188
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,370
so the junior had long forgotten about the cloud iron incident.

189
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,070
So that soft sword

190
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,970
became the sword the junior carried around.

191
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,410
Are you trying to say that my father misappropriated the cloud iron?

192
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:15,760
Are you trying to say that

193
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,560
my father is a villain who stole things and took advantage of others?

194
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,050
I don't know,

195
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,260
nor do I want to know.

196
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,300
It's up to you

197
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,310
whether you believe it or not.

198
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,840
Young Master, bad news!

199
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,250
Lian Quan is missing.

200
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:51,910
No need to look for him.

201
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,540
I let him go.

202
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,370
How could you...

203
00:11:59,070 --> 00:11:59,870
Li Lianhua.

204
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:00,990
No need.

205
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,930
I've let Li Lianhua go as well.

206
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,450
How could you...

207
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,530
Why couldn't I?

208
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,450
Li Lianhua saved my life.

209
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,290
You're ungrateful,

210
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,510
but I'm a grateful person.

211
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,320
Alright.

212
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,290
Don't be mad.

213
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:19,880
Li Lianhua said

214
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,330
he has his own plan.

215
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,370
I helped him steal the key to release him,

216
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,030
and he'll figure out the truth for you in return.

217
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,090
He asked me to give this to you.

218
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,090
Jian Lingxiao's tracking bee?

219
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,700
The doctor isn't Lian Quan.

220
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,700
Lian Quan is dead.

221
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,580
Niutou Mamian is still alive.

222
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,370
He said

223
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,470
he'll give you

224
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,700
the answers to the other two questions tomorrow.

225
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,130
The poison has been detoxicated.

226
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,680
As expected from you, Li Xiangyi.

227
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,320
As expected from Yangzhouman.

228
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:33,700
Good.

229
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:34,970
Very good.

230
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,220
Sect Leader Li, you're useless

231
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,370
after this.

232
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:44,490
Wait.

233
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,320
So you two

234
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,950
want to kick down the ladder.

235
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:50,550
Sect Leader Li.

236
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,840
You're a man of honor,

237
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,920
but Netherworld Estate has always believed in evil ways.

238
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,180
You don't really think

239
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,010
we'll give you the Rama Heavenly Ice obediently, do you?

240
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:01,000
Too much power was consumed for detoxification just now.

241
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,290
He can't even stand straight now.

242
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,950
It's a good chance to kill him.

243
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,890
You are not eager to look for the Heavenly Ice,

244
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,080
and you want to kill me first?

245
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,840
Aren't you putting the cart before the horse?

246
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,370
What are you talking about?

247
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,260
If I guessed it right,

248
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,650
you should have hidden the Heavenly Ice

249
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,810
under the chessboard in the monk room.

250
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,940
When I was checking the authenticity that day,

251
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,610
I accidentally added a little pollen

252
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,850
to the Heavenly Ice.

253
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,760
And I happen to have a bee that can track pollen.

254
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:30,850
Half a day ago,

255
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,370
the tracking bee

256
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,720
circled around your monk room.

257
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,260
That's why

258
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,270
I brought you here for detoxification.

259
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,080
The Heavenly Ice

260
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,910
must have been taken away by now.

261
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,220
Then I'll torture you to be half-dead

262
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,720
and trade you for the Heavenly Ice.

263
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,650
I'm not the half-dead one.

264
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,530
Look at your brother.

265
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,960
Brother!

266
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:55,810
Slowly.

267
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,520
It's Bicha Poison.

268
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,390
[Hanshui Temple]

269
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:33,300
One more?

270
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:35,840
Sit tight.

271
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:40,510
Go.

272
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,690
You were still locked in the woodshed

273
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,050
of Baishui Garden yesterday,

274
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,130
and now you're back in Lotus Tower?

275
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:47,980
You know that?

276
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,450
I was worried about you,

277
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:51,850
so I asked around.

278
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:52,850
Little girl.

279
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,730
Thank you for your concern, Miss Su.

280
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:56,480
You fed the dog for me,

281
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,910
yet you still had time to ask around about my well-being?

282
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,230
Not only about your well-being.

283
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,190
I also heard that

284
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,410
you owe Young Master Fang

285
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,870
answers to two questions.

286
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:04,490
What is it?

287
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,850
What answers?

288
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,320
So juvenile.

289
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,290
Anyway,

290
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,310
we should pack up.

291
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,640
We should lose no time in looking for the next piece of Heavenly Ice.

292
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,700
We're leaving now?

293
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,000
We haven't got rid of Niutou Mamian yet.

294
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,330
Besides, is it okay

295
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,100
to leave it to Fang Duobing?

296
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,430
As for those two,

297
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,920
only one of them is able to move now.

298
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,130
Of course Fang Duobing can handle it.

299
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:29,770
Besides,

300
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,970
Baishui Garden is surrounded by traps.

301
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,520
Li Xiao can't get in even if he wants to.

302
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:36,380
Let's go.

303
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,620
What's wrong?

304
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:42,860
Let me help you lie down.

305
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:44,820
I'm okay.

306
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,520
Maybe I'm tired.

307
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,810
What's that sound?

308
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,450
It's an explosion.

309
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,580
It seems to be from the west of the city.

310
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,320
From the direction of Baishui Garden.

311
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,100
How many times has it been?

312
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,390
Why did it catch on fire again?

313
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,850
Why was there another explosion?

314
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,580
Could it be because of the mine?

315
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,530
Did someone go down the mine again?

316
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,260
I don't know.

317
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,290
I knew something bad would happen because of the mine.

318
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,079
You're awake.

319
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:41,250
It shouldn't be that easy to get Rama Heavenly Ice, right?

320
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,170
Since you've got the Heavenly Ice,

321
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,610
why did you have to abduct me here?

322
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,740
To lure Sect Leader Li here, of course.

323
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,040
He should be here soon.

324
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,720
You are right.

325
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:54,840
I'm here.

326
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,290
You've gone through so much trouble

327
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,530
to lure me here.

328
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,790
Sect Leader Li, you are scheming.

329
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,350
You detoxicated Bizhong Strike for my brother,

330
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:13,980
but then you poisoned him

331
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,360
with the deadliest poison in the world, Bicha Poison.

332
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,690
Hand over the antidote.

333
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,690
You said yourself that Bicha Poison

334
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,550
is the deadliest poison in the world.

335
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,210
How could I have the antidote?

336
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,820
Others may not have it,

337
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,540
but I believe you do, Sect Leader Li.

338
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,280
You must have heard of who I, Li Xiangyi, am.

339
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,200
I advise you to release him as soon as possible.

340
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,200
Otherwise,

341

If it wasn't for Mr. Fang,

345

You think you can threaten Li Xiangyi by kidnapping me?

349

Li Xiangyi is cold-hearted.

350
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,170
He's only here just for Rama Heavenly Ice,

351
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,110
not me.

352
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,220
Don't try to take this chance to snatch the Heavenly Ice.

I didn't expect that

you made a new friend during your ten years of silence, Sect Leader Li.

357
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,690
He'd even ruin your reputation to keep you safe.

358
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,430
Li Xiangyi is just arrogant.

359

He's not cold-blooded at all.

360
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:38,500
Back then, Shan Gudao searched for descendants of Nanyin.

361
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,020
On the surface, it was to protect the Central Plains,

362
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,170
but it was actually to shake the martial world.

363
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:46,490
There have been rumors about this secret for a long time in the martial world.

364
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,950
But no one dared to tell him

365
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,560
because everyone knows

366
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,120
he would never believe it.

367
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,550
I think he's still in the dark.

I'll ask you one last time.

00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,940
Where is the antidote to Bicha Poison?

371
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,450
I do have no antidote

372
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,650
to Bicha Poison.

373
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,700
I didn't mean to poison your brother either.

374
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,320
But after thinking about it,

375
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,390
I do have a way.

376
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,000
Maybe we can give it a try.

377
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:22,960
Say it.

378
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,300
There's a Hualong Crystal

379
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,240
in my Wenjing sword.

380
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:33,830
It may be able to detoxicate the poison in your brother's body.

381
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,620
Take three steps back.

382

Li Xiangyi.

383
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,120
You are poisoned by Bicha Poison.

384
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,910
I knew it.

385
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:23,060
So when you were curing my brother,

386
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,690
you transported the poison into his body.

387
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,860
Bicha Poison?

388
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,760
There's no need to be nervous.

389
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,140
I've been poisoned for a long time.

390
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,010
Look.

391
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,360
I'm still okay.

392
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,550
It's not as serious as he said.

394
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,050
You can't even cure your own poison.

395
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,620
It seems that there really is no antidote to Bicha Poison.

396
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,800
But my brother has been anemic

397

after being poisoned for one day.

398
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,210
However, you've survived for so long,

399

and you are still active.

400
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:54,780
I think

401
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:58,720
Yangzhouman is the best solution to suppressing this poison.

402

Even if I teach you the mental codes of it,

it'll be hard for you to learn.

406

Yang is born of wood, while Yin is born of gold.

410

Yin and Yang reincarnate, and the rivers turn upside down.

Speak it out, or hide it in your heart.

412

Speak your heart, and five viscera invigorate of archeus.

413

One is missing for archeus, and one becomes three.

00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:14,750
What a mess.

511
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,250
At this point, you're still trying to fool me?

512
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:31,760
Lie down.

513
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,190
Look at me.

514
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,200
You must be scared.

515
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:45,730
Don't you know

516
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,880
how you look?

517
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:47,690
Lie down.

518
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:53,810
You feel cold, right?

519
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:03,370
Here.

520
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:04,990
Here's some warm wine.

521
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,520
Why are you vomiting blood?

522
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,450
The Bicha Poison was triggered.

Li Lianhua.

524
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,190
Are you okay, Li Lianhua?

525
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:30,980
Mother!

00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,070
Xiaobao.

527
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:33,770
How is Li Lianhua?

528
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,710
The poison was triggered.

529
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,180
He was so lively before.

530
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:42,140
Why did he suddenly become like this?

531
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,710
I don't have time to explain.

532
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,890
I want to borrow your Cloud-chasing Carriage

533
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,350
and take him to see Guan Hemeng.

534
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,280
There's no time to lose.

535
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,120
Go now.

Xiaobao.

537
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,250
You must save Physician Li.

538
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,740
Signs shows that

539
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:01,380
there's no evidence of Li Lianhua colluding with Jinyuan Alliance.

540
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,690
He didn't think of that, either.

541
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,870
That secret letter has a great intention of slandering.

542
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,070
It's untrustworthy.

543
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,850
You think so too?

544
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,110
Jiao Liqiao besieged and attacked

00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,140
Li Lianhua with the masters from  Jinyuan Alliance,

546
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,290
and injured him badly.

547
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,620
He almost lost his life.

548
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,390
We saw it with our own eyes.

549
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:23,500
He's injured?

550
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,390
Guan!

551
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:30,280
Guan! Help!

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,840
Guan! Help!

553
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,180
Hurry, save Li Lianhua!

554
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,230
He's in a coma!

You entered without my permission.

557
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,120
How impressive.

558
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,850
I can't save him.

559
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,080
Only you can save him now.

560
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,750
I'll do whatever you want.

561
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,320
I won't break my promise.

562
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,790
Get him in here first.

564
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,070
Go prepare the Three-archeus-in-one Soup

565
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:23,000
so that I can give him a herbal bath.

566
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:27,670
Guan.

567
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:28,890
How is it?

568
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:30,590
A word, please.

569
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,940
He's dying.

570
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,000
There must be ways to save him.

571
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,650
His body is overly consumed.

572
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,910
He's injured in the origin.

573
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:51,660
Even if it's repaired and mended,

574
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,920
he can barely survive.

575
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,560
His Qi and blood can't last longer.

[Excellent Medical Skills Work Magic]

577
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:00,450
But when I did his check-up last time,

578
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,380
he still had four months to live.

579
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,860
In just a few days,

580
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,310
he lost half of his life

581
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,570
to ruin my reputation.

582
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,410
Has he been poisoned?

583
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,670
It's Bicha Poison.

584
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,850
Once Bicha Poison gets deep into the blood,

585
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:20,460
it will destroy all the internal organs. It's incurable,

586
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,920
and he'll definitely die.

587
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:23,320
It's just fighting poison with poison.

588
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,000
If you want to sober him up a bit more,

589
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,070
you can take a risk.

590
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,580
If he lacks inner power,

591
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,500
I suggest

592
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,850
you use it after he takes the medicine.

593
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,889
Although the tiger palm is highly poisonous,

594
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:35,429
it can postpone the madness.

595
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:37,650
Fighting poison with poison?

596
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,449
That's right.

597
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,219
He used Yangzhouman to suppress Bicha Poison.

598
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,900
He shouldn't have used his inner power again and again.

599
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,630
What happens if he uses his inner power forcibly?

600
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,790
The more he uses his inner power,

601
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:56,330
the deeper the poison will get in the internal organs

602
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,590
and endanger his life.

603
00:34:57,909 --> 00:34:59,760
The day the fuel of his inner power runs out

604
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,080
is what it is now.

605
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,540
Even if I try my best to keep him alive,

606
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,600
he can only hold on for a month at most.

607
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,590
You've always wanted to get rid of me

608
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,550
because you didn't want me to know who you are.

609
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,480
So the Master in White was also you.

610
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,060
You hid it from me for so long.

611
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,390
I didn't know anything,

612
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:18,090
and l was still worried about your safety.

613
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:18,890
Fang Xiaobao.

614
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:22,600
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

615
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:26,370
I thought he pretended to have no martial skills

616
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,350
just to hide his identity.

617
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:31,220
He used Yangzhouman to save people more than once.

618
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,550
I didn't know it was at the cost of his life.

619
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,980
He used to teach me Yangzhouman.

620
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,150
He saved me and others with Yangzhouman.

621
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,220
Can I save him too?

622
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:45,580
How long have you been learning Yangzhouman?

623
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,510
Several months.

624
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,380
You can use Yangzhouman

625
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,900
to slowly guide his inner power to rotate

626
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,190
so that he doesn't have to be drowsy

627
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,450
or lie in bed every day.

628
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,570
However, without at least ten years of

629
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,810
refining Yangzhouman's intensive inner power,

630
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:59,520
it's impossible to detoxicate and save people

631
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,520
like him.

632
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,610
He only has one month to live.

633
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,110
He can't wait for you for ten years.

634
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,210
I don't believe it.

635
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,910
There is always a way out.

636
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,210
No one believed that he could come back alive,

637
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,210
but he made it.

638
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,990
We still have some time.

639
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,530
Even if I have to search all over the world,

640
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,170
I must find a way to save him.

641
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,310
Go to Yunyin Mountain and find Granny Qin.

642
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,570
Maybe she can save him.

643
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:25,630
Isn't that where

644
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,710
Li Xiangyi's master, Qi Mushan, finished his apprenticeship?

645
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,650
So Granny Qin is...

646
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:31,220
Don't you know that Qi Mushan's wife is Granny Qin?

647
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,540
She still lives in Yunju Pavilion on Yunyin Mountain.

648
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,000
But that is a hidden place.

You've got what I want, right?

she's now imprisoned in the Dragon King Temple of the 188 Prisons.

00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:54,540
It's really him.

679
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,190
Look at your face.

680
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:58,960
So what if it is him?

681
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:01,590
After Li Xiangyi became Li Lianhua,

682
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,170
he's lost most of his power.

683
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,020
But there's one thing you should worry about.

684
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,230
He will come to you

685
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,230
to settle the score for poisoning him with Bicha Poison.

686
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:19,200
So you might as well take action first and kill him secretly

687
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,690
to prevent future troubles.

688
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:31,410
Saintess.

689
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:32,880
Help me!

690
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:39,770
My Lord.

691
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:41,730
Why are you...

692
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:45,070
Someone delivered a letter from Zongzheng Mingzhu.

693
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:48,890
This pair of loving jade butterflies came with it.

694
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,230
Don't you know

695
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,830
my feelings for you, My Lord?

696
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:58,890
If I betray you, I will die a horrible death.

697
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:00,420
It's his wishful thinking.

698
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,840
His wishful thinking?

699
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:06,020
It is said that you have been in contact with him for years.

700
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,420
If it’s not for him,

701
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,830
are you trying to collude with the Wansheng Clan behind?

702
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:12,990
My Lord, what are you talking about?

703
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:13,590
My Lord.

704
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:16,040
When you were recuperating in seclusion,

705
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,010
I investigated the War of the East Sea.

706
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:20,750
Only then did I know that Wansheng Clan may have added fuel to the fire.

707
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:25,050
I wanted to find out the truth,

708
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:27,300
so I approached him deliberately and pretended to cooperate.

709
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:27,780
Really?

710
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,730
So what did you find?

711
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,110
Have you seen

712
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,860
the real master of Wansheng Clan?

713
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,750
So Lord hasn't recalled those things.

714
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,120
My Lord.

715
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,360
That man is very secretive.

716
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:50,660
I only contacted Feng Qing.

717
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,600
I don't know anything else.

718
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,080
But give me some time.

719
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:57,480
I'll definitely find the person behind it

720
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,740
and present him to you.

721
00:39:58,850 --> 00:39:59,860
You should at least know

722
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,700
why they want the Rama Vessel.

723
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,030
It belongs to Nanyin.

724
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:10,830
You are a descendant of Nanyin's royal family.

725
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:11,980
Jiao Liqiao.

726
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,540
What else are you hiding from me?

727
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:16,870
My Lord.

728
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,110
I'm not hiding anything from you.

729
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,530
I'll tell you everything

730
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:23,310
about the Rama Vessel.

731
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:27,460
The Rama Vessel contains the larvae of Nanyin's Karmic Bugs.

732
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,950
The mother bugs can be found through the larvae,

733
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:32,350
and they'll give birth to more Karmic Bugs.

734
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,190
So Wansheng Clan wants to manipulate

735
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,660
those who've been poisoned by Karmic Bugs

736
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,280
and make them follow whatever order they give.

737
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,700
How do they manipulate them?

738
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,230
I have been away from my hometown for too long.

739
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:43,890
How can I know the method?

740
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:47,690
Only professional bug-control sorcerers know it.

741
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,710
What's in it for you then?

742
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,550
You can see

743
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,940
how loyal I am to you, My Lord.

744
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,380
I want nothing

745
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:58,830
but to help you achieve great cause

746
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,430
by the power of those people.

747
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,820
In that case,

748
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,460
give it to me.

749
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:04,930
What?

750
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,680
The Heavenly Ice that opens the Rama Vessel.

751
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,280
You are so impatient, My Lord.

752
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:15,900
I only have one piece.

753
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,220
Besides, I've been pretending to collude with Zongzheng Mingzhu

754
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,460
for so long.

755
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,310
It's because I want to use him

756
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:22,740
to collect all the pieces of Heavenly Ice

757
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,070
and open the Rama Vessel

758
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:26,040
for you to ride around, My Lord.

759
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,760
By then,

760
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:31,420
everything will be under your Jinyuan Alliance's control, My Lord.

761
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,750
Wouldn't that be great?

762
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:33,820
Give it to me.

763
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,190
My Lord.

764
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:38,680
Give it to me.

765
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:51,690
Do as usual.

766
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:54,080
Tell your Zongzheng Mingzhu to find

767
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,410
Rama Vessel and the rest of Heavenly Ice as soon as possible.

768
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:45,370
Mother! Mother!

769
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,080
Run!

770
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,280
Run...

771
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:52,400
Are you okay?

772
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:54,140
I'm okay.

773
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:01,850
This is my place.

774
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,850
I'll beat you again next time.

775
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:03,210
Go.

776
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:03,690
Get out.

777
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:04,410
Leave now.

778
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:21,810
[Yunyin Mountain]

779
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:26,110
Granny Qin!

780
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,260
Setting up the mist formation to block me again.

781
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,400
I just went down the mountain for a drink.

782
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,150
Do you have to be so angry?
