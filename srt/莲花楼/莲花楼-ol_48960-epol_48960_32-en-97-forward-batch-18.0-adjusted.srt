[Episode 32]

4
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,300
It turned out that Consort Xuan had always wanted to revive Nanyin

5
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,620
and had established such a strong foundation.

6
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,890
But the Magician, Feng Ah Lu

7
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,220
didn't meet Consort Xuan's son back then.

8
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,539
The wealth of reviving Nanyin and the Rama Heavenly Ice

9
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:09,530
were all divided by the four of Jin, Yu, Huang and Quan.

10
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,390
Maybe something unexpected happened at that time.

11
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,340
But now,

12
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,370
Consort Xuan's descendant

13
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,740
must have been found by the Nanyin people.

14
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,490
Otherwise these letters wouldn't be here.

15
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:21,810
You mean

16
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,330
my father is Consort Xuan's son,

17
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,190
the descendant of the royal family of Nanyin?

18
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,850
There are other letters in this box.

19
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,430
Open it and take a look.

20
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,000
You're right.

21
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,570
The Magician, Feng Ah Lu,

22
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,530
and his whole family were very loyal.

23
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,150
Back then, they couldn't find Consort Xuan's son,

24
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,350
but still searched for him everywhere.

25
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,660
Even though the Magician, Feng Ah Lu went missing,

26
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,860
his descendant didn't stop searching.

27
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,910
So in the end,

28
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,120
with Consort Xuan's old possessions and the birthmark,

29
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,579
they verified that Senior

30
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,500
was the descendant of Prince Fangji and Consort Xuan.

31
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,500
And Feng Qing from the Wansheng Clan

32
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,500
was the descendant of Feng Ah Lu.

33
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,750
Obviously my father did not object,

34
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,690
but conspired with the Wansheng Clan

35
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:18,690
to plan all this.

36
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:23,920
Senior,

37
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,080
you did hide too well.

38
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,240
No matter how ambitious he was,

39
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,140
he didn't expect

40
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,520
to die a long time ago.

41
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,960
All his plans have come to nothing.

42
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,460
Maybe he already figured it out.

43
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,790
Fang Duobing.

44
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,250
I want to open the coffin for an autopsy.

45
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,490
What happened?

46
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,880
How did it become a skeleton?

47
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,079
Did the medicine not work in the coffin?

48
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,270
When I found the body,

49
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,560
I also examined the remains.

50
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,680
Senior was also wearing this armor,

51
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,880
and the little finger on his right hand was broken in half.

52
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,480
Being in a state of confusion, I didn't have time to distinguish.

53
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,110
The armor is fake.

54
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,210
In order to cover it up,

55
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,050
even half of the little finger

56
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,579
is exactly the same.

57
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,340
But when Senior broke the formation,

58
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,140
he did lose half of his little finger to the arrows.

59
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,660
But this little finger was cut off flat.

60
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,820
Could this be not my father's corpse?

61
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,150
This is another person.

62
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:53,980
But back then,

63
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,909
he was cut off and skinned,

64
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:58,100
and was disguised to look like Senior.

65
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,770
This magic must be extremely cruel

66
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,020
because he has the Wuxin Huai on him,

67
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,190
which was used to relieve his pain.

68
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,260
So Shan Gudao didn't die.

69
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,770
After he found out his identity,

70
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,760
he wanted to revive Nanyin

71
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,510
and dominate the world.

72
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,940
He wanted to cooperate with the imperial court

73
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,900
and then fight against the Sigu Sect.

74
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,300
But he never thought that

75
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,640
you would firmly oppose getting involved with the imperial court.

76
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,610
His pursuit of the descendant of Nanyin

77
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,140
was discovered by Liu Rujing.

78
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,370
As a result, he had no choice

79
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,100
but to escape with a fake death.

80
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,380
He even knew that

81
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,290
you'd avenge him.

82
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,010
So he colluded with Jiao Liqiao

83
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,220
and used her obsession with Di Feisheng.

84
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,580
With just the Bicha Poison

85
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,660
and thundering fire bombs,

86
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,500
he managed to overthrow the two major sects in the martial arts world.

87
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,630
But he hid in the dark

88
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,360
and took advantage of that,

89
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,600
making the Wansheng Clan grow rapidly.

90
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,160
He never gave up his conspiracies.

91
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,600
Since the Sigu Sect couldn't be used by him,

92
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,540
he just destroyed it and built another one.

93
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:58,930
Senior,

94
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,930
I've never been able to understand you.

[Guest House]

96
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,460
You used the hidden weapon very fast.

97
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,710
Unfortunately, I have armor protection.

98
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,130
Shan Gudao.

99
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,270
You're still alive.

[Shan Gudao]

101
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,010
You dug the grave,

102
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,040
and you made a good analysis.

103
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,020
I don't need to hide anymore.

104
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:13,460
It's just like what I dreamed of.

105
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,180
You're already a handsome young man,

106
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,320
and you look a bit like me back then.

107
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,580
Today, we reunited as father and son.

108
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,460
We should drink for that.

109
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,320
Father and son?

110
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,600
When you betrayed my biological mother,

111
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,590
when you saw that I was a sickly child

112
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:32,710
and abandoned me,

113
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,980
and when you lied that you were my uncle,

114
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,960
did you ever think of our relationship as father and son?

115
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,750
You pretended to be dead for so many years,

116
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,950
but now you claim that you're my father.

117
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:53,240
What are you up to?

118
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,840
As a man,

119
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,220
you should aspire to achieve a great cause.

120
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,580
If you always think about those trivial matters,

121
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,780
what can you achieve?

122
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,140
Is that all

123
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,220
the Tianji Mountain Manor has taught you over the years?

124
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,540
The Tianji Mountain Manor taught me to be honest

125
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,380
and upright,

126
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,780
instead of betraying masters and friends

127
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,980
and doing evil deeds.

128
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,090
When you and Li Xiangyi

129
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,620
established the Sigu Sect,

130
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,140
you said you wanted to build a fair martial arts world.

131
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,020
What is your great cause then?

132
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,560
Hiding in the dark and fearing to show up openly,

133
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,050
just like what you are now?

134
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:36,310
The Sigu Sect was once admired by everyone

135
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,610
and flourished for a while,

136
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,490
but it was still destroyed by me.

137
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,830
Li Xiangyi, who was cocky and arrogant,

138
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,250
also lost to me.

139
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,760
In the first half of my life,

140
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,880
I was overshadowed by Li Xiangyi who was gifted and prominent.

141
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,940
Who cared about me?

142
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:53,140
Who ever looked at me?

143
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,799
But one day,

144
00:08:58,179 --> 00:08:59,710
someone found me and told me

145
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,220
that I am the descendant of
the royal family of Nanyin

146
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,080
and the current imperial family.

147
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,460
I realized

148
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,080
the meaning and value

149
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,920
of my life.

150
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,060
You asked me what I want.

151
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,030
What I want

152
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,710
is what's supposed to be mine.

153
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,880
I hid in the dark

154
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,550
to accumulate strength.

155
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,300
And now it's time for me to show up and succeed.

156
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,130
This is destiny.

157
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,760
Do you understand?

158
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,820
The position that everyone admires and no one dares to usurp

159
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,300
belongs to me, Shan Gudao.

160
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,460
Stop it.

161
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,220
What destiny?

162
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,520
It's just your ambition.

163
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,540
Your crazy obsession

164
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,940
will only bring harm to this peaceful martial arts world.

165
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,520
You're just as stupid as you were when you were a kid.

166
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,820
You just can't understand it.

167
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,700
Tit for tat.

168
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,740
I should be the one to get it back.

169
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,660
Remember this.

170
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,140
You are my only family in this world.

171
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,420
You're my son.

172
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,850
You are related to me by blood.

173
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:04,990
Think about it.

174
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,920
When I succeed and rule the world,

175
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,660
I'll pass everything on to you.

176
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,580
Don't you want it?

177
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,020
As long as you come back to me

178
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,940
and give me your Rama Heavenly Ice,

179
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,700
we will

180
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,130
find the last one together.

181
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,590
-Then we…
-I don’t have it.

182
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,750
Even if I have it,

183
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,860
I will never give it to you.

184
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,510
Nanyin has been destroyed for a hundred years.

185
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,470
Now the world is at peace,

186
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,400
which is a blessing for all people.

187
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,370
I won't let you ruin this.

188
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,970
Just you?

189
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,500
You should be glad that you're my son.

190
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,270
I can't bear to kill you.

191
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,580
Come back with me.

192
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,510
It's still so hard

193
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,460
to defend against your sword.

194
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,140
We haven't seen each other for ten years,

195
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,620
but we're still alive.

196
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,360
Should we find a place

197
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,470
to celebrate?

198
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,330
Celebrate?

199
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,590
We haven't seen each other for ten years.

200
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,600
I've been looking for you for ten years.

201
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,980
I've been looking for you for ten years.

202
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,360
I've been looking for you for ten years.

203
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,410
Ten years?

204
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,410
I can't believe

205
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,230
you've been looking for me for ten years.

206
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,100
My kindness to you when I was young was worthwhile.

207
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,610
Li Xiangyi,

208
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,980
is it very sad

209
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,840
to be deceived by someone

210
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,990
you don't care about

211
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,910
for ten years?

212
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,220
The Wenjing Sword I gave you,

213
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,180
how's that working out for you?

214
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,690
Did you kill

215
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,840
the original owner of the cloud iron?

216
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,070
If I didn't kill him,

217
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,130
how could I give you the sword?

218
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,100
It's all because of you.

219
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,580
He didn't want to work for me,

220
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,820
so I had to kill him.

221
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,910
You almost died,

222
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,100
but you look like a loser now.

223
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,600
Why am I so happy to see that?

224
00:12:58,850 --> 00:12:59,580
Ridiculous.

225
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,310
It was just a small setback

226
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,200
for him.

227
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,820
Is that something to brag about?

228
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,580
Shut up.

229
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:06,580
You are my son.

230
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,980
How can you speak for him?

231
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,380
What's so good about him? Everyone praises him.

232
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,710
No matter how good he is,

233
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,730
he still lost to me.

234
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,060
He didn't even know

235
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,380
that I had tricked him for ten years.

236
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,870
Li Xiangyi is just a joke.

237
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,980
Li Xiangyi

238
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,280
is indeed a joke.

239
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,490
If you want to win,

240
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,180
Li Xiangyi

241
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,390
has already lost to you.

242
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,220
Stop it.

243
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,870
You should stop going your own way.

244
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,730
Stop pretending to be righteous

245
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,270
and heroic.

246
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,400
There is no turning back.

247
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,620
What's the point of winning you alone, Li Xiangyi?

248
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,700
I want everyone in the world

249
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,980
to obey me.

250
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,580
If you've thought about it,

251
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,180
meet me at the Wansheng Clan.

252
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,920
No need to chase him.

253
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,420
It turns out that everything we speculated before

254
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,180
is true.

255
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,890
I don't even know

256
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,230
when I got this far.

257
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,530
Xiaobao,

258
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,290
if you hadn't been involved,

259
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,070
you wouldn't have known this.

260
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,990
Do you think I'll regret it?

261
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,710
The more clearly I see it,

262
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,570
the more I know which path to take.

263
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,210
I'm glad that I've seen all the facts.

264
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,150
[Guest House]

265
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,520
This is the news I just received.

266
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,800
Four-faced Qingzun's wife, Liangyi Fairy

267
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,330
was locked up in the Ninth Prison.

268
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,500
Yesterday Di Feisheng broke into the prison with his men.

269
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,630
Di Feisheng must have teamed up with Shan Gudao

270
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,510
to get the last Rama Heavenly Ice.

271
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,450
I thought Di Feisheng

272
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,830
would turn over a new leaf

273
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,200
after you saved him.

274
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,700
I didn't expect him to go after the Rama Vessel.

275
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,700
He shouldn't have been interested in the Rama Vessel.

276
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,160
Maybe

277
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,880
I was wrong about him.

278
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:44,980
Anyway,

279
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,330
they already have the Rama Vessel

280
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,150
and three pieces of the Rama Heavenly Ice.

281
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,440
They will try to get

282
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,040
the one in our hands.

283
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:02,830
Young Master.

284
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,020
The Master of the Tianji Mountain Manor sent a letter,

285
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,620
asking you to return to the Manor immediately.

286
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,530
Li Lianhua.

287
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,330
My mother asked me to take you back to the Tianji Mountain Manor.

288
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,020
You said you gave the ice shard to your mother.

289
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,810
Is there something wrong?

290
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,130
You didn't find

291
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:30,330
the Rama Heavenly Ice in the hands of Four-faced Qingzun?

292
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,800
At that time, Four-faced Qingzun was seriously injured

293
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,860
and died in prison.

294
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,920
He left the Rama Heavenly Ice to his wife,

295
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,200
Liangyi Fairy.

296
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,010
I didn't know about it until I broke into the prison.

297
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,180
After Four-faced Qingzun died,

298
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,510
Liangyi Fairy also died of hunger strike.

299
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,750

[Foreworld Forever]

301
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,940
I found the whereabouts of Liangyi Fairy after her death

302
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,600
in the residence of Mr. Pi who guards the prison.

303
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,910
She is still alive?

304
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,900
Where do you think she'd be hiding

305
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,770
with the Rama Heavenly Ice?

306
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,230
Mr. Pi comes from the Tianji Hall.

307
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,510
We're going to the Tianji Mountain Manor anyway.

You are too slow.

Saintess, what happened?

312
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:40,540
Is it scary?

I spent ten years of my life on him,

318
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,420
but still failed to make him like me.

319
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,660
He doesn't care about my love

320
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,380
or my hatred.

321
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,760

00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,450
Mr. Li.

341
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,200
You're too late.

342
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:00,530
You've missed

343
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,680
Xiaofeng.

344
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,810
Master He,

345
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,580
please stop making fun of me.

346
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,660
Auntie's marriage is too sudden.

347
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,390
I know her thoughts.

348
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:14,700
In her heart,

349
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,780
she still can't let go of Mr. Li,

350
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,640
but she knows that she has no hope with Mr. Li

351
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,940
and is disheartened.

352
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,710
Don't take it personally.

353
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,950
She's just that kind of person,

354
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,460
emotional

355
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,950
and capricious.

356
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,340
Well, you see,

357
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,460
a few days ago, she picked up an injured man at the foot of the mountain.

358
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,260
You know what?

359
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,250
This young man is really handsome.

360
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:36,850
And now

361
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,920
she's fallen in love with him after taking care of him for a few days.

362
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,560
She married a man just like that?

363
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,490
That's too fast.

364
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:43,980
It's indeed

365
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,240
a little hasty.

366
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,820
But they are already

367
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:48,980
in love with each other.

368
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,840
They just wanted to get married as soon as possible.

369
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,290
At first I wanted to invite you to the wedding,

370
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,780
but as soon as Xiaofeng heard that Mr. Li was coming,

371
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,110
she insisted on getting the wedding done.

372
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,380
In her heart,

373
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,250
she still cares about Mr. Li.

374
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:03,400
So

375
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,380
she had to finish the wedding ceremony

376
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,680
and enter the bridal chamber

377
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,450
before dark.

378
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,080
She wants me to convey a message to Mr. Li.

379
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,420
According to my Auntie's personality,

380
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,330
she would say,

381
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,600
"Do you regret it?"

382
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,900
And then she would tell him,

383
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,630
"It's useless to regret it now.

384
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,840
I, He Xiaofeng, have a husband now.

385
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,410
You can go wherever you want."

386
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,010
You really know your Auntie.

387
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,840
You're right about every word.

388
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,720
By the way, Mother,

389
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,000
-when I came back last night...
-That brat's done messing around outside

390
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
and has come back?

391
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,210
Master.

392
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,850
Let me introduce him to you.

393
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:44,490
This is

394
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,750
Xiaobao's friend, Li Lianhua.

395
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,170
[Fang Zeshi, Minister of the Ministry of Revenue]

396
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,720
Greetings, Lord Fang.

397
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,710
Look at you!

398
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,540
You're frivolous and slovenly.

399
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,210
Have you achieved anything outside?

400
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,490
Today, I...

401
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,570
What are you doing?

402
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:03,570
Let go!

403
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,390
-Let go of me.
-I'm sorry.

404
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,110
Sorry.

405
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:06,990
Lord Fang.

406
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,120
I've never called you Father before.

407
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,980
But in my heart,

408
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,530
you're the best father.

409
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,010
Did you get into

410
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,620
some big trouble outside?

411
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:27,460
You've been acting like a good boy since you came back.

412
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,420
Listen,

413
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:31,360
don't try to play tricks on me.

414
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,440
Also,

415
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,680
don't try to avoid your marriage with the princess.

416
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,170
Now that your Auntie's wedding is over,

417
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,730
it's your turn next.

418
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:42,280
The emperor's grace is widely known. You can't avoid it.

419
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,360
Look.

420
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,750
-He's lecturing me again.
-You...

421
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,860
I don't want to marry the princess. How many times have I told you?

422
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,640
What kind of son

423
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,810
talks to his father like this?

424
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,740
You're stubborn and disobedient.

425
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,220
Madam.

426
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,120
Madam.

427
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,320
Discipline your son.

428
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,430
Alright.

429
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,200
We have a guest here.

430
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,330
Don't be too strict.

431
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:03,700
By the way,

432
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,640
the people from the Ministry of Works

433
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,590
came to congratulate you.

434
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,390
I've invited them to the Western Banquet Hall.

435
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,950
Go and greet them.

436
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,950
I'll leave your mother to discipline you.

437
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,550
By the way, Xiaobao,

438
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,380
Mr. Li,

439
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,030
I have an urgent matter.

440
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,060
Because of Xiaofeng's wedding,

441
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,820
the Tianji Mountain Manor sent out wedding invitations a few days ago.

442
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,820
We've received congratulatory gifts from friends from all sides in the past few days.

443
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,820
I don't know who sent such a gift box.

444
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:39,330
When I saw that it was the setting of the mechanism brocade box

445
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:40,810
from our Tianji Hall before,

446
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,140
it caught my attention.

447
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,580
When I opened it,

448
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,940
I found the Rama Heavenly Ice inside,

449
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,300
just like the ice shard

450
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,450
you asked me to keep.

451
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,760
Why is it empty?

452
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,590
How is that possible?

453
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,920
It was in there just now.

454
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:01,890
Master He.

455
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,240
When did you see that the ice shard

456
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,010
was still in the box before?

457
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,370
About an hour ago.

458
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,230
After seeing the ice shard,

459
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,770
I found that the auspicious time had come,

460
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:13,660
so I put the ice shard back into the box and locked it up.

461
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,720
Then I sent the bride and groom into the bridal chamber after the ceremony.

462
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,120
In the blink of an eye, it just disappeared.

463
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,760
It seems that the person who took the ice shard had a clear goal

464
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,820
and came prepared.

465
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,300
There is only one way to the Tianji Mountain Manor.

466
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,580
When we went up the mountain,

467
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,330
we did not find anyone going down.

468
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,700
The person who stole the Ice

469
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,300
should still be in the Manor,

470
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,390
perhaps just among the guests.

471
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,210
Come on.

472
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:40,750
Cheers.

473
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,980
Thank you.

474
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,530
Come on.

475
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,010
Please.

476
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,060
Cheers.

477
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,460
There are so many guests.

478
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,050
It's hard to find out who's suspicious

479
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,740
just by staring at them like this.

480
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,400
Master He.

481
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,140
Have you arranged any performances

482
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,600
for this wedding banquet?

483
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:02,980
What do you mean?

484
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,580
Since

485
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,030
someone came here for the Ice,

486
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:09,640
we might as well give him a surprise.

487
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,110
You want to use the Rama Heavenly Ice

488
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,550
I gave my mother before

489
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,820
to lure him out?

490
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:15,890
You're right.

491
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,150
Not many people know about the Ice.

492
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,560
If we show it to them,

493
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,660
people who know about it and those who don't

494
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,060
will react differently.

495
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,500
Isn't it too risky?

496
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,160
Don't let them take it away again.

497
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,070
You brat.

498
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,620
What kind of place do you think our own home is?

499
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,900
I don't care who he is.

500
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:34,570
It's not that easy

501
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,480
to step out of the Tianji Hall.

502
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,650
Thank you, Master He.

503
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,300
Okay.

504
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:42,920
Just in case,

505
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,080
I'll go get Guardian Zhan.

506
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,240
Who is this Guardian Zhan

507
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,480
that needs your mother to invite him personally?

508
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,300
He's just a weird guy.

It's good.

573
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,660

575

This is the luminous pearl from Qionghai.

576
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,650
Legend has it that this luminous pearl

577
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:04,250
was formed by the tears of a fairy in the heaven.

578

What is this?

585
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,630
It may look ordinary,

586

but it's cold and frosty to the touch.

587

He was injured at the foot of the mountain

680
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,880
and was rescued by her.

681
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,540
It seems that he's also a man in the martial arts world.

682
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,670
He's extremely weak

683
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,590
in martial arts.

684
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,900
He's nothing but a good-looking man.

685
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,020
He's not good enough for her.

686
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:47,640
Then why did you...

687
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,840
It's most important that she likes him.

688
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:51,740
Okay.

689
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,310
Do you want to have a few drinks?

690
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:54,800
No.

691
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,780
I didn't expect to see you again.

692
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,220
I'm very happy.

693
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,270
You really know Zhan Yunfei.

694
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,410
Well,

695
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,490
he's an old friend.

696
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,550
What old friend?

697
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,650
Like Di Feisheng,

698
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,640
or the ones

699
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,250
that Physician Li treated before?

700
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,630
You need to tell me in advance.

701
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,160
I need to know the situation

702
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,900
and hide myself in advance.

703
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,260
Fang Xiaobao.

704
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:29,429
The tea is good.

705
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,320
Do you want to hear a story?

706
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:39,199
Pour me a cup of tea.

707
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:45,270
Thanks.

708
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,710
I'll take a sip first.

709
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,389
Here's the story.

710
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,500
Back then, Zhan Yunfei teamed up with others

711
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,969
to destroy the Lianhai Gang.

712
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,460
They captured the gang leader, Jiang Dafei.

713
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,949
When they tried to tie him up and sent him back to Yanzhou,

714
00:35:01,949 --> 00:35:03,520
there was no rope.

715
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:04,820
So

716
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,830
someone took fancy of one of Zhan Yunfei's belongings

717
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,050
and wanted to borrow it.

718
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:09,889
What is it?

719
00:35:10,179 --> 00:35:10,909
Headband.

720
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,580
So Zhan Yunfei used to use headbands before.

721
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,310
Doesn't he never comb his hair?

722
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,360
Not only does he love to comb his hair,

723
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,100
he's also very particular about it.

724
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,020
But

725
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,550
he's a little stubborn.

726
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:23,970
He didn't want to lend it.

727
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:24,890
And then?

728
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:25,830
Then...

729
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:04,930
What did we just agree on?

730
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,030
Take a bet on your headband.

731
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:10,120
Whoever loses will never comb his hair again.

732
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,400
Then this headband is mine.

733
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:14,900
Thank you.

734
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,320
I admit defeat.

735
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,220
I promised you.

736
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,800
I won't break my promise.

737
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,290
I won't tie my hair anymore.

738
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:32,310
It's more suitable to tie him up with this headband.

739
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:36,700
It turns out that Zhan Yunfei never combs his hair

740
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,410
because of the bet he made with you.

741
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:40,100
Li Xiangyi was so boring back then.

742
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,300
How dare you say that?

743
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,760
Isn't he just like you?

744
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,320
He was too young and arrogant back then.

745
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,630
He enjoyed showing off his martial arts,

746
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:51,010
and wasted his inner power on things that didn't matter.

747
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,870
But Li Xiangyi didn’t expect that

748
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,550
after so many years of his death,

749
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,950
Zhan Yunfei still remembers this promise.

750
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,630
He's so stubborn.

751
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,580
He did lose every bet.

752
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,850
He did lose the bet

753
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,300
with Li Xiangyi back then.

754
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,160
But as to the bet with your Auntie,

755
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:10,730
I'm not sure.

756
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:11,560
He...

757
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,950
And my Auntie?

758
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,330
Young Master.

759
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,660
Young Master.

760
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,180
I've checked and found that

761
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,920
the 17 people Xing Ziru contacted throughout the night

762
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,320
are all local merchants.

763
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,540
They have been in touch with the Tianji Hall for many years.

764
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,070
There should be no problem.

765
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,510
What else did he do

766
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:29,780
besides talking to the guests?

767
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,480
In between conversations with people,

768
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,100
he would go out for some fresh air.

769
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,680
Each time he would go to the pavilion in the courtyard

770
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,850
and set up a game of chess.

771
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:37,620
He set it up himself and played it himself.

772
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,480
-A game of chess?
-A game of chess?

773
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,480
We don't know how to play chess.

774
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,380
But we were taught

775
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,540
when joining the Tianji Hall.

776
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,460
We can remember what we've seen correctly.

777
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,570
These are what we saw

778
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:49,870
when we followed Xing Ziru

779
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,000
at different times.

780
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:53,440
After the fourth round, he went back to his room

781
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,720
and didn't come out again.

782
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,050
Keep an eye on Xing Ziru.

783
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,120
Don't alert him.

784
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:58,900
Yes.

785
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,250
Aren't these the chess manuals

786
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,600
from the Carefree and Innocent Pastime Collection?

787
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,040
Look.

788
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:12,870
This is the Painting of Shangqing.

789
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,380
This is the Painting of the Four Immortals of Chengdu Prefecture.

790
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,830
This is the Painting of Baozhen.

791
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,630
This is the Painting of Jinming.

792
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,980
Minister Fang has really

793
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,860
cultivated you with great effort.

794
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,240
You are thoroughly accomplished

795
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,820
in lyre-playing, chess, calligraphy and painting.

796
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,200
My father cultivated me heart and soul when I was a child.

797
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,490
But I was still young back then.

798
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:33,080
I disobeyed him all the time.

799
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,480
Now that I think about it,

800
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,220
I'm really lucky.

801
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,700
Fang Xiaobao.

802
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,730
You've grown up.

803
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:42,660
Take a good look.

804
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,600
What do you think about these chess manuals?

805
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,080
I don't have a clue yet.

806
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,740
But the Rama Heavenly Ice is close at hand.

807
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,540
If Xing Ziru

808
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,870
is still in the mood to play chess at this time,

809
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,980
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

810
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:01,050
Study these chess manuals first.

811
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:03,110
I'll go to the pavilion to find clues.

812
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,390
Has my bet

813
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,980
ruined their marriage?

814
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,020
Blood!

815
00:39:58,410 --> 00:39:59,270
Somebody help! Blood!

816
00:39:59,270 --> 00:39:59,740
Somebody help!

817
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,980
Help! Somebody help!

818
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:01,920
Blood!

819
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:07,410
Li Lianhua.

820
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,560
Something happened to the groom.

821
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,240
Father!

822
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:13,110
Mother.

823
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,060
What happened to the groom?

824
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:23,490
Young Master!

825
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,110
Young Master, it's scary.

826
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,500
The groom had an accident last night,

827
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,580
and the body was gone.

828
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,740
Now there's only a piece of human skin left.

829
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,270
Xiaobao.

830
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:31,640
Aren't you detectives?

831
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,840
You must help me find the murderer

832
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,230
and seek justice for my husband who died distressingly.

833
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:52,060
Ms. He,

834
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,040
how do you know that

835
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,790
this piece of human skin is the groom's?

836
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,820
Wei was injured before.

837
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,140
I saw it when he applied the medicine.

838
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,600
He had this tattoo on his back.

839
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,490
My poor husband.

840
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,300
On our wedding night,

841
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:10,460
his body just disappeared.

842
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,370
Only this bloody human skin was left.

843
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:15,920
Dead or alive, there must be a body.

844
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,680
The groom is not made of water.

845
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,780
How could he just disappear?

846
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:22,500
The bedding and clothes are intact

847
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,330
and there are no signs of corrosion.

848
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:26,590
It doesn't look like decomposing water.

849
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,450
Ms. He,

850
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,440
do you remember what happened last night?

851
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,360
Last night?

852
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,000
Last night...

853
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:36,460
Calm down. Tell us slowly.

854
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,110
Yesterday evening,

855
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:41,370
after the wedding ceremony,

856
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:44,620
he and I returned to the courtyard.

857
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,430
Seeing that it was still early,

858
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,000
we sat together in the courtyard for a while.

859
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,410
We didn't go back to the room until the moon came out.

860
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,140
After drinking the cross-cupped wine,

861
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,930
I felt sleepy.

862
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,020
He took me to bed to rest.

863
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,980
I don't know what happened after that.

864
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:04,010
When I woke up,

865
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:06,170
I saw

866
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:08,010
this bloody human skin.

867
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:11,490
You felt sleepy after drinking the cross-cupped wine?

868
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:12,090
Auntie.

869
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:13,940
Think about it carefully.

870
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,740
Was there anything suspicious?

871
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,910
Anything suspicious?

872
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:33,180
Leave one's mortal form behind and attain bliss,

873
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,440
ascend to heaven and become immortal.

874
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,840
I've never heard that he likes poetry.

875
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,190
A poem.

876
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,320
Poem, human skin.

877
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,900
The pattern on the skin

878
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,490
doesn't look like an ordinary tattoo.

879
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:58,050
Does it mean anything?

880
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,510
There seems to be

881
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,450
something odd about the groom.

882
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:02,900
Something odd?

883
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,160
There are traces of fighting.

884
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,100
Someone must have broken into the bridal chamber last night,

885
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,520
but this person didn't hurt Auntie at all.

886
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,780
What's certain is that

887
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:19,370
no one else

888
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:22,040
has been killed or attacked in the Tianji Mountain Manor.

889
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:22,670
So,

890
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,980
the murderer came for Wei Qingchou?

891
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,420
He took the body away

892
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,550
after he killed him?

893
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:28,500
Impossible.

894
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,140
Last night when I returned from delivering the treasure,

895
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,140
the two of them

896
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,280
gave me a box of wedding candies.

897
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:37,520
No one else entered the bridal chamber after that.

898
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:39,020
Otherwise,

899
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,430
they could never escape my attention.

900
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:46,630
That is to say, Wei Qingchou

901
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:49,480
must have died after Brother Zhan returned.

902
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,230
Brother Zhan

903
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:53,820
has been guarding the opposite side of the house all night long.

904
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:56,860
Then the murderer couldn't have entered or exited from the front.

905
00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:00,060
There is no entrance to the sill walls behind the windows.

906
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:03,460
The mechanisms in the Tianji Hall have always been very famous.

907
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,520
Is it possible that

908
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:08,380
there are other mechanisms and secret passages here?

909
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,300
This building

910
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,460
is a very normal place,

911
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,360
and there is nothing else.

912
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,840
The body is gone,

913
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:17,230
and the only thing left here is a tattooed human skin.

914
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:19,100
If the murderer killed Wei Qingchou

915
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,610
for this tattooed human skin,

916
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:22,070
why didn't he take it away?

917
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:25,650
Madam.

918
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,940
Xiaofeng must be shocked.

919
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,320
Why don't you take her to rest somewhere else?

920
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,080
We can leave it to Xiaobao here.

921
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:33,640
Alright.

922
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:35,120
Li,

923
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,620
you've been on standby outside the door

924
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:37,830
since last night.

925
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:38,980
Then stay here

926
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,940
and listen to Young Master's orders.

927
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:41,410
Yes.

928
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:42,890
Let's go.

929
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:52,830
What are you thinking?

930
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,870
Since no one went out all night,

931
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:57,810
the murderer and the body

932
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,460
might not have left at all.
