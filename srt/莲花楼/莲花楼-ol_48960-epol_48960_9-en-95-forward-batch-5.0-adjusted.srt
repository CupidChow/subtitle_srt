[Episode 9]

4
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,720
After all these years,

5
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,530
we finally found the Shaoshi Sword that Xiangyi always carried with him.

6
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,880
We feel so relieved.

7
00:01:56,979 --> 00:02:00,740
I hope everyone in the martial world

8
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,660
can keep in mind the noble cause of righting wrongs and maintaining peace.

9
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,800
That's also Xiangyi's wish.

10
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,560
Xiao Zijin is so bold now.

11
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,660
Shi Shui.

12
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,110
It's been ten years.

13
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:31,930
I thought

14
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,400
Qiao Wanmian was your woman.

15
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,590
Ms. Qiao only belongs to herself.

16
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:45,800
It's my honor

17
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,120
to witness the return of the Shaoshi Sword with you.

18
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,190
Look.

19
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,350
It's really the Shaoshi Sword.

20
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,220
Li Xiangyi cut a stunning figure in the martial world

21
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,550
with the Xiangyi Swordplay he invented.

22
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,480
I heard that to entertain Ms. Qiao,

23
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,700
he tied a long red ribbon around the hilt of that sword

24
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,530
and played the 36 Drunken Moves

25
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,400
on the roof of House of Delights in Yangzhou.

26
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,000
Everyone came out to see him.

44
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,460
It's said that countless people flooded the streets

45
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,530
just to see that sword with the red ribbon.

46
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,760
This must be eye-opening for you two.

47
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:54,390
He was too young

48
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,070
and too ostentatious.

49
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:57,740
Yes.

50
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,490
Too ostentatious.

51
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,710
What's that attitude?

52
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,100
You can never achieve what he achieved.

53
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,560
You two are just jealous.

54
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,600
To make it more thrilling,

55
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,710
you can come on stage for a spar.

56
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,170
When the incense burns out,

57
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,550
the one on the stage

58
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,680
with the ribbon flower

59
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,210
can try the Shaoshi Sword.

60
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,240
Try the Shaoshi Sword?

61
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,190
I'll surely win!

62
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,070
It's quite lively.

63
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,860
The Sect Leader likes activities like this.

64
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,780
I bet he's very happy now.

65
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,540
I've known you for so long

66
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,250
but never asked the name of your sword.

67
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:46,850
Sword.

68
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:48,330
Sword?

69
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,100
It doesn't have a name?

70
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:50,700
A sword is a sword.

71
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,960
It doesn't need a name.

72
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,920
That one has a fancy name

73
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,190
but ended up in someone else's hands.

74
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,940
Whatever you say.

75
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,830
Aren't you going to take back your sword?

76
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:03,650
It's not mine.

77
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,930
Li Xiangyi died a decade ago.

78
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,250
Are you still upset about being defeated by me?

79
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:28,970
Li Lianhua?

80
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,370
What are you doing up there?

81
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,120
That mask…

82
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,659
Time's up.

83
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,230
The one holding the ribbon flower won.

84
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:55,830
Li Lianhua,

85
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,220
you lucky dog!

86
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,270
Shut up.

87
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:03,170
You're not an old friend of the Sigu Sect.

88
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,820
I've never seen you before.

89
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,380
May I know your name?

90
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,790
My surname is Li.

91
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,020
Li?

92
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,890
What's your full name?

93
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,610
Li Lianhua.

94
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,770
You're Physician Li.

95
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,640
I've heard a lot about you.

96
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,590
You got the chance

97
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,110
to try the Shaoshi Sword.

98
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,450
But I… I don't know how to use swords.

99
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:49,890
You cheated!

100
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,250
It's unfair!

101
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,780
Come down! Come down!

102
00:07:59,070 --> 00:07:59,550
Guys.

103
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,140
Mr. Xiao said

104
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,659
that whoever got the ribbon flower won.

105
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:04,590
He is the winner.

106
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,970
You're all big shots in the martial world.

107
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:07,830
Don't be sore losers.

108
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,340
Right?

109
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,340
Young Master Fang is right.

110
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,330
Physician Li has Xiangyi's surname.

111
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,970
Maybe he's destined to win.

112
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,290
Physician Li,

113
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,670
try the sword.

114
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,460
Go.

115
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,380
Go!

116
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,180
What a good sword!

117
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,580
It's so beautiful!

118
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,950
It…

119
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,830
How dare you destroy the Shaoshi Sword?

120
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:42,720
Guys,

121
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:43,910
calm down.

122
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,110
There must be a misunderstanding.

123
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,670
What did you do to that sword?

124
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,090
This sword is a counterfeit.

125
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,770
Counterfeit?

126
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,480
Impossible.

127
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,750
Why did you say that?

128
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,350
It's a good counterfeit.

129
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,700
Even the carving on the hilt is exactly the same.

130
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,860
But I heard that Li Xiangyi got this sword at the age of 15

131
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,660
and kept using it for five years.

132
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,960
But this hilt

133
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,890
looks brand new.

134
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,150
It doesn't make sense.

135
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,420
No abrasion at all.

136
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,130
Here, take a look.

137
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,340
When Xiangyi fought with Master Wuyou,

138
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,240
to save Wuyou's life,

139
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:39,220
he used the hilt of his sword to parry Wuyou's fatal blow.

140
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,700
This hilt is intact.

141
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,940
It's really a counterfeit.

142
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,230
This is not the sword I brought back.

143
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:45,830
Master Ji,

144
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,320
the sword was swapped.

145
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,590
As I said.

146
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:07,730
[Sword Room]

147
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,580
Look.

148
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,500
Three days ago,

149
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,680
Ms. Qiao and Mr. Xiao

150
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,110
brought back the Shaoshi Sword and locked it here.

151
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,580
The Sword Room is strictly guarded.

152
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,450
No one has entered here in the past few days.

153
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,910
Before the Sword-Appreciation Ceremony,

154
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:31,400
Shi Shui and I took the sword out.

155
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,040
I don't think anyone had the chance

156
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,590
to swap the sword.

157
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,240
Look.

158
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,470
Something seems wrong here.

159
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,520
Gosh.

160
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,090
Why is there a tunnel here?

161
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:45,840
Who did it?

162
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:46,900
When was it dug?

163
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,840
I wonder where the tunnel leads.

164
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,260
Should we go down and check it out?

165
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,120
Mian.

166
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,730
It's stuffy down there.

167
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,180
You may get an asthma attack.

168
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,500
Why don't you wait here?

169
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:57,900
No.

170
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,960
I went through a lot to finally find the Shaoshi Sword.

171
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,760
I can't wait here and do nothing.

172
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,550
Let's go.

173
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,520
This tunnel was dug at least half a month ago.

174
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,090
But the Shaoshi Sword was only sent to the Sword Room

175
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,150
in the Baichuan Court three days ago.

176
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,230
Did someone anticipate its coming?

177
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,750
Half a month ago?

178
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,710
By that time, I'd written a letter

179
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,950
to Master Ji and we'd decided

180
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,350
to keep the Shaoshi Sword in the Sword Room.

181
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,790
Few people have access

182
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,320
to our letters.

183
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,560
Seems that it's an inside job.

184
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:49,970
The tunnel is so long.

185
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,160
There's a clear dividing line here.

186
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,060
The section we walked through is recently dug.

187
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,380
The rest of the tunnel is quite old.

188
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,770
It was dug at least ten years ago.

189
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,640
So someone extended an old tunnel

190
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,390
to the Sword Room?

191
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:04,910
Ten years ago,

192
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,220
the Baichuan Court was a branch of the Sigu Sect.

193
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,450
We lived here at that time.

194
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,850
Has any one of you heard of

195
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:10,970
this long tunnel?

196
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,100
This tunnel…

197
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:17,980
Mian.

198
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,160
Are you feeling uncontrollable?

199
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,240
Li Lianhua.

200
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,350
Come here.

201
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,930
Coming through.

202
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,680
She's dead.

203
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,740
A stab in the chest killed her.

204
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,480
It's been four hours.

205
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,060
Rou?

206
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:56,700
Rou.

207
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,480
She's my maid Rou.

208
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,500
I couldn't find her anywhere this morning.

209
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,590
Did she know that the Shaoshi Sword was kept in the Sword Room?

210
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,190
She's been my maid for years.

211
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,220
All the letters I exchanged with Master Ji

212
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,740
were sent and received by her.

213
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,980
The cut is thin and clean.

214
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,180
Judging from its length, it was left by the Shaoshi Sword.

215
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,830
There are two types of footprints here.

216
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:19,920
They're not messy.

217
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,740
So there was no fight.

218
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,580
They were standing face to face

219
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,670
and Rou didn't expect the attack.

220
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,190
It seems that Rou conspired with someone

221
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,160
to steal the Shaoshi Sword

222
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,220
but her accomplice killed her.

223
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,450
These footprints are big.

224
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,850
They must belong to a man.

225
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,980
You're right.

226
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,480
That guy

227
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,350
should be hiding in the Pudu Temple.

228
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,590
I'm so sure

229
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,800
because the monks in that temple

230
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,980
all wear homemade straw shoes like these.

231
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,180
They're not for sale.

232
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:53,770
Half a month ago,

233
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,900
a new cook arrived there.

234
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,130
Half a month ago?

235
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,760
That fits the timeline.

236
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,870
Yes, it does.

237
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,360
There's a crack in the wall.

238
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,980
It seems to be connected to the outside.

239
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,990
[Pudu Temple]

240
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,900
When I sent someone to look for Jingren,

241
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,230
he was already nowhere to be found.

242
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:58,150
Who'd have known he was so malicious?

243
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,030
If the Baichuan Court and the Pudu Temple work together,

244
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,610
we can definitely find that murderer.

245
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:02,750
I hope so.

246
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,700
Namaste.

247
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,400
Ms. Qiao.

248
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,080
Do you recognize this handwriting?

249
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,520
It's Rou's handwriting.

250
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,750
You're obsessed with that sword.

251
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,620
I feel guilty about Ms. Qiao

252
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,090
but don't want you to have regrets.

253
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,220
So I'll take it out to let you have a look at it

254
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,980
and then put it back

255
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,040
before anyone notices it's missing.

256
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,900
Looks like Miss Rou was betrayed by her lover.

257
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,280
She swapped the Shaoshi Sword

258
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,480
so that her lover could have a look at it,

259
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:35,170
but that man had another plan

260
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,340
and killed her for the sword.

261
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:37,880
Yeah.

262
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,090
Rou was so foolish

263
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,960
and died for nothing.

264
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,090
Mr. Xiao, Mr. Fang,

265
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,180
can you lead my disciples back into the tunnel

266
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,340
to bring that girl's body up?

267
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:54,940
No problem.

268
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,340
Ms. Qiao, why don't you come with me to my room

269
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,930
and have some tea while waiting for them?

270
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,490
Mr. Li, come and join us.

271
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,069
Please.

272
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,390
So you've known each other for a long time.

273
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,310
Yes.

274
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:28,859
It doesn't matter when people meet.

275
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,810
Fate will bring them together eventually.

276
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,310
But it's a pity that when old friends meet,

277
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,839
they can't recognize each other.

278
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,990
What does that mean?

279
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,650
Have we met before, Mr. Li?

280
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,060
No.

281
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,530
Bhante Wuliao

282
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,140
is used to preaching

283
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,350
and loves to give lectures on life.

284
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,040
But personally,

285
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,000
I don't believe in any constant laws.

286
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,420
They're all just personal choices.

287
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,290
Everything is written in the stars

288
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,220
and we just need to go with the flow.

289
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,250
We reap what we sow,

290
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,900
so what's the point of escaping the inescapable?

291
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,620
Mr. Li, I bet you have a lot to say

292
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,230
to Ms. Qiao.

293
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,650
So stop wasting your time on me.

294
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,140
I'll mind my own business

295
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,890
and go explain sutras in the sutra hall.

296
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,060
You guys talk.

297
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,800
What do you want to say to me, Mr. Li?

298
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:40,770
Here's the thing.

299
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,260
When I was young,

300
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,110
I stayed in this temple for a while

301
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,070
and met a young monk

302
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,050
named Huiyuan.

303
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,710
Later I learned that he joined the Jinyuan Alliance

304
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,050
and changed his name to Shi Hun.

305
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,040
Shi Hun?

306
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,230
I've heard of that name.

307
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,630
I'll look into it for you.

308
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,080
Thank you, Ms. Qiao.

309
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,710
I'll refill the teapot.

310
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,420
No way.

311
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:49,950
Ms. Qiao.

312
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:51,590
Ms. Qiao?

313
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,520
Ms. Qiao, are you okay?

314
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,310
They may have come out.

315
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,960
I'll go ask about the person you mentioned.

316
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,350
I'll tell you if I find anything.

317
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,850
Since when have you become so withdrawn?

318
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,370
Why didn't you tell her who you are?

319
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,650
Do you think

320
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,600
you're not as good as your old self?

321
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:37,990
Director Di,

322
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,300
since when have you

323
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,820
become so nosy?

324
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:42,730
It's just interesting

325
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,120
to see you pining over a woman.

326
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,790
Don't let your love affair

327
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,840
hinder our plan.

328
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,000
Director Di,

329
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,680
I'm not interested in other people's affairs.

330
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,540
We'll leave once we know the whereabouts of Shi Hun.

331
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,510
[Pudu Temple]

332
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,550
Li Lianhua.

333
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,750
How's it going?

334
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,010
Have Mr. Xiao and Ms. Qiao gone back to the Baichuan Court?

335
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:03,900
Everything is done.

336
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,690
But Ms. Qiao said she saw someone outside the window

337
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:06,750
and went after him.

338
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,940
When we came out,

339
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,130
both she and that guy were gone.

340
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,510
We're looking for her now.

341
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:10,860
OK.

342
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,740
Let's split up.

343
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,230
Li Lianhua.

344
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,220
Li Lianhua

345
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,160
cares so much about Ms. Qiao.

346
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,070
I'm afraid his feelings will never be reciprocated.

347

[Wei Manor's Yipin Tomb]

348
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,500
[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

349
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:53,980
Miss Shi Shui.

350
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,340
Yang Yunchun,

351
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,010
what are you doing here?

352
00:21:59,010 --> 00:21:59,940
You're sneaky.

353
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,880
Miss Shi Shui, don't get me wrong.

354
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,410
I came to attend the Sword-Appreciation Ceremony

355
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,870
but got delayed on the way.

356
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,290
When I got here, I heard that the Shaoshi Sword was stolen.

357
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:11,220
Are you here to poke fun at us on behalf of the Supervision Bureau?

358
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:11,780
No.

359
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,200
Don't get me wrong.

360
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,340
We're not looking for the sword now.

361
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,910
We're looking for a person.

362
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:18,910
Miss Shi Shui.

363
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,960
Miss Shi Shui.

364
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:27,090
Are you looking for someone?

365
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,680
You know where she is.

366
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,610
I saw her going after a monk

367
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,220
and getting dragged away.

368
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,460
He seemed to be the fake monk

369
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,660
who stole the sword and killed the maid.

370
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,550
You stood by and watched.

371
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,500
Where was she taken?

372
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,170
I can see the murderous intent in your eyes.

373
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,360
I'm so glad.

374
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,500
Li Xiangyi is still alive.

375
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,300
You'd better not joke with me.

376
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,240
Where is Qiao Wanmian?

377
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,080
Rou told you that incense powder

378
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,360
can trigger my asthma.

379
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,660
You used it against me.

380
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,490
She always tells you everything.

381
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,780
She forced me.

382
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,530
I told you.

383
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,790
It's not that I don't want to return the Shaoshi Sword.

384
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,150
I just want to keep it for a few more days.

385
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,420
Who in the martial arts world

386
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,750
wouldn't want the best sword in the world?

387
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,420
You killed Rou

388
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:25,120
and you're still defending yourself like a coward.

389
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:25,680
Enough!

390
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,480
You sealed the mountain pass

391
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,570
and trapped me here.

392
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,470
I could only kidnap you.

393
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:35,340
I'll chop off one of your hands and give it to them.

394
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,340
Ms. Qiao, are you okay?

395
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,700
Why are you here, Mr. Li?

396
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,840
Everyone split up to search for you.

397
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,300
It's just a coincidence.

398
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,860
I'm not good at martial arts,

399
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,540
so I had to launch a sneak attack.

400
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,470
Let me untie you.

401
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,960
You're risking your life to save me.

402
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:16,970
I will remember

403
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,510
your kindness.

404
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,010
You're welcome.

405
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,330
This person is really shameless.

406
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,620
What treasure is this?

407
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,490
I'm not allowed to look at it?

408
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,090
A bangle.

409
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:46,210
This Green Phoenix Bangle is the Xiao family's heirloom.

410
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,620
It forms a pair with the Jade Flower Carvings

411
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,620
on my Pojun Sword.

412
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,770
So it's for your future wife.

413
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:53,290
What?

414
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:54,580
You have a crush?

415
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,470
I hit it on something just now.

416
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,840
I was afraid it might be damaged.

417
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,990
Luckily, it's fine.

418
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,230
Ms. Qiao.

419
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:07,630
It seems that you value this jade bangle very much.

420
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,930
Let's get out of here.

421
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,780
Be careful.

422
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:21,820
Xiangyi is gone.

423
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,880
The Sigu Sect has suffered great losses.

424
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,210
Why don't we dissolve the Sigu Sect today?

425
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,970
You want to dissolve Sigu Sect?

426
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,550
The two leaders are gone.

427
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,810
Our morale is gone too.

428
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,470
Why should we force ourselves to carry on?

429
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,860
Hang in there.

430
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,540
What's wrong?

431
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:55,900
I feel like Xiangyi came back.

432
00:25:58,570 --> 00:25:59,540
I regret it.

433
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:05,170
I shouldn't have written that letter to him.

434
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:07,500
You wrote to him a month ago?

435
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,480
He's a proud person.

436
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,430
But I said I would leave him.

437
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,110
But I was too tired.

438
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,780
I was so tired of chasing him.

439
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:28,110
[To Minister Yi]

440
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:43,180
I have enjoyed your love, protection,

441
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,230
and company for the past few years.

442
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,470
I will remember this forever.

443
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,900
I know you are generous.

444
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,020
It causes me admiration, pride,

445
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,320
but also fear.

446
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,260
You love the hubbub of the martial arts world.

447
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,430
You strive towards the pinnacle of the martial world.

448
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,780
I can only follow closely behind you,

449
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,450
exhausted.

450
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,620
You are as bright as the sun,

451
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,650
and as dazzling.

452
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,040
However,

453
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,860
who can look into the sun forever?

454
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,780
I'm tired.

455
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,540
I respect you,

456
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,140
but am unable to accompany you any further.

457
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,800
I can't love you like I used to.

458
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,780
I'll say goodbye to you with this letter.

459
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,020
May you

460
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,700
live healthy,

461
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,350
and carefree,

462
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,340
and fulfill your life's wishes.

463
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,000
Yours, Wan.

464
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,970
Li Xiangyi.

465
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:55,020
You only think that everyone relies on you and respects you.

466
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,550
But you don't know

467
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,300
you've become a burden to others.

468
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,380
I'm sorry, Wan.

469
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:21,890
Ms. Qiao.

470
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,490
I think the intersection between Pudu Temple and Baichuan Court

471
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:25,460
is too far away.

472
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,860
Let's hurry up.

473
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,380
Okay.

474
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,470
Watch the steps.

475
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:37,740
Ms. Qiao,

476
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:41,200
I heard from Mr. Xiao that you have asthma.

477
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,280
Why don't you sit down and rest?

478
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:43,850
Okay.

479
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:45,740
Slowly.

480
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:54,430
Wan.

481
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,420
How are you?

482
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,760
Xiangyi.

483
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,160
Xiangyi, you're here.

484
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:32,080
Are you willing to talk to me today?

485
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,370
You're still unwilling?

486
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,780
I know

487
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:47,880
you hate me.

488
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,300
Ms. Qiao,

489
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,700
don't think too much.

490
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,920
Let me send you home first.

491
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,460
No, I don't want to go.

492
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,660
I don't want to go back.

493
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:08,220
Xiangyi.

494
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,310
Don't go!

495
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,740
Xiangyi.

496
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,070
Do you remember this place?

497
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,220
At that time,

498
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,310
you didn’t say anything

499
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,730
and went to duel with that master.

500
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,030
I was worried and angry.

501
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,970
I told you not to show up in front of me again.

502
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,180
So I dug this tunnel to see you.

503
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:41,030
At that time, I wanted to make you happy.

504
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:45,810
But you always resented me for not understanding you.

505
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,010
And I

506
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,700
only had Sigu Sect on my mind.

507
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,750
I neglected your feelings.

508
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,090
You...

509
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,740
Why did you realize this so late?

510
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,240
It's too late, Xiangyi.

511
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,560
I can't find you.

512
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,840
I can't find you.

513
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,920
I can't wait for you either.

514
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,370
What should I do?

515
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,740
What should I do?

516
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,410
Wan.

517
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,680
Forget it.

518
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,260
Live the happy life you deserve.

519
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,470
Zijin always tells me the same thing.

520
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,220
But if I wait for you,

521
00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:00,340
there'll be one more person in this world that believes you're still alive.

522
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,060
Maybe...

523
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,900
Maybe then you can come back alive.

524
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,530
I've let you down.

525
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:18,250
I... I've also let down Zijin's genuine feelings.

526
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,530
I've let him down.

527
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,220
Did you find anything?

528
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:45,980
I've searched everywhere.

529
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,980
There's nothing.

530
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,310
Mian must have been caught by that scoundrel.

531
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,510
He might have gone down the mountain.

532
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,820
I'll go down the mountain now.

533
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,930
Inform the people of Baichuan Court

534
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:53,750
to go after them too.

535
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,150
OK.

536
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,150
Fei?

537
00:32:59,030 --> 00:32:59,960
Why are you here?

538
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,570
Let me ask you.

539
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,830
Did you see Ms. Qiao?

540
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,740
What does it have to do with me?

541
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,220
Wait.

542
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,080
Ms. Qiao has nothing to do with you.

543
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,340
Did you see Li Lianhua?

544
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,190
He said he was looking for someone, but he's gone too.

545
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,450
Did something happen?

546
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,810
You two are old friends.

547
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:14,460
You should care about where he went.

548
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,120
He told you we're old friends?

549
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:19,960
Interesting.

550
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:22,970
Make yourself clear!

551
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:25,270
Weird.

552
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,860
Xiangyi.

553
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,030
Xiangyi.

554
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:55,670
Xiangyi.

555
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:02,470
Ms. Qiao.

556
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,120
Ms. Qiao.

557
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,010
Are you okay?

558
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,130
You were crying and talking in your sleep

559
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:23,090
when you had an attack.

560
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:25,080
I have

561
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,340
some medicine on me.

562
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:29,100
It can relieve your pain.

563
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,679
This sachet...

564
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:44,070
Why do you have it?

565
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:45,780
You...

566
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,530
I accidentally found this sachet on the beach

567
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,060
when I was practising medicine at the East Sea.

568
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,320
Do you recognize this?

569
00:34:59,659 --> 00:35:03,100
Is this the only sachet you found?

570
00:35:06,659 --> 00:35:09,920
Many people were dead in the sea.

571
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,820
This sachet

572
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:14,020
was found

573
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,220
on one of the corpses.

574
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,190
What's wrong, Ms. Qiao?

575
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,450
What did he look like?

576
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:27,560
What did the person you saw look like?

577
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:35,530
I remember it very clearly.

578
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,540
But I remember

579
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,260
he was around 20 years old.

580
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,520
I couldn't see his face clearly.

581
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:48,770
There seemed to be a string of Buddha beads on his left wrist.

582
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,490
I got those for him.

583
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,140
It turns out he's your friend.

584
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:11,700
At that time,

585
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:14,190
I had to turn back and ask for help.

586
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,820
To my surprise,

587
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,100
when I came back,

588
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,550
he had already been carried away by the waves.

589
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,980
Now that I think about it,

590
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,060
I'm regretful.

591
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,180
Stop it.

592
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,130
When did you

593
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,340
find him?

594
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,140
Come to think of it,

595
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,060
it's been about ten years.

596
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,730
I'm sorry, Mian.

597
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,820
I always hurt you.

598
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,270
I can't make it up to you.

599
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,060
Zijin loves you wholeheartedly.

600
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,860
I can see that you also love him.

601
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,850
Don't make it hard for yourself.

602
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:32,120
You must be happy in the future.

603
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:34,520
Ms. Qiao.

604
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,090
Let me send you back first.

605
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,190
Stop!

606
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:42,940
Don't touch her!

607
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,930
What does Mr. Xiao want?

608
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,700
He's trying to harm Mian.

609
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,560
He deserves it.

610
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,380
If anything happens to Mian,

611
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:52,390
I'll kill him.

612
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:55,130
You're hurting people without getting the facts straight.

613
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,440
You're from Sigu Sect?

614
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,900
Sigu Sect was dissolved ten years ago.

615
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,430
What are you talking about?

616
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,150
I want to take this scoundrel with me.

617
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,080
Mr. Xiao, you're too domineering.

618
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,820
Baichuan Court gives Tianji Hall

619
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,570
leeway.

620
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:09,030
If you dare to bully my friend,

621
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,420
don't blame me for turning nasty.

622
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,300
Mr. Xiao, don't get me wrong.

623
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,350
I just ran into Ms. Qiao

624
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:19,330
when she was kidnapped in the tunnel,

625
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,460
so I followed her in.

626
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,860
How dare you make up stories about saving a damsel in distress?

627
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,620
How dare you!

628
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,140
Zijin, stop!

629
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,080
I won't argue with you.

630
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,680
I'll take her back.

631
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,260
Come here.

632
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,770
What's wrong with Xiao Zijin?

633
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:49,110
The young master of Tianji Hall is really powerful.

634
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:52,270
But now that you've gotten on a master's bad side,

635
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,860
how can you enter Baichuan Court?

636
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,980
I just can't stand him relying on his position

637
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,100
to bully others.

638
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,290
I don't care.

639
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,170
How are you?

640
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,970
I'm fine.

641
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:12,790
Brother.

642
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:14,990
How is Ms. Qiao?

643
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,820
She had an asthma attack.

644
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,780
Luckily, she took Physician Li's medicine.

645
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,640
She's fine now.

646
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,100
Didn't Ms. Qiao say anything else?

647
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,580
Why did Physician Li rush to save her?

648
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,620
Didn't she think

649
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:30,420
Physician Li seemed familiar?

650
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:30,920
Biqiu.

651
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,010
What do you want to ask?

652
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,450
Don't you think

653
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:41,090
Li Lianhua looks a little like

654
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:42,840
Sect Leader?

655
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,360
To heal someone from Bicha Poison,

656
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,820
besides taking the unique antidote in time,

657
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:52,110
the other way is Wuliao's Brahman golden needles.

658
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,240
Over the years,

659
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,770
there have been many swindlers pretending to be Sect Leader.

660
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:57,980
If Wuliao healed him

661
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:58,990
through the Brahman arts,

662
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:00,490
why didn't he tell us?

663
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,680
Yes, Biqiu.

664
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:03,680
I think

665
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:06,130
his age, physique, and martial arts skills

666
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:08,050
don't match Sect Leader's.

667
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:10,050
They only have similar eyes and eyebrows.

668
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:12,380
But on closer look, they don't look alike.

669
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,790
Brother, I think

670
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,500
I should sound him out again.

671
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,720
It's all because of me

672
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,240
that Sect Leader...

673
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,020
Yun Biqiu, how dare you bring it up?

674
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,630
Bicha poison is so vicious.

675
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,400
It not only disperses people's martial power,

676
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,980
but also cause brain problems and drive them to death by madness.

677
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,870
You know that,

678
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:34,450
but you still poisoned Sect Leader.

679
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:36,510
You deserve to die hundreds of times for what you did.

680
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,360
All right.

681
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,000
Let bygones be bygones.

682
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,150
Only the four of us know about

683
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,890
Sect Leader being poisoned by Bicha Poison.

684
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:44,820
Don't spread it.

685
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,160
He didn't mean to hurt Sect Leader.

686
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,920
He was just bewitched by that demoness.

687
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,850
Every time he has seen someone who looks like Sect Leader

688
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,560
over the past few years,

689
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:07,350
he would check him out.

690
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,900
I will never forgive

691
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,100
what he did back then.

692
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:13,550
This...

693
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:17,730
[General Temple]

694
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,100
Physician Li.

695
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,780
It's the Masters.

696
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,320
Don't get up, you're infirm.

697
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,030
I'm embarrassed.

698
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,990
Thanks to Physician Li,

699
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,060
we were able to find Shaoshi yesterday.

700
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,770
I brought it here today

701
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,620
so you can take a look for yourself.

702
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,230
Please go ahead.

703
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:55,950
You are really good at joking.

704
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,170
I don't deserve this sword.

705
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,640
You're exaggerating.

706
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:00,580
Try it.

707
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,580
It's okay.

708
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,950
I'll give it a try.

709
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,940
I'm embarrassed.

710
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:52,630
I can't pull out this sword.

711
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:55,490
I think it's a great honor

712
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:57,990
just to be able to touch the sword.

713
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,340
Please keep it safely.

714
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,770
It's very heavy.

715
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:08,100
We were inconsiderate.

716
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:10,050
Physician Li is infirm.

717
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,330
You can't wield this sword.

718
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:14,010
Good sword.

719
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:17,470
Physician Li,

720
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,900
I have a small question.

721
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:25,560
Why don't you show your face?
