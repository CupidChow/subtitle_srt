00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:52,420
Why?

176
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,680
How could it dissolve?

177
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,500
What's wrong with me?

178
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:01,980
Why?

179
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,300
Only Princess Xuan's bloodline

180
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,310
can destroy the mother Karmic Bug.

181
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:10,690
Could it be...

182

184
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,980
the true descendant

185
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,980
of Prince Fangji and Princess Xuan?

186
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:42,980
Impossible.

187
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,730
Absolutely impossible.

188
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,260
I have Consort Xuan's token.

189
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,960
Nanyin's totem is engraved on the jade pendant.

190
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:54,950
Look.

191
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,540
Take a good look.

192
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,810
I am the descendant of Consort Xuan,

193
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,340
the Supreme Lord of Nanyin.

194
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,180
Feng Qing, you recognized me because of this.

195
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,460
Also,

196
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,280
this scar on my wrist

197
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,660
is the important clue you've been looking for.

198
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,830
Do you dare to say

199
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,670
I'm not the one you're looking for?

200
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,970
Ridiculous.

201
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,180
Shan Gudao,

202
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,400
do you really think you're a nobleman from Nanyin?

203
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,840
You were just a little beggar

204
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,710
Qi Mushan and I

205
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,330
took from a group of beggars.

206
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,490
I can tell you now

207
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,680
what really happened.

208
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,980
Back then, Qi Mushan

209
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,110
and Li Xiangyi's father were best friends.

210
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,490
The Li family used to live in seclusion.

211
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,480
But one day, in order to save someone,

212
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,830
they angered the bandits in the mountain.

213
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,280
The bandits attacked the Li family overnight

214
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,720
and killed the Li family.

215
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,460
Only two sons survived

216
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,590
and they were left on the streets.

217
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,540
After Qi Mushan and I found out about the disaster,

218
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,140
we searched for the two sons.

219
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,570
Unfortunately,

220
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,800
when we found them,

221
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,870
Li Xiangxian, the eldest son of the Li family, had passed away from sickness.

222
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,990
This jade pendant is all I have.

223
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,190
I'll give it to you.

224
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,780
Please take care of

225
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,120

Two sons.

229
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,480

-We had no choice but bring back
-Xiangxian.

231
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,290
Li Xiangyi, who was less than four years old, from the group of beggars,

232
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,090
and

233
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,580
the little beggar who was close in age to Li Xiangxian

234
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,940
that guarded Li Xiangyi.

235
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,560
Is this Xiangxian?

236
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,420
Who are you?

237

-You are Shan Gudao.

239
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,390
I'm Li Xiangyi.

240
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,450
You said you would be my brother.

241
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,950
That jade pendant belongs to you.

242
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,630
This little beggar was you.

243
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,260
Nonsense!

244
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,780
It's all nonsense.

245
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,650
How come I never knew about this?

246
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,420
Madam,

247
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,340
are you lying?

248
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,460
Fine.

249
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,420
Let me ask you.

250
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,760
How much do you remember from the time

251
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,670
before we took you to Yunyin Mountain?

252
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,950
You don't remember, do you?

253
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:33,440
When your master and I saved you,

254
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,320
your hand was injured.

255
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,390
This injury on your wrist

256
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,190
caused you to have a high fever and fall unconscious.

257
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,270
When you woke up,

258
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,280
you lost most of your memory.

259
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,220
As for Xiangyi,

260
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,740
he was still a child.

261
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,490
He was not old enough to remember things,

262
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,060
so it's natural

263
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,910
he can't remember some things.

264
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,420
The Feng clan

265
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,900
have searched for Princess Xuan's descendant

266
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,620
for over a hundred years.

267
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,940
Until 20 years ago,

268
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,630
we learned that Princess Xuan's grandson

269
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,700
had a ten-year-old son

270
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,860
studying under Qi Mushan.

271
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,740
With this clue,

272
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,700
the royal Nanyin jade pendant,

273
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,310
and the mark on his body,

274
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,390
I welcomed back my master.

275
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,220
In the end, it's all wrong.

276
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:33,980

277
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,460
you are my true master.

278
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,710
This was why Shan Gudao's blood

279
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,470
didn't work on the Karmic Bug.

280
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,260
Only Li Lianhua's blood could destroy it.

281
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:08,830
I don't believe it.

282

00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,470
it's been ten years.

286
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,550
Do you know how much effort I put in?

287
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:22,990
What about you?

288
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,220
You just say it's a misunderstanding

289
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,330
and a joke.

290
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,490

Why should all the good things belong to you?

No one has ever competed with you.

294
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,250
It's just your own obsession.

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,890
He's my biological father, after all.

347
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,380
I still feel bad

348
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,830
seeing his tragic end.

349
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:39,740
If...

350
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,860
There's no if.

351
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,750
No need to look back.

352
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:49,160
Xiaobao,

353
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,410
you've improved a lot

354
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:52,670
through this journey.

355
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,310
Compared to back then,

356
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,440
when you were a kid

357
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,660
using a wooden sword

358
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,230
and claiming to be Li Xiangyi's student,

359
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,690
you're much stronger now.

360
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,680
As your teacher,

361
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,860
I am very pleased.

362
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,700
Stop taking advantage of me.

363
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,900
I'm not your student.

364
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,000
You don't respect your master at all.

365
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,580
Then, Master,

366
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,660
what do you plan on doing now?

367
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,180
I need to find some pieces of wood

368
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,960
to repair my shabby building.

369
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,730
After repairing your shabby building,

370
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:22,460
what's next?

371
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,180
Director Di.

372
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,810
Director Di,

373
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,220
you need to fix your bad habit

374
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,480
of eavesdropping.

375
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,430
You've done everything you wanted to.

376
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,690
What’s your next plan?

377
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,940
From now on...

378
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,620
Look.

379
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,300
I'll find a place to get some sun.

380
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,230
I'll go fishing.

381
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,740
How comfortable!

382
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,390
I won't let you live such a carefree life.

383
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,190
Styx Flower.

384
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,370
First, it's to repay you.

385
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,610
Second, it's to remind you

386
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,090
that we have another battle.

387
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:55,330
I thought we're friends now.

388
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,450
So what if we're friends or foe?

389
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,410
Don’t try to cheat in our battle.

390
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,840
The Styx Flower and Yin and Yang leaves are all here.

391
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,630
The Yin Leaf is too strong alone.

392
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,840
You'll die from your Genuine Qi exploding.

393
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,140
If you take it with the Yang Leaf,

394
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,490
it can cure this aggressive effect

395
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:12,740
and remove the poison in your body

396
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,740
to save your life.

397
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,020
Director Di,

398
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,600
you searched for this all your life.

399
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,030
You're willing to give it to me?

400
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,230
See you at the East Sea

401
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,260
in half a month.

402
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,640
The great battle at the East Sea half a month later?

403
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,260
I was right.

404
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,700
Di Feisheng

405
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,230
is giving up on his own dream

406
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,330
for you to live on.

407
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,960
At least he has a conscience.

408
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,560
Li Lianhua,

409
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,510
after struggling for so long,

410
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:43,300
you finally have the Styx Flower.

411
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,500
Your poison can finally be detoxified.

412
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,460
The Styx Flower is indeed a magical cure,

413
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,620
but I've had the Bicha Poison

414
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,610
for many years.

415
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,390
The Styx Flower

416
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,790
has at most

417
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,660
a 30 percent chance to cure it.

418
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,350
Even 10 percent is a chance.

419
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,540
Let's go find Guan Hemeng now.

420
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,090
He must know how to use the Styx Flower.

421
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,660
Why should we find Guan Hemeng?

422
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,190
I'm a miracle physician, aren't I?

423
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:05,630
You...

424
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,380
But recently,

425
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,890
my internal power is unstable.

426
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,550
I need to adjust it

427
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,230
before the Styx Flower can be used.

428
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,670
Don't worry.

429
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,020
Fine.

430
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,690
It's indeed not good to feast after starving.

431
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,280
I'll put the Styx Flower away

432
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,500
so that you can recover in peace.

433
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:27,740
No.

434
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:30,150
I have to find a Thousand-gear Lock first.

435
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:32,290
This way, no one will try to steal the Styx Flower.

436
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,210
Don't worry.

437
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,460
With you guarding it,

438
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,520
no one can steal it.

439
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,700
We have to make sure nothing goes wrong

440
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,300
so that we can be more at ease.

441
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,590
I've thought about it.

442
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,100
After you detoxify the poison,

443
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,350
we'll solve all the mysterious cases

444
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,690
and explore the martial world together.

445
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,200
Come on.

446
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,020
To encourage you,

447
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,220
here's candy for you.

448
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:51,540
I wish you longevity

449
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,830
and for all illnesses to be cured.

450
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,380
Thanks.

451
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:54,410
I'll do it myself.

452
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,370
[Tianji Mountain Manor]

453
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,300
Mother.

454
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,500
You're finally back.

455
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,350
Yang is here too.

456
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:08,220
Fang.

457
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,200
Li.

458
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:12,900
Your father went to the palace to care for the emperor and still isn't back.

459
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,630
The seasons are changing soon.

460
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,870
I wonder if he brought enough clothes.

461
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:17,620
So,

462
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,100
Lord Yang was passing by.

463
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,980
I asked Lord Yang to bring some clothes

464
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,180
for your father.

465
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,660
Care for the emperor?

466
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,230
My father has been in the palace for this long?

467
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:26,980
Lord Yang,

468
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,700
how is His Majesty?

469
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,460
The Imperial Hospital gave many prescriptions.

470
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,980
His Majesty is getting better,

471
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,280
but he has been in low spirits.

472
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,880
He still needs to rest in bed.

473
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,690
Fortunately, several lords

474
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,350
are accompanying His Majesty these days.

475
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,540
It's just that Lord Fang will be unable

476
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,070
to leave the palace for now.

477
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:43,680
I have work to do,

478
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,300
so I’ll take my leave now.

479
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:46,450
Take care.

480
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:57,780
Yang.

481
00:31:59,260 --> 00:31:59,680
Li.

482
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,310
Are you able to

483
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,570
bring people to see His Majesty in the palace?

484
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,640
Your Majesty, greetings from Fang Duobing.

485
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:29,940
Fang Duobing?

486
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:35,880
Official Fang,

487
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,270
you are a cultured and educated man.

488
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,640
How could you

489
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,390
name your son like this?

490
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,100
Your Majesty,

491
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,610
I wasn't home when he was born.

492
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,960
My wife said

493
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,530
he was sickly

494
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,860
and might not survive,

495
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,620
so she nicknamed him Duobing.

496
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,560
After that,

497
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,980
we never gave him an official name.

498
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:59,360
Official Fang, you are loyal to the country,

499
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,980
but you treat your wife and children so lightly.

500
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,180
It's inappropriate.

501
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,210
How dare you!

502
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,440
At this point,

503
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,250
you still dare to hide it from me?

504
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,490
Fang Duobing is the son

505
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,200
of the rebel, Shan Gudao.

506
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,570
Am I wrong?

507
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,480
Your Majesty.

508
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,350
My son didn't know much about his background before.

509
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,550
He has no connections with Shan Gudao.

510
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:24,710
Your Majesty.

511
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:28,680
I know my birth father, Shan Gudao, committed a grave crime.

512
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,750
As his son,

513
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,500
I can't escape punishment,

514
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,650
but this has nothing to do with the Fang family.

515
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,010
Your Majesty, please be just.

516
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,630
If you wish to punish someone,

517
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:38,200
please punish me alone.

518
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,810
I will accept it willingly

519
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,740
and without any complaints.

520
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,070
Father,

521
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,310
this isn't what you said before.

522
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:46,300
If it weren’t for Fang Duobing

523
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,810
and the others who came to help,

524
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,110
the consequences would've been unimaginable.

525
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,620
You can't punish the Fang family.

526
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,150
Silence.

527
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,060
Guards!

528
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,890
Take the princess and Minister Fang away.

529
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:55,710
Father.

530
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:05,740
Rise.

531
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,760
Thank you, Your Majesty.

532
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:11,989
Fang Duobing,

533
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,320
you say you want me to punish you alone?

534
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,540
But you can't clear the others' crimes

535
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,230
just with your words.

536
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,199
Please enlighten me, Your Majesty.

537
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:26,719
I heard that the son of the Fang family

538
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:28,830
has improved greatly.

539
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,719
He solved many cases in the martial world.

540
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:35,699
Some of them are related to Nanyin.

541
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,690
Tell me in detail

542
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,489
and I will make my judgment.

543
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,139
Then I will recount everything I have seen and heard

544
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:44,270
from the beginning.

545
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,639
More than a hundred years ago,

546
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,050
Nanyin was destroyed,

547
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:55,540
but the imperial family's followers did not give up.

548
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:02,360
That's the whole story.

549
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,120
How did you know about this?

550
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,300
We started investigating after we discovered

551
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,470
the first Rama Heavenly Ice in Yuanbao Villa

552
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,260
and analyzed the clues step by step.

553
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,320
But we did not understand the full story

554
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,580
until we saw the murals

555
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,270
in the Pagoda of Bliss.

556
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,430
Fang Duobing.

557
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,490
You said you saw the murals in the abandoned pagoda,

558
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,390
but I've already sent someone to investigate it.

559
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:24,080
The abandoned palace has been flattened

560
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,640
and the vanished pagoda had not reappeared.

561
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:29,220
How can you prove

562
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,550
that you're telling the truth?

563
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,390
Ask His Majesty,

564
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,190
in the palace's recent murder case

565
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,720
that everyone knows about,

566
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:43,780
what was the cause

567
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,920
for the deaths of Lu Fang's group

568
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,840
and Liu Kehe?

569
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:48,460
Your Majesty,

570
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,550
there was a murder case in the palace

571
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:52,280
that caused a great commotion.

572
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:55,200
Have you found the cause for Lu Fang's group

573
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,640
and Supervisor Liu Kehe's death?

574
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,400
If you don't know,

575
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,760
I have an answer.

576
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,360
Lu Fang's group of four once found

577
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,190
a dried well filled with treasures in the palace

578
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,850
and mistook it as the legendary Pagoda of Bliss.

579
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,680
When Shan Gudao heard about this,

580
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,680
he became greedy.

581
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,200
He captured the four to seize the treasures

582
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,860
to strengthen the Wansheng Clan and dominate the martial arts world.

583
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,500
Fortunately, Supervisor Liu Kehe

584
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,900
discovered this in time.

585
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,340
He killed the four people

586
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,380
and protected the order in the palace,

587
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,860
but he died, unfortunately.

588
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,670
Shan Gudao's scheme failed

589
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,430
and was finally executed.

590
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,720
This is the truth of the Pagoda of Bliss

591
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,640
and will be the truth in historical records.

592
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,650
This is the whole truth of the Pagoda of Bliss case

593
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,260
and a truthful recount of everything I know.

594
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:00,540
Good.

595
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:03,230
This case was solved well.

596
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,370
I'm very satisfied.

597
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,500
Whether it's the Pagoda of Bliss,

598
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,510
or treasures,

599
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,240
this matter is over now.

600
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,940
If you leak a single word out,

601
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:14,690
I'll kill the entire Fang family.

602
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:16,790
Yes.

603
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:17,900
All right.

604
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:20,300
Ask your friend outside to come in.

605
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,510
Although I'm old,

606
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,010
my mind is still clear.

607
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,140
I pardon you for trespassing the palace this time.

608
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,810
Greetings, Your Majesty.

609
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,470
Fang Duobing,

610
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,580
you may leave.

611
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:46,150
I want to speak to Li Lianhua alone.

612
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,660
Well...

613
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:15,770
[Imperial Study]

614
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,980
His Majesty's decree.

615
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:21,380
The Fang family and Tianji Hall Sect contributed to saving His Majesty.

616
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:24,250
Fang Zeshi, Minister of the Ministry of Revenue,

617
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,890
is loyal and virtuous.

618
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,100
He is granted a thousand acres of land

619
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,660
and ten thousand taels of gold.

620
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,810
Considering his contribution in accompanying the emperor,

621
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,400
he is allowed to leave the palace for a rest.

622
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,850
Thank you, Your Majesty.

623
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,600
I knew Father would be a fair emperor.

624
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,910
Fang Zeshi's son, Fang Duobing, is wise and brave.

625
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:46,670
He is talented,

626
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,390
but his ambition is in the martial arts world

627
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:50,660
and doesn't like the court.

628
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,800
He is granted to travel around the world,

629
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,890
patrol the mountains and rivers for the emperor,

630
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:57,090
and settle the injustices in the world.

631
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:00,620
The marriage with Princess Zhaoling will be discussed another day.

632
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,300
Best regards.

633
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,430
I accept the decree.

634
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:10,000
Will be discussed another day?

635
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:12,490
Why does Father want to discuss it another day?

636
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:14,220
I'm going to argue with him now.

637
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:15,390
Princess.

638
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,000
Thank you for speaking up for me and the Fang family.

639
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,060
But with my current status,

640
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,040
it's no longer suitable for me

641
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:28,020
to interact more with you or the court.

642
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,260
Let's say

643
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,410
we are not meant to be.

644
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:39,290
Fang Duobing, you...

645
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,800
Fang Duobing.

646
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,350
Do you really love the martial world?

647
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:52,790
Yes.

648
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:54,530
What if

649
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,070
I can persuade Father?

650
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:01,050
Would you still be unwilling to stay in the palace for me

651
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,650
and be an official?

652
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,340
Since you don't like it,

653
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,850
I won't force you.

654
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,630
Leave.

655
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,650
I've set you free.

656
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,340
Take care.

657
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,060
Princess.

658
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:02,880
Who knows

659
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,150
what will happen in the future?

660
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,670
Don't forget your words.

661
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:09,700
Okay.

662
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,590
I'll wait for you.

663
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,260
When you've experienced enough of the martial world,

664
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,720
come back and be my prince.

His Majesty knows you are the son of Prince Fangji.

686
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:06,720
♫I'll write a poem about old friends departing with me♫

687
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,830
He didn't give you a hard time about it?

688
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:09,520
His Majesty is benevolent and kind.

689
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,960
♫It's just to choose♫

690
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:13,010
♫An ending that I like♫

691
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,540
He cares for the people.

692
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,670
He's a good emperor.

693
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:14,040
On the other hand, I'm just a dying man.

694
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:16,410
I'm nobody important to him.

695
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:17,950
♫Ask a question about the joys and sorrows of the lotus flower♫

696
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,020
Even a wise emperor

697
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:21,770
♫Break a sword and throw it into the mud♫

698
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:19,590
would not be softhearted

699
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,990
towards any possibility

700
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,990
that could affect his throne.

701
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:24,120
♫Only when you're over your worries♫

702
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:29,010
♫Can you live up to all beings♫

703
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,830
Alright, Fang Xiaobao.

704
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,580
You're right.

705
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,830
Actually, I told His Majesty

706
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:33,780
I took something from the Pagoda of Bliss.

707
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,380
If anything happens to us,

708
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,100
this friend

709
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:39,230
will reveal it to the public.

710
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:40,420
Nonsense.

711
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,510
When did you take anything from the Pagoda of Bliss?

712
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:45,240
You've fooled me so many times.

713
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,400
You still think I'll believe you?

714
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,870
You even dare to lie to His Majesty.

715
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,520
You're indeed

716
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:53,660
the Physician Li who can cure the dead.

717
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:54,160
Not bad.

718
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,390
You've grown up.

719
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:00,870
Look.

720
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,860
In this prosperous world,

721
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:04,560
everything is at peace now.

722
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:05,620
Let me ask you,

723
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,330
who is more suitable than him

724
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:10,750
to be the emperor?

725
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:12,310
Besides,

726
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,300
if I have time,

727
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:16,010
I have to repair my Lotus Tower

728
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,660
and plant all kinds of radish.

729
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:18,790
That would be great.

730
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,410
♫The long night accompanies the moon on the rooftop♫

731
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:20,570
After all this,

732
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:22,530
have you rested enough?

733
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:23,260
♫Push aside the clouds to count the stars♫

734
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,130
♫Old worries are so far away yet so close♫

735
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:26,450
When are you going to use Styx Flower for your poison?

736
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,140
♫Since ancient times, how many heroes could♫

737
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:27,870
This is the important matter.

738
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:29,190
There's no rush at all.

739

♫gamble their lives♫

740
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:32,230

♫to win against the odds of love♫

742
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,230
There's one more thing I need to resolve.

743
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:38,590
♫Ask a question about the joys and sorrows of the lotus flower♫

744
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:37,630
Here.

745
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:38,480
Drink.

746
