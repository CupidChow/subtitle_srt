00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Kissing myself thousands of times

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The most reluctant moment is that moment

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Right on the edge of the world

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who has never wandered a mile

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Who does not know that the clouds scattered in the sky and the earth are like the moon

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Right on the edge of the world

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The youth is flustered and the youth is not drunk like a grudge

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The world is like a dream

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Right on the edge of the world

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Who has never wandered a mile

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Who does not know that the clouds scattered in the sky and the earth are like the moon

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Right on the edge of the world

The youth is flustered and the youth is not drunk like a grudge

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The wind is strong up there. Put it on.

20
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Okay.

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'll go.

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay.

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'll go.

24
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'll go.

25
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'll go.

26
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'll go.

27
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'll go.

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'll go.

29
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'll go.

30
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'll go.

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'll go.

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'll go.

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Thank you.

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I know you're going to the temple.

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Have you really decided?

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
There are things that I have to solve by myself.

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I can only solve them.

38
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I can only solve them.

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I can only solve them.

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I can only solve them.

41
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I can only solve them.

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I can only solve them.

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I can only solve them.

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I can only solve them.

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I can only solve them.

46
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I can only solve them.

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Everyone, have you heard?

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The head of the Four Ancient Sects, Li Xiangyi, is still alive.

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Really?

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This traitor, Yun Biqiu

51
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
has repeatedly colluded with the Jiali Bridge

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and almost subverted the whole martial arts world.

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Fortunately, the head of the Four Ancient Sects, Li Xiangyi

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
has been able to get out of the martial arts world

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and prevented this big chaos.

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I heard that the Four Ancient Sects

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
are going to interrogate the traitor, Yun Biqiu.

58
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Why don't we go together and be witnesses?

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Let's go.

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Let's go together.

61
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Let's go.

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
These letters are all sent out

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
in the daily letters of the Baichuan Courtyard.

64
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The letters are all sent out

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
in the daily letters of the Baichuan Courtyard.

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You have handed over all the location

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
of the Baichuan Courtyard

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
and the defense of the position of the 188th prison.

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What else do you want to say?

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Biqiu, Biqiu.

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Ten years ago,

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
you were bewitched by the beauty of the Jiali Bridge.

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
These years,

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
you have been unable to leave the house

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
and have been suffering.

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I really thought

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
you were just trying to ruin your country.

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I didn't expect that

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
ten years ago,

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
you were still so stubborn

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
and didn't even realize it.

82
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
For that witch,

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
you actually

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
attacked the sect leader for the second time.

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The Baichuan Courtyard

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:48,740
has been known for its

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
strict punishment.

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Kill him.

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Kill him.

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Kill him.

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Kill him.

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Kill him.

93
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Kill him.

94
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Kill him.

95
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Kill him.

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Kill him.

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Five.

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Kill him.

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
As one of the private courtyards of the Baichuan Courtyard,

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yun Biqiu

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
has been harming the martial arts world

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
and committing treason.

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He tried to harm the sect leader five times.

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
He is unforgivable.

105
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The Baichuan Courtyard

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
has always been strict in punishment

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and never gave in to it.

108
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So, from today onwards,

109
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yun Biqiu will be expelled from the Baichuan Courtyard.

110
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But,

111
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
the crime he committed

112
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
is a life-or-death matter.

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Please witness it.

114
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yun Biqiu,

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
you have come to this point

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
because you saved yourself.

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Today, I will clean up the four sects

118
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
and the Baichuan Courtyard.

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I will avenge the sect leader

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
and the brothers and sisters

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
who have passed away.

122
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Get out.

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I said get out.

124
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,440
What are you doing?

125
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,440
,

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Single-minded man.

127
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Get you serving in the outside world

128
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
and you can guard the Baichuan Court well.

129
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
No?

130
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Then,

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
a death

132
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
means our family

133
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
won't have thered woulde

134
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
to be our shield.

135
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So,

136
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'll take that if it is so.

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Alright.

138
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's so hot.

139
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's so hot.

140
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Greetings, Master.

141
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Greetings, Master.

142
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Everyone, get up.

143
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm not the Master of the Four Gu Sects anymore.

144
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
No matter what, you are our Master.

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We will follow you until we die.

146
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Is this what you want to see?

147
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Hanfu,

148
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
teach everyone to get up.

149
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Hanfu.

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Hanfu.

151
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Bichuo.

152
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I didn't die.

153
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Why are you being so persistent?

154
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Master.

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm sorry, Master.

156
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Because I was already poisoned,

157
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I have no shame to live in the jail.

158
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,200
What about the good things you did?

159
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,240
Why didn't you mention it?

160
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,920
You misled the people

161
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,920
and used the 188 fishing boats as bait.

162
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,960
You deceived Jialiqiao's trust

163
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,240
and found out all his faults.

164
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,360
You secretly gave this news to Fang Luo Bin.

165
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,280
So that day,

166
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,600
everyone dared to save me.

167
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
It was you

168
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,720
who faked your indulgence in the beauty.

169
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,360
You let Jialiqiao

170
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,600
let go of his guard.

171
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,800
You seduced him to design the mechanism to leak out the hole.

172
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,040
You destroyed half of the foundation of the valley.

173
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,640
Am I right?

174
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,440
Sect Leader,

175
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,880
is everything you said true?

176
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,480
Go...

177
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,080
Everyone,

178
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,600
these are all orders of the mastermind

179
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,840
in the convenience store,

180
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,580
design the mechanism

181
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,880
derived from Jiao Liqiao's executeًs.

182
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,440
The撁筆 breeding plan is stored here.

183
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,920
We need to check it.

184
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,800
Anyone who would master the design of the mechanism

185
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,080
will know where theever speeds are made from.

186
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,600
All the accounts are exposed.

187
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
It's obvious.

188
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,880
Anyone who knows the design

189
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,880
knows that this mechanism should be hidden.

190
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
And this mechanism...

191
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,880
This mechanism

192
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,600
was put up on purpose

193
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
to show people.

194
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,120
He also bought

195
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,800
a dozen of gas and medicine outside the yard

196
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,800
to avoid a bloody battle.

197
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,600
So this is it.

198
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
This is it.

199
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
This is it.

200
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
This is it.

201
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
Li Qiu.

202
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Why didn't you tell everyone

203
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,600
that you did this?

204
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
Back then,

205
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,600
my master was poisoned by me.

206
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
And

207
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
I stabbed him with a sword.

208
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Fifty-eight brothers of the Four-Bones Sect

209
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,600
died because of me.

210
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
No matter what I do,

211
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,600
I can't make up for my sins.

212
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,600
Li Qiu.

213
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
You stabbed me that day.

214
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
You were half-dead on purpose.

215
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
You had a grudge against me that day.

216
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,600
I wanted to tell you about these information.

217
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,600
But I didn't expect that

218
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
Jiao Li Qiao

219
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
had been secretly

220
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
sending people to spy on you.

221
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
I'm not talking about that year.

222
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
I'm sorry

223
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
about now.

224
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,600
Only by stabbing me

225
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,600
can Jiao Li Qiao

226
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,600
put down the guard.

227
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,600
And the mechanism you set

228
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
won't be suspicious anymore.

229
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
So

230
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
you helped me

231
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
find the residence of Jiao Li Qiao

232
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
and beat him up.

233
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,600
What you did

234
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
wasn't your intention.

235
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
Since you have a sense of remorse,

236
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,600
let all this

237
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
pass.

238
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,600
Man Chu.

239
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
Man Chu.

240
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,600
I don't deserve your mercy.

241
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Master Yun.

242
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,600
To prove for you

243
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,600
that the man called Li Xiang Yi

244
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,600
has to come back alive.

245
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,600
And the man called Li Lian Hua

246
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,600
can no longer be the one

247
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
who can be free and free

248
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
and go around the world.

249
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
Man Chu.

250
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,600
How is he?

251
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
Xue Rong Hua.

252
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,600
Who is Xue Rong Hua?

253
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,600
It's Xue Gong's evil master.

254
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,600
I think Jiao Li Qiao

255
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,600
did it to control Bi Qiu.

256
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,600
If you want to stop this poison,

257
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,600
the only way is

258
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
to use Xue Rong Hua's inner power

259
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
to move his blood vessels.

260
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
Otherwise,

261
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
he will die from the poison.

262
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,600
Jiao Li Qiao and Xue Gong are dead.

263
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,600
Xue Rong Hua has been

264
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
dead in the world.

265
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
Then, then Bi Qiu, he

266
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
he

267
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,600
he can't stand it for a few days.

268
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
He knew it.

269
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,600
He didn't want me

270
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,600
to kill Xue Gong that day.

271
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,600
Xiaobao.

272
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
I don't know if there is

273
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,600
a secret room of Tianqi Hall nearby.

274
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Can you help us

275
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,600
to find a way

276
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
to dissolve Xue Rong Hua?

277
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
Okay. I'll contact you here.

278
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
You guys can go out first.

279
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,600
We'll make plans

280
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,600
after Bi Qiu wakes up.

281
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
Go.

282
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
I had to dig my own heart.

283
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,600
But Li Xiang Yi said

284
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,600
he would save all the people of the Four Kingdoms.

285
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,600
The fire of the blood vessel

286
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,600
killed 58 brothers and killed Dong An.

287
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,600
Now the Four Kingdoms are in the same boat.

288
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
There is a chance

289
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,600
to meet Xue Gong in the netherworld.

290
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
It's better to have some

291
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,600
useful information.

292
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,600
When people were young,

293
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,600
they shouldn't have wasted their time.

294
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,600
Now the people here

295
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,600
are using money to do something serious.

296
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,600
They have to spend half a year of their lives.

297
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
Master.

298
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,600
You're awake.

299
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
You helped me

300
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
to kill Xue Rong Hua.

301
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,600
Mi Ke.

302
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,600
I feel better now.

303
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
I...

304
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,600
I...

305
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
Bi Qiu.

306
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
When the Eastern Sea was in danger,

307
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,600
I was the only one to fight against the Golden Moon.

308
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
There was no way out.

309
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
There was no reinforcements.

310
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
I tried my best

311
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
to inherit the ship.

312
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
I went to the ship,

313
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
but I was forced to investigate the poison

314
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,600
and fell into the sea.

315
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
At that time,

316
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
I really felt sorry for you.

317
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Later, I survived from the sea

318
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,600
and passed away.

319
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
Even if I fell into hell,

320
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
I would come back to avenge.

321
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,600
I...

322
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,600
I deserve to die.

323
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Actually,

324
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,600
after the battle in the Eastern Sea,

325
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
I came back to the Four Ancient Gates.

326
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
I secretly saw the Four Ancient Gates

327
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,600
in a terrible state.

328
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,600
I also heard

329
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,600
some complaints

330
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,600
that I had never heard before.

331
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
I was in a hurry

332
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,600
and lost my way.

333
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,600
I thought for a long time

334
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
whether I should go back

335
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
or not.

336
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,600
Maybe that failure

337
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
was caused by me

338
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
alone.

339
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
No.

340
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,600
Actually, it doesn't matter anymore.

341
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
I don't want to go back to the Four Ancient Gates.

342
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
Do you think it's funny?

343
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
At that time,

344
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
I didn't have money

345
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,600
and I was injured.

346
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,600
I took the only valuable thing

347
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,600
and gave it to him.

348
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,600
I changed 50 taels of silver back.

349
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,600
It's the token

350
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,600
that can kill you

351
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
and make you alive.

352
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
The token that no one in the martial arts world

353
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,600
knows about.

354
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,600
Bi Qiu,

355
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,600
it's really funny.

356
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
Such a powerful token

357
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,600
only costs 50 taels.

358
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,600
At that time, I thought

359
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
I would redeem it

360
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
when my injury was better.

361
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,600
But I don't know

362
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,600
when I started

363
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
to plant radishes.

364
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Plant radishes?

365
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Just to stop starving.

366
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
It was spring.

367
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,600
I felt that radishes were growing too slowly.

368
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
I watched them day by day

369
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
and counted them day by day.

370
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
When I saw that there were radishes in the field,

371
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,600
I was so happy.

372
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,600
I was so happy.

373
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,600
When I was about to throw up,

374
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,600
I was so happy

375
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,600
that I almost cried.

376
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,600
I suddenly

377
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,600
saved 50 taels of silver.

378
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
It was three years

379
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
after I went to the sea.

380
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
I took 50 taels of silver

381
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600
to the token that I couldn't redeem.

382
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,600
I went to the fishing village

383
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
and didn't know what it was.

384
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
The token was still there,

385
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
but I hesitated.

386
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
I had gradually forgotten

387
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
the world.

388
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
I didn't need

389
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,600
the first ten thousand people in the world to support me.

390
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
I raised myself

391
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,600
and a dog.

392
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,600
What else

393
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,600
could I ask for in this life?

394
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,600
When I think of you one day,

395
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
I suddenly

396
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,600
forgot why I hate you.

397
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
The past

398
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
is no longer important.

399
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Manchu,

400
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,600
if those things are not important,

401
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,600
what is important?

402
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
What's important is

403
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
the future days.

404
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
You always like to study

405
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,600
and get a job.

406
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Or you can live a peaceful life

407
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
with your wife.

408
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
Biqiu,

409
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,600
live well

410
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,600
and live for yourself.

411
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,600
Okay.

412
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,600
I'll live well

413
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,600
for you.

414
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
What about you?

415
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
What about your poison?

416
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,600
Don't worry.

417
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,600
I can cure your blood phlegm.

418
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,600
This little poison

419
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
is nothing to me.

420
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
I'm sorry.

421
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
Yuan Hua.

422
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
What's wrong with you?

423
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,600
You saved Yun Biqiu with Yang Zhou Man?

424
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,400
You don't regret what you did to her?

425
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,200
A man who regrets his mistakes

426
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,800
deserves a second chance.

427
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,000
No.

428
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,400
You can't drag it out anymore.

429
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,400
I have to get you the Meng Chuan Flower.

430
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Where is the Meng Chuan Flower?

431
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,600
After Di Feisheng came back,

432
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,400
I've been locked inside.

433
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,400
Why is it gone?

434
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,200
This lotus,

435
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,200
how did His Majesty detoxify it?

436
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
I'm sorry.

437
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,400
I'm sorry.

438
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
You took the Meng Chuan Flower to save His Majesty?

439
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,600
Wang Xiaobao,

440
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,600
now you...

441
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,600
Don't you know that only this flower

442
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,600
was important to you?

443
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,200
If it had been what is yours,

444
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,860
you wouldn't have gotten expelled

445
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,960
by your old man.

446
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,200
I know that you are angry.

447
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,600
The thing is,

448
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,240
that Meng Chuan Flower

449
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:46,520
has only been damagedkay

450
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,060
for me

451
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,840
a third of times.

452
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,220
I might just

453
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:51,960
waste it.

454
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,200
Why don't you

455
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,200
to the one we need.

456
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,840
Am I right?

457
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,080
Greetings, Your Majesty.

458
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,720
I'm here today

459
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,680
to offer you a piece of my heart.

460
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,320
I'm here to relieve Your Majesty's pain.

461
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,720
No wonder His Majesty released my father so soon.

462
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,200
No wonder he no longer hates you.

463
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,280
Li Lianhua,

464
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,960
so many people are trying to get you to live.

465
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,720
But you?

466
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,960
Don't you care about your own life?

467
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,160
You're not a common West Shaman.

468
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,800
There's nothing I can do.

469
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,360
I know how to save you.

470
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,120
No.

471
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,200
I will not let you die.

472
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,360
My disciple

473
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,240
All right.

474
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,000
You're awake?

475
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,960
How did you feel?

476
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,660
Fantastic!

477
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,660
It'll be done in 4 or 5 days

478
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,160
You'll have to set up a stall

479
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,540
This is on top of the 2008

480
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,980
And you got into a trouble

481
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,540
Keep it safe

482
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,660
I'll come back for dodge

483
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,600
Sure

484
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,620
How do you decided to join our team?

485
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,880
It's a fun project

486
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,340
It's הה Powers

487
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,520
And yours

488
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,120
I have moreしい

489
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,320
I can't operate without you

490
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,260
Then it'll be a problem

491
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,300
Yes

492
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,960
Here, drink some water.

493
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,680
If you don't drink it, you'll die.

494
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,400
My Eya Sword

495
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,000
has killed the King of Hell.

496
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,200
You can still save your life.

497
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,280
I'm looking for Guan Heng.

498
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,840
He must have a way.

499
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,200
Wait.

500
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:42,620
много

501
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,460
I'm sorry.

502
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,140
Fang Xiaobao, what are you going to do again?

503
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,140
I know you're going to run away.

504
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,660
No one can stop you.

505
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,580
But this time,

506
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,060
just consider it as

507
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,500
considering your health.

508
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,580
Don't think about sneaking out, okay?

509
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,100
I'll be back in a minute.

510
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,700
Fang Xiaobao,

511
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,140
you're so rude.

512
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,900
Anyway, I used to be

513
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,460
a hero who was raised by a thousand people.

514
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,620
Hey, Fang Dubin,

515
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,620
let go of me.

516
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:37,540
A'Ming,

517
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,860
what are you doing?

518
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,740
I'm sorry.

519
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,060
It's because Li Xiangyi is back.

520
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,620
So you have to leave me.

521
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,380
Xiangyi and I

522
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,780
have been together for a long time.

523
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,620
It has nothing to do with her.

524
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,380
This bracelet

525
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,020
was given to me by you.

526
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,660
Now I'm returning it to you.

527
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,580
From now on,

528
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,140
we'll be on our own.

529
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,980
Be safe.

530
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,340
Why are you caring for me?

531
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,180
Living in a welcome society

532
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,060
is 나도 careful,

533
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,700
not chivalrous,

534
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,940
but gentle,

535
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,700
waiting for one's wish.

536
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,860
Gu厲jing,

537
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,260
in the future,

538
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,100
I'll never make you good food again.

539
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,380
Here,

540
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,660
you're so fat.

541
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,820
Next time,

542
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,220
you should eat less.

543
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,740
Do you understand?

544
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:46,820
But

545
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,260
you should stay here

546
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,460
and wait for Fang Le Biyun to come back.

547
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,340
Tell me.

548
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,540
Are you happy now?

549
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,660
Alas.

550
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,320
Wait a sec.

551
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,320
Excuse me.

552
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,960
Is this Four� Hall Gang reference?

553
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,800
Yes.

554
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,480
Someone asked me to give you this.

555
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:49,960
You're being too Ginger

556
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,780
My master

557
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,480
The copper!

558
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,340
You're being too Ginger

559
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:05,580
The only thing you want to become

560
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,420
Is the Minister

561
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,240
Searching for every contrario

562
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,760
And finding everyone

563
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,800
A video Central

564
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,440
Does Pei Yibo know you?

565
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,960
Do you know her?

566
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,660
A video Pei Yibo

567
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,420
Haha

568
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,080
What are you talking about?

569
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,340
Grim reaper 시Hold your tongue

570
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,040
Did she break the spoon?

571
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,200
Did Pei Yibo know her?

572
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,680
What are you talking about

573
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,440
I'm sorry.

574
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,920
This is

575
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,960
myë billa who led me to making this dessert many years ago

576
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,640
into an PR en ing recipe .

577
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,440
It's very istainlyotherment.

578
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,800
I'm bit hungry.

579
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,800
He's going to give me the Fox-Ghost Gold and what Bisheng asked for.

580
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,800
He's going to...

581
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,800
In a few days, he's going to meet Di Feisheng to fight against Donghai.

582
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,800
He should be here, right?

583
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,800
It's a good chance.

584
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,800
But Li Lianhua,

585
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,800
it's hard to say.

586
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,800
It's really bad luck.

587
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,800
I've gone the wrong way.

588
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
Li Xiangyi,

589
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,800
where did you hide A Min?

590
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,800
You see, I seem to be hiding A Min.

591
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,800
Stop quibbling.

592
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,800
You Li Xiangyi is a hypocritical villain.

593
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,800
You said you wouldn't come back.

594
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,800
You won't take A Min and the sect leader's position from me.

595
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
In the end,

596
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,800
you still have the position of the Young Master and the Fox-Ghost.

597
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,800
You're not going to take the position of the sect leader.

598
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,800
You're not going to take the position of the sect leader.

599
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,800
You're still holding the Young Master Sword and showing up in front of everyone.

600
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
You just want to tell everyone

601
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,800
that your Li Xiangyi is back.

602
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,800
You just want to use this to show me the power.

603
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,800
Zi Jing,

604
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,800
you misunderstood.

605
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,800
The four sects don't need two sect leaders.

606
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,800
Between A Min and me,

607
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,800
we don't need a dead Li Xiangyi.

608
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,800
Pull out the sword.

609
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,800
Today,

610
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,800
I'm going to fight with you.

611
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,800
Shi Niang,

612
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,800
let me see your Young Master Sword again.

613
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,800
Li Xiangyi is dead.

614
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,800
His sword is not dead.

615
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,800
It's easy to destroy the world.

616
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,800
It's not easy to cut off Xiangyi's sword.

617
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,800
But I really want to be a dead man.

618
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,800
It's not that easy.

619
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,800
I have no more internal strength.

620
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,800
I'm not your opponent.

621
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,800
Why don't you give me a self-destruction?

622
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,800
It's not easy to kill you and me.

623
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,800
You...

624
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,800
Some people are like a shadow in the sky.

625
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
Some people will never surrender.

626
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,800
People's faith

627
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,800
is always different.

628
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,800
What are you talking about?

629
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,800
I have many things to do.

630
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,800
But the most sorry thing

631
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,800
is this Young Master Sword.

632
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,800
Zi Jing,

633
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,800
now that the Young Master is dead,

634
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,800
there is no Li Xiangyi in this world.

635
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,800
There is no Xiangyi Stairway.

636
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,800
Don't worry.

637
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,800
Love you until you die.

638
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,800
Lovely Blue Bl conventional demigods.

639
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,800
As for Amin no oneった

640
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,880
because of yourре

641
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,800
and telling him of yourfood sin.

642
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,800
I'm weak.

643
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,800
Please don't do

644
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,800
this kind of things in the future.

645
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,240
遠祖 젠遇!

646
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,800
You can guess how it works.

647
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,800
The owner of Lotus Pavilion, Li Lian Hua,

648
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,800
who can kill people,

649
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,800
is actually the one who

650
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,800
killed the four masters of the Four Gu Sects

651
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,800
in the Golden Fence Alliance

652
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,800
ten years ago.

653
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,800
Li Xiang Yi.

654
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,800
Li Xiang Yi.

655
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,800
It's said that Li Xiang Yi

656
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,800
came back from the bottom of the sea

657
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,800
and lived for more than ten years

658
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,800
just to

659
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,800
destroy the conspiracy of the Ten Thousand Holy Weapons

660
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,800
of the Four Gu Sects.

661
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,800
At that time, he was killed for nothing.

662
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,800
He had the Sword of the Young Lion

663
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,800
and he was sent to the martial world.

664
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,800
He was the leader of the Ten Thousand Holy Weapons.

665
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,800
Good.

666
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,800
Good.

667
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,800
Good.

668
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,800
It's tomorrow.

669
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,800
Hu Lei Jian.

670
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,800
Do you think he will come?

671
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,800
Good.

672
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,800
Is Li Xiang Yi afraid

673
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,800
and not coming?

674
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,800
Who is Li Xiang Yi?

675
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,800
I think he is deliberately disturbing

676
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,800
the heart of the Di Fei Sheng.

677
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,800
Master,

678
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
did something happen?

679
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,800
I think

680
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,800
he is the one who

681
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,800
killed the four masters of the Four Gu Sects.

682
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,800
He is the one who

683
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,800
killed the four masters of the Four Gu Sects.

684
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,520
realistic?

685
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,440
Could you queue up here?

686
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,320
This is where

687
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,920
those women from the Li's family

688
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,560
came to slaughter me.

689
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,560
Go search?

690
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,560
Let's go.

691
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,360
In these things that are inți world,

692
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:20,900
Has become an ending to the confian in sea and ki crowds

693
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:25,060
Ten years ago, Dong Hai was fifty years não

694
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,200
This was the battle-time

695
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,720
So the English was not able to accept this

696
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,820
In a place with no soldiers, you were convinced

697
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,820
You emigrated together

698
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,280
Today this thing that happened so many years ago

699
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,340
Is that member of thigh is dead

700
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,980
....will never be able to bear this heavy winter hard send.

701
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:51,940
so do we post our last error on the kart of the winter of brilliant

702
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,800
steppe

703
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:00,500
my old land were truly in the essence of the ancient

704
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,880
Etude

705
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,880
Where will be the concreteness in this life of his wife

706
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:10,440
We've had this sin for a long time

707
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,440
I will not be in the deep sea of the moon for many days.

708
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,440
I have no intention to enter the military capital, but I seek to conquer the world.

709
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,440
I have already left.

710
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,440
If the military will be not peaceful, I will ask for your help.

711
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,440
Prime Minister Li, you are not here.

712
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,440
The sword is broken.

713
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,440
Li Lianhua.

714
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,440
What does it mean?

715
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,440
Why did the good Duanduan return to Duan Jian'er?

716
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,440
Is Prime Minister Li really not coming?

717
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,440
He sent a letter of resolution.

718
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,440
A letter of resolution?

719
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,440
The good Duanduan is a man.

720
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,440
Li Lianhua's poison of tea is not solved.

721
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,440
How could this happen?

722
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,440
Isn't the sect leader...

723
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,440
What a pity.

724
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,440
Of course.

725
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,440
He told me that he had a way to solve the poison of tea.

726
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,440
But...

727
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,440
I should have done it earlier.

728
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,440
It seems that I really misunderstood him.

729
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,440
It turned out to be true.

730
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,440
But how could it be possible?

731
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,440
He is alive. How could he die?

732
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,440
When that person broke the sword, he was clearly fine.

733
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,440
Broken sword?

734
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,440
When did you see him?

735
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,440
A few days ago.

736
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,440
At Wangjiang Pavilion.

737
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,440
I forced him to pull the sword and fight with me.

738
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,440
Then he broke the sword of Shaoshi.

739
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,440
He jumped into the river.

740
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,440
Li Lianhua...

741
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,440
How could he...

742
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,440
He doesn't care about the position of sect leader.

743
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,440
Why don't you believe him?

744
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,440
It's all our fault.

745
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,440
We didn't notice it before.

746
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,440
We thought he was fine.

747
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,440
Miss Shi.

748
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,440
Since Li Xiong can control the poison for ten years,

749
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,440
it can be the second or third ten years.

750
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,440
I'll go find him now.

751
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,440
I'm afraid it's too late.

752
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,440
I've broken his pulse.

753
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,440
He only has one month left.

754
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,440
In order to fight against the ancient sword,

755
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,440
he often used martial arts.

756
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,440
If he could take the flower of Wangchuan in time,

757
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,440
I'm afraid he would have...

758
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,440
Impossible.

759
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,440
Li Lianhua is not dead.

760
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,440
No matter what you say,

761
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,440
I, Fang Duo Bin, will never believe it.

762
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,440
As long as I don't see his body,

763
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,440
even if it's three feet away,

764
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,440
I'll find him.

765
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,440
Xiaobao.

766
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,440
Prime Minister Li.

767
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,440
Our wish...

768
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,440
No one can replace it.

769
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,440
I'm afraid it's too late.

770
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,440
I've broken his pulse.

771
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,440
He only has one month left.

772
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,440
In order to fight against the ancient sword,

773
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,440
he often used martial arts.

774
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,440
If he could take the flower of Wangchuan in time,

775
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,440
I'll find him.

776
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,440
As long as I don't see his body,

777
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,440
even if it's three feet away,

778
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,440
I'll find him.

779
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,440
Our wish...

780
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,440
No one can replace it.

781
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,440
Our wish...

782
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,440
No one can replace it.

783
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,440
I'll find him.

784
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,440
As long as I don't see his body,

785
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,440
even if it's three feet away,

786
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,440
I'll find him.

787
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,440
Our wish...

788
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,440
No one can replace it.

789
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,440
Our wish...

790
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,440
No one can replace it.

791
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,440
Our wish...

792
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,440
No one can replace it.

793
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,440
Our wish...

794
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,440
No one can replace it.

795
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,440
Our wish...

796
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,440
No one can replace it.

797
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,440
I'm afraid it's too late.

798
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,440
I've broken his pulse.

799
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,440
He only has one month left.

800
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,440
In order to fight against the ancient sword,

801
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,440
I'll find him.

802
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,440
As long as I don't see his body,

803
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,440
even if it's three feet away,

804
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,440
I'll find him.

805
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,440
Our wish...

806
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,440
No one can replace it.

807
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,440
Our wish...

808
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,440
No one can replace it.

Thanks for watching!
