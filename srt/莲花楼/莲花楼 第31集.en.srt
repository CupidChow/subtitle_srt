[Episode 31]

4
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,320
Li Lianhua.

5
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,640
You're awake.

6
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,080
It's indeed effective that Guan Hemeng asked me

7
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,880
to use Yangzhouman on you daily.

8
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,300
How do you feel?

9
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,730
This is Yunyin Mountain.

10
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,700
You should know the way here.

11
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,430
Do you know how to walk up the mountain?

12
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:10,820
I haven't been here for so long that I've forgotten the way.

13
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,640
Let's go. Hurry up.

14
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,500
I have something important to do.

15
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,380
Where are you going now?

16
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,890
Going up the mountain to ask Granny Qin to save your life

17
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,890
is the only important thing for now.

18
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,840
F-Find my master's wife?

19
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,020
Fang Xiaobao,

20
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,050
let me tell you the truth.

21
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,340
I'm going to tell you the truth now,

22
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,540
but you may think I'm lying to you again.

23
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,160
Back then, I was so unfilial

24
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,200
and willful that I pissed my master off, leading to his death.

25
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,040
Now you're taking me to see my master's wife.

26
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,320
What if I infuriate her

27
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,820
when she sees me?

28
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:43,910
Don't fool me.

29
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,579
Guan Hemeng said you...

30
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,470
Guan Hemeng?

31
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,880
Why would you believe Guan Hemeng, that quack?

32
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,360
He might not know the profound theory of Yangzhouman.

33
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,390
Besides,

34
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,810
everyone is afraid of death.

35
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,410
I'm just an ordinary person.

36
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,600
Now you have Yangzhouman to protect you,

37
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,330
and you also know its strength.

38
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,020
Let's go.

39
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,330
The more you talk, the more guilty you are.

40
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,360
I won't believe you no matter what you say.

41
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,850
Now we're at the foot of the mountain.

42
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,240
I've made up my mind to walk up the mountain.

43
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,230
If I can't make it,

44
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,350
I'll just spend my time with you here.

45
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,880
You can't go anywhere else.

46
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,829
The Lord found that I'm a royal member of Nanyin.

47
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,520
Also, he asked about the Rama Vessel.

48
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,750
I'm afraid it's only a matter of time for him to find

49
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,960
that I colluded with Wansheng Clan to set him up with Wuxin Huai.

50
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,620
Snow Master, what do you think

51
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,130
the Lord will do to me?

52
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,620
Saintess,

53
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,630
aren't you ready?

54
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:39,760
How about

55
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,670
we go the whole hog?

56
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,940
Go the whole hog?

57
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,600
It's been more than ten years.

58
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,430
I'm already exhausted.

59
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,880
He's still not into me.

60
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,750
Send a message to all our people

61
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,330
so that they will take action as soon as I order them to.

62
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,440
As for Zongzheng,

63
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,190
ask him to hand the Rama Vessel to me in person

64
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,470
once he gets it.

65
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:21,980
No one can be trusted.

66
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:22,880
Yes.

67
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,000
Di Feisheng.

68
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,690
You forced me to do this.

69
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,100
Do you think you can win her heart

70
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,860
by stealing the Rama Vessel and Heavenly Ice?

71
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,580
After Jiao Liqiao finishes using you,

72
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,460
you'll only end up being torn apart.

73
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,080
I have no intention of betraying you.

74
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,520
I... I was bewitched by the siren.

75
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,610
For the sake of the close relationship

76
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,330
between the Zongzheng family and the imperial court,

77
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,540
please spare my life.

78
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,300
I've got my people all over the court.

79
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,040
Without you, a traitor,

80
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,210
what's the big deal?

81
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,409
Even if I didn't tell you,

82
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:35,409
you would have already noticed this fool.

83
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:36,300
Of course you won't let him

84
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,980
take action under your nose.

85
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,270
You told me

86
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:45,010
about the scheme between Zongzheng and Jiao Liqiao.

87
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,020
In other words,

88
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,390
compared to well-matched rivals,

89
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,560
you hate those who betray you more.

90
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,470
I'm just giving them a taste of their own medicine.

91
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,650
You said you want to cooperate with the Wansheng Clan.

92
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,000
Are you trying to

93
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,830
collect the debt from the Wansheng Clan?

94
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,380
The victories and defeats are all in the past.

95
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,910
Since we want to cooperate,

96
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,900
let's not talk about the past anymore.

97
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,140
I established the Jinyuan Alliance for only one purpose.

98
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,530
It is to be the top martial artist.

99
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,550
The top of the martial arts world is what I want

100
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,750
but not what you want.

101
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,320
I'm not interested in what you want.

102
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,460
Now both of us

103
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,040
each has a Rama Heavenly Ice.

104
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,770
Without one of us, no one can open the Rama Vessel.

105
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,090
So you and I are the best partners for now.

106
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:30,970
Okay.

107
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,570
Di Feisheng.

108
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,810
You're the one who cornered me.

109
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,980
Why don't I add more Wuxin Huai

110
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,800
and turn you into a good-for-nothing completely?

111
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,670
Di Feisheng.

112
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,460
Be good and wait for me to arrange everything for you.

113
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,500
What's it like to breathe Wuxin Huai in?

114
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:38,730
My Lord.

115
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,530
I hate being set up the most in my life.

116
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,659
Ten years ago, in the battle at the East Sea,

117
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,159
you attacked the alliance with thundering fire bombs, right?

118
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,290
So you knew it.

119
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,540
The 12 Guardians were all dead.

120
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,410
The Jinyuan Alliance collapsed.

121
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,350
I fell into the sea after being seriously injured and stayed in seclusion for ten years.

122
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,050
You then took over the Jinyuan Alliance

123
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,490
step by step.

124
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,020
You have ambitions and means.

125
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:11,690
But today,

126
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,320
it's time to settle the score.

127
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,560
So you recall everything.

128
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,030
You liar!

129
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,300
It was my miscalculation.

130
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,320
Why didn't you ask me the reason I did it?

131
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,210
Why didn't you ask me

132
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,299
who I was scheming so hard for?

133
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,559
Don't say it's for me.

134
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,210
I insist on saying that.

135
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,280
The 12 Guardians

136
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,780
just joined the Jinyuan Alliance before me.

137
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,110
Their looks and means

138
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,300
were no match for me.

139
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,300
Why could they get to be around you?

140
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,230
When they looked at you for another glance,

141
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,220
I would like to dig their eyes out.

142
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,210
If I didn't get rid of them,

143
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,700
how could you notice me?

144
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,890
The Sigu Sect and the Jinyuan Alliance had always been well-matched.

145
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,410
But all you cared about was

146
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,170
fighting against Li Xiangyi for the first place.

147
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,900
You knew I hated him the most,

148
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,950
but he was all you remember in this world.

149
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,590
What about me?

150
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,400
So I got rid of the Jinyuan Alliance

151
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,880
and Sigu Sect together.

152
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,660
Also, I got rid of Li Xiangyi for you.

153
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:20,980
Yes.

154
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,710
The arrangement was not perfect.

155
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,970
I wouldn't want you to get hurt.

156
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,420
I would feel the same pain as you if you got hurt.

157
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,310
So I found you immediately and saved you.

158
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,980
When you went into seclusion to heal your injuries,

159
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,380
I found the most precious medicine for you.

160
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,130
I rebuilt the Jinyuan Alliance

161
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,860
and waited for you to come back.

162
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,300
I waited every day,

163
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,840
and I got back

164
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,470
everything you lost.

165
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,670
When the Rama Vessel is opened,

166
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,750
I'll give you the title of the top martial artist

167
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,190
that you want.

168
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,740

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,520
gradually,

340
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,380
Senior did take more and more punishments.

341
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,360
You are so flighty and impetuous.

342
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,280
You are not allowed to practise new moves today.

343
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,160
Go face the wall and ponder about your misdeeds.

344
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,070
Senior.

345
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,460
I won.

346
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,200
Master.

347
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,320
It's the same attack.

348
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,930
You can dodge it without using it.

349
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,570
Why did you do that just now?

350
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,470
Martial arts practitioners value sincerity the most.

351
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,270
If you lose the match on purpose,

352
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,070
you are not only looking down on your opponent

353
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,120
but also yourself.

354
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,620
I don't need you to lose on purpose.

355
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,280
Li Xiangyi.

356
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,740
Don't look down on me.

357
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,410
After that,

358
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,260
I never lost on purpose.

359
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,170
I thought

360
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,980
he wouldn't be angry anymore.

361
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,000
But he has been

362
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:02,020
hiding his feelings all along.

363
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,950
I just never realised it.

364
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,770
After that,

365
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,870
Madam and Master had a fierce fight and didn't give in to each other.

366
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:16,530
So they decided to make a bet

367
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,200
to see who can teach the better disciple.

368
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,620
The two of them drew lots.

369
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:24,990
I

370
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,010
followed Master.

371
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,370
Madam took Senior away.

372
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:33,930
They had a deal.

373
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,540
The deal

374
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,420
was to compete once a month.

375
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,870
Since then,

376
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,030
my father lost to you every time.

377
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,350
I'm afraid he hates you even more.

378
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,300
Maybe

379
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,350
I've never been right.

380
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,350
It's not your fault.

381
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,280
Life is about self-deliverance.

382
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,050
Some can see past it,

383
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,680
but some can't.

384
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,860
When I was young,

385
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,850
I met Bhante Wuliao.

386
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:14,490
He always said I had no Bodhisattva tree in my heart.

387
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:16,610
At that time,

388
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,140
I was arrogant

389
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,130
and didn't take his words seriously.

390
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,290
But after thinking deeply, I realised

391
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,150
some people join the martial world

392
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,900
to cultivate their mind.

393
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,610
Some people enter the martial world

394
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,700
to cultivate a meaningful life.

395
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,050
But I don't know

396
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,160
what I really want.

397
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:44,050
Li Xiangyi is a martial arts genius.

398
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,100
No.1 in the world.

399
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,890
I don't know how others think of him,

400
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,770
but becoming someone like him

401
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,660
has been my dream since childhood.

402
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:57,280
I was shallow and superficial when I was younger.

403
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,380
Naturally the friends around me

404
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,530
were also like that.

405
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,130
But in my heart,

406
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,530
Senior always held a special place.

407
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,750
But at the end of the day,

408
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,440
I never did my best in this relationship.

409
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,650
Then you should blame yourself.

410
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,440
In my opinion,

411
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,250
I should be the one reflecting on myself.

412
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,450
My mother once told me

413
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,060
getting along with others

414
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,060
is like drinking.

415
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,770
Cup after cup.

416
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,980
Each taking turns.

417
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,800
No matter more or less,

418
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:36,540
both parties have to drink to our will to enjoy it.

419
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:37,930
But I forgot

420
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,320
you and I

421
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,820
have already been honest with each other.

422
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,860
There's no need to show every inch of ourselves to each other.

423
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:51,250
That's how people get along as well.

424
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,260
Whether it's being caring,

425
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,530
or drinking together.

426
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,460
I've passed the obstacles and drunk the wine.

427
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,260
I don't think Madam

428
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,120
will be coming back anytime soon.

429
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,350
Instead of just waiting here,

430
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,360
why don't we

431
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,830
come another day?

432
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,980
She doesn't live here at all, does she?

433
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,150
Although the place has been kept clean,

434
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,080
there are no traces of anyone living here.

435
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,210
When I first came in,

436
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,940
I found pine needles on the ground

437
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,470
that didn't come from here.

438
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,420
I think

439
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:35,380
it must have been left behind by the people who come here to clean.

440
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,220
I did see the woods are full of pine trees

441
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,880
over there by the south peaks.

442
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:39,940
That must be

443
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,920
where Madam Qin really is.

444
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,700
How dare you fool around with something related to your life?

445
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,760
It's getting late.

446
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,870

[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

449
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,910
You even know about this place?

450
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,860
The people you have locked up here

451
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,800
are martial artists who have once followed you.

452
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,420
You tested poison on them,

453
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,760
and tested medicine on them.

454
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,950
They were tortured beyond recognition by you.

455
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,210
If I were in your hands,

456
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,250
I would have ended up like this too.

457

You're wrong.

458
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,940
I love you so much.

459
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,670
How could I ever bear to leave you here,

460

with how much I love you?

461

keep you by my side forever.

463

I will feed you my strongest poison

00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,680
It's you.

511
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,980
It's really the voice of Xiangyi.

512
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,560
Xiangyi?

513
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,580
This unfilial disciple

514
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,500
greets Madam.

515
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:32,460
Xiangyi.

516
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,180
Where have you been all these years?

517
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,610
Madam Qin,

518
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,800
Li Xiangyi was badly injured in the fight

519
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,940
with Jinyuan Alliance ten years ago.

520
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,380
Now he's been poisoned by Bicha Poison.

521
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,550
After enduring for all these years,

522
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,280
he doesn't have much time left.

523
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,760
Please help him.

524
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,750
Poisoned?

525
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,970
Let's talk inside. Let's go.

526
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,270
Is this boy your disciple?

527
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,400
He's talented.

528
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,820
Madam, he is not my disciple.

529
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,820
I didn't teach him anything too.

530
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,640
Come, sit down.

531
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:13,980
Xiangyi.

532
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,430
If your master knows, even in the netherworld,

533
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,390
that you came back to Yunyin Mountain,

534
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,050
he would have been very happy.

535
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,150
You are his favorite disciple.

536
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:26,190
When he found out about what happened to you,

537
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,230
he was devastated.

538
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,380
He was in great pain.

539
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:31,410
He didn't want to see anyone.

540
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:32,860
He locked himself up

541
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,940
and told the public that he was practicing martial arts in seclusion.

542
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,380
But soon after,

543
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:43,630
he lost his mind and passed away.

544
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,610
After I recovered,

545
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,090
I came back once.

546
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,280
I was too ashamed to enter

547
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,400
when I learned the Master passed away.

548
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,490
Silly child.

549
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,820
This is the reason you didn't dare come back here?

550
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,720
I'm unfilial

551
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,010
and caused him to suffer.

552
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,080
This is also our fault.

553
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:17,290
I fought with your master for half my life.

554
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,500
Only at the brink of death

555
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,050
did I realise

556
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,250
that I can't bear to leave him.

557
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,760
I can't bear to leave you too.

558
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,650
And Shan Gudao.

559
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:31,850
When all of you left,

560
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,100
now that I think back on it, I feel so regretful.

561
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:37,850
I made you suffer so much.

562
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:40,900
Madam,

563
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,820
I'm fine now.

564
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:46,300
That's good.

565
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,530
It's good that you're back.

566
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,200
I won't let you suffer anymore.

567
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,120
I know the method that

568
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,860
Guan Hemeng mentioned.

569
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,590
Don't worry.

570
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:00,110
I'll cure your poison.

571
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,420
Please don't think about it.

572
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:15,350
I don't want you to save me with your life.

573
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:18,620
Guan Hemeng told Fang Duobing that you can save me

574
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,300
because your inner power

575
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,360
is similar to mine.

576
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,700
But if you force the Bicha Poison

577
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,030
into your own body using your inner power,

578
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:28,820
it's just a life for a life.

579
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:29,970
Madam.

580
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,350
I don't want to do it.

581
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:34,620
If Master knew about this,

582
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,180
he would never agree.

583
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,860
Come on, child. Get up.

584
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,130
Get up first.

585
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:51,870
Xiangyi, if your master knows in the netherworld,

586
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,240
he would have agreed for me to do it.

587
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,550
Even if he is alive,

588
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,270
he will also save you with his life,

589
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,660
because your parents are his saviors.

590
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,890
I am repaying kindness for your master

591
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,460
by saving you today.

592
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,060
Li Xiangyi.

593
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,360
What are you doing?

594
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:25,159
Are you going to kill yourself in front of me?

595
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,120
Madam.

596
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:32,600
Everyone has his own fate.

597
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,179
There are things that you don't need to force.

598
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,650
How can I feel at ease?

599
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,659
How can Master feel at ease?

600
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,060
Fine.

601
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,060
If you don't want us to save you,

602
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,050
then stay here and recuperate

603
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,100
and let me take care of you.

604
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:54,739
Madam.

605
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,390
There are still some things

606
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,200
that need to be settled by myself.

607
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,260
You need to let me give you some of my Genuine Qi

608
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,780
so that you can protect yourself at critical times.

609
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,460
Also,

610
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:11,410
can you fool

611
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,330
the one standing there?

612
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:16,910
So please

613
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,360
keep it a secret for me.

614
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:35,820
How are you?

615
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,190
I'm fine now.

616
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,170
The poison has just been cleared. He is not allowed to fight.

617
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,300
You're alright now?

618
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,380
The poison has been cleared and everything is fine?

619
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,130
It's all thanks to your Granny Qin.

620
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,330
Now my inner power

621
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,540
has just recovered twenty or thirty percent.

622
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,340
Yes.

623
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,950
That's why we need to take good care of him.

624
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:01,900
It's my fault.

625
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,900
I was too happy to care about anything else.

626
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,430
Thank you for reminding me.

627
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,440
In my opinion,

628
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,570
since Madam Qin can clear this Bicha Poison,

629
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:10,430
why didn't you come back earlier?

630
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,650
I'm just lucky.

631
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,380
Madam used years

632
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,310
of her power to create an antidote

633
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,430
in her earlier years.

634
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,300
Now the poison was only removed

635
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,630
together with the help of her inner power.

636
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:29,010
That's why I'm recovering well now.

637
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,030
Right, Madam?

638
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:30,580
I see.

639
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:33,900
Yes.

640
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,750
I spent

641
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,380
more than ten years

642
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,880
to make this antidote.

643
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,180
Just this one and you've used it.

644
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,540
Don't forget your promise.

645
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,340
I'll give you one month

646
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:50,020
to go down the mountain and settle your affairs.

647
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,470
You must come back to inherit the sect afterwards.

648
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,670
No other allowances.

649
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:54,980
Got it, Madam.

650
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:02,150
Why do you need to promise her?

651
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,670
Do you see why I don't come back?

652
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,020
As you can see,

653
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,180
my Madam's temperamental.

654
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,640
She asked me to inherit the sect as soon as I came back.

655
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,500
I have to stay in Yunyin Mountain.

656
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,340
Although I survived,

657
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,030
I lost my freedom.

658
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:18,960
Anyway,

659
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,100
your health always comes first.

660
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,380
As long as you are well, there is still hope.

661
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,020
Besides,

662
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,840
she didn't tell you

663
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,700
that you must stay in Yunyin Mountain forever.

664
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,300
Speaking of the sect.

665
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:30,410
Fang Duobing.

666
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:33,290
You are now a descendant of Yunyin Mountain.

667
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:36,000
Why don't you kowtow and serve tea to your Granny Qin,

668
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,410
and me, your master today?

669
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:41,200
From now on, Yunyin Mountain will depend on you.

670
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,740
It was just a joke when I said I wanted to be your disciple.

671
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,400
How can you take it seriously?

672
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,390
You brat, are you trying to deny it?

673
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,740
I remember you said you were my disciple

674
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,380
when we first met at Lingshan.

675
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,070
What a joke.

676
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,240
Given my age, you want me to kowtow to you?

677
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,100
In your dreams!

678
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,180
Don't try to deny it.

679
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:18,720
What are you doing here,

680
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,980
not resting properly?

681
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,350
Have a taste.

682
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,550
This porridge

683
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:25,460
is made from Tofieldia Thibetica of Yunyin Mountain.

684
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,920
It's good for your injury.

685
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:27,760
Injury?

686
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,520
Just eat it.

687
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,660
Stop talking.

688
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,620
It tastes good today.

689
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,960
When did it taste bad?

690
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:42,150
Are you really not going back to your past identity?

691
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,510
Fang Xiaobao.

692
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,560
Look at Yunyin Mountain.

693
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,110
The young sprouts grow and the new trees grow.

694
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,470
The martial arts world is the same.

695
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,670
Who can explain

696
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:58,580
what will happen in the future?

697
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,820
There's so much hustle and bustle in the martial arts world.

698
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,680
There will always be new legends.

699
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,160
Young Master Fang,

700
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,850
there are few empty rooms on the mountain.

701
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:22,320
This is where Shan Gudao lived when he practiced martial arts.

702
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,450
Please bear with it.

703
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,620
Madam Qin,

704
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,710
what kind of person is he?

705
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,920
Back then, he and Li Xiangyi founded Sigu Sect together.

706
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,650
But people in the martial world

707
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,740
seem vague on their opinions of him.

708
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,600
Shan Gudao looks easy-going on the surface,

709
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,650
but he's willing to hide himself.

710
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,660
He's actually a very competitive person.

711
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,000
He is not quite tolerant of others.

712
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,130
In his fight with Li Xiangyi that year,

713
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,260
he was willing to use

714
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,060
whatever it took to win, even unorthodox methods.

715
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,040
He passed early.

716
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,220
It's my fault

717
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,770
I didn't bring him to a broader path.

718
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,470
It's getting late.

719
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,500
Rest early.

720
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,730
Thank you, Madam Qin.

721
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:22,460
[Yunyin Mountain]

722
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:25,250
Nanyin's Three Magical Techniques,

723
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,510
Asura Grass, Wuxin Huai, and Karmic Bug.

724
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,030
These were passed down the royal family of Nanyin.

725
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,890
The night before Nanyin was overturned,

726
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,940
Princess Longxuan married Crown Prince Fangji

727
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,340
and became Consort Xuan.

728
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:38,200
Consort Xuan secretly initiated the revival of Nanyin

729
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,130
and plotted using the Rama Vessel.

730
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:42,730
The imperial clan prince conspired and killed Emperor Xicheng,

731
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:45,180
and the Empress of Prince Fangji declared herself as the Emperor.

732
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,510
Consort Xuan was sentenced to be buried with Prince Fangji.

733
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,600
Rama Heavenly Ice and Emperor Guangqing.

734
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,560
These should be my father's handwriting as well.

735
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,340
It seems that he had been investigating

736
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,470
Nanyin when he was in Yunyin Mountain.

737
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:05,300
So, he has been investigating these.

738
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:08,060
The answer is in this box.

739
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,380
There's a lock

740
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,450
and self-destruction mechanism.

741
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,380
I dare not try it.

742
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,940
This is Nanyin Script.

743
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,260
Yes.

744
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:25,180
These patterns are the same as the one on Consort Xuan's grave.

745
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,900
It should be her symbol as the Princess of Nanyin.

746
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,900
Since it's her private belongings,

747
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:32,560
try her birthday.

748
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,030
[In the year of Ren Yin, Wu Shen month, Geng Jia day, at the hour of Geng Chen.]

749
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,030
[Princess Longxuan]

750
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:49,050
There's even a translation manual.

751
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:50,170
To the magician.

752
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:51,790
This is

753
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,790
a letter from Consort Xuan to magician Feng Ah Lu.

754
00:42:58,650 --> 00:42:59,850
Miss Su said

755
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,860
Nanyin magicians are the ones

756
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,870
in charge of keeping and controlling the Karmic Bugs.

757
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,390
I married the Crown Prince of Fangji with hatred.

758
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:13,260
I had already settled in the Central Plains,

759
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,890
but I misplaced my trust in the bad guys.

760
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:17,430
The imperial clan prince fought for the crown with Crown Prince Fangji,

761
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:20,190
so I was incarcerated with Crown Prince Fangji

762
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,870
and have no chance of survival.

763
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:24,760
I can only try my best to send my son to safety.

764
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:28,410
I hope that you will think of  continuing the Nanyin royal bloodline

765
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:31,060
and hurry to the bamboo forest outside the city to meet my son.

766
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,860
Contact Jin, Yu, Huang, and Quan

767
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:35,180
to fulfill my unfinished wish

768
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:37,300
and restore the country of Nanyin.

769
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:40,580
Consort Xuan has been trying to revive Nanyin

770
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,230
and set up such a powerful foundation.

771
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:44,680
But this Feng Ah Lu

772
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:47,040
didn't meet Consort Xuan's son back then.

773
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,240
The wealth acquired to revive Nanyin and the Rama Heavenly Ice

774
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,070
were divided by Jin, Yu, Huang, and Quan.

775
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:53,800
Maybe something happened.

776
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:55,820
But now,

777
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,940
the descendants of Consort Xuan

778
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:00,260
must have been found by the people of Nanyin,

779
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:03,180
otherwise these letters wouldn't be here.

780
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:04,340
You mean

781
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,180
my father is the descendant of Consort Xuan,

782
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,410
the royal bloodline of Nanyin?
