2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Kissing myself thousands of times

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The most reluctant moment is that moment

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Right on the earth, a thousand miles of madness

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who doesn't wander around

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds and the moon on the cliff

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Right on the earth, the youthful youthfulness

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The thousand times of not being drunk is like a grudge

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The journey to the end of the world is like a dream

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Right on the earth, a thousand miles of madness

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Who doesn't wander around

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds and the moon on the cliff

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Right on the earth, the youthful youthfulness

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The thousand times of not being drunk is like a grudge

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The journey to the end of the world is like a dream

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Right on the earth, a thousand miles of madness

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Right on the earth, a thousand miles of madness

Episode 2

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Then I'll tell you the truth

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I've been sick since I was a kid

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
My mother didn't even give me my name

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
She was afraid that I wouldn't live until I was an adult

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
When I was ten, my mother recognized her lost brother

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
He was the vice chief of the Four Gu Sect, Yi Xiangyi's brother, Shan Gu Dao

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Shan Gu Dao is your uncle?

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
My mother didn't like the martial arts since she was a kid

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So she didn't want uncle to make public this relationship

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Uncle secretly wanted to teach me martial arts

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But I was too weak at that time

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Uncle always blamed me for being useless

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
How many times have I taught you? Why can't you remember?

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You can't even hold a sword. What martial arts do you practice?

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Again

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This sword is too heavy for you

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's not a good sword

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Next, this wooden sword is more suitable for you

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
If you can use this wooden sword to practice the basic sword skills

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Come to me, I'll take you as my disciple

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
When he left, he told me

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Don't lose your sword

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
A swordsman must hold the sword in his hand

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Only then can he solve all the problems in the world

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That was the only time I saw Li Xiangyi

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Now, I don't even remember his face

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But just for his one word

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I tried my best to cure him

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I took the bitter medicine

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I took the cold spring that was hard to soak

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Now I can't even stand the cold spring

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I can't stand the cold spring

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I can't stand the cold spring

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I can't stand the cold spring

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Now I can finally stand up

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I can hold the sword in my hand

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But he's gone

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
No

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
A person like my master who is easy to understand

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You won't understand

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's you

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I didn't expect this bad boy to grow up

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
This martial arts skill is not bad

62
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's not a good thing for your uncle

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm not a good person

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But there are some things

65
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You don't have to remember too clearly

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Come

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Young master

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The fish is not hungry

69
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Cheers

70
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Young master

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Young master

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Young master

73
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Young master

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Young master

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Why are you sleeping here

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
We've been looking for you all night

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Where is this building

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I don't know

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I don't know

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Where is this building

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Where is the person

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I said all the new words

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But the person ran away

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The days of the past

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
There is a theme

86
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Where is my senior's body

87
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Where is it

88
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Your biggest weakness is

89
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You like to be a hero

90
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
A swordsman shouldn't have weaknesses

91
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Where is my senior's body

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Where is it

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Your biggest weakness is

94
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You like to be a hero

95
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
A swordsman shouldn't have weaknesses

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I am worried about making old friends

97
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm fine

98
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm fine

99
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
What should we do

100
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,720
Immortals fighting? What immortals?

101
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,240
Those people from the Jianghu,

102
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,800
what sect, what alliance,

103
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,720
they're always fighting.

104
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,920
What else can they do besides harming people?

105
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,520
This way, this way, this way!

106
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,360
Senior!

107
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,200
It's okay.

108
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,360
Earlier,

109
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,680
Let's go.

110
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,240
What can we achieve

111
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,480
if the Four Gu Sect is like this?

112
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,520
Why don't we

113
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,560
split up?

114
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,400
The master's life is uncertain.

115
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,000
Do you want to split up?

116
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,080
I'm asking you.

117
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,720
The Four Gu Sect is badly injured.

118
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,000
Who is it for?

119
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,960
That's right.

120
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,200
If it weren't for the master's

121
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,520
strong will and willful action,

122
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,560
how could we be

123
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,040
defeated by the evil plan of the Golden Moon Alliance?

124
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,480
How could we lose so many brothers?

125
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,680
When I said

126
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,040
I would avenge the second master,

127
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,440
you were one by one

128
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,680
shouting out loud together.

129
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,520
Why are you

130
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,960
blaming it all on the master?

131
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,480
Whoever dares to step out of this door

132
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
will be killed.

133
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,280
Don't be so lucky.

134
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,640
The situation of the Four Gu Sect today

135
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,520
was caused by the selfish action of Li Xiang Yi.

136
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,120
But he definitely doesn't want to see

137
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,080
you two competing here.

138
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,120
Now that Xiang Yi is gone,

139
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,480
the Four Gu Sect is badly injured.

140
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,960
If the two sides

141
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,040
disagree and separate,

142
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,480
why don't we

143
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,320
separate the Four Gu Sect today?

144
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,240
We'll be safe.

145
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,520
You want to separate the Four Gu Sect?

146
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,200
The two masters are gone.

147
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,440
The people are gone, too.

148
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,920
Why do you have to force yourself to do it?

149
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,000
You don't like this place, either, do you?

150
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,640
gangster

151
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,160
았어

152
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,920
your

153
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,400
sound

154
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:17,840
how to

155
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,220
my

156
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,360
is rheumatoid.

157
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,640
Bi Cha poison

158
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,360
has been spread all over your body.

159
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,040
If you aren't

160
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,100
RISIN and BAC

161
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,360
Yang Zhou is wearing out.

162
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,600
Enhance the vital حalve

163
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,040
with an tear.

164
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,840
Dupping

165
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,440
holds fellow jump King late

166
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,640
just as compliment

167
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,560
will drink out

168
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,080
Bi Cha poison

169
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,480
I can't detoxify myself.

170
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,760
I can't get back

171
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,240
the great power of Sect Leader Li.

172
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,400
I can only forcefully leave you

173
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,560
a part of my inner power.

174
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,560
This Shudao Jinzhen

175
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,960
has made you suffer.

176
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,880
Your appearance and body shape

177
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,120
have changed day by day.

178
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,560
It's hard to meet your old friends.

179
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,880
Premier Li is not Premier Li.

180
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,360
This is a fate.

181
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,560
Premier Li is still in Sanjing.

182
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,440
You need to return to the Four Gu Sect as soon as possible

183
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,240
and catch the subordinates and friends

184
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,160
to seek for the cure.

185
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,440
Otherwise, you may not live long.

186
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,440
Monk,

187
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,320
how long can I live?

188
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,520
Ten years if you insist.

189
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,960
Ten years?

190
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,920
Ten years?

191
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,960
You helped me get back

192
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,400
the ten years of fate from Prince Yan.

193
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,560
No way.

194
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,560
But please

195
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,600
give me a message.

196
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,960
If someone asks,

197
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,400
you've never met Premier Li.

198
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,160
There's no Premier Li in this world.

199
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,560
And the Four Gu Sect.

200
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,600
I won't go back.

201
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,040
I'm leaving.

202
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,200
Premier Li,

203
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,040
you're young

204
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,920
but you're so relaxed.

205
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,400
It's a pity.

206
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,560
Besides, the poison of tea

207
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,320
has been in your lungs.

208
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,040
It will torture you.

209
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,400
If you can't hold it in

210
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,680
and get into trouble again,

211
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,600
you'll be trapped in illusion.

212
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,880
In the end...

213
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,840
In the end, you'll be a lunatic.

214
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,000
It's good to be sealed to death.

215
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,040
You'll be ignorant

216
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,040
and have no faith.

217
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,000
I don't know what you want to avoid.

218
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,600
You're determined to marry me.

219
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,400
I'm calm and relaxed.

220
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,080
I'm open to flowers.

221
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,640
Monk,

222
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,880
your tea

223
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,880
is very good.

224
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,720
It's done.

225
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,040
Chief Li.

226
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,800
I've been buried in the East Sea.

227
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,800
From now on,

228
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,840
there are only flowers left.

229
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,520
You have to pay the money back at once.

230
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,400
We don't have money on us.

231
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,800
You must congratulations me.

232
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,800
Master,

233
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,200
did you purposefully

234
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,680
vain about surprise me,

235
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,880
I don't have the face to pick you up.

236
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,200
It's indeed the safety of the Golden Moon Alliance.

237
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
This warm moon is quite rare.

238
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,680
Kunlun Jade City.

239
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,880
The Golden Moon Alliance

240
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,400
Young Master, why don't you sit down and eat something?

241
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,680
That looks like a bad thing.

242
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,680
I haven't reached the point of losing my mouth.

243
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,680
You have to lose your stomach if you don't lose your mouth.

244
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,680
Young Master, we really don't have any more food left.

245
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,680
After eating this meal, we might not have another meal.

246
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,680
Wang Fu,

247
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,680
do you really have nothing left on you?

248
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,680
Nothing left.

249
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,080
Young Master, aren't you going to use this jade pendant as a pendant?

250
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,880
No, no.

251
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,080
This is something that the Hall Leader hung on you since he was born.

252
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,680
You can't even move it when you're talking or selling.

253
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,680
Otherwise, my mother wouldn't have torn it off.

254
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,680
Wang Fu, turn the bag over and take a look.

255
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,280
This letter is...

256
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,680
The thing that the Lin Mountain Sect threw away to kill the Second Emperor,

257
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,480
I just picked up a few pieces of paper that he wrote.

258
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,480
I wanted to burn them for my mother.

259
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,480
I told her not to think about them anymore.

260
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,680
I'll help you write it next time.

261
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,680
Come, let me see.

262
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,680
Wait a minute.

263
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,880
Why does this letter have a different pattern?

264
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,880
As long as it didn't match your message,

265
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,080
there would be no money in the page.

266
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,080
Oooh!

267
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,880
I'm be Bock.

268
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,280
Thank you for Costumeona separate unni and living together since then.

269
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,480
Thank you for your support.

270
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,080
What... what does this mean?

271
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,320
This is obviously the request letter

272
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,320
that Piao Erhuang hasn't sent out yet.

273
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,120
There are only

274
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,800
the drug drugs

275
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,320
that are available in the Golden Thread Embroidery.

276
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,160
Only the drug drugs

277
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,160
that are available in the drug drugs

278
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,360
of the Demon Di Feisheng.

279
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,640
Piao Erhuang

280
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,960
is working for the drug drugs.

281
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,200
Young Master,

282
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,760
what does the drug drug look like?

283
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,560
Li Er,

284
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,400
take out the first-hand

285
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,040
Golden Thread Embroidery's drug

286
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,280
that Tianqi Hall has collected for many years.

287
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:07,680
Okay.

288
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,700
Manage the defense

289
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,880
Drugs and 그런데

290
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,040
cannot be used 하

291
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,040
where does it come from?

292
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,240
It is good for ceiling by poison

293
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:36,840
Are

294
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,840
It's not a coincidence that he survived and died.

295
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,440
Because he's the demon.

296
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,560
So it's not a coincidence that he went to the Taoist Temple.

297
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,520
And it's not a coincidence that he died.

298
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,720
It's because he exposed the traces of the Golden Thread Embroidery.

299
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,160
The demon is here to kill him.

300
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,720
There are too many coincidences.

301
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,440
If he's really the fish face of the Golden Thread Embroidery,

302
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,680
we can't let him slip away from the bottom of the eye.

303
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,760
Then where can we find him?

304
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,600
There's a mountain road in the north.

305
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,960
He can't get away by dragging this house.

306
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,320
Let's go.

307
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,360
Let's go after him.

308
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,360
Young Master, walk slowly.

309
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,800
Brother.

310
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,000
What's wrong?

311
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,000
Young Master, a ghost.

312
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,440
It's not a ghost.

313
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,400
It's a corpse.

314
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,120
Let's go to Li Lianhua.

315
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,160
Hurry up.

316
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,280
Okay.

317
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,360
Okay.

318
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,560
I finally found you.

319
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,760
Where were you sleeping the whole night?

320
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,040
You should rest well.

321
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,200
It's rare that he does over all my good deeds.

322
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,120
He completely recovered my power.

323
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,880
But I hurt myself too.

324
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,160
It's really strange.

325
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,120
Be careful.

326
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,640
Don't speak much IDEA.

327
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,440
Jabu has been hurting herself before.

328
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,520
Nothing is strange.

329
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,520
Young Master,

330
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,920
you'd better not say it.

331
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,880
That's right, Young Master.

332
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,960
We've checked this area just now.

333
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,440
There's nothing special.

334
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,280
You're silly.

335
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,680
The most important thing

336
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,560
is often hidden in the most unobtrusive place.

337
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,680
Your Majesty.

338
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,200
Fine silk and Pleflows.

339
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,880
That's a rare thing.

340
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,520
Why would you use it to heat an electric casserole?

341
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,760
This lathe is rather popular with the wounded.

342
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,600
I think that

343
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,720
Jin Yue Meng may have a Sahas pick it up.

344
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:18,960
It…

345
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,000
Does it mean his master

346
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,440
had a crush on him

347
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,320
and bought it for it?

348
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,520
I don't think

349
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,880
there's anything among them on this house.

350
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,720
There must be somebody around.

351
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,440
Open the door.

352
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,440
Please forgive us.

353
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,440
We have a rule here.

354
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,440
If you want to stay here,

355
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,440
you have to cross the fire plate of the evil.

356
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,440
The evil?

357
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,440
You may not know,

358
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,440
there is an ancient battlefield nearby.

359
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,440
Many soldiers are lost.

360
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,440
So,

361
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,440
sometimes,

362
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,440
there are some things

363
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,440
that make people suspicious.

364
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,440
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

365
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,440
The shopkeeper

366
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,440
has prepared a fire plate.

367
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,440
Let's go and have a look.

368
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,440
It's a little bit strange.

369
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,440
Young Master,

370
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,440
how about we not staying here?

371
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,440
If we don't stay here,

372
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,440
we will be lost at night.

373
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,440
Thank you.

374
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,440
Thank you.

375
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,440
May you be safe.

376
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,440
May you be safe.

377
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,440
May you be safe.

378
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,440
Fortunately, the shop is full of people.

379
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,440
That kid was so scary.

380
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,440
I thought it was some ghost shop.

381
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,440
It's really here.

382
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,440
You two,

383
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,440
go to the room and have a look.

384
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,440
Is there any other evidence?

385
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,440
Come on.

386
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,440
It's said that

387
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,440
when you meet someone,

388
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,440
you will lose your chance of meeting him.

389
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,440
But it's awkward

390
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,440
to meet him again.

391
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,440
Mr. Fang,

392
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,440
it's like this.

393
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,440
I was in a hurry to go north.

394
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,440
I didn't manage to get you drunk.

395
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,440
I didn't get you drunk.

396
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,440
I didn't manage to get you drunk.

397
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,440
I didn't do anything wrong.

398
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,440
Come on.

399
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,440
I'll treat you to a cold drink.

400
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,440
I don't like to eat melon.

401
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,440
Li Shen Yi,

402
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,440
you left in such a hurry

403
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,440
because of Piao Er Huang, right?

404
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,440
What does it have to do with Piao Er Huang?

405
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,440
How did you get into the woodshed

406
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,440
that was locked?

407
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,440
It's like this, Mr. Fang.

408
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,440
I saw Piao Er Huang

409
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,440
screaming all the time.

410
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,440
So,

411
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,440
I went in

412
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,440
to have a look

413
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,440
and I even knocked on the lock.

414
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,440
Then, you should have some skills.

415
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,440
The script is really smooth.

416
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,440
It's a pity that you left in such a hurry.

417
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,440
You didn't confirm whether Piao Er Huang

418
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,440
was dead or not.

419
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,440
What if you have a chance to talk?

420
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,440
Mr. Fang,

421
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,440
it's better that Piao Er Huang didn't die.

422
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,440
It's better to let you send her to Bai Chuan Yue

423
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,440
to work.

424
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,440
I think so, too.

425
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,440
It's a pity that Piao Er Huang only told you

426
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,440
what the source and identity was.

427
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,440
I don't need to prove it anymore.

428
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,440
Come back to Bai Chuan Yue with me.

429
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,440
Mr. Fang, you're joking.

430
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,440
What source and identity can I have?

431
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,440
I'm just a

432
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,440
wandering doctor who eats everywhere.

433
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,440
There's more than one person

434
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,440
who has a reputation.

435
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,440
Ten years ago, there was one person

436
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,440
who was famous for being a doctor.

437
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,440
After talking about it for a long time,

438
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,440
you're suspecting that I'm the drug model of Golden Moon.

439
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,440
It seems that Piao Er Huang is dead.

440
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,440
Otherwise,

441
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,440
you wouldn't guess so badly.

442
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,440
Di Fei was born with silver jewelry.

443
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,440
But he found it in your lotus head.

444
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,440
He also said that you had nothing to do with Golden Moon.

445
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,440
This thing has such a big origin.

446
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,440
I did pick it up at the beach a few years ago.

447
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,440
Isn't picking up things a crime?

448
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,440
What a coincidence.

449
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,440
Who said I didn't eat it?

450
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,440
Mr. Fang, eat some watermelon quickly.

451
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,440
If you don't eat it, it won't be cold anymore.

452
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,440
Mr. Fang,

453
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,440
it rains every night.

454
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,440
It's so humid.

455
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,440
This place is really dirty.

456
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,440
If it weren't for this place,

457
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,440
it would be the closest road to the port.

458
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,440
I wouldn't come here even if I died.

459
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,440
No wonder the store is so particular.

460
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,440
I came here.

461
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,440
Did you hear what happened two days ago?

462
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,440
What happened?

463
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,440
Just two days ago,

464
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,440
a friend of mine

465
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,440
saw two merchants

466
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,440
passing by the forest not far from here.

467
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,440
He was robbed by a hooligan from a warehouse.

468
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,440
Really?

469
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,440
Okay.

470
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,440
Waiter,

471
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,440
may I ask

472
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,440
which room the hooligan's son lives in?

473
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,440
The one in the innermost room.

474
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,440
Okay.

475
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,440
Li, help me dig the wind.

476
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,440
I'll go find the room of that fake doctor.

477
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,440
Okay.

478
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,440
Okay.

479
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,440
Don't panic, everyone.

480
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,440
It's just a big wind.

481
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,440
I'm sorry.

482
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,440
Li,

483
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,440
take this stuff away.

484
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,440
Sir,

485
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,440
I can't say that.

486
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,440
This girl in the portrait

487
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,440
is the sister of the master of the city, Yu Qiushuang.

488
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,440
She left home early because of some reason.

489
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,440
That's why Zhang Tie told me to find her.

490
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,440
The people who live in the inn

491
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,440
are all people from the city to find the second lady.

492
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,440
Okay.

493
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,440
The melon is almost broken.

494
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,440
Why didn't you give it to the guest?

495
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,440
Why didn't you give it to the guest?

496
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,440
Why didn't you give it to the guest?

497
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,440
I have a suggestion for you.

498
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,440
Two coins for the noodles,

499
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,440
three coins for the food,

500
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,440
and a small dish of food.

501
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,440
Who are you looking down on?

502
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,440
I'm not hungry.

503
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,440
Young Master is so depressed now.

504
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,440
He can't even afford the noodles.

505
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,440
Go home now.

506
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,440
You haven't finished your words.

507
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,440
Where are you going?

508
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,440
Young Master,

509
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,440
if the detective of Baichuangyuan

510
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,440
catches people casually,

511
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,440
the name tag will never be used.

512
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,440
So,

513
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,440
you catch me,

514
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,440
and I'll be the master.

515
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,440
Don't be afraid.

516
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,440
Ghost!

517
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,440
Who are you calling a ghost?

518
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,440
It's...

519
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,440
The moon on the painting.

520
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,440
What are you looking at?

521
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,440
Don't look at it.

522
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,440
Second Young Mistress.

523
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,440
Second Young Mistress,

524
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,440
where are you going?

525
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,440
We're looking for you.

526
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,440
You're all over the mountain,

527
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,440
and you're also putting up posters.

528
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,440
Are you trying to be a whip?

529
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,440
It's...

530
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,440
It's Madam who's been looking for Second Young Mistress

531
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,440
for days,

532
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,440
but she couldn't find her.

533
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,440
That's why she asked us to put up posters.

534
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,440
Sister asked you to come?

535
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,440
Madam went to the south of the mountain.

536
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,440
She'll be back in a few days.

537
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,440
It's Miss Yun Jiao

538
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,440
who brought us here to look for Second Young Mistress.

539
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,440
She's on the second floor.

540
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,440
Second Young Mistress.

541
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,440
Second Young Mistress.

542
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,440
Second Young Mistress.

543
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,440
Second Young Mistress.

544
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,440
Why are you following me?

545
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,440
I'm already upstairs.

546
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,440
Can't you just run away?

547
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,440
Shuang, you're finally back.

548
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,440
If you didn't put up posters,

549
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,440
I'll make sure you're all over the mountain.

550
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,440
Good thing we found the person.

551
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,440
It's not easy for a man like you

552
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,440
to give up on his temper.

553
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,440
That's a good idea.

554
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,440
If any suspect disappears for no reason,

555
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,440
we'll be in trouble all the way.

556
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,440
We'll force him to show up automatically.

557
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,440
Wang Zhao Xiao,

558
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,440
your son

559
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,440
is missing after he came in.

560
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,440
You might have this way

561
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,440
to find him.

562
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,440
I'll go check on him.

563
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,440
Second Young Mistress.

564
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,440
Have you prepared the hot water for the bath?

565
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,440
Yes, Miss.

566
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,440
This way.

567
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,680
I've already settled the

568
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,440
I'll be back in the imperial city tomorrow morning.

569
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,440
Thank you, Miss Yun.

570
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,440
Miss Yun and our Second Young Mistress

571
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,440
are like sisters.

572
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,440
With her,

573
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,440
we can finally give her a job.

574
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,440
Let's go up.

575
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,440
Here they come again.

576
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,440
Hurry!

577
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,440
Hurry!

578
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,440
Hurry!

579
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,440
Hurry!

580
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,440
Hurry!

581
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,440
Hurry!

582
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,440
Hurry!

583
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,440
Hurry!

584
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,440
What's going on?

585
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,440
Shen Qi!

586
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,440
Shen Qi!

587
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,440
Shen Qi!

588
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,440
Shen Qi!

589
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,440
Shen Qi!

590
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,440
There's blood up there!

591
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,440
There's blood up there!

592
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,440
There's blood up there!

593
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,440
What's going on?

594
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,440
Wang Fu!

595
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,440
Wang Fu!

596
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,440
Young Master,

597
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,440
Wang Fu was just fine.

598
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,440
He turned into this once he entered the room.

599
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,440
Wang Fu.

600
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,440
It's him.

601
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,440
It must be him!

602
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,440
It's him!

603
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,440
It's him!

604
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,440
It's him!

605
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,440
It's him!

606
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,440
It's him!

607
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,440
It's him!

608
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,440
He must have caused Wang Fu's death!

609
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,440
Did you do something?

610
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,440
What...

611
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,440
What could I do?

612
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,440
You know that Wang Fu came to your room.

613
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,440
So you used evil tricks to kill him.

614
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,440
I can understand that you're upset about Wang Fu's death.

615
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:50,440
But you wouldn't have tainted this crime on me.

616
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,440
You're a devil.

617
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,440
You have many evil tricks.

618
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,440
If you really have the right,

619
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,440
come back to the White Shrine with me to investigate it.

620
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,440
If you leave now,

621
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,440
your Wang Fu will die in vain.

622
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,440
His bones are broken.

623
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,440
He was obviously stabbed to death.

624
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,440
I just saw him.

625
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,440
He was obviously stabbed to death.

626
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,440
I was sitting opposite you.

627
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,440
How could I stab him to death?

628
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,440
Mr. Fang.

629
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,440
If you waste your time like this,

630
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,440
the murderer will really run away.

631
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,440
Young Master, you can't believe his evil tricks.

632
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,440
It must be him!

633
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,440
Don't worry, Li.

634
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,440
No matter who the murderer is,

635
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,440
he needs evidence.

636
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,440
If you're the murderer,

637
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,440
I'll avenge Wang Fu.

638
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,440
I'll give you a chance.

639
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,440
Who's the murderer?

640
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,440
I really don't know.

641
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,440
But a little man was killed by accident.

642
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,440
It means he's just a shadow.

643
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,440
But as long as we keep looking for it along the line,

644
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,440
then we can definitely get into the real body.

645
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,440
Second Young Mistress!

646
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,440
Second Young Mistress!

647
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,440
Where's Second Young Mistress?

648
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,440
Where's Second Young Mistress?

649
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,440
We were just waiting at the stairs.

650
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,440
We didn't see Second Young Mistress go out.

651
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,440
Where's Qiu Shuang?

652
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,440
Where's Qiu Shuang?

653
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,440
A man just died.

654
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,440
Second Young Mistress is also missing.

655
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,440
Could it be that Xue Zhao Yin took her away?

656
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,440
Search!

657
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,440
Yes!

658
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,440
Search!

659
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,440
What are you doing?

660
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,440
What do you want?

661
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,440
Second Young Mistress!

662
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,440
I'm Cheng Yun He, the chief of the Escort of He Xing Escort.

663
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,440
Judging from your outfits,

664
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,440
you must be the guards of the imperial city.

665
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,440
We always keep our eyes on the river.

666
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,440
I wonder what you're doing in our room all of a sudden.

667
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,440
My second young mistress is missing.

668
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,440
That's why I searched the inn.

669
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,440
Please forgive me for offending you.

670
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,440
Second Young Mistress?

671
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,440
Everyone saw it.

672
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,440
There's only our Escort's body in this room.

673
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,440
There's no Second Young Mistress you found.

674
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,440
Open it.

675
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,440
Friends,

676
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,440
we're all criminals in the underworld.

677
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,440
We can't open the place where the Escort is transported.

678
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,440
That's our rule.

679
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,440
Look.

680
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,440
There are also prints of the hand-sealed by the employer.

681
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,440
The date on the lock has never been unsealed.

682
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,440
The Second Young Mistress you mentioned

683
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,440
can't have passed these prints.

684
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,440
She must have been in the box.

685
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,440
Right?

686
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,440
My second young mistress is missing.

687
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,440
The box is suspicious.

688
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,440
If you don't open it,

689
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,440
I'll kill you.

690
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,440
I'll kill you.

691
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,440
I'll kill you.

692
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,440
There's a suspicion.

693
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,440
If you don't open it,

694
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,440
we can't let it slip away today.

695
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,440
I'll see who dares to.

696
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,440
Escort Master.

697
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,440
This is the underground of the imperial city.

698
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,440
If we do it now,

699
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,440
I think we'll have to leave it here.

700
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,440
The body.

701
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,440
Escort Master Cheng.

702
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,440
You promised us

703
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,440
you wouldn't bring anything unlucky into the inn.

704
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,440
You're an old customer.

705
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,440
That's why we trusted you.

706
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,440
How...

707
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,440
How did you bring a head in here?

708
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,440
This is a dead ball that the government just cut off.

709
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,440
My family wants to keep a whole body.

710
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,440
So they asked me to bring it back.

711
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,440
That's not good.

712
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,440
As long as it's something bad,

713
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,440
it'll cause a complaint.

714
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,440
The...

715
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,440
The complaints are here.

716
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,440
Look.

717
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,440
This is a magic trick.

718
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,440
There will definitely be no bad things.

719
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,440
Second Young Mistress.

720
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,440
Second Young Mistress.

721
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,440
Excuse me.

722
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,440
Excuse me.

723
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,440
Second Young Mistress.

724
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,440
Second Young Mistress.

725
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,440
Second Young Mistress.

726
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,440
Second Young Mistress.

727
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,440
Second Young Mistress.

728
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,440
What... What's going on?

729
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,440
How is this possible?

730
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,440
Could it be that there's really a ghost?

731
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,440
My second young mistress died in the inn.

732
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,440
None of you are involved.

733
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,440
Take her back to the inn.

734
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,440
Yes.

735
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,440
City Leader.

736
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,440
This is Second Young Mistress.

737
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,440
Second Young Mistress.

738
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,440
It's locked.

739
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,440
Lock up everyone in the inn.

740
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,440
Wait for the mistress to come back and set out.

741
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,440
Yes.

742
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,440
Brother.

743
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,440
You asked your City Leader to come see me.

744
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,440
Do you know who I am?

745
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,440
I'm the detective of Bai Shuyuan.

746
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,440
Why should I be locked up?

747
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,440
You can't even hear me?

748
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,440
I'm talking to you.

749
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,440
Stop yelling.

750
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,440
I told you.

751
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,440
City Leader Yu is not here.

752
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,440
When he comes back, he'll see you.

753
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,440
When he locked us up,

754
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,440
he only saw City Leader Yu Mulan.

755
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,440
Yu Mulan is not real.

756
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,440
He's the mastermind.

757
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,440
How do you know?

758
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,440
Think about it.

759
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,440
The guards in the inn

760
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,440
only mention Madam, not City Leader.

761
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,440
And this Yu Qiushuang.

762
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,440
She only calls her sister, not sister-in-law.

763
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,440
You can imagine

764
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,440
that Yu Mulan is a new person.

765
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,440
She just left the City Leader's name.

766
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,440
So in this city,

767
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,440
the real speaker is Yu Hongzhu.

768
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,440
But last night,

769
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,440
you still can't figure out the suspect.

770
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,440
Don't put all your thoughts on me.

771
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,440
As a detective,

772
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,440
you have to listen and ask more.

773
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,440
Do your homework.

774
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,440
No need for you to say.

775
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,440
City Leader, don't go.

776
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,440
What's going on with your identity tag?

777
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,440
I also want to know the reason.

778
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,220
The

779
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,220
royal jade was sent to the capital by the mine.

780
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,220
Everyone saw it when it was sealed.

781
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,220
And it never left our sight.

782
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,220
Why is it now Miss Yu?

783
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,220
It's all because you stole the identity tag.

784
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,220
Don't lie to me.

785
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,220
That man has done magic.

786
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,220
What's the use of doing it?

787
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,220
Yu City is clearly going to

788
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,220
drag us to the grave.

789
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,220
Lead Escort Master Chen,

790
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,220
what's going on with this identity tag?

791
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,220
It's the same day of the token.

792
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,220
Someone found me

793
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,220
and asked me to secretly steal the identity tag.

794
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,460
They said that the official silver of the

795
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,460
Xiong Fanjie was cut off.

796
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,460
The family wanted to protect the power.

797
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,460
They gave us a hundred taels of silver.

798
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,460
I was so happy

799
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,460
and agreed to it.

800
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,460
Manager,

801
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,460
is there any strange thing about the Xiaoming Inn?

802
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,460
No.

803
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,460
It's just that in the past years,

804
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,460
the Central Plains Festival was invited to do magic.

805
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,460
Only this year,

806
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,460
it really happened.

807
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,460
It's the ghost.

808
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,460
We saw it.

809
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,460
Brother, don't be nervous.

810
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,460
The ghost god said that it's not credible.

811
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,460
Except for the ghost,

812
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,460
who else could kill Miss Yu'er?

813
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,460
She even hid in our old box.

814
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,460
It's strange.

815
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,460
How did Yu Qiushuang get killed?

816
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,460
How did she get sealed in the box?

817
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,460
It sounds like a ghost.

818
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,460
This ghost

819
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,460
probably doesn't want to

820
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,460
protect Miss Yu'er's body.

821
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,460
You...

822
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,460
Miss Yu'er's body was burned.

823
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,460
I'm very angry after I saw her.

824
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,460
Take everyone away.

825
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,460
Yes.

826
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,460
Blood?

827
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,460
Where did the blood come from?

828
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,460
This blood

829
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,460
should be from the guard of the imperial city.

830
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,460
What's wrong with the guards?

831
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,460
As a guard of the imperial city,

832
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,460
the guardian is not good.

833
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,460
I sent them to guard the body.

834
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,460
I don't know who burned the body.

835
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,460
My sister was killed.

836
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,460
I let them kill themselves.

837
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:50,460
It's kind of mercy.

838
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,460
You're Mrs. Yu.

839
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:56,460
You didn't figure it out.

840
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,460
You just wanted the guards' lives.

841
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,460
Yu Cheng's servants

842
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:02,460
are not related to you.

843
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,460
They are incompetent.

844
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,460
Yu Cheng never leaves anything behind.

845
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,460
Mrs. Yu,

846
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,460
Miss Yu'er's death is not related to us.

847
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,460
It's not related to us.

848
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,460
It's the evil spirit that killed people.

849
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,460
Yes, we're here to testify.

850
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,460
It's not related to us.

851
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:20,460
I haven't seen the ghost.

852
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,460
Then tell me

853
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,460
what the evil spirit looks like.

854
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:32,460
What?

855
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,460
You can't remember?

856
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:36,460
Or you forgot?

857
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:38,460
I heard that the dead

858
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,460
are not related to us.

859
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,460
You're crazy.

860
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,460
Are you crazy?

861
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,460
I'm sorry.

862
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,460
I'm sorry.

863
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:14,460
I'm sorry.

864
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,460
I'm sorry.

865
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,460
I'm sorry.

866
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,460
I'm sorry.

867
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,460
I'm sorry.

868
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,460
I'm sorry.

869
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,460
I'm sorry.

870
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,460
I'm sorry.

871
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,460
I'm sorry.

872
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,460
I'm sorry.

873
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,460
I'm sorry.

874
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:36,460
I'm sorry.

875
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:38,460
I'm sorry.

876
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,460
I'm sorry.

877
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:42,460
I'm sorry.

878
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,460
I'm sorry.

879
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,460
I'm sorry.

880
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,460
I'm sorry.

881
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,460
I'm sorry.

882
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,460
I'm sorry.

883
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:54,460
I'm sorry.

884
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,460
I'm sorry.

885
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,460
I'm sorry.

886
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,460
I'm sorry.

887
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:02,460
I'm sorry.

888
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,460
I'm sorry.

889
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:06,460
I'm sorry.

890
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,460
I'm sorry.

891
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,460
I'm sorry.

892
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:12,460
I'm sorry.

893
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,460
I'm sorry.

894
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,460
I'm sorry.

895
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,460
I'm sorry.

896
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:20,460
I'm sorry.

897
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,460
I'm sorry.

898
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,460
I'm sorry.

899
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,460
I'm sorry.

900
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,460
I'm sorry.

901
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,460
I'm sorry.

902
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:32,460
I'm sorry.

903
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:34,460
I'm sorry.

904
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:36,460
I'm sorry.

905
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:38,460
I'm sorry.

906
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,460
I'm sorry.

907
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:42,460
I'm sorry.

908
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:44,460
I'm sorry.

909
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,460
I'm sorry.

910
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:48,460
I'm sorry.

911
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:50,460
I'm sorry.

912
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:52,460
I'm sorry.

913
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,460
I'm sorry.

914
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,460
I'm sorry.

915
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,460
I'm sorry.

916
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:00,460
I'm sorry.

917
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,460
I'm sorry.

918
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,460
I'm sorry.

919
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:06,460
I'm sorry.

920
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:08,460
I'm sorry.

921
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,460
I'm sorry.

922
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:12,460
I'm sorry.

923
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:14,460
I'm sorry.

924
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,460
I'm sorry.

925
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:18,460
I'm sorry.

926
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:20,460
I'm sorry.

927
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,460
I'm sorry.

928
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:24,460
I'm sorry.

929
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:26,460
I'm sorry.

930
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,460
I'm sorry.
