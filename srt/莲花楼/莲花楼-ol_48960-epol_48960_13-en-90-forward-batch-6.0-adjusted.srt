00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:47,950
Xiangyi.

5
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,789
Do you think that

6
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:54,070
what you say is always right,

7
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,070
always the truth,

8
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,520
and Sigu Sect can't survive without you?

9
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,560
Yes.

10
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,640
It has been proven over the years

11
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,980
that all these are true.

12
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,520
Sigu Sect will run normally

13
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,840
regardless of who leaves.

14
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,650
But without Li Xiangyi,

15
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,850
it'll collapse.

16
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,540
Fine.

17
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,860
You've finally said it.

18
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,180
We grew up together since we were young.

19
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,579
When there was food, I couldn't bear to eat them,

20
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:32,850
and I gave all of them to you.

21
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,980
I also gave you the best sword I forged.

22
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:36,980
Deep down,

23
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,260
I value you

24
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,260
more than myself.

25
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,079
But what about you?

26
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,329
Since Sigu Sect only needs you,

27
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,650
I quit.

Sect Leader.

51
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,580
We were ambushed by the Jinyuan Alliance.

52
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,990
Senior's dead body was snatched too.

53
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,000
It was a trick of luring the tiger out of the mountain.

54
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,270
Sigu Sect, listen to my order.

55

From today onwards,

56
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,910
we'll fight the Jinyuan Alliance

57

Li Lianhua.

59
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,350
Why are you spacing out?

60
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,650
Since I exposed your nonsense,

61
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,780
you don't know how to quibble anymore, do you?

62
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,510
I can't hide anything from you.

63
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,310
Of course.

64
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,909
They are very close.

65
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,690
I'll spare your life today.

66
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,290
Don't spread rumours again.

67
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,390
It's time to go.

68
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,700
Fei knows my uncle.

69
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,830
He must know Li Xiangyi.

70
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,300
Fei is not familiar with Li Xiangyi.

71
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,820
You don't have to ask him.

72
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,370
I don't care about others,

73
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,970
but I must find out about Fei.

74
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,530
He is so bad at martial arts

75
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,460
but so arrogant.

76
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,270
There must be something fishy.

77
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:29,840
Come on.

78
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,410
Let's go to Baichuan Court together.

79
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,340
Why are we going to Baichuan Court?

80
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,380
Counting the murder cases in Cailian Manor,

81
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,140
I've already solved three major cases.

82
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,340
It's time to go to Baichuan Court

83
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,810
for the real detective badge.

84
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,730
If so, you will have Baichuan Court as your partner

85
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,330
when you become a detective.

86
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,030
Congratulations.

87
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,830
Same to you.

88
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,720
You used to be my partner,

89
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,560
and you'll also be the only one in the future.

90
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,420
How about this?

91
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,960
We'll imitate the Sigu Sect

92
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,600
to solve mysterious cases

93
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,140
and rectify the martial arts world.

94
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,670
Let's go.

95
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,220
So much money?

96
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,560
Li Lianhua,

97
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,659
did you strike gold

98
00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:06,460
or get a fever?

99
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,000
You're leaving soon.

100
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,340
If you don't prepare well,

101
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,100
you may starve to death on the way.

102
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,760
Take it to buy some solid food.

103
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:14,360
No need?

104
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,740
Fine, if you don't need it, I can just...

105
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,230
It's a rare opportunity for misers like you to be generous.

106
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,340
I'll go buy food in town right away.

107
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:24,490
By the way,

108
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:25,910
keep an eye on Fei.

109
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,180
I'll investigate him when I come back.

110
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,950
I bought a lot of fresh vegetables.

111
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,400

Otherwise, things will change."

124
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,440
There's no way I will buy that.

Director Di,

134
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:03,460
you've emptied all the pharmacies nearby, right?

135
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,510
Let's begin.

136
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,490
To practice this technique,

137
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,020
you have to insert silver needles at certain anatomical points

138
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,200
and take herbal medicine to get the poison out of your body.

139
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:15,960
Director Di,

140
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,410
please meditate and circulate your qi.

141
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,720
I'll perform the acupuncture.

Li Xiangyi,

143
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,350
don't play tricks with me when it's related to martial arts.

144
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,080
It's been ten years since we saw each other,

145
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,940
and you've become more vigilant.

146
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,170
Don't worry.

147
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,720
I won't play any tricks.

148
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:31,700
It would be best.

149
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,940
I've told you

150
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,340
the mantra.

151
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,480
Circulate your inner breath for 49 days,

152
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,840
and the poison of the Xiuluo Grass will be detoxified.

153
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,400
Remember, it's 49 days.

154
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,490
Don't miss even a bit.

155
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,880
Do you hear me?

156
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,150
Director Di.

157
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,860
Do you hear me?

158
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,910
Director Di.

159
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,520
When should I leave

160
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,810
if not now?

161
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,260
My Lord ordered that

162
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,100
I must make Sect Leader Li stay.

163
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,260
Your Lord just said I can leave.

164
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:54,930
Oh no.

165
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,140
The poisonous grass has backfired on Your Lord.

166
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,600
Go quickly and have a look.

167
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,180
You have recovered just like that?

168
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,020
I didn't realize how quickly 49 days went by.

169
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:21,780
Where are you going?

170
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,050
We're even now.

171
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,120
So I'm leaving.

172
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,340
I promised not to expose your identity.

173
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,350
But do you think you can retire from the martial arts world

174
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,480
and die like a loser?

175
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,700
You're too naive.

176
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,230
Director Di,

177
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,720
why bother forcing me?

178
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,900
All I want is for you to live on

179
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,750
and fight with me again.

180
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,230
Greetings, My Lord.

181
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,710
Medicine Demon.

182
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,320
I want him to regain his inner power.

183
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,670
My Lord,

184
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,980
he is severely injured.

185
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,270
It's not easy to deal with.

186
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,150
Is it not easy,

187
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,480
or are you not competent enough?

188
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:17,860
No, no, no.

189
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,110
My Lord, if you want him to recover,

190
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,330
I'll try my best.

191
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,990
My Lord, please come with me.

192
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:29,300
Let's go.

193
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:30,980
Move.

194
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,620
My Lord,

195
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,680
Hundreds Herbs Syrup

196
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,380
is a treasure I have decocted

197
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,410
with hundreds of exotic herbs for over ten years.

198
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,860
Normally, a cup of it works.

199
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,500
But if you drink too much,

200
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,760
your meridians will overreact and cause unbearable pain.

201
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,080
Drink that.

202
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,680
Please.

203
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,870
With his injury,

204
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,370
one cup may not work.

205
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,070
Go on.

206
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,540
It's so bitter.

207
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:49,870
Well...

208
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:51,830
Feed him.

209
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,430
Yes, My Lord.

210
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:00,310
Please.

211
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:02,910
Thank you.

212
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,980
I'll do it myself.

213
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:20,610
My Lord,

214
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,870
this guy's qi has been disrupted.

215
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,230
His inner power is weak.

216
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:24,760
Well...

217
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,300
Even three cups are of no avail.

218
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,160
His inner power is weak?

219
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:42,090
I'll insert my inner power into his body

220
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,590
to stimulate the drug effect.

221
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:09,460
My Lord.

222
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,810
He will die if you do so.

223
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,440
I told you it's incurable.

224
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,010
It's such a waste of resources

225
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,920
for Director Di to get me all these treasures.

226
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:39,770
Think of another way.

227
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,340
Think of a way.

228
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,950
We can give it a shot at the Spiritual Snake Cave.

229
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,360
Spiritual Snake Cave?

230
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,460
My Lord,

231
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,580
these spiritual flood dragons in the Eastern Sea

232
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,580
have been fed with spiritual medicine for many years.

233
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,930
They like to suck people's qi and feed them again.

234
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,330
Now that this guy's qi is disrupted.

235
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,310
Let's have an exchange transfusion for him.

236
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,610
It might work.

237
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:22,650
Let's try then.

238
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,780
B-Bicha Poison?

239
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:53,830
My Lord.

240
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,800
He was poisoned by Bicha Poison.

241
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:02,920
Useless!

242
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,040
My Lord, please calm down.

243
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,430
If you want him to regain his inner power,

244
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,270
and fight him,

245
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,710
there's another way.

246
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,140
Say it.

247
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,020
Wangchuan Flower.

248
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,590
Wangchuan Flower?

249
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,210
It has the supreme yang.

250
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:21,670
It can help me break through the eighth level of the Windy Poplar.

251
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,750
But his inner power is not strong.

252
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:24,990
How can it cure him?

253
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,400
My Lord,

254
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,540
Wangchuan Flower has two different types, namely Yin and Yang.

255
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,370
The Yang grass is a kind of martial art, same as you.

256
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,770
While the Yin grass

257
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,900
is the most poisonous grass in the world.

258
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,760
Even if a child takes it,

259
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,810
they can gain more than ten years of martial skills.

260
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,260
But it's like the last radiance of the setting sun.

261
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,540
A few days later,

262
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,870
the Yin grass will start to have a strong effect,

263
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,400
and it will get stronger and stronger.

264
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,140
His meridians will break

265
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,550
and his organs will split.

266
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,710
There is no other way to die more terribly

267
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,980
than it in the world.

268
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,110
I don't want him to live a long life.

269
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,820
I just want him to live on until we fight again.

270
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,460
Let's go.

271
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,300
I want the Wangchuan Flower.

272
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,400
Yes, My Lord.

273
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,220
Why are you laughing?

274
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:23,950
Director Di,

275
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,980
stop wasting your time.

276
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:29,220
It's all for nothing.

277
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,650
So what if you get the Wangchuan Flower?

278
00:17:33,339 --> 00:17:34,770
You can force me to eat it,

279
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,700
but you can't force me to fight with you.

280
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,540
By then, I'll lie in front of you

281
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,420
and wait for death under the sun,

282
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,750
seeing you anxious.

283
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,750
It's already interesting even if I just imagine the situation.

284
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,350
Lee Xiangyi.

285
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,900
Don't you want to know

286
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,500
how your senior, Shan Gudao,

287
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,560
died?

288
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,900
The three kings of the Jinyuan Alliance killed my senior.

289
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,390
Yet you want to deny it?

290
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,060
It's written clearly on the mortuary records of the Jinyuan Alliance.

291
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,700
Shan Gudao died because his left chest was stabbed.

292
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,150
Among the three kings, only the King Xunming of Yama used a sword as his weapon.

293
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,300
He made a mistake back then.

294
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,130
I punished him to bind his right hand for a month.

295
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,430
Even if he did attack your senior,

296
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,980
he should have used his left hand.

297
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,510
It's impossible for him to kill your senior with his right hand.

298
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,040
Ten years ago,

299
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,980
we declared a five-year truce.

300
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,940
After that, your senior was killed for no reason.

301
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,110
Then the war between Jinyuan Alliance

302
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:40,900
and Sigu Sect

303
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,980
started again.

304
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,640
In the end, both of us lost our power

305
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,300
and declined in the martial arts world.

306
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,570
But you and I were not the ones who benefited from it.

307
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,790
If you really want to avenge the death

308
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,590
of tens of Sigu Sect's warriors,

309
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,420
and avenge the death of your senior,

310
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,620
I can help you find out the hidden truth.

311
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,580
As long as you promise

312
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,380
to fight with me again.

313
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,360
Avenge?

314
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,510
If they really want to avenge themselves,

315
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,460
they should take revenge on Li Xiangyi.

316
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,340
Because he was arrogant,

317
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,220
and he killed everyone.

318
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,350
He deserved to die.

319
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,540
And he did die after that.

320
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,420
All the hatred

321
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:30,340
vanished with Li Xiangyi ten years ago.

322
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:31,720
Director Di,

323
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,330
Li Lianhua

324
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:36,940
won't fight with you.

325
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,530
I understand.

326
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,360
You are now a lost soul

327
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,490
although you're alive.

328
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,160
You won't be easily persuaded by me.

329
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,310
Okay.

330
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,620
I'll add some more bets.

331
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,030
If you don't promise me,

332
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,600
I'll kill Shan Gudao's son myself.

333
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,360
Director Di,

334
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,900
please stop joking.

335
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,540
My senior didn't even get married.

336
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,160
How could he have a son?

337
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:12,710
18 years ago, the Second Young Miss of the Tianji Hall, He Xiaolan,

338
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,840
was in a relationship with Shan Gudao.

339
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,840
This is her farewell letter to Shan Gudao.

340
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,430
[To Shan Gudao]

341
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,250

00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:20,920
My Lord,

513
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,290
I have good news for you.

514
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:26,860
Aren't you looking for the King  Xunming of Yama

515
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,770
and the Four-faced Qingzun?

516
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,690
I sent someone to find some parts

517
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,260
of the map of Prison 188.

518
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,900
The whereabouts of King Xunming of Yama are included.

519
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,130
My Lord, I am so loyal to you,

520
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,940
please spare me this time.

521
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:49,830
Are you really that loyal?

522
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:50,990
Then tell me

523
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,040
why Li Xiangyi got poisoned by Bicha Poison.

524
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:55,930
How did you...

525
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,930
It doesn't matter how I know about it.

526
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:00,040
What matters is that in the past ten years,

527
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,730
you made me feel that I won the battle at the East Sea.

528
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,630
What matters is that in the past ten years,

529
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,760
you made me become an ignorant person.

530
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,170
Li Xiangyi deserved to die.

531
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,180
In this life,

532
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,740
I hope only My Lord ranks first in the martial arts world.

533
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,400
How do I need to use poison to dominate the world?

534
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:21,690
I wanted to get rid of Li Xiangyi secretly

535
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:23,400
to solve your problem.

536
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,600
But Li Xiangyi was so ignorant

537
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,550
that he came to steal your thunder.

538
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,840
I know I was wrong.

539
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:37,460
I've been waiting for you in the Jinyuan Alliance for ten years.

540
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,190
Finally, My Lord is back.

541
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,620
Please punish me.

542
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,690
I'll accept it.

543
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,110
I'm willing to accept the punishment.

544
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,120
Don't think you can do whatever you want

545
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,650
with ten years of hard work.

546
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,940
I don't care

547
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,160
whether Jinyuan Alliance survives or not.

548
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,000
From now on,

549
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,020
you don't have to investigate the thundering fire bombs anymore.

550
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,060
I have assigned Wuyan to investigate it.

551
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,120
If I find out that it's related to you,

552
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:00,730
I'll kill you.

553
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,260
Fang Duobing!

554
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,140
Are you abandoned again?

555
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,400
Are you hungry?

556
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:44,730
Dig in.

557
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,010
Eat.

558
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,370
Eat slowly.

559
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,490
What were you mumbling about?

560
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,540
I'm hungry.

561
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:08,980
Eat slowly.

562
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,240
Don't get choked.

563
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:33,880
I'm not eating.

564
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,340
You eat.

565
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,500
Why are you staring at me?

566
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,740
It's nothing.

567
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,820
Aren't you more like your mother?

568
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,900
What kind of nonsense is that?

569
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,530
Our butler said

570
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,700
I resemble my second aunt the most.

571
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,760
But when I was born,

572
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,690
my second aunt had already died.

573
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,510
You didn't see your uncles many times.

574
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,070
When you were young,

575
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,340
did he dote on you much?

576
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,230
My uncle is the second master of the Sigu Sect.

577
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,440
He was usually very busy.

578
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,900
He didn't have time for me.

579
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,800
Besides, my mother seemed to hate him very much.

580
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:16,260
She didn't allow me to get close to him.

581
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,260
Why do you suddenly ask about my family matter?

582
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:26,460
It's nothing.

583
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,280
I was just asking.

584
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,830
Eat your buns.

585
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,060
Then let me ask you.

586
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,150
You have to answer me honestly.

587
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,469
Who is Fei exactly?

588
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,860
Why is he so skilful in martial arts?

589
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,190
Since we are now at this point,

590
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:46,000
I won't hide it from you anymore.

591
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,290
He's Di Feisheng.

592
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,159
D-Di Feisheng?

593
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:54,100
The devil of the Jinyuan Alliance, Di Feisheng?

594
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:54,560
Well...

595
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,260
Do you know my master

596
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,170
is unaccounted for ten years because of him?

597
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:01,230
How can you hang out with such a devil?

598
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,990
He asked me to promise him to save someone.

599
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:05,790
Save someone?

600
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,100
You can lie with your medical skills,

601
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,900
but you can't save lives with it.

602
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,400
There are people in this world

603
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,850
who can only be saved by me.

604
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:17,980
Unfortunately,

605
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,700
I don't want to save them.

606
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,180
So you left me behind

607
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,120
because you were afraid Di Feisheng would deal with me,

608
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,090
but it turned out that you were caught

609
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,740
and got hurt all over your body.

610
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,400
Li Lianhua,

611
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,980
I won't accept your kindness for that.

612
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,850
We agreed that friends should share weal and woe.

613
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,850
Even if the opponent is Di Feisheng.

614
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,040
Young Hero Fang,

615
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,540
I know you're good.

616
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,340
It's my fault this time.

617
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,310
Thank you.

618
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:44,500
At least you have a conscience.

619
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,140
By the way,

620
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,820
don't promise Di Feisheng

621
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,730
to save the person he mentioned.

622
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:49,910
The person he wants to save

623
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,710
is definitely not a good person.

624
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,800
He is indeed not a good person.

625
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,960
I won't save him.

626
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,590
It's more important to save you now.

627
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,450
Di Feisheng has inserted Gang Qi

628
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,360
into your body.

629
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,320
It'll be troublesome.

630
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:06,990
It doesn't matter.

631
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,260
I'm talented.

632
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,960
I felt a little uncomfortable just now.

633
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,560
Look now.

634
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:11,830
I'm fine.

635
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,380
I don't have much inner power left.

636
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,190
I almost can't deploy my power to suppress the Gang Qi.

637
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,190
But if Gang Qi reaches his temple,

638
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,080
he will surely die.

639
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,020
This is the only way.

640
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,200
You're awake.

641
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,420
Get up and have some warm water.

642
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,880
Why did I faint again?

643
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,290
You've been inserted Gang Qi.

644
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:08,820
You fainted all of a sudden.

645
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,070
I didn't expect that you are so heavy

646
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,530
that I was exhausted

647
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,880
to carry you back to the Lotus Tower.

648
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:22,470
Practice the skill set according to the papers I put on the table.

649
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,040
Practice it properly.

650
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:34,780
What is this?

651
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:36,230
A draft?

652
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:38,870
A draft?

653
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,410
This is an ancestral skill.

654
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,710
Previously,

655
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,000
the Gang Qi inside your body

656
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,390
was suppressed by it.

657
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:46,870
Study hard.

658
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,710
Don't bother me anymore.

659
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,370
It's ancestral?

660
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,480
The ink is not dry yet.

661
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,260
Did you draw it just now?

662
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,450
The ancestral martial arts

663
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,140
must be passed down by word of mouth.

664
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,330
So I drew it for you

665
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:01,630
to make you understand

666
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,600
and learn well.

667
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:03,560
Understand?

668
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,470
I can't simply practice any martial arts for no reason.

669
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:07,780
If it can't cure the Gang Qi,

670
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,760
and I'm obsessed because of it,

671
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,650
it's not worth it.

672
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:10,740
I won't practice it.

673
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,110
No.

674
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,130
Do you know why Di Feisheng

675
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,830
wanted me to save lives?

676
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,940
It's because of this skill set.

677
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,370
If you don't trust me,

678
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,000
or you doubt me, it's fine.

679
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,530
But Di Feisheng's judgment

680
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,800
can't be wrong.

681
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,470
You don't want it?

682
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,930
Fine, if you don't want it, give it to me.

683
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:32,660
Give it to me.

684
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,820
Listen, Fang Xiaobao,

685
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,550
how can you be a detective?

686
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,310
You're such a fool,

687
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:40,860
an idiot.

688
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:41,990
How can you be a detective?

689
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,430
Can't you think about

690
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,850
why Di Feisheng

691
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,750
used you to threaten me to save others?

692
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,350
If the Gang Qi in your body is getting more serious,

693
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:50,990
you'll fall into his trap

694
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,150
because you have to listen to him.

695
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,480
What should you do then?

696
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,000
That devil keeps killing people

697
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,860
and keeps doing evil.

698
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,120
Don't you feel guilty?

699
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,510
-Do you want to practice it or not?
-Fine.

700
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:00,180
I will practice it.

701
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,050
You're talking too much.

702
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,710
I won't let the devil succeed.

703
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:03,960
Remember.

704
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,200
If I

705
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:07,010
go crazy,

706
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:07,660
foam at the mouth

707
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,060
and dance uncontrollably after practising it,

708
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,270
do remember to find me a physician from the town.

709
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:12,000
Don't worry.

710
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:15,410
I'll get you any expensive medicine if you need it.

711
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:16,710
Practice hard.

712
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,300
Fine.

713
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,660
After all, you've called Li Xiangyi

714
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,320
your master for so many years.

715
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:50,690
I'll pass this Yangzhouman to you.

716
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,840
It's a way to repay his promise to you.

717
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,320
What are you doing?

718
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,280
Are you sleepwalking at night?

719
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:26,940
Li Lianhua,

720
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,460
where did you get that skill set?

721
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,580
Didn't I tell you?

722
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,500
It's ancestral.

723
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,230
Impossible.

724
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:34,560
The skill set is profound and mysterious.

725
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,560
It's very useful.

726
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,580
Even Tianji Hall's Mind-reading Skills

727
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,710
can't compare to it.

728
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,830
If it's really ancestral,

729
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:44,540
there must have been many high-skilled warriors coming from your family.

730
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,100
Tell me.

731
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,830
Where did you get it?

732
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,590
Let go of me!

733
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:49,860
No manners.

734
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:53,050
Fine.

735
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,950
One year, I went to the mountain to collect herbs.

736
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,400
Unfortunately, I fell off the cliff.

737
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,890
Suddenly, in front of a cave,

738
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,720
a fairy godmother appeared.

739
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,980
She asked me to kowtow thrice to her

740
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,240
and passed me the set of skills.

741
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:10,410
After thinking about it,

742
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:13,820
I realised that was a legendary immortal fate.

743
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:15,430
Bah!

744
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,380
How can there be like the pie in the sky?

745
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,280
Didn't I tell you?

746
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,410
It's all fate.

747
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:21,550
Tell me

748
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,840
what the name of the skill set is.

749
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,190
That's amazing.

750
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:27,590
It's almost the same as Yangzhouman.

751
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:28,590
It's Suzhoukuai.

752
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:30,860
I'm not buying that.

753
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,480
You know what?

754
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:35,460
You asked me to tell you, but you don't believe me after I told you.

755
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,620
Then explain to me

756
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:39,080
why I, a physician who sells plasters,

757
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,860
can get the ultimate skill set.

758
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,380
If I were born good at martial arts,

759
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,170
I would have become a hero.

760
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,230
Unfortunately,

761
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,780
we have different fates.

762
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:56,130
I can only be a wandering physician.

763
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,540
Unlike someone,

764
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,810
who's going to be a master soon.

765
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:01,480
All right.

766
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,010
I owe you this time.

767
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,680
It's okay if you don't know martial arts.

768
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,880
It's the same if I can.

769
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,580
After we get out of here, I'll take care of you

770
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,500
and protect you.

771
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,250
No matter what happens, just mention my name.

772
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,310
Most importantly,

773
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,110
I kowtowed three times

774
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,710
to get the skill set.

775
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:22,900
So you also have to kowtow thrice to me

776
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,430
so that I can feel better.

777
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:27,280
Dream on.

778
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,540
Except for my parents,

779
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,390
I'll only kowtow to my master, Li Xiangyi.

780
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:31,150
Who are you?

781
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,580
Your Suzhoukuai

782
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,900
is definitely not as good as my master's Yangzhouman.

783
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,270
Take your time.

784
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,500
Li Lianhua,

785
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,470
why don't you tell me more

786
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:40,470
about my master?

787
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:41,580
You said too little last time.

788
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,460
I haven't heard enough yet.

789
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,950
Don't you feel hot

790
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,180
and chest tightness?

791
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:46,310
No.

792
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,930
The crucial part of Suzhoukuai is silence.

793
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,950
Most importantly, talk less

794
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:51,680
and be quiet.

795
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,440
When you talk, you'll spend your energy and cause blood flow.

796
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,170
It'll boom like a firecracker.

797
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,270
It's up to you.
