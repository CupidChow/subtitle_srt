[Episode 32]

4
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,300
It turned out that Consort Xuan had always wanted to revive Nanyin

5
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,620
and had established such a strong foundation.

6
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,890
But the Magician, Feng Ah Lu

7
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,220
didn't meet Consort Xuan's son back then.

8
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,539
The wealth of reviving Nanyin and the Rama Heavenly Ice

9
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:51,530
were all divided by the four of Jin, Yu, Huang and Quan.

10
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,390
Maybe something unexpected happened at that time.

11
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,340
But now,

12
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,370
Consort Xuan's descendant

13
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,740
must have been found by the Nanyin people.

14
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,490
Otherwise these letters wouldn't be here.

15
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,810
You mean

16
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,330
my father is Consort Xuan's son,

17
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,190
the descendant of the royal family of Nanyin?

18
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,850
There are other letters in this box.

19
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,430
Open it and take a look.

20
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,000
You're right.

21
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,570
The Magician, Feng Ah Lu,

22
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,530
and his whole family were very loyal.

23
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,150
Back then, they couldn't find Consort Xuan's son,

24
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,350
but still searched for him everywhere.

25
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,660
Even though the Magician, Feng Ah Lu went missing,

26
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,860
his descendant didn't stop searching.

27
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,910
So in the end,

28
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,120
with Consort Xuan's old possessions and the birthmark,

29
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,579
they verified that Senior

30
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,500
was the descendant of Prince Fangji and Consort Xuan.

31
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,500
And Feng Qing from the Wansheng Clan

32
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,500
was the descendant of Feng Ah Lu.

33
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,750
Obviously my father did not object,

34
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,690
but conspired with the Wansheng Clan

35
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,690
to plan all this.

36
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:05,920
Senior,

37
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,080
you did hide too well.

38
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,240
No matter how ambitious he was,

39
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,140
he didn't expect

40
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,520
to die a long time ago.

41
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,960
All his plans have come to nothing.

42
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,460
Maybe he already figured it out.

43
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,790
Fang Duobing.

44
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,250
I want to open the coffin for an autopsy.

45
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,490
What happened?

46
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,880
How did it become a skeleton?

47
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,079
Did the medicine not work in the coffin?

48
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:43,270
When I found the body,

49
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,560
I also examined the remains.

50
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,680
Senior was also wearing this armor,

51
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,880
and the little finger on his right hand was broken in half.

52
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,480
Being in a state of confusion, I didn't have time to distinguish.

53
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,110
The armor is fake.

54
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,210
In order to cover it up,

55
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,050
even half of the little finger

56
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,579
is exactly the same.

57
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,340
But when Senior broke the formation,

58
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,140
he did lose half of his little finger to the arrows.

59
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,660
But this little finger was cut off flat.

60
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,820
Could this be not my father's corpse?

61
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,150
This is another person.

62
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:35,980
But back then,

63
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,909
he was cut off and skinned,

64
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:40,100
and was disguised to look like Senior.

65
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,770
This magic must be extremely cruel

66
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,020
because he has the Wuxin Huai on him,

67
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,190
which was used to relieve his pain.

68
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,260
So Shan Gudao didn't die.

69
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,770
After he found out his identity,

70
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,760
he wanted to revive Nanyin

71
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,510
and dominate the world.

72
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,940
He wanted to cooperate with the imperial court

73
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,900
and then fight against the Sigu Sect.

74
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,300
But he never thought that

75
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,640
you would firmly oppose getting involved with the imperial court.

76
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,610
His pursuit of the descendant of Nanyin

77
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,140
was discovered by Liu Rujing.

78
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,370
As a result, he had no choice

79
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,100
but to escape with a fake death.

80
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,380
He even knew that

81
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,290
you'd avenge him.

82
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,010
So he colluded with Jiao Liqiao

83
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,220
and used her obsession with Di Feisheng.

84
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,580
With just the Bicha Poison

85
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,660
and thundering fire bombs,

86
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,500
he managed to overthrow the two major sects in the martial arts world.

87
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,630
But he hid in the dark

88
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,360
and took advantage of that,

89
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,600
making the Wansheng Clan grow rapidly.

90
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,160
He never gave up his conspiracies.

91
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,600
Since the Sigu Sect couldn't be used by him,

92
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,540
he just destroyed it and built another one.

93
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:40,930
Senior,

94
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,930
I've never been able to understand you.

[Guest House]

96
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,460
You used the hidden weapon very fast.

97
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,710
Unfortunately, I have armor protection.

98
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,130
Shan Gudao.

99
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,270
You're still alive.

[Shan Gudao]

101
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,010
You dug the grave,

102
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,040
and you made a good analysis.

103
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,020
I don't need to hide anymore.

104
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:55,460
It's just like what I dreamed of.

105
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,180
You're already a handsome young man,

106
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,320
and you look a bit like me back then.

107
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,580
Today, we reunited as father and son.

108
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,460
We should drink for that.

109
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,320
Father and son?

110
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,600
When you betrayed my biological mother,

111
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,590
when you saw that I was a sickly child

112
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,710
and abandoned me,

113
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,980
and when you lied that you were my uncle,

114
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,960
did you ever think of our relationship as father and son?

115
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,750
You pretended to be dead for so many years,

116
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,950
but now you claim that you're my father.

117
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:35,240
What are you up to?

118
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,840
As a man,

119
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,220
you should aspire to achieve a great cause.

120
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,580
If you always think about those trivial matters,

121
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,780
what can you achieve?

122
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,140
Is that all

123
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,220
the Tianji Mountain Manor has taught you over the years?

124
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,540
The Tianji Mountain Manor taught me to be honest

125
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,380
and upright,

126
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,780
instead of betraying masters and friends

127
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,980
and doing evil deeds.

128
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,090
When you and Li Xiangyi

129
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,620
established the Sigu Sect,

130
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,140
you said you wanted to build a fair martial arts world.

131
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,020
What is your great cause then?

132
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,560
Hiding in the dark and fearing to show up openly,

133
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,050
just like what you are now?

134
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,310
The Sigu Sect was once admired by everyone

135
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,610
and flourished for a while,

136
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,490
but it was still destroyed by me.

137
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,830
Li Xiangyi, who was cocky and arrogant,

138
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,250
also lost to me.

139
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,760
In the first half of my life,

140
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,880
I was overshadowed by Li Xiangyi who was gifted and prominent.

141
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,940
Who cared about me?

142
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,140
Who ever looked at me?

143
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,799
But one day,

144
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,710
someone found me and told me

145
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,220
that I am the descendant of
the royal family of Nanyin

146
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,080
and the current imperial family.

147
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,460
I realized

148
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,080
the meaning and value

149
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,920
of my life.

150
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,060
You asked me what I want.

151
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,030
What I want

152
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,710
is what's supposed to be mine.

153
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,880
I hid in the dark

154
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,550
to accumulate strength.

155
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,300
And now it's time for me to show up and succeed.

156
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,130
This is destiny.

157
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,760
Do you understand?

158
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,820
The position that everyone admires and no one dares to usurp

159
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,300
belongs to me, Shan Gudao.

160
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,460
Stop it.

161
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,220
What destiny?

162
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,520
It's just your ambition.

163
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,540
Your crazy obsession

164
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,940
will only bring harm to this peaceful martial arts world.

165
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,520
You're just as stupid as you were when you were a kid.

166
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,820
You just can't understand it.

167
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,700
Tit for tat.

168
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,740
I should be the one to get it back.

169
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,660
Remember this.

170
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,140
You are my only family in this world.

171
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,420
You're my son.

172
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,850
You are related to me by blood.

173
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:46,990
Think about it.

174
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,920
When I succeed and rule the world,

175
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,660
I'll pass everything on to you.

176
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,580
Don't you want it?

177
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,020
As long as you come back to me

178
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,940
and give me your Rama Heavenly Ice,

179
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,700
we will

180
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,130
find the last one together.

181
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,590
-Then we…
-I don’t have it.

182
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,750
Even if I have it,

183
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,860
I will never give it to you.

184
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,510
Nanyin has been destroyed for a hundred years.

185
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,470
Now the world is at peace,

186
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,400
which is a blessing for all people.

187
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,370
I won't let you ruin this.

188
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,970
Just you?

189
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,500
You should be glad that you're my son.

190
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,270
I can't bear to kill you.

191
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,580
Come back with me.

192
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,510
It's still so hard

193
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,460
to defend against your sword.

194
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,140
We haven't seen each other for ten years,

195
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,620
but we're still alive.

196
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,360
Should we find a place

197
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,470
to celebrate?

198
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,330
Celebrate?

199
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,590
We haven't seen each other for ten years.

200
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,600
I've been looking for you for ten years.

201
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,980
I've been looking for you for ten years.

202
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,360
I've been looking for you for ten years.

203
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,410
Ten years?

204
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,410
I can't believe

205
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,230
you've been looking for me for ten years.

206
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,100
My kindness to you when I was young was worthwhile.

207
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,610
Li Xiangyi,

208
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,980
is it very sad

209
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,840
to be deceived by someone

210
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,990
you don't care about

211
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,910
for ten years?

212
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,220
The Wenjing Sword I gave you,

213
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,180
how's that working out for you?

214
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,690
Did you kill

215
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,840
the original owner of the cloud iron?

216
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,070
If I didn't kill him,

217
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,130
how could I give you the sword?

218
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:28,100
It's all because of you.

219
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,580
He didn't want to work for me,

220
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,820
so I had to kill him.

221
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,910
You almost died,

222
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,100
but you look like a loser now.

223
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,600
Why am I so happy to see that?

224
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:41,580
Ridiculous.

225
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,310
It was just a small setback

226
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,200
for him.

227
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,820
Is that something to brag about?

228
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,580
Shut up.

229
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:48,580
You are my son.

230
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,980
How can you speak for him?

231
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,380
What's so good about him? Everyone praises him.

232
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,710
No matter how good he is,

233
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,730
he still lost to me.

234
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,060
He didn't even know

235
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,380
that I had tricked him for ten years.

236
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,870
Li Xiangyi is just a joke.

237
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,980
Li Xiangyi

238
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,280
is indeed a joke.

239
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,490
If you want to win,

240
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,180
Li Xiangyi

241
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,390
has already lost to you.

242
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,220
Stop it.

243
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,870
You should stop going your own way.

244
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,730
Stop pretending to be righteous

245
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,270
and heroic.

246
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,400
There is no turning back.

247
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,620
What's the point of winning you alone, Li Xiangyi?

248
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,700
I want everyone in the world

249
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,980
to obey me.

250
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,580
If you've thought about it,

251
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,180
meet me at the Wansheng Clan.

252
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,920
No need to chase him.

253
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,420
It turns out that everything we speculated before

254
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,180
is true.

255
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,890
I don't even know

256
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,230
when I got this far.

257
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,530
Xiaobao,

258
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,290
if you hadn't been involved,

259
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,070
you wouldn't have known this.

260
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,990
Do you think I'll regret it?

261
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,710
The more clearly I see it,

262
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,570
the more I know which path to take.

263
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,210
I'm glad that I've seen all the facts.

264
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,150
[Guest House]

265
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,520
This is the news I just received.

266
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,800
Four-faced Qingzun's wife, Liangyi Fairy

267
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,330
was locked up in the Ninth Prison.

268
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,500
Yesterday Di Feisheng broke into the prison with his men.

269
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,630
Di Feisheng must have teamed up with Shan Gudao

270
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,510
to get the last Rama Heavenly Ice.

271
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,450
I thought Di Feisheng

272
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,830
would turn over a new leaf

273
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,200
after you saved him.

274
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,700
I didn't expect him to go after the Rama Vessel.

275
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,700
He shouldn't have been interested in the Rama Vessel.

276
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,160
Maybe

277
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,880
I was wrong about him.

278
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:26,980
Anyway,

279
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,330
they already have the Rama Vessel

280
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,150
and three pieces of the Rama Heavenly Ice.

281
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,440
They will try to get

282
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,040
the one in our hands.

283
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:44,830
Young Master.

284
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,020
The Master of the Tianji Mountain Manor sent a letter,

285
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,620
asking you to return to the Manor immediately.

286
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,530
Li Lianhua.

287
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:56,330
My mother asked me to take you back to the Tianji Mountain Manor.

288
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,020
You said you gave the ice shard to your mother.

289
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,810
Is there something wrong?

290
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,130
You didn't find

291
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:12,330
the Rama Heavenly Ice in the hands of Four-faced Qingzun?

292
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,800
At that time, Four-faced Qingzun was seriously injured

293
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,860
and died in prison.

294
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,920
He left the Rama Heavenly Ice to his wife,

295
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,200
Liangyi Fairy.

296
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,010
I didn't know about it until I broke into the prison.

297
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,180
After Four-faced Qingzun died,

298
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,510
Liangyi Fairy also died of hunger strike.

299
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,750

[Foreworld Forever]

301
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,940
I found the whereabouts of Liangyi Fairy after her death

302
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,600
in the residence of Mr. Pi who guards the prison.

303
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,910
She is still alive?

304
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,900
Where do you think she'd be hiding

305
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,770
with the Rama Heavenly Ice?

306
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,230
Mr. Pi comes from the Tianji Hall.

307
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,510
We're going to the Tianji Mountain Manor anyway.

You are too slow.

Saintess, what happened?

312
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:22,540
Is it scary?

I spent ten years of my life on him,

318
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,420
but still failed to make him like me.

319
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,660
He doesn't care about my love

320
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,380
or my hatred.

321
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,760

00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,450
Mr. Li.

341
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,200
You're too late.

342
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:42,530
You've missed

343
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,680
Xiaofeng.

344
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,810
Master He,

345
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,580
please stop making fun of me.

346
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,660
Auntie's marriage is too sudden.

347
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,390
I know her thoughts.

348
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:56,700
In her heart,

349
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,780
she still can't let go of Mr. Li,

350
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,640
but she knows that she has no hope with Mr. Li

351
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,940
and is disheartened.

352
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,710
Don't take it personally.

353
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,950
She's just that kind of person,

354
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,460
emotional

355
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,950
and capricious.

356
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,340
Well, you see,

357
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,460
a few days ago, she picked up an injured man at the foot of the mountain.

358
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,260
You know what?

359
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,250
This young man is really handsome.

360
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:18,850
And now

361
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,920
she's fallen in love with him after taking care of him for a few days.

362
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,560
She married a man just like that?

363
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,490
That's too fast.

364
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:25,980
It's indeed

365
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,240
a little hasty.

366
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,820
But they are already

367
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:30,980
in love with each other.

368
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,840
They just wanted to get married as soon as possible.

369
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,290
At first I wanted to invite you to the wedding,

370
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,780
but as soon as Xiaofeng heard that Mr. Li was coming,

371
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,110
she insisted on getting the wedding done.

372
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,380
In her heart,

373
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,250
she still cares about Mr. Li.

374
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:45,400
So

375
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,380
she had to finish the wedding ceremony

376
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,680
and enter the bridal chamber

377
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,450
before dark.

378
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,080
She wants me to convey a message to Mr. Li.

379
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,420
According to my Auntie's personality,

380
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,330
she would say,

381
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,600
"Do you regret it?"

382
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,900
And then she would tell him,

383
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,630
"It's useless to regret it now.

384
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,840
I, He Xiaofeng, have a husband now.

385
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,410
You can go wherever you want."

386
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,010
You really know your Auntie.

387
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,840
You're right about every word.

388
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,720
By the way, Mother,

389
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,000
-when I came back last night...
-That brat's done messing around outside

390
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
and has come back?

391
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:24,210
Master.

392
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,850
Let me introduce him to you.

393
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:26,490
This is

394
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,750
Xiaobao's friend, Li Lianhua.

395
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,170
[Fang Zeshi, Minister of the Ministry of Revenue]

396
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,720
Greetings, Lord Fang.

397
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,710
Look at you!

398
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,540
You're frivolous and slovenly.

399
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,210
Have you achieved anything outside?

400
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,490
Today, I...

401
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,570
What are you doing?

402
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:45,570
Let go!

403
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,390
-Let go of me.
-I'm sorry.

404
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,110
Sorry.

405
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:48,990
Lord Fang.

406
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,120
I've never called you Father before.

407
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,980
But in my heart,

408
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,530
you're the best father.

409
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,010
Did you get into

410
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,620
some big trouble outside?

411
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,460
You've been acting like a good boy since you came back.

412
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,420
Listen,

413
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,360
don't try to play tricks on me.

414
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,440
Also,

415
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,680
don't try to avoid your marriage with the princess.

416
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,170
Now that your Auntie's wedding is over,

417
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,730
it's your turn next.

418
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,280
The emperor's grace is widely known. You can't avoid it.

419
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,360
Look.

420
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,750
-He's lecturing me again.
-You...

421
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,860
I don't want to marry the princess. How many times have I told you?

422
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,640
What kind of son

423
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,810
talks to his father like this?

424
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,740
You're stubborn and disobedient.

425
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,220
Madam.

426
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,120
Madam.

427
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,320
Discipline your son.

428
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,430
Alright.

429
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,200
We have a guest here.

430
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,330
Don't be too strict.

431
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,700
By the way,

432
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,640
the people from the Ministry of Works

433
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,590
came to congratulate you.

434
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,390
I've invited them to the Western Banquet Hall.

435
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,950
Go and greet them.

436
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,950
I'll leave your mother to discipline you.

437
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,550
By the way, Xiaobao,

438
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,380
Mr. Li,

439
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,030
I have an urgent matter.

440
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,060
Because of Xiaofeng's wedding,

441
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,820
the Tianji Mountain Manor sent out wedding invitations a few days ago.

442
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,820
We've received congratulatory gifts from friends from all sides in the past few days.

443
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,820
I don't know who sent such a gift box.

444
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,330
When I saw that it was the setting of the mechanism brocade box

445
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,810
from our Tianji Hall before,

446
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,140
it caught my attention.

447
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,580
When I opened it,

448
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,940
I found the Rama Heavenly Ice inside,

449
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,300
just like the ice shard

450
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,450
you asked me to keep.

451
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,760
Why is it empty?

452
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:40,590
How is that possible?

453
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,920
It was in there just now.

454
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:43,890
Master He.

455
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,240
When did you see that the ice shard

456
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,010
was still in the box before?

457
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,370
About an hour ago.

458
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,230
After seeing the ice shard,

459
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,770
I found that the auspicious time had come,

460
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:55,660
so I put the ice shard back into the box and locked it up.

461
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,720
Then I sent the bride and groom into the bridal chamber after the ceremony.

462
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,120
In the blink of an eye, it just disappeared.

463
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,760
It seems that the person who took the ice shard had a clear goal

464
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,820
and came prepared.

465
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,300
There is only one way to the Tianji Mountain Manor.

466
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,580
When we went up the mountain,

467
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,330
we did not find anyone going down.

468
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,700
The person who stole the Ice

469
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,300
should still be in the Manor,

470
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,390
perhaps just among the guests.

471
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,210
Come on.

472
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:22,750
Cheers.

473
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,980
Thank you.

474
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,530
Come on.

475
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,010
Please.

476
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,060
Cheers.

477
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,460
There are so many guests.

478
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,050
It's hard to find out who's suspicious

479
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,740
just by staring at them like this.

480
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,400
Master He.

481
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,140
Have you arranged any performances

482
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,600
for this wedding banquet?

483
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:44,980
What do you mean?

484
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,580
Since

485
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:49,030
someone came here for the Ice,

486
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,640
we might as well give him a surprise.

487
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,110
You want to use the Rama Heavenly Ice

488
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,550
I gave my mother before

489
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,820
to lure him out?

490
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,890
You're right.

491
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,150
Not many people know about the Ice.

492
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:01,560
If we show it to them,

493
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,660
people who know about it and those who don't

494
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,060
will react differently.

495
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,500
Isn't it too risky?

496
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,160
Don't let them take it away again.

497
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,070
You brat.

498
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,620
What kind of place do you think our own home is?

499
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,900
I don't care who he is.

500
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,570
It's not that easy

501
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,480
to step out of the Tianji Hall.

502
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,650
Thank you, Master He.

503
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,300
Okay.

504
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:24,920
Just in case,

505
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,080
I'll go get Guardian Zhan.

506
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,240
Who is this Guardian Zhan

507
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,480
that needs your mother to invite him personally?

508
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,300
He's just a weird guy.

It's good.

573
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,660

575

This is the luminous pearl from Qionghai.

576
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,650
Legend has it that this luminous pearl

577
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:46,250
was formed by the tears of a fairy in the heaven.

578

What is this?

585

It may look ordinary,

but it's cold and frosty to the touch.

He was injured at the foot of the mountain

680
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,880
and was rescued by her.

681
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,540
It seems that he's also a man in the martial arts world.

682
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,670
He's extremely weak

683
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,590
in martial arts.

684
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,900
He's nothing but a good-looking man.

685
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,020
He's not good enough for her.

686
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:29,640
Then why did you...

687
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,840
It's most important that she likes him.

688
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:33,740
Okay.

689
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,310
Do you want to have a few drinks?

690
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:36,800
No.

691
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,780
I didn't expect to see you again.

692
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,220
I'm very happy.

693
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,270
You really know Zhan Yunfei.

694
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:55,410
Well,

695
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,490
he's an old friend.

696
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,550
What old friend?

697
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,650
Like Di Feisheng,

698
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,640
or the ones

699
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,250
that Physician Li treated before?

700
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,630
You need to tell me in advance.

701
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,160
I need to know the situation

702
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:07,900
and hide myself in advance.

703
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,260
Fang Xiaobao.

704
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:11,429
The tea is good.

705
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,320
Do you want to hear a story?

706
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:21,199
Pour me a cup of tea.

707
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:27,270
Thanks.

708
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,710
I'll take a sip first.

709
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,389
Here's the story.

710
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:36,500
Back then, Zhan Yunfei teamed up with others

711
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,969
to destroy the Lianhai Gang.

712
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,460
They captured the gang leader, Jiang Dafei.

713
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,949
When they tried to tie him up and sent him back to Yanzhou,

714
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:45,520
there was no rope.

715
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:46,820
So

716
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,830
someone took fancy of one of Zhan Yunfei's belongings

717
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,050
and wanted to borrow it.

718
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:51,889
What is it?

719
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:52,909
Headband.

720
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,580
So Zhan Yunfei used to use headbands before.

721
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,310
Doesn't he never comb his hair?

722
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,360
Not only does he love to comb his hair,

723
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,100
he's also very particular about it.

724
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,020
But

725
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,550
he's a little stubborn.

726
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:05,970
He didn't want to lend it.

727
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:06,890
And then?

728
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:07,830
Then...

729
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:46,930
What did we just agree on?

730
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,030
Take a bet on your headband.

731
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:52,120
Whoever loses will never comb his hair again.

732
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,400
Then this headband is mine.

733
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:56,900
Thank you.

734
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,320
I admit defeat.

735
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,220
I promised you.

736
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,800
I won't break my promise.

737
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,290
I won't tie my hair anymore.

738
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:14,310
It's more suitable to tie him up with this headband.

739
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,700
It turns out that Zhan Yunfei never combs his hair

740
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,410
because of the bet he made with you.

741
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:22,100
Li Xiangyi was so boring back then.

742
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,300
How dare you say that?

743
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,760
Isn't he just like you?

744
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,320
He was too young and arrogant back then.

745
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,630
He enjoyed showing off his martial arts,

746
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:33,010
and wasted his inner power on things that didn't matter.

747
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:34,870
But Li Xiangyi didn’t expect that

748
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,550
after so many years of his death,

749
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:38,950
Zhan Yunfei still remembers this promise.

750
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,630
He's so stubborn.

751
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,580
He did lose every bet.

752
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,850
He did lose the bet

753
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,300
with Li Xiangyi back then.

754
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,160
But as to the bet with your Auntie,

755
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:52,730
I'm not sure.

756
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:53,560
He...

757
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,950
And my Auntie?

758
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:57,330
Young Master.

759
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,660
Young Master.

760
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,180
I've checked and found that

761
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,920
the 17 people Xing Ziru contacted throughout the night

762
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,320
are all local merchants.

763
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,540
They have been in touch with the Tianji Hall for many years.

764
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,070
There should be no problem.

765
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,510
What else did he do

766
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:11,780
besides talking to the guests?

767
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,480
In between conversations with people,

768
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,100
he would go out for some fresh air.

769
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,680
Each time he would go to the pavilion in the courtyard

770
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,850
and set up a game of chess.

771
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:19,620
He set it up himself and played it himself.

772
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,480
-A game of chess?
-A game of chess?

773
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,480
We don't know how to play chess.

774
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,380
But we were taught

775
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,540
when joining the Tianji Hall.

776
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,460
We can remember what we've seen correctly.

777
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,570
These are what we saw

778
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:31,870
when we followed Xing Ziru

779
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,000
at different times.

780
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:35,440
After the fourth round, he went back to his room

781
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,720
and didn't come out again.

782
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,050
Keep an eye on Xing Ziru.

783
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,120
Don't alert him.

784
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:40,900
Yes.

785
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,250
Aren't these the chess manuals

786
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,600
from the Carefree and Innocent Pastime Collection?

787
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,040
Look.

788
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,870
This is the Painting of Shangqing.

789
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:57,380
This is the Painting of the Four Immortals of Chengdu Prefecture.

790
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,830
This is the Painting of Baozhen.

791
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,630
This is the Painting of Jinming.

792
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,980
Minister Fang has really

793
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,860
cultivated you with great effort.

794
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,240
You are thoroughly accomplished

795
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,820
in lyre-playing, chess, calligraphy and painting.

796
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,200
My father cultivated me heart and soul when I was a child.

797
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,490
But I was still young back then.

798
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:15,080
I disobeyed him all the time.

799
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,480
Now that I think about it,

800
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,220
I'm really lucky.

801
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,700
Fang Xiaobao.

802
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,730
You've grown up.

803
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:24,660
Take a good look.

804
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,600
What do you think about these chess manuals?

805
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,080
I don't have a clue yet.

806
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:31,740
But the Rama Heavenly Ice is close at hand.

807
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,540
If Xing Ziru

808
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,870
is still in the mood to play chess at this time,

809
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,980
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

810
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:43,050
Study these chess manuals first.

811
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:45,110
I'll go to the pavilion to find clues.

812
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,390
Has my bet

813
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,980
ruined their marriage?

814
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,020
Blood!

815
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:41,270
Somebody help! Blood!

816
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:41,740
Somebody help!

817
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,980
Help! Somebody help!

818
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:43,920
Blood!

819
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,410
Li Lianhua.

820
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,560
Something happened to the groom.

821
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,240
Father!

822
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:55,110
Mother.

823
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:59,060
What happened to the groom?

824
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:05,490
Young Master!

825
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,110
Young Master, it's scary.

826
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,500
The groom had an accident last night,

827
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,580
and the body was gone.

828
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,740
Now there's only a piece of human skin left.

829
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,270
Xiaobao.

830
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,640
Aren't you detectives?

831
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,840
You must help me find the murderer

832
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:19,230
and seek justice for my husband who died distressingly.

833
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:34,060
Ms. He,

834
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,040
how do you know that

835
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,790
this piece of human skin is the groom's?

836
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,820
Wei was injured before.

837
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,140
I saw it when he applied the medicine.

838
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,600
He had this tattoo on his back.

839
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,490
My poor husband.

840
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,300
On our wedding night,

841
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:52,460
his body just disappeared.

842
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,370
Only this bloody human skin was left.

843
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,920
Dead or alive, there must be a body.

844
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,680
The groom is not made of water.

845
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,780
How could he just disappear?

846
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:04,500
The bedding and clothes are intact

847
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:06,330
and there are no signs of corrosion.

848
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,590
It doesn't look like decomposing water.

849
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,450
Ms. He,

850
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,440
do you remember what happened last night?

851
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,360
Last night?

852
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,000
Last night...

853
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:18,460
Calm down. Tell us slowly.

854
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,110
Yesterday evening,

855
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,370
after the wedding ceremony,

856
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,620
he and I returned to the courtyard.

857
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,430
Seeing that it was still early,

858
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,000
we sat together in the courtyard for a while.

859
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,410
We didn't go back to the room until the moon came out.

860
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,140
After drinking the cross-cupped wine,

861
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,930
I felt sleepy.

862
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,020
He took me to bed to rest.

863
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:44,980
I don't know what happened after that.

864
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,010
When I woke up,

865
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:48,170
I saw

866
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:50,010
this bloody human skin.

867
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:53,490
You felt sleepy after drinking the cross-cupped wine?

868
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:54,090
Auntie.

869
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:55,940
Think about it carefully.

870
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,740
Was there anything suspicious?

871
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,910
Anything suspicious?

872
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:15,180
Leave one's mortal form behind and attain bliss,

873
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,440
ascend to heaven and become immortal.

874
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,840
I've never heard that he likes poetry.

875
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:23,190
A poem.

876
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,320
Poem, human skin.

877
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,900
The pattern on the skin

878
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,490
doesn't look like an ordinary tattoo.

879
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,050
Does it mean anything?

880
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,510
There seems to be

881
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,450
something odd about the groom.

882
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:44,900
Something odd?

883
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,160
There are traces of fighting.

884
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,100
Someone must have broken into the bridal chamber last night,

885
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,520
but this person didn't hurt Auntie at all.

886
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,780
What's certain is that

887
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:01,370
no one else

888
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:04,040
has been killed or attacked in the Tianji Mountain Manor.

889
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:04,670
So,

890
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,980
the murderer came for Wei Qingchou?

891
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,420
He took the body away

892
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,550
after he killed him?

893
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:10,500
Impossible.

894
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,140
Last night when I returned from delivering the treasure,

895
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,140
the two of them

896
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,280
gave me a box of wedding candies.

897
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:19,520
No one else entered the bridal chamber after that.

898
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,020
Otherwise,

899
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,430
they could never escape my attention.

900
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:28,630
That is to say, Wei Qingchou

901
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:31,480
must have died after Brother Zhan returned.

902
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,230
Brother Zhan

903
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:35,820
has been guarding the opposite side of the house all night long.

904
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,860
Then the murderer couldn't have entered or exited from the front.

905
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:42,060
There is no entrance to the sill walls behind the windows.

906
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:45,460
The mechanisms in the Tianji Hall have always been very famous.

907
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,520
Is it possible that

908
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:50,380
there are other mechanisms and secret passages here?

909
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,300
This building

910
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,460
is a very normal place,

911
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,360
and there is nothing else.

912
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,840
The body is gone,

913
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,230
and the only thing left here is a tattooed human skin.

914
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:01,100
If the murderer killed Wei Qingchou

915
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,610
for this tattooed human skin,

916
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,070
why didn't he take it away?

917
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:07,650
Madam.

918
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,940
Xiaofeng must be shocked.

919
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:12,320
Why don't you take her to rest somewhere else?

920
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,080
We can leave it to Xiaobao here.

921
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:15,640
Alright.

922
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:17,120
Li,

923
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,620
you've been on standby outside the door

924
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:19,830
since last night.

925
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:20,980
Then stay here

926
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:22,940
and listen to Young Master's orders.

927
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:23,410
Yes.

928
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:24,890
Let's go.

929
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:34,830
What are you thinking?

930
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,870
Since no one went out all night,

931
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:39,810
the murderer and the body

932
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,460
might not have left at all.
