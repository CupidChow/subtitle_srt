After four thousand times

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Thousands of times

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The most reluctant

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Is that moment

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
On the earth

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A thousand miles of madness

Who doesn't wander

Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
On the edge of the world

Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
On the edge of the world

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000

The most reluctant

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Is that moment

Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds

On the edge of the world

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,600
I can't wait any longer.

36
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,600
You're up.

37
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,760
Li Lian Hua, you're so good.

38
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,720
You're so weak, but you're so strong.

39
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,240
You're just a cold-blooded person.

40
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,440
You've been lying in bed for so many days.

41
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,600
You've eaten so many ginseng pills of my Brother Guan.

42
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,320
You're still not feeling well.

43
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,920
When you're sick,

44
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,680
you're not even looking at yourself.

45
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,400
You're not even looking at yourself.

46
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,000
You're not even looking at yourself.

47
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,680
You're not even looking at yourself.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,640
Li Lian Hua,

49
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,200
why don't you stop looking for that Lian Quan?

50
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,400
You should go back to my brother

51
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,680
and let him help you with the treatment.

52
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,360
I'm a doctor.

53
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,440
If I go to see your brother,

54
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,360
I'll admit that I'm not very skilled.

55
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,600
I've been much better these days.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,880
What about the next step?

57
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,400
I think I should go out for a walk.

58
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,240
Maybe this method will be very good.

59
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,280
Don't worry.

60
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,920
But the Lian Quan you mentioned

61
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,920
has disappeared in Shi Shou Village.

62
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,600
Where are we going to find him?

63
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,120
Xiaoyong,

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,040
I need your help.

65
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,080
Help me find a piece of jade

66
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,520
that my grandmother left behind.

67
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,480
Grandmother?

68
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,160
What do you want this for?

69
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,160
Lian Quan is repairing the royal nerves.

70
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,960
The most powerful one of them is called the B-homage.

71
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,760
This trick requires the use of poison

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,280
to protect yourself.

73
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,640
I heard that

74
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,560
he bought a huge

75
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,680
grandmother's jade coin.

76
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,120
Only this jade coin

77
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,560
can help you get rid of the poison.

78
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,160
When he left,

79
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,240
the jade coin in his grandmother's house

80
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,840
was broken by his enemy.

81
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,040
I think

82
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,800
he must have lived near

83
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,400
the grandmother's jade coin

84
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,000
to save his life.

85
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,520
I see.

86
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,280
I'll go find him now.

87
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,800
Take care of yourself.

88
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,760
Take care.

89
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,280
Your Majesty,

90
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,880
Mr. Fang has been talking to you

91
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,920
for three days and three nights.

92
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,520
Are you really not interested?

93
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,120
I can't give him the answer he wants.

94
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,280
Just say that I haven't returned yet.

95
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,320
Master.

96
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,200
Didn't we agree that

97
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,640
the monk would not fight wild clouds?

98
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,440
Mr. Fang,

99
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,400
I have an important task.

100
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,160
I need to send it to the capital immediately.

101
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,440
Master.

102
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,280
I know who Li Lian Hua is.

103
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,080
You know it?

104
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,080
Then why are you stopping me?

105
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,960
I just want to ask you

106
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,680
why he hid himself and refused to come back.

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,720
And

108
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,280
my father died of a knife wound.

109
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,000
Is it related to him?

110
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,600
The first one,

111
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,960
I know it but I can't tell you.

112
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,320
The second one,

113
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,960
I don't know it but I can't tell you.

114
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,320
Why can't you tell me?

115
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,360
Are you trying to hide something from me?

116
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,480
Okay.

117
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,880
Then I'll ask you another question.

118
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,920
Is he really not good at martial arts?

119
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,600
Or is he hiding his strength on purpose?

120
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,840
Even if he is hurt by the knife wound,

121
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,880
a master like him

122
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,160
can't be completely unsteady.

123
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,560
What is he doing?

124
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,480
Mr. Fang,

125
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,320
have you ever thought about it?

126
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,200
Sometimes the simplest answer

127
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,960
is the most correct answer.

128
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,240
It's the tree is quiet but the wind is not straight.

129
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,000
I don't understand.

130
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,160
Please give me some advice.

131
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,240
That's all.

132
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,800
I have my words in my heart.

133
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,000
I can't help you.

134
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,080
You can only

135
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,080
find the truth yourself.

136
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,160
But

137
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,840
I have a question for you.

138
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,240
You are so entangled.

139
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,800
Is it because of Li Lian Hua?

140
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,120
Or is it because of Li Xiang Ni?

141
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,360
Or is it because of Li Lian Hua?

142
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,320
When you have a storm in your heart,

143
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,360
you will lose the wisdom of a drop of water.

144
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,120
So why don't you think about

145
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,760
the impurities in that drop of water?

146
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,760
After so many years,

147
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,840
he has been alone.

148
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,320
I can only be by his side

149
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,240
and see you as a friend.

150
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,040
Friend?

151
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,280
I've known him for so long.

152
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,680
You know.

153
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,920
Li Feisheng knows.

154
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,960
But I don't.

155
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,400
What kind of friend am I?

156
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,280
The weather is bad.

157
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,600
I'm afraid the storm is coming.

158
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,000
Master.

159
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,560
Feng Du Bing.

160
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,080
I finally found you.

161
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,920
You are here.

162
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,520
You are here.

163
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,800
There are new people on the Puren Pond.

164
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
All four helpers are asking you to go back.

165
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,440
Who?

166
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,880
Li Lian Hua.

167
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,720
What?

168
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,120
Master Ji.

169
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,360
Why is Li Lian Hua on the Puren Pond?

170
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,600
The Four Gu Sects received a secret letter

171
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,320
saying that Li Lian Hua has joined the Golden Soul Alliance.

172
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,040
Sect Leader Xiao asked the White Ship Courtyard

173
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,080
to investigate this matter.

174
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,200
That's impossible.

175
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,440
How can a secret letter

176
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,040
be a crime?

177
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,160
I've been with Li Lian Hua for months.

178
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,520
What kind of person is he?

179
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,720
I can testify for him.

180
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,400
The Puren Pond has hidden hidden flowers.

181
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,200
The righteous people in the world can arrest him.

182
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,880
Li Lian Hua is good at martial arts.

183
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,920
If he is hurt, then...

184
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,120
You know who is the one

185
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,640
with the mask around Li Lian Hua

186
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,320
named Fei.

187
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,320
Someone has seen his real face.

188
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,320
He is Di Feisheng.

189
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,200
You and Li Lian Hua used to be inseparable.

190
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,400
You also went out with Fei.

191
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,880
Didn't you find anything strange about him?

192
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,840
I...

193
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,040
Little Bing Bing just set up the martial arts.

194
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,720
How could he know

195
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,280
the one who hasn't been out for ten years?

196
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,600
Murong Yao hasn't left the Puren Pond.

197
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,200
Shi Shui went to look for him.

198
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,960
He will know the truth soon.

199
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,640
I've seen Fei.

200
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,920
But I've never seen his real face.

201
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,600
Have you seen his weapon?

202
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,400
Behind him is a long knife.

203
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,600
He hasn't been out.

204
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,760
He is very arrogant.

205
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,240
He said ordinary people don't deserve to be out.

206
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,520
I remember now.

207
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,880
He has been out once.

208
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,880
He is a good swordsman.

209
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,320
He is good at using the sword.

210
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,760
Whenever he uses the sword,

211
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,360
he will be very arrogant.

212
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,840
The first master of Di Feisheng

213
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,320
is the famous swordsman of the Blood and Jade Monastery.

214
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,720
He removed the golden wheel on his stick

215
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,520
and hung it on his sword as a trophy.

216
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,200
It seems that

217
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,280
he is Di Feisheng.

218
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,360
I didn't expect Li Lian Hua

219
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,200
to be really with Di Feisheng.

220
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,400
No matter what,

221
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,160
he is a good swordsman.

222
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,760
He is a good swordsman.

223
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,840
He is a good swordsman.

224
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,440
He is a good swordsman.

225
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,920
We have no excuse for

226
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,440
him to be with the Demon Sect's leader.

227
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,640
We have no excuse for

228
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,840
him to be with the Demon Sect's leader.

229
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,920
Then we should not blame him.

230
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,800
Wait.

231
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,560
Even if he is really with Di Feisheng,

232
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,840
it doesn't mean

233
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,200
he is from the Golden Soul Alliance.

234
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,960
Maybe

235
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,600
he is using Di Feisheng's power

236
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,000
to investigate the difficult Luomuo Heavenly Army.

237
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,400
We were investigating the case of Jin Mantang.

238
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
We found an antique container.

239
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,120
It contained the ancient King of Chimney,

240
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,120
Ye Huotang.

241
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,120
Ye Huotang.

242
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,120
I didn't expect that Ye Huotang could be exposed.

243
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,920
Why didn't you tell us about this serious matter earlier?

244
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,560
In my opinion,

245
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,960
Ye Huotang has been missing for a hundred years.

246
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,680
It's hard to tell whether it's true or not.

247
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,680
We have to find out.

248
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,680
Where is Luo Motianbing?

249
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,880
She's with Li Lianhua.

250
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,680
With her?

251
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,280
You trust her so much,

252
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,280
but she's always wary of you.

253
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,280
She's a man of no martial arts.

254
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,280
Is it safer for her to keep her?

255
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,080
There's a trick to trick people.

256
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,000
You're a young man who just came out of the martial arts world.

257
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You're so smart.

258
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,400
And you're willing to speak up for her.

259
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
I don't believe her.

260
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,000
I believe in my intuition.

261
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,600
She might have something to hide,

262
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,000
but she's not a villain.

263
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Did she tell you the truth?

264
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,200
We've investigated.

265
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Her name, origin, military origin.

266
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,000
If she's a man of no martial arts,

267
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,120
how could she get involved in the world?

268
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,120
You think you're in charge of the investigation?

269
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,120
But think about it.

270
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,120
Who's in charge between you two?

271
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,120
Who's Di Feshen?

272
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,120
He's selfish and cold-blooded.

273
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,920
But he's willing to dress up and follow Li Lianhua.

274
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,120
I really can't figure out who in the world

275
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,440
can make Di Feshen so stubborn.

276
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,440
I can't figure out what he's up to.

277
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,440
Li Lianhua is unpredictable.

278
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,440
Maybe there's a bigger secret behind it.

279
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,440
We must investigate who Li Lianhua is.

280
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,440
That's your duty as a detective.

281
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,440
You know her best.

282
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,760
She must know her future better than anyone else.

283
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,760
You'll be in charge of this case.

284
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
Arrest her as soon as possible.

285
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,960
Don't worry.

286
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,960
We won't wrongly accuse anyone.

287
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,960
If Li Lianhua is innocent,

288
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,960
we'll clear everything up when we get her back.

289
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,960
We'll definitely clear her name.

290
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,960
You also hope to solve the mystery behind her.

291
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,960
You're a man who likes to be down-to-earth

292
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,960
and stubborn.

293
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,960
You still hold on to your secrets.

294
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,960
You're a good man.

295
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,960
You're the first friend I've made in the world.

296
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,960
You have no threat.

297
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,960
What are you doing?

298
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,960
I'm here to help you.

299
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,940
Release send-off data

300
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:15,940
of the background

301
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,380
Fronted movement

302
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,080
of all Sorryuan spring

303
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,660
Breione dmg

304
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:19,880
Ten years ago

305
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,420
Stretched if

306
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,540
I can follow the essence of the war

307
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,300
On where to go

308
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,140
Find him

309
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,640
I have already known their identity?

310
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,760
This was related to Monkey King.

311
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,520
Really,

312
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,080
that one is Curry Story's

313
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,760
evil design,

314
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:39,820
from a 것을 sometimes

315
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,020
See it's using Arrow,

316
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,320
seeing the same partners there.

317
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:40,960
See no trace.

318
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,040
But

319
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,920
maybe

320
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,260
just seeing him

321
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,760
mortality is uncle's

322
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,440
cheering

323
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,020
That because

324
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,040
a finally found

325
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,100
mysterious item

326
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,380
me.

327
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,620
There are only two of them.

328
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,020
I'm afraid I can barely

329
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,980
describe each of them.

330
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,100
Get rid of their

331
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:16,260
slow-moving

332
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,700
when you run to Duck trophy starts.

333
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,980
I found it.

334
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,180
Look.

335
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,820
The ancestral mother-in-law of our dynasty

336
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,980
is all from the Bosjin.

337
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,500
Although there are not many mines,

338
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,820
there are five of them.

339
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,580
If they are scattered like this,

340
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,100
are we going to

341
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,900
find them one by one?

342
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,620
To avoid enemies in the front line,

343
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,500
there are many people and many eyes.

344
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,980
It's impossible to go to the front line.

345
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,820
If we exclude these two,

346
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,820
the remaining three small mines...

347
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,780
Xiaoyong,

348
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,700
what does this mark mean?

349
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,860
It means that

350
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,060
the three small mines

351
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,540
are located in the back of the mountain.

352
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,700
There is a hot spring here.

353
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,660
Hot spring?

354
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,060
The back of the mountain can be hidden.

355
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,300
The left hot spring can be healed.

356
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,820
If I choose,

357
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,220
this place

358
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,860
is the best place.

359
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,740
Then let's go to this

360
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,620
Li Zhou's small city.

361
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,220
Close the door and windows.

362
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,020
Be careful of the fire.

363
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,740
Close the door and windows.

364
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,020
Be careful of the fire.

365
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,580
Su Hua.

366
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,300
Mother.

367
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,660
Come in.

368
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,700
Close the door.

369
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,380
Why are you back?

370
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,060
Didn't I tell you that your home is dangerous

371
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,220
and I didn't let you come back?

372
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,340
My uncle's family is going to do business outside.

373
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,820
I don't know when I can come back.

374
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,980
I rushed out to see you and father.

375
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,260
No one saw us.

376
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,140
I knew you were back.

377
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:21,360
This isotticked goods И

378
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,460
Give me a minute please.

379
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,940
I'm here to investigate Fang Duobing's case.

380
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,260
Why did you go to the broken-down castle?

381
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,860
I have to ask Fang Duobing.

382
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,700
It's too late.

383
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,580
Since I have to be arrested on the broken-down castle,

384
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,500
it seems that I can't stay in Lotus Pavilion anymore.

385
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,660
Xiaoyong,

386
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,260
we have to split up and leave now.

387
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,860
Don't be sad.

388
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,260
Take Lotus Pavilion and the fox-hide crystal for me.

389
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,860
We'll meet outside Xiaoyuan City.

390
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:43,980
Okay.

391
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,340
They found me in Lotus Pavilion.

392
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,740
They won't make it hard for me.

393
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,220
Then, be careful.

394
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,660
You too.

395
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,380
This is the secret medicine I made.

396
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,460
It can save lives.

397
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,860
Okay, you can go now.

398
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,580
Stay alive, you little girl.

399
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,020
It's a coincidence.

400
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,380
You also found Xiaoyuan City?

401
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,060
It's really a lucky day.

402
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,580
You're quite bold.

403
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,580
You even dare to walk into the city gate.

404
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,380
You must know about the broken-down castle, right?

405
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,780
On the broken-down castle,

406
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,980
it does say Lotus Pavilion.

407
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,180
That means

408
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,380
you didn't tell them my identity.

409
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,780
Why?

410
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,380
I won't expose you.

411
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,380
I'm just a little girl.

412
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,500
I won't expose you

413
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,100
because I don't want to be a low-ranking official.

414
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,500
There's really no collusion between me and this Di Feseng.

415
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,700
You should know that.

416
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,700
I don't know.

417
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,260
I've been with you for so long.

418
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,700
I even know your name is fake.

419
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,700
I've never been so generous to you.

420
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,700
Fang Dubing.

421
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,580
I do owe you an explanation.

422
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,980
But I can't go back to the temple gate with you now.

423
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,500
I have to find Lotus Pavilion and get the Heavenly Army first

424
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,300
so that I can find out the real murderer behind the scenes and find out the truth.

425
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,500
I really don't have time now.

426
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,900
Why don't we find out the truth together?

427
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,500
What do you think?

428
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,900
You're a fugitive.

429
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,500
I'm a detective.

430
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,700
Why should we have a face-to-face meeting?

431
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,900
You should go back to the Baichuan Temple with me.

432
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,900
You can explain it to me.

433
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,100
Calm down first.

434
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,100
How about this?

435
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,700
Let's make a move.

436
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,820
If you can find Lotus Pavilion first,

437
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,820
I'll definitely make a move with you.

438
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,420
I won't lie to you this time.

439
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,420
You have no right to bargain with me.

440
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,020
If you don't go back with me,

441
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,420
I'll be rude to you.

442
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,420
It's not right to hit your master.

443
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,420
Master?

444
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,820
Do you think you deserve this?

445
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,220
That brat.

446
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,620
He's so good at this.

447
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,620
Li Lianhua, stop pretending.

448
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,820
What's going on?

449
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,620
I think my wrist is broken.

450
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,620
Come and help me check.

451
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,820
Hurry up.

452
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,700
How are you?

453
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:38,300
Her世界

454
00:19:38,300 --> 00:20:04,640
He

455
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,560
It is of little concern from者

456
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,140
Groups

457
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,940
My sister

458
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,820
Kids

459
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,220
Do you knowー

460
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Do you know this person called Lian Quan in this small city?

461
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,060
No

462
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,500
Charging Muchas pellulas.

463
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:38,600
You have been…

464
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,580
Is a的时候了老白

465
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,380
Did not stay until late

466
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,440
Moreover…

467
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:44,940
No way

468
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,640
You…

469
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,380
You went out to drop the goods

470
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,780
I left it here

471
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,120
Aunt, are you okay?

472
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,980
Just like knee injury

473
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,940
Leg injury is okay

474
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,040
This gentleman is doing well

475
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,820
It's very useful to stick it on

476
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,260
Thank you doctor

477
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,220

478
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,140

479
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:13,980
Thank you

480
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,020
Doctor

481
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,500
I happened to meet you

482
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,100
In our small town

483
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,020
There is only such a reliable doctor

484
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,300
Busy

485
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,140
It's hard to go on a date usually

486
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:27,300
Doctor, you eat buns

487
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,820
I, Wang, Wang, Wang, 80 buns

488
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,180
That is loud

489
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,820
Wang, 80

490
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,060
Wang, 80

491
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,020
When he was born

492
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,980
His father made 80 copper plates

493
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,740
Just gave him this name

494
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,940
Doctor, what is your name?

495
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,260
I that

496
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:53,940
I know

497
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,660
You call that doctor

498
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,220
How much is this treatment fee

499
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,260
I'll take it for you

500
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,580
Aunt, this treatment fee is not needed

501
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,500
I

502
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,180
I want to ask people in the village

503
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,220
I don't know if it's convenient

504
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,100
That doctor

505
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,820
You just ask me

506
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,700
I used to be a matchmaker

507
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,180
In the small town

508
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,180
This ancestors

509
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,260
I don't know him

510
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,180
That's it, aunt

511
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,700
Have you ever heard

512
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,340
There is a person called Lianqun

513
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,900
What about this Huangquan

514
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,420
I don't know

515
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,140
Aunt

516
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,820
Didn't you just say this ancestor

517
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,140
You are familiar with this generation

518
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,460
How did he forget it all at once

519
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,540
Have you ever seen one person

520
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,540
No, it's two people

521
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,940
They have both legs

522
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,020
But two bodies

523
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,380
Human body, cow head, horse face

524
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,180
No

525
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,380
You said this

526
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,740
I really have some impression

527
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,140
Six years ago

528
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,900
There was a mine in the city

529
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,180
There are often some foreigners

530
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,540
Work hard

531
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,740
One of the foreigners

532
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,940
That looks weird

533
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,820
His back

534
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:21,720
There is something like a

535
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,860
Inst intersect election

536
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,460
On the day

537
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,900
Help and came out

538
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,140
Have you seen

539
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,220
We were bathing

540
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,100
A man

541
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:41,940
Excited

542
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,900
All of them

543
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,340
Can you do it

544
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,180
It's dead

545
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,100
he

546
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,780
That person

547
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,660
Plumbers

548
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,420
I done

549
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:51,700
come

550
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,300
see

551
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,340
Mom

552
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,940
Then

553
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,700
This pass

554
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,480
Small

555
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,300
Me

556
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:58,800
Where is this

557
00:23:59,020 --> 00:23:59,980
Open

558
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:00,620
Mr.

559
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,620
The ancestors said that there are mountain gods in the mountains.

560
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,620
The outsiders came here

561
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,620
to buy those green stones at a high price.

562
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,620
After many people heard about it, they started to mine.

563
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,620
They dug up the mountain

564
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,620
and dug it up.

565
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,620
Five years ago, a fire broke out.

566
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,620
The rich people who bought stones

567
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,620
of a family of salt

568
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,620
burned it cleanly. The mountain was blown up half a mile.

569
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,620
From then on, no one dared to mine again.

570
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,620
Although the people in the city all say that it was King of Salt who committed the crime,

571
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,620
my master hit me once before he died.

572
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,620
There is a shadow of King of Salt.

573
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,620
You mean

574
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,620
that it was a fake?

575
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,620
Did you investigate many strange cases

576
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,620
in the Baichuan Courtyard before?

577
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,620
Can you help us investigate this case of King of Salt?

578
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,620
Don't worry.

579
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,620
This case will definitely be investigated.

580
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,620
Really? Thank you.

581
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,620
Thank you.

582
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,620
Fang Xiao Bao.

583
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,620
Mother?

584
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,620
Why are you here?

585
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,620
I am the type of Baichuan Courtyard.

586
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,620
I have a duty. Why are you here?

587
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,620
I...

588
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,620
I also have a duty.

589
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,620
Duty?

590
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,620
Prince Yan blamed us for moving his

591
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,980
property to the

592
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,620
property of the Emperor.

593
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,620
So he punished us with the mountain fire.

594
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,620
That money is the betrothal gift of Prince Yan.

595
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,620
But it's strange.

596
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,620
Since Prince Yan married,

597
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,620
there has never been a mountain fire here.

598
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,620
According to the host of Liao Yuan of Hanshan Temple,

599
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,620
it was the girls who were taken away by Prince Yan

600
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,620
who protected the safety of this small city.

601
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,620
The girls now

602
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,620
dare not live here.

603
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,620
They got married at the wedding age

604
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,620
and moved to other places.

605
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,620
So they were taken away by Prince Yan.

606
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,620
No, it's not Prince Yan.

607
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,620
It's... it's the bad guys.

608
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,620
Don't talk nonsense.

609
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,620
Then, Ba Shi,

610
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,620
did the girl

611
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,620
get taken away by Prince Yan the day before yesterday?

612
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,620
I don't believe it.

613
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,620
Su Hua went back to

614
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,620
her mother's house to visit her.

615
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,620
She was taken away by the bad guys.

616
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,620
Ba Shi and that girl, Su Hua,

617
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,620
have been childhood friends.

618
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,620
If it wasn't for that,

619
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,620
I wouldn't have been able to get Ba Shi.

620
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,620
It's a pity for this girl.

621
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,620
She didn't even escape to other places.

622
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,620
I... I'm going to send the buns.

623
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,620
What did the bailiff say?

624
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,620
The bailiff didn't find out the result

625
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,620
after a lot of investigation.

626
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,620
No matter where the girl is hiding,

627
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,620
she was caught.

628
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,620
What do you think this is?

629
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,620
The Zhang family had a lot of suffering before.

630
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,620
Now Witcher will be taking full responsibility for the body.

631
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,620
Ma, Ma...

632
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:12,540
Master, please give Su Hua more money to, to, to...

633
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,940
to pay your debt.

634
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,700
Amitabha.

635
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,100
Master, wait.

636
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,020
I have two problems,

637
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,540
I would like to ask you a few questions.

638
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,620
Is it possible?

639
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,540
Amitabha.

640
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,540
Master, aren't you a local?

641
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,540
Time has passed.

642
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:46,540
I've been here for more than ten years.

643
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,540
You are not qualified to be here.

644
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,540
Why did you choose to come to this small town?

645
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,540
I broke my legs because of the fire.

646
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,540
Now the people are not well.

647
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,540
If I can make the dead happy,

648
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,540
I can't change anything.

649
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,540
What can I do?

650
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,540
Can you count on me?

651
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:12,540
Master, you are so kind.

652
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:19,540
Master, I want to meet this young master Yan.

653
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,540
I don't know if you can guide me to Huangquan.

654
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,540
People die to go there.

655
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,540
Master, why are you in a hurry?

656
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,540
Buy a house?

657
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,540
It's more than ten days away from our house.

658
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,540
Why did you come here to buy a house?

659
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:45,540
Do you know what money is?

660
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,540
Look, I told you to take over our business.

661
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,540
But you didn't listen.

662
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,540
Now the emperor is wise.

663
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,540
The state is peaceful.

664
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,540
People live and work in peace.

665
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:00,540
It's the good thing to buy land and make a living.

666
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,540
You are so kind.

667
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,540
The people live and work in peace.

668
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:07,540
It's the good time to buy land and make a living.

669
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:10,540
Tianji Hall is in a hurry to invest.

670
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,540
So we have the situation today.

671
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:16,540
So you can have a good life.

672
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:20,540
This time, your father went back to the capital to work.

673
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:24,540
Li Ye and I have bought 36 houses along the way.

674
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,540
It's a good life.

675
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,540
You are afraid that my father will stop you from buying.

676
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,540
I'm not afraid.

677
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,540
Son, you don't know.

678
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,540
There is a hot spring here.

679
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,540
This house is close to the back hill.

680
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:41,540
I'm going to make a soup well.

681
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:45,540
I plan to build a beauty soup in this place.

682
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:48,540
It's a perfect match with the beauty soup in Nanshan.

683
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:51,540
It will definitely make you happy.

684
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:56,540
The beauty is that the back yard once caught fire.

685
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,540
It's very serious.

686
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,540
We need to find someone to repair it.

687
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,540
Find a fire?

688
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,540
This is a house.

689
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,540
You can buy it.

690
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,540
Houses are cheap.

691
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,540
Do you think we have a lot of money?

692
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,540
It's all saved here.

693
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,540
It doesn't matter.

694
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:14,540
I have already asked the local host to make a law to pay the bill.

695
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,540
Do you know?

696
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:19,540
This house usually sells for 5,000 taels.

697
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,540
Do you know how much your mother bought?

698
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,540
50 taels.

699
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,540
How about it? Your mother has a good taste.

700
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,540
Hurry up.

701
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,540
This is the lady who is very lucky.

702
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,540
She is very good at acting.

703
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,540
She is very good at acting.

704
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,540
Okay.

705
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,540
You can repair your beauty soup.

706
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,540
I'm going to do something serious.

707
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,540
Goodbye.

708
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,540
Where are you going?

709
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,540
I have something serious to do.

710
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,540
You need to eat if you have something serious.

711
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:53,540
I met her on the way.

712
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,540
I also invited her here.

713
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,540
She?

714
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,540
Which her?

715
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:02,540
You are talking about her.

716
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,540
You are not a coward.

717
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,540
You dare to come here.

718
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,540
You think I don't dare to touch you?

719
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,540
I'm looking for the owner of the lotus pond.

720
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,540
This has nothing to do with you.

721
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,540
What are you doing?

722
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,540
Isn't she your friend?

723
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,540
Mother, she is not my friend now.

724
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,540
She is a wanted criminal on the Poyuan Bridge.

725
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,540
I will take her away.

726
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,540
Bao.

727
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,540
What's going on?

728
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,540
Tell me.

729
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,540
Mother, I came here to catch her.

730
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,540
Catch her?

731
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,540
What did she do?

732
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,540
She was kidnapped?

733
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,540
Or she was killed?

734
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,540
I can't explain it to you.

735
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,540
Leave me alone.

736
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,540
Listen.

737
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,540
Li Lianhua is my guest.

738
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,540
I'm her friend.

739
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,540
If you dare to touch my guest on my territory,

740
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,540
you will be in trouble with me.

741
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,540
Including you.

742
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,540
Mother.

743
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:01,540
And your aunt also favors her.

744
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,540
You know your aunt is old.

745
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,540
She has never appreciated someone.

746
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,540
Right?

747
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,540
Mr. Li, right?

748
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,540
Li is my friend.

749
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,540
She...

750
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,540
Shut up.

751
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,540
Don't take her as a shield.

752
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,540
Come with me.

753
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,540
Fang Xiaobao.

754
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:20,540
You are too bold to listen to me.

755
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,540
I never taught you this kind of hospitality.

756
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,540
Let go of my hand.

757
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,540
Mother.

758
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,540
Watch out.

759
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,540
Sorry.

760
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,540
Don't be so rude.

761
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,540
Please come in, Doctor Li.

762
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,540
Be careful.

763
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,540
Doctor Li.

764
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,540
Chief He.

765
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,540
Just call me Mr. Li.

766
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,540
Okay.

767
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,540
Please leave.

768
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,540
Please come in.

769
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,540
Mr. Li, please sit.

770
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,540
I didn't expect you to be so young.

771
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,540
Really?

772
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,540
You are so arrogant.

773
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,540
I didn't expect that

774
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:09,540
Li, who is known to be a man of many talents,

775
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:13,540
is such a handsome man.

776
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:21,540
I often hear about your case.

777
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:24,540
He said that you are good at planning.

778
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,540
He learned a lot from you.

779
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,540
You don't have to be polite.

780
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,540
Lin Lang helped me a lot.

781
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,540
How can a little fox beat an old fox?

782
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,540
Jiang Han is old and weak.

783
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:38,540
Didn't you say that Li Lianhua is a good man?

784
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,540
You said that you are a good friend in life.

785
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,540
You don't go to the world.

786
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:46,540
You only want to be with your husband.

787
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,540
Isn't that what you said?

788
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,540
I didn't introduce you to the right person.

789
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,540
You don't need to be careful when you are making friends.

790
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,540
You should be careful when you are making friends.

791
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:59,540
I feel very far away when I see Li Lianhua.

792
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,540
I believe that she is not a big evil person.

793
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,540
What's wrong with you two?

794
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,540
I'll make it clear here today.

795
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,540
If you like my Jiang Han wine, drink more.

796
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,540
He's going to the old house of Bai Chuan Garden.

797
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,540
He's been drinking for so long and he's not going to drink anymore.

798
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,540
Don't listen to this fellow's nonsense.

799
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,540
Drink more.

800
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,540
Drink more.

801
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,540
Mother.

802
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:33,540
Fang Xiao Bao, you were so determined to enter the world.

803
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,540
Your mother didn't want to.

804
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:39,540
She was worried that you, a young man, had no experience,

805
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,540
and caused more troubles.

806
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:44,540
Who knew that you met Li Lianhua.

807
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,540
She didn't teach you, but she was always protecting you.

808
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,540
I'll accept it for this.

809
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,940
Everyone has a secret

810
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,940
they don't want to tell in their life.

811
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,940
If you keep it to yourself,

812
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,340
it's like keeping it to yourself.

813
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,340
Just like you keep it from me.

814
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,940
Is my father like that?

815
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:03,940
You...

816
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,940
You little brat.

817
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,340
You dare to give your mother a medicine.

818
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,540
You're so bold, aren't you?

819
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:09,940
Wait, wait, wait.

820
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,740
Right?

821
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,940
Do you think your father is a good person?

822
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,540
I won't say it.

823
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,940
I have my reasons.

824
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:16,940
I hate you the most

825
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,940
because of the people from the Baichuan Courtyard and the Four Gu Men.

826
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,340
The grudges and grudges of Jianghu for so many years

827
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,140
were all made up by those who

828
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,940
are from the right sects.

829
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,540
They want to set rules for Jianghu.

830
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,740
In the end,

831
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,940
they still want to

832
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,740
fight for power for those who make rules.

833
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,540
Jianghu is Jianghu.

834
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,340
The rules of Jianghu

835
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,540
are the rules of Jianghu itself.

836
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,140
There are 420 rules in the law of this country.

837
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,340
There are more than 3,000 regulations.

838
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,140
If we really calculate it,

839
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,340
which one can win over

840
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,940
the people of Jianghu?

841
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,740
So,

842
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,140
I admire

843
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,340
a man like Mr. Li

844
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,540
who is willful and brave

845
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,540
and never participates in any sect's dispute.

846
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,140
He's not like the idol Li Xiangyi

847
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:05,540
that Fang Xiaobao admired before.

848
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,340
I think

849
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,740
the so-called hero

850
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,340
is a man who is famous for his reputation.

851
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,140
I really don't know

852
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,340
where he is good at.

853
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:15,940
Mother.

854
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,740
Mr. Li, you don't know.

855
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:19,940
I asked Xiaobao.

856
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,540
Since he was a child,

857
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,140
in order to become Li Xiangyi's disciple,

858
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,340
he has been eating

859
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,740
such a big bitter pill.

860
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,540
In order to stand up,

861
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:30,140
he has been in the needle for 12 times.

862
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,540
It hurts.

863
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,140
He has been in the red for many times

864
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,340
and he refused to cry.

865
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,540
Just for one word from Li Xiangyi,

866
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,140
he said that as long as he could hold the sword,

867
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,940
he would accept him as his disciple.

868
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,740
Do you think he is stupid?

869
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,540
Mother, stop talking, okay?

870
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:50,740
Madam,

871
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,340
the doctor sent the medicine for catching him.

872
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,540
Okay, leave it there.

873
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,340
Medicine?

874
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,940
Mother, are you not feeling well?

875
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,140
The underground water nearby

876
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,740
is not clean.

877
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,940
It's not drinkable.

878
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,740
Li and I are new here.

879
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,940
We don't know.

880
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,140
So these days,

881
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,940
I feel a little guilty.

882
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,140
I'm sorry.

883
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,740
I'm sorry.

884
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,740
I'm a little guilty.

885
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,940
It's okay. It's okay.

886
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,140
Then go back and take the medicine.

887
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:14,940
Don't...

888
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,340
Don't say so many words, okay?

889
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,340
Master He,

890
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,140
no need to be so polite.

891
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,140
Your health is important.

892
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,140
Okay, Mr. Li.

893
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,740
I won't accompany you then.

894
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:30,740
By the way,

895
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,340
you haven't seen this house, right?

896
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,340
Li, Madam,

897
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,340
take Mr. Li and Young Master

898
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,540
to visit the house later.

899
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,140
Yes.

900
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,740
Young Master, please.

901
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,140
Why is the backyard so deserted?

902
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,940
Actually,

903
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,740
I heard from the housekeeper next door that

904
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,340
there was a disaster in this yard.

905
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,140
Is it the fire disaster my mother mentioned?

906
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,540
The original owner is called Yan Qingtian.

907
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,940
It seems that his wife and housekeeper

908
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,540
stole his love and killed him in the middle of the night.

909
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,340
The fire burned half of the house

910
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,340
and even took the whole family's treasure.

911
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,940
Madam is not afraid.

912
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,940
We servants are so scared.

913
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,940
Then, Young Master,

914
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,340
you and Mr. Li

915
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,140
can see the rest of the yard by yourself.

916
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,340
I didn't tell you something.

917
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,540
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

918
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,140
You came to my house on purpose

919
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,140
to make friends with my mother.

920
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,740
What do you want to do?

921
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,540
It's useless.

922
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:49,140
I just happened to meet Li.

923
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:54,140
I didn't kill your father.

924
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,540
I can trust you.

925
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,540
So many evidences point to you.

926
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,740
It's a coincidence that

927
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,740
someone knew you were still alive.

928
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,140
I deliberately pointed all the clues to you.

929
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,740
But it doesn't mean that it's fake.

930
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,140
You may be innocent or not.

931
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,340
If you can tell me the truth

932
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,540
about what you hid,

933
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,540
I can judge it by myself.

934
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,140
Except for my identity,

935
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,740
I didn't hide anything else.

936
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,340
Then you really appeared outside the Yi Pin Ferry

937
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,140
because of an accident?

938
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,140
You didn't find Guan Yin Chui

939
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:34,940
when you found out about Di Feisheng.

940
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,140
You didn't find out about him

941
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,140
because of Guan Yin Chui?

942
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,740
You really investigated the case with me

943
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,140
because you wanted to reward me?

944
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,140
Not because you wanted to enter the Bai Chuan Courtyard?

945
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,540
You and Di Feisheng

946
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,940
really didn't want to save anyone?

947
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,540
He planted steel on me.

948
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,540
You lied to me that he was an iron head slave

949
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,540
and kept him by your side.

950
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,940
Do you really think it's a lie?

951
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:56,940
So,

952
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,740
you really didn't hide anything.

953
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:01,740
In the end,

954
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,340
I was the only one who was blinded in the valley.

955
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,540
I didn't know anything.

956
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,140
There are many things

957
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,340
that I really can't help but to do.

958
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,540
It's good to have no mercy.

959
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,740
Wait.

960
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,740
This courtyard

961
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,140
is called the Bai Shui Courtyard.

962
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,540
Bai Shui Courtyard?

963
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,740
Is it the Huangquan Prefecture?

964
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,740
Huangquan Prefecture?

965
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,140
Did my mother buy

966
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,740
the house of Huangquan?

967
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,740
If what those servants said is true,

968
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,340
the one who died is Lian Quan.

969
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,740
But Huangquan Prefecture's martial arts are so powerful.

970
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,540
How could he be killed by his wife

971
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,540
just because of his martial arts?

972
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,740
There must be something wrong with it.

973
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,540
Have you heard of Lord Yan's marriage?

974
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,540
I suspect

975
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,740
that this is related to Lian Quan.

976
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,340
Huangquan Prefecture's master

977
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,940
was the third best martial arts master ten years ago.

978
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,540
He must have been involved in the painting of Yuzhan.

979
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,340
Since you can find it,

980
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,540
you must have come for Lian Quan.

981
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,740
Or we can cooperate.

982
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,540
Do you think that without you,

983
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,740
I can't find the case?

984
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:33,940
Then you've failed

985
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,740
the teachings of Sect Leader Li secretly.

986
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:40,340
It's okay if you can't tell me those secrets.

987
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,940
Someone will

988
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,740
knock on your door.

989
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:47,940
Hello?

990
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:48,740
Hello?

991
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:51,940
What a coincidence.

992
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,140
When I met you at the gate,

993
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,340
I played a new song.

994
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,940
I don't have time to joke with you.

995
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,940
Where is the Luo Mo Tian Bing on you?

996
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,740
I'm not talking about you two.

997
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,340
You're always so shy.

998
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,340
I heard that this Yun Yuan Zhu

999
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,340
has been working for the prison for ten years.

1000
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,140
I didn't expect that in order to catch me,

1001
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,340
he was caught by Xiaoshun

1002
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,340
and tied up.

1003
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,540
Li Mo is a good man.

1004
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,740
I'm so lucky.

1005
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,540
You don't need to change the topic.

1006
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,340
Maybe you don't know

1007
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,540
the method of the Baichuan Courtyard yet.

1008
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,540
We have a kind of dragon-sweeping smoke.

1009
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,140
The first one is used to make a shadow.

1010
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,740
The second one can be used to make a shadow.

1011
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,740
No matter what kind of steel man

1012
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,740
can't stand it.

1013
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:38,740
I mean,

1014
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,540
is it a waste

1015
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,140
to deal with such a powerful thing?

1016
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,940
Only those who are not good at dealing with evil

1017
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,540
can use the dragon-sweeping smoke.

1018
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,140
I don't know

1019
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,940
why you hate this Li Lian Hua so much.

1020
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,740
When we find the Lian Hua House,

1021
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,140
we'll return to Baichuan Courtyard immediately.

1022
00:42:59,340 --> 00:42:59,940
Fang Xiao Bao.

1023
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,740
Fang Xiao Bao.

1024
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,940
Since I caught you this time,

1025
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,740
I'll let you go.

1026
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,140
I'll go with you.

1027
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,140
If you're done,

1028
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,140
you can go back to Tian Ji Villa with me.

1029
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,540
You've had enough of the eyes of a detective.

1030
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,740
Next, you can go back to

1031
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,540
marry me in a peaceful way.

1032
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:23,940
Do you hear me?

1033
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:24,940
Who said I'm going back?

1034
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,340
If you don't go back,

1035
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:28,540
where are you going?

1036
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,540
You don't even have a partner now.

1037
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,740
Are you going to go on your own?

1038
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:37,740
Madam.

1039
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:39,140
Young Master.

1040
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:39,940
What's wrong?

1041
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,140
Why is there someone

1042
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,140
who's so rich?

1043
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,340
Lord Yan, please take the money.

1044
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:14,540
The world is too hasty.

1045
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,740
I can't wait to see the old days.

1046
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,940
There are so many things to do.

1047
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:22,940
I want to change my fate.

1048
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,740
The world is too hasty.

1049
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:30,940
I've experienced so many things.

1050
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:37,940
I don't want to part with my life.

1051
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:41,540
The world is too hasty.

1052
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,540
I can't wait to see the old days.

1053
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:46,940
There are so many things to do.

1054
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:50,140
I want to change my fate.

1055
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,940
The world is too hasty.

1056
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:58,140
I've experienced so many things.

1057
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:04,540
I don't want to part with my life.

1058
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:12,940
The world is too hasty.
