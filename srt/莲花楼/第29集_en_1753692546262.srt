Kissing myself thousands of times

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The most reluctant moment is that moment

Live in the world

00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000

Episode 12

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You guys, guard the entrance of the hall.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You guys, stay in the room.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The rest of you, go to the yard and take a walk.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Make sure that you are in each other's eyes.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
If there is a movement, immediately knock on the door.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You guys, get up.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Don't sleep.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Did you lock the back door?

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yes, Young Master.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I say, Fang Xiaobao.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Look at you, you look like a big enemy.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So ridiculous.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Don't worry, son. It's okay.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We have more than forty people here.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Are you afraid that he won't be able to do it?

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's not that there are too many people.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You went out and brought two good guys for the general.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The rest are the guests invited by the local.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
This Huangquan Talisman Master's martial arts are indescribable.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Those people are in his eyes, I'm afraid it's an unbearable blow.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Don't forget, we have two more masters here.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Where?

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
One is you, one is me.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What?

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Are we Tianji Hall eating vegetables?

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Wait a minute, we'll work together to catch this fake King Yan

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
and send him to see the real King Yan.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
He's smiling.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
He's finally smiling.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
He's not even handsome this night.

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'll get a quilt.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You let me sit here all night.

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm not a good boy.

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Li, go get it for Master Tang.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
No, I'll be right back.

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You just need to watch these young ladies.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Don't worry about your mother.

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What are you waiting for?

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Protect Master Tang.

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yes.

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Come on, save Master Tang!

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Let Master Tang go!

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
No one is to leave this room.

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yes.

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Mother.

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Everyone, go after them.

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yes.

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Go.

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Go.

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Go.

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Go.

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Go.

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Go.

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Go.

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Go.

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Go.

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Go.

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Go.

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Go.

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The King of Heaven has taken the throne!

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The King of Heaven has taken the throne!

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Watch Li Minghao.

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'll go check on him.

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The King of Heaven has taken the throne!

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
São Paulo neighbours

91
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,180
The underground kidney walls are inference

92
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,020
Most of them are still painless

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,900
Come here, come here.

94
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,200
Gave attention to the Kick Rafael.

95
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,600
Att Moscue...

96
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,900
There is.

97
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,100
Now all I analyzing intoOkay Philosophy

98
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:05,520
already퍼 to myising to a one day

99
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,460
I chased the

100
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,460
But someone helped him to distract the attention

101
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,460
I also took a picture for him

102
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,460
It's that B-Chong Ji

103
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,460
It's really Lian Quan

104
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,460
The other one should be Niu Tou Ma Mian

105
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,460
It's just that they're all gone

106
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,460
near where I chased

107
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,460
You just said who did that Silver Snake catch

108
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,460
My mother was caught

109
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,460
That person is very powerful

110
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,460
I was shot by him and lost him

111
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,460
But I don't have any signs of anyone getting in

112
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,400
I was wondering how he got in

113
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
and how he left

114
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
I found out that there was a crying girl at home

115
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
I said that the crying girl came in

116
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
Young Master, how is it?

117
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,400
I didn't find her

118
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,400
Where are you?

119
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,400
No one

120
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
It's all my fault

121
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
I didn't expect this accident to do to my mother

122
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
Xiao Bao, calm down

123
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
The more it is now, the calmer you have to be

124
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
Everyone, follow the mine and find me

125
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
Yes

126
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,400
Huai Da, you go to the gate immediately

127
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,340
The whole city is under our control

128
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,340
No matter if the boy or girl is old

129
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,340
We will help you find them

130
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,340
As long as there is any clue

131
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,340
we will be in danger

132
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,340
Yes

133
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,340
Young Master, have you found your wife yet?

134
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,340
Is something wrong with your wife?

135
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,340
Don't panic, Li Er

136
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,340
We have already gone to the gate for her

137
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,340
Abalone stone

138
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,280
A piece of abalone stone

139
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,280
What's so strange?

140
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,280
There is no abalone stone in the well

141
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,280
Where did the abalone stone come from?

142
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,280
Don't you think the life here

143
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,280
is much bigger than the villa?

144
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,280
I think so

145
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,280
Li Er

146
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,280
Look

147
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,280
This should be a mine hole

148
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,280
But it seems to be sealed on purpose

149
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,280
Li Er

150
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,280
Wait

151
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,280
The mine hole that the air doesn't flow

152
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,280
will explode if it meets fire

153
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,280
I heard that it exploded a few times before

154
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,280
Be careful not to get hurt

155
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,280
You guys hide first

156
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,280
The mine hole

157
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,280
is not completely empty

158
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,280
There are still some places that are hidden

159
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,280
The biggest one

160
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,280
is right under this white water source

161
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,280
The hole is so big

162
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,280
that it's hard to find

163
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,280
I think it's a trap

164
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,280
I think it's a trap

165
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,280
I think it's a trap

166
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,280
I think it's a trap

167
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,720
Everything seems to be here

168
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,720
They can't take out a tiny strike

169
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,720
There's nothing to be worried about

170
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,640
Him

171
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,240
No

172
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,240
A boy

173
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,240
won't meet the strong man

174
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,240
I'm okay

175
00:10:53,940 --> 00:11:01,940
Push it

176
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,340
That's not right.

177
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,580
Think about it. If you want to keep this house

178
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:12,620
why must this person pretend to be dead?

179
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,300
After he dies, the house will naturally belong to someone else.

180
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,900
He can't hide himself.

181
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,980
There's no need to do that.

182
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,780
Could it be that an enemy has come to us?

183
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,500
He left in a hurry?

184
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,940
Even if he wanted to hide

185
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,260
he wouldn't have asked King of Yan to marry his wife.

186
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,940
He's just a knife on his head.

187
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,020
I don't think Lin Quan is that kind of person.

188
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,820
Don't think too much now.

189
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,140
Let's go look elsewhere.

190
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,420
The body on the ground is only half-dead.

191
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,300
Where did his legs go?

192
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,340
It's possible that he doesn't have legs.

193
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,700
He's just a little bit of a coward.

194
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,100
He's just a little bit of a coward.

195
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,220
He's just a little bit of a coward.

196
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,340
He's just a little bit of a coward.

197
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,060
He probably doesn't have legs.

198
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,460
Look.

199
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,260
The bones on the wall are intact.

200
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,140
But the body on the ground

201
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,140
is cut off by a flag under the cloth.

202
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,180
Could it be that it's the bullhead horse?

203
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,580
Look.

204
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,540
The bones on the chest are black.

205
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,540
It looks like it's been poisoned by the poison of the poison.

206
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,580
The two of them must have suffered a lot before they died.

207
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,060
Could it be that the owner of the imperial palace and the bullhead horse

208
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,060
tricked them here to kill them

209
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,300
and then they separated the two brothers?

210
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,860
This father of the imperial family is really very cruel.

211
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,340
It's a bit strange.

212
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,940
What's strange?

213
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,580
I think

214
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,140
something is wrong with the bones.

215
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,540
The bullhead horse died here.

216
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:03,020
Who was the person who cooperated with the imperial family?

217
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,140
Young Master.

218
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,860
I think I'm a little dizzy.

219
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,940
This is bad. There are many poisons here.

220
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,940
Let's leave here first.

221
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,060
This isn't a bullhead horse.

222
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,260
It's a kind of bullhead horse with a half-body ore.

223
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,340
It's called the Fecui Ore.

224
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,060
The two pieces of ore you found

225
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,060
look different in the middle of the bullhead horse.

226
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,980
But in fact, they have different effects.

227
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,980
The Fecui Ore isn't only priceless

228
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,060
but also has a huge poison.

229
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,580
If you stay near that mine for a while,

230
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,220
you might get hurt and your lungs will bleed.

231
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,300
The stone will ignite and explode.

232
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,660
But the grandmother's ore loves to grow with it.

233
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,900
It's hard to avoid it when it's open.

234
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,460
Then, everyone thought that

235
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,300
if they met it, they would make a mark next to it.

236
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,500
If they did, the locals would see it

237
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,700
and they would avoid it.

238
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,700
This is really hard to tell.

239
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,100
Ordinary people can't tell.

240
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,700
If it wasn't for people like us

241
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,700
who have been mining for decades,

242
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,700
who can tell?

243
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,700
Thank you.

244
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,300
Goodbye.

245
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,100
I don't understand.

246
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,700
Why is he wasting time?

247
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,100
Is this the grandmother's ore or the Fecui Ore's?

248
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,100
Does it have anything to do with us?

249
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,700
I understand.

250
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,300
What do you understand?

251
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,700
I understand why the Lotus Fist

252
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,300
has to use all the tricks of the King of Hell to get the gold.

253
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,700
In fact, the Lotus Fist that just arrived here

254
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,700
can't distinguish between these two ore.

255
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,900
If you use the Fecui Ore as the grandmother's ore to practice the cultivation,

256
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,100
what do you think will happen?

257
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,500
The B中技

258
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,500
can only pass the poison through the grandmother's ore.

259
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,700
If she does this, the poison will only get deeper and deeper.

260
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,100
The poison will enter the bone marrow.

261
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,700
I heard there is a kind of evil martial art

262
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,300
called the Jade Maiden Bridge.

263
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,900
It can use its inner power to hold the poison on the girl

264
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,300
without damaging her inner heart.

265
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,300
The Lotus Fist, in order to get the jade,

266
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,500
keeps using the Fecui Ore to maintain its own martial art.

267
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,300
At the same time, it continuously draws the poison to the innocent girl.

268
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,300
It's really too poisonous.

269
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,100
My mother is still in her hands.

270
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,300
I can't wait any longer.

271
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,700
Fang De Ming, the Lotus Fist is in danger now.

272
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,100
We have to save her first.

273
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,500
We'll talk about the rest later.

274
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,900
Let's split up to find clues.

275
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,100
Let's use the rumors as a source of information.

276
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,300
80.

277
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,900
You... You... You... You... You... Doctor.

278
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,700
This... This is... Su... Su...

279
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,900
This is Su Wa's grave, right?

280
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,300
Give her some more silver money.

281
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,300
When she dies,

282
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,300
don't make any more mistakes.

283
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,900
I'll go.

284
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,500
I'll go.

285
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,300
80.

286
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,700
The girls that were taken away by the King of Hell

287
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,100
were all missing.

288
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:43,300
Where did you find Su Wa's body?

289
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,500
Over there, at the foot of the hill,

290
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,700
there's a cave.

291
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,100
A few corpses were found in the rain a while ago.

292
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,100
They were all female corpses taken away by the King of Hell.

293
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,100
I... I recognized Su Wa at a glance.

294
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,100
How many more girls are there?

295
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,900
Where is the body?

296
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,300
The girls that were taken away by the King of Hell

297
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,500
were all missing.

298
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,900
They were... they were in the clothes.

299
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,700
I'll go.

300
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,500
From the east of the city, there are fake clothes.

301
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,300
To the east of the city, there are fake clothes.

302
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,700
From the south of the city, there are fake clothes.

303
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,300
To the south of the city, there are fake clothes.

304
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,900
Young Master, we've searched the whole of Xiao Yan City.

305
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,500
There's still no clue about the lady.

306
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,700
Young Master, what are you looking at?

307
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,900
Why is there a rock in the pit below?

308
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,900
Li'er, go ask the government office. Xiao Yan City's food and drink company is here.

309
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,500
Food and drink company?

310
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,300
Okay.

311
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,500
I'm sorry.

312
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:51,300
These girls were killed by the poison palm that was used to kill them.

313
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:56,300
Maybe the poison palm caused her to die.

314
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:01,100
Ba Shi, why did you say that the one who married the King of Hell wasn't Yan Wang, but a bad person?

315
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,100
If... if it really was Yan Wang, why did he only appear in Xiao Yan City?

316
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,700
If he escaped from the city, he would be safe.

317
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,100
You're right. I think this person

318
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,300
is a good person.

319
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,300
You're right. I think this person

320
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,700
can only get out of the pit by using the mine.

321
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,500
Then, what about the underground pit that can be used to destroy the city?

322
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,900
There are pit holes in all the houses in the five or six cities.

323
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,700
But the underground pit is

324
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:31,100
70,000 miles around. I can't even tell where it leads to.

325
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,300
70,000 miles around?

326
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,700
You can even find where these girls are.

327
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,700
How did Yan Wang select these women who were killed?

328
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,100
How can he accurately find their location?

329
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:50,100
Ba Shi, do these girls have any common places?

330
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,300
Or where do they live?

331
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,700
They don't live in the same place. They live in the south, south, and north.

332
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,700
Then, what kind of friends do they have?

333
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,900
Or are they parents, brothers, or colleagues?

334
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,500
They have all kinds of friends.

335
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,500
Speaking of common friends, I don't know either.

336
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,900
After all, this is a small city. Everyone knows it.

337
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,700
It's not related in the surface.

338
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,900
But there must be some kind of connection.

339
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,300
Yan Wang never misses any action.

340
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,300
Even if he comes and goes freely under the pit,

341
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,100
how can he find out which room each girl lives in?

342
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,700
It must be in the middle of the house.

343
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,700
The acupuncture.

344
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,300
The fire extinguisher.

345
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,300
Ba Shi.

346
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,900
Did Su Hua get sick before he died?

347
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,300
That day, Su Hua's mother had a headache.

348
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,700
She called the doctor to come up.

349
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,300
Madam, the doctor brought the medicine.

350
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,900
That's it.

351
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,700
The doctor's identity is safe and reasonable.

352
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,100
He can enter the girl's house and look around.

353
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,900
He won't make anyone suspect him.

354
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,100
The End

355
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,300
The End

356
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,100
This little garden is not full of white and messy stones.

357
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,100
Only the west side of the city has them.

358
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:56,700
Could it be that someone deliberately left the stones behind?

359
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,700
Li'er.

360
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,300
Have you seen any outsiders enter and exit the Bai Shui Garden these days?

361
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,500
There are a lot.

362
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,300
I've invited many craftsmen to help me with the garden.

363
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,300
Are there any craftsmen near the Guo Jing?

364
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,900
There are fewer people who go there.

365
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,100
What is this?

366
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,700
Didn't Madam give you the medicine?

367
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,500
This is the medicine.

368
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,900
This is the medicine for the phlegm?

369
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,960
How can there be a

370
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,500
rarest herb that can cure the poison?

371
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,700
Ordinary people can't tell.

372
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,300
If it's not someone like us

373
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,300
who have been doing mining for decades,

374
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,500
who can tell?

375
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,900
Where is that doctor?

376
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,100
Just next to the Guo Jing.

377
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,700
It's him.

378
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,900
What is he?

379
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,100
The one with the poison in the phlegm is someone with a sense of taste.

380
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,700
But he could open the prescription to cure the poison.

381
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,500
It seems that he must know about the situation of the mine.

382
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,900
He left the medicine in the well to make a mark.

383
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,700
Li'er, light the heart.

384
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,900
It's you.

385
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,700
You're the one who gave me the medicine.

386
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,500
It's too late.

387
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,900
Go!

388
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,500
What are you doing?

389
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,700
Let me tell you.

390
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,500
If you dare to touch my finger,

391
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,700
my son won't forgive you.

392
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,900
Lian Lian Hua.

393
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,300
It seems that I came in time.

394
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,300
Be careful. He has poison on his palm.

395
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,300
A killer is more likely to be seduced by a doctor.

396
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,500
You're good at hiding.

397
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,500
What are you doing here?

398
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,100
Let's talk about our business later.

399
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,900
Fang Xiao Bao, why are you here so late?

400
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,700
Mom.

401
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,900
Hurry and catch that bastard.

402
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,300
The one with the poison in the phlegm is someone with a sense of taste.

403
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,700
But you could open the prescription to cure the poison.

404
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,300
This white lotus seed

405
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,900
is also the one you left in the well to make a mark.

406
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,500
Although this bifurcated agent is powerful,

407
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,300
it has a limited amount of poison in its body.

408
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,300
I'll use the young herb to make sure it doesn't use poison.

409
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,100
If you dare to catch my mom, you'll be in for death.

410
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,300
Where are you going?

411
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,600
magic power, calm down.

412
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,620
кого

413
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:15,680
вы не

414
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,680
вы

415
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,880
вы

416
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,480
I'm afraid that he'll be arrested.

417
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,320
Your mother almost got hit by a

418
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,280
poisonous palm just now.

419
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,880
It's all thanks to Li Lianhua who saved me.

420
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,120
How could such a benefactor

421
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,880
take a pregnant woman?

422
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,480
How heartless.

423
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,080
By the way, mother,

424
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,480
are you okay?

425
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,480
Are you hurt?

426
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,880
How can I be hurt?

427
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,480
I was just let that dead doctor

428
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,880
to swallow my throat.

429
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,880
I'm fine.

430
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,880
I'm fine.

431
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,880
I'm fine.

432
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,880
I'm fine.

433
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,880
I'm fine.

434
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,880
I'm fine.

435
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,880
I'm fine.

436
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,880
You just got into a hole in your brain.

437
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,680
But he's not that good.

438
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,080
He was hit by a

439
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,880
treasured pearl of my Tianji Drugstore.

440
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,480
He's the most vulnerable.

441
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,080
It's great that you're not hurt.

442
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,680
You really made me worry.

443
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,480
Alright.

444
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,680
Let me send you home.

445
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,280
Invite Li Lianhua later.

446
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,480
I'll thank her.

447
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,080
Alright.

448
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,080
I know.

449
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,880
Water.

450
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,680
Water.

451
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,880
Give me water.

452
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,680
Water.

453
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,280
Give me water.

454
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,280
Water.

455
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,680
Give me water.

456
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,680
He has too much toxic in his body.

457
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,480
He can't detoxify with the Jade Maiden's Cauldron.

458
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,680
So he needs water to absorb the poison.

459
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,680
Take it.

460
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,880
The thing you want is in my shoe.

461
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,680
Give me water.

462
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,680
Water.

463
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,680
Give me water.

464
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,080
Water.

465
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,280
Water.

466
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,080
Give me water.

467
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,080
Water.

468
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,080
Give me water.

469
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,880
Water.

470
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,880
Water.

471
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,280
Lianquan.

472
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,280
Is this the Dragon Demon Heavenly Army?

473
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,880
I didn't expect that.

474
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,280
Except for the Golden Fist,

475
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,680
the White-Sword Fist

476
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,880
also knows about the Dragon Demon Heavenly Army.

477
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,080
Not only that,

478
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,880
we also know the Night Fire Pond.

479
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,680
So you'd better

480
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,080
explain the difficult plan.

481
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,280
Otherwise,

482
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,680
in a few hours,

483
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,080
there will be no second batch of water

484
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,280
to detoxify you.

485
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,280
Say it.

486
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,880
I'm in this state now.

487
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,480
What can't I say?

488
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,680
Back then, my ancestor

489
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,680
and the other three people

490
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,080
took the Dragon Demon Heavenly Army to the Central Plains.

491
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,680
Only Zhao Yishi could open the Dragon Demon Pond

492
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,880
and control the thousands of people in the Central Plains.

493
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,680
But the four people who got the Heavenly Army

494
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,480
and the wealth of Ronghua

495
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,480
didn't want to do this

496
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,680
for the rest of their lives.

497
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,680
I didn't expect that after so many years,

498
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,280
I could escape from the Golden Fist.

499
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,680
I couldn't escape from the White-Sword Fist.

500
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,080
Many years ago,

501
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,080
I had a meeting with the owner of the imperial power, Lianquan.

502
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,680
Why do you look

503
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,080
different from him?

504
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,280
I'm a coward who is eager to practice martial arts.

505
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,480
I'm full of poison.

506
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,280
I've been in a state of disfigurement for a long time.

507
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,680
If I don't use the magical power to change my skin,

508
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,280
I won't be a human.

509
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,880
Magical power to change your skin?

510
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,480
That's a secret skill.

511
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,480
Only a few masters can get it.

512
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,880
Only then can they get the power in the magical power of the mortal world.

513
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,280
But it's too old-fashioned

514
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,080
to be used as a magic trick.

515
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,280
Magic trick?

516
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,480
All right.

517
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,080
I've told you everything I know.

518
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,280
You've got the Dragon Demon Heavenly Army.

519
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,280
Let me go.

520
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,680
Let you go?

521
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,880
Have you ever let go of those girls

522
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,480
who were poisoned by you?

523
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,680
These skills and lives

524
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,880
will be counted one by one.

525
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,680
The Dragon Demon Heavenly Army is a big matter.

526
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,480
I'm going to ask Master Su from the Wanren Temple

527
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,280
to verify if this Heavenly Army is real or not.

528
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,680
You can take over Lianquan.

529
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,280
We'll split up.

530
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,080
Since the Heavenly Army is a big matter,

531
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,280
I can't let you take it away alone.

532
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,280
I have to go with you.

533
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,680
You're still so worried about me,

534
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,880
aren't you?

535
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,280
I shouldn't have let you go.

536
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,080
Even if we go together,

537
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,480
what about Lianquan?

538
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,480
Will it stay in the post?

539
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,480
Fang Duoduo is here.

540
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,280
It's safer to keep Lianquan in the water park

541
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,680
that Fang's family bought.

542
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,880
You don't have to worry about it.

543
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,080
All right.

544
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,880
Let's do it together.

545
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,480
Sister Shi,

546
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,280
how are you going to deal with Lianquan?

547
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,080
Three days. I'll be back in three days.

548
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,080
I'll leave Lianquan to you.

549
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,480
I'll check on him.

550
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,880
Lianquan?

551
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,880
Did he hide something?

552
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,080
I think so.

553
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,280
I'll try to let him go in these three days.

554
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,880
Boss,

555
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,480
you're so good.

556
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,680
You can knead the dough and cut it quickly.

557
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,080
My mother said

558
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,680
the neighbors saw it

559
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,680
and thought it was hard to knead.

560
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,280
But I have a lot of strength and habit.

561
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,480
I can't change it.

562
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,680
You can't change it?

563
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,680
The one who killed Zulan

564
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,480
and the one who used the Jade Bridge to poison me is Lang Zhong.

565
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,280
He is a young man.

566
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,080
The one who can enter the Bai Shui Garden to rob people is Guan Yongdan.

567
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,480
There is another person.

568
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,880
Who is this person?

569
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,080
Two white dough sticks.

570
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,680
Okay.

571
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,480
Don't forget it.

572
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,480
Shi,

573
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,080
how did you put the money in this water bowl?

574
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,880
I have too much oil in my hands.

575
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,080
If I touch the money, it will get dirty.

576
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,880
Like this?

577
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,480
created no air

578
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,800
Xiang Hui.

579
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,560
Wang Hui...

580
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:50,500
The tripes tonsured and executives Achilles Our were prepared at Ganjun Lake for you on that night

581
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,100
Save yourKO now!

582
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,300
Yes, I'm데a вд bakх

583
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,040
so I can drop the soup.

584
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,800
attending to the villagers at yes,

585
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,100
and training ?

586
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:23,960
.

587
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,200
I got it.

588
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,800
What?

589
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,800
What channel?

590
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,800
Stop pretending.

591
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,800
When I chased you that day,

592
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,800
there was someone who covered for you.

593
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,800
Did you get poisoned and get into your brain?

594
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,800
Did you forget it?

595
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,800
That was a bandit from the past.

596
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,800
Every time I do a crime,

597
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,800
I will listen to it from the dark to the dark.

598
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,800
It's convenient for me to do it.

599
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,800
After that, I will pay the money and leave.

600
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,800
It's irrelevant.

601
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,800
It's irrelevant?

602
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,800
That's not right.

603
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,800
I remember that day,

604
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,800
my mother sent a drum.

605
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,800
The drum was hit by someone.

606
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,800
The drum was hooked into the water.

607
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,800
But I just saw that

608
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,800
there was no trace of you.

609
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,800
The only explanation is that

610
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,800
the person who got hit by the drum was not you.

611
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,800
You hired a bandit to help you.

612
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,800
It's not a problem.

613
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,800
It's too unethical to get hit by the drum for you.

614
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,800
Speak.

615
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
Where is your accomplice?

616
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,800
You're still stubborn.

617
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,800
Heroine Heng.

618
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,800
I haven't been a organ-maker for a long time.

619
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,800
I let you stay up all night for you.

620
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,800
This organ-maker

621
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,800
is the most painful and itchy one.

622
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
It can change seven times in an hour.

623
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,800
Sometimes it makes you cry.

624
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,800
Sometimes it makes you laugh.

625
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,800
In fact,

626
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,800
you can answer whatever we ask.

627
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,800
Otherwise, you'll suffer.

628
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,800
Speak.

629
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,800
Where is the accomplice?

630
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,800
You're still pretending to be dead.

631
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,800
I'm telling you.

632
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,800
I haven't paid you back for taking my money.

633
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,800
I'll see how long you can hold on.

634
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,800
By the way,

635
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,800
the name of this organ hasn't been taken yet.

636
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,800
Just call it Lotus Blood-Straining Fertilizer.

637
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,800
Fang Xiaobao, what do you think?

638
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,800
He's going to call me if he calls me.

639
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,800
You kid, you're so easy.

640
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,800
Master, you're so strong.

641
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,800
It must hurt to hold the pig.

642
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,800
That's right.

643
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,800
I shouldn't call you Master.

644
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,800
Or

645
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,800
I should call you Bullhead

646
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,800
or Horse Face.

647
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,800
Didn't you see it with your own eyes?

648
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,800
Bullhead and Horse Face died in this mine hole.

649
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,800
I'm not a bullhead.

650
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,800
I'm a horse face.

651
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,800
I'm a horse face.

652
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,800
Bullhead and Horse Face died in this mine hole.

653
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,800
That's right.

654
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,800
Yes.

655
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,800
I saw the bones in the mine hole.

656
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,800
I did suspect that it was Bullhead and Horse Face.

657
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,800
But those two bones

658
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,800
one is called heavy

659
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,800
and the other is called light.

660
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,800
The mother's leg is obviously

661
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,800
much wider.

662
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,800
It's a woman.

663
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,800
So

664
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,800
the one who died in the hole

665
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,800
wasn't Bullhead and Horse Face.

666
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,800
I'm sure you're right.

667
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,800
It's hard to deal with smart people.

668
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,800
But

669
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,800
you're only half right.

670
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,800
You killed the couple

671
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,800
and took the secret of the Lotus Fist

672
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,800
and made it a secret weapon.

673
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,800
But you're afraid of the enemy's pursuit.

674
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,800
So you disguised the couple's bodies

675
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,800
into this.

676
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
Right?

677
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,800
We killed the Lotus Fist

678
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,800
not to take its martial arts

679
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,800
but to protect ourselves.

680
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,800
So

681
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,800
let's meet later.

682
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,800
Many years ago

683
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,800
all of ourmeal peel was made to knight her.

684
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,400
I heard that Xiao Yuan Cheng was hiding in the city.

685
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,240
Who knew that he married a woman with a water-like face

686
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,080
and had doubts about us.

687
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,400
He thought that we had a crush on that woman.

688
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,800
Lian Quan used the Bizhong Skill to lure us into the mine.

689
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,600
He used the poisonous jade to replace the grandmother's jade to train us.

690
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,760
When we realized that we were poisoned,

691
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,440
he thought that we would die underground.

692
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,680
But my brother Li Xiong used his skills

693
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,080
to absorb the poisonous jade into himself

694
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,840
and separated us.

695
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,200
Although I lost my mind, I never got poisoned.

696
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,160
I could use the mechanism to act,

697
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,680
but my brother was killed by the poisonous jade.

698
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,440
Brother! Brother!

699
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,960
Brother, don't! Brother!

700
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,960
I was in a hurry to save my brother's life.

701
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,560
I looked for many ways.

702
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,240
Finally, I found out that the assistant of Hanshui Temple

703
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,920
has a new skill of the Jade Jade Bridge.

704
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,480
It can detoxify and save lives.

705
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,080
Killing and taking books

706
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,080
will keep my brother alive.

707
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,360
After that, I used the assistant of Hanshui Temple

708
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,560
to stay in Xiao Yuan City

709
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,680
and seek revenge for Lian Quan.

710
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,520
Look, we found him.

711
00:38:59,080 --> 00:38:59,920
Madam.

712
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,080
One day,

713
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,120
I successfully lured Lian Quan into the mine

714
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,160
and killed him and that woman.

715
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,280
Then I disguised the corpse as our brother.

716
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,000
Even if the Golden Abyss Alliance comes to investigate this,

717
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,760
they won't find out about my brother.

718
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,560
Everything was perfect.

719
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,400
But you found out that we hid the Golden Abyss Alliance.

720
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,120
My brother Li Xiong has been caught by you, right?

721
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,520
He's in the hands of the Household Department.

722
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,000
Fortunately, I'm not that unlucky.

723
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,640
God gave me a chance to get rid of Feng Sheng.

724
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,680
Your identity has been exposed.

725
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,440
You still want to get rid of Feng Sheng?

726
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,760
With the four-tree sect leader, Li Xiangyi,

727
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,040
I can do it.

728
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,200
You chased me that day and used the pozo cloth.

729
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,840
Sect Leader Li, you can't hide it from me.

730
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,640
If it's Li Xiangyi,

731
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,560
do you think you can escape?

732
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,520
Sect Leader Li,

733
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,000
you came all the way to Xiao Yuan City

734
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,080
to get rid of the Golden Abyss Alliance.

735
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,280
You promised me a condition.

736
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,400
I'm willing to give you the Golden Abyss Alliance.

737
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,960
The Household Department has already got the Golden Abyss Alliance from your brother.

738
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,560
That's a lie.

739
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,960
We brothers didn't rely on God.

740
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,120
The Golden Abyss Alliance is a life-saving thing.

741
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,600
It has to be kept until the end.

742
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,120
Now, with you, Li Xiangyi,

743
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,880
it can be taken out.

744
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,120
Sect Leader Li, promise me.

745
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,560
The Golden Abyss Alliance is yours.

746
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,800
Otherwise, I'll give it to the Golden Abyss Alliance.

747
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,120
Although the Golden Abyss Alliance doesn't keep its promise,

748
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,440
it can still save our lives.

749
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,280
Tell me.

750
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,080
What do you want me to do?

751
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,080
Save my brother, Li Xiong.

752
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,920
To cure the poison of the Bizhong Ji.

753
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,400
I know.

754
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,840
Yang Zhengman is the best in the world.

755
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,840
Only you can cure his poison.

756
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,960
Li Xiao, you're thinking so well.

757
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,720
I'm not a person who goes through all the hardships.

758
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,440
This bastard is always trying to attack me.

759
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,560
I can't save your brother.

760
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,680
That's your brother's business.

761
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,800
It has nothing to do with me.

762
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,360
I know.

763
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,960
You have a deep friendship with the detective of the Baichuan Courtyard.

764
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,720
You can think of a way from him.

765
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,240
Finally, I remind you, Sect Leader Li.

766
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,880
You only have two days.

767
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,440
When two days are up, I'll ask for help from the Golden Abyss Alliance.

768
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,840
You have to hurry up.

769
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,800
You're going to offend Fang Xiaobao again.

770
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,200
It's not a big deal to promise you.

771
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,000
But I'm worried.

772
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,000
Sect Leader Li, what are you worried about?

773
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,840
Your brother's heavenly army is fake.

774
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:45,000
Then I have to check if this piece in your hand is real or fake.

775
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,960
Li Xiangyi is a man of his word.

776
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,280
I believe you won't take advantage of the situation.

777
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,920
You don't have to use the past to blame me.

778
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,120
I only check the treasure.

779
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,840
I won't take it.

780
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,160
Chen Jiang.

781
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,160
Fang Xiaobao, why did you lock the prison?

782
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,360
That doctor hasn't vomited yet.

783
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,360
He didn't do anything when you pulled his organ.

784
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,600
It means he won't tell his accomplices.

785
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,160
It's useless to force him.

786
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,960
I, the leader of Tianji Hall,

787
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,280
can't even cure him with my own organ.

788
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,280
I don't agree.

789
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,560
Go and open the prison door.

790
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,960
Let me improve Lianhua's academic position.

791
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,080
No need.

792
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,360
Let's change the plan.

793
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,880
He won't tell his accomplices when he dies.

794
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,040
It means they're very close.

795
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,440
He'll definitely come to save his accomplices.

796
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,320
I've already set up the organ in the Baichuan Courtyard.

797
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,760
If he dares to come, I'll make sure he can't escape.

798
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,040
Can you give me the documents?

799
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:23,240
I'll ask

800
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,440
What are you doing here again?

801
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,080
I thought it over.

802
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,480
So you're here to turn yourself in?

803
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,240
I have no other choice.

804
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,440
Why don't we continue to work together?

805
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,080
I'm here to turn myself in.

806
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,080
I have no other choice.

807
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:06,080
Why don't we continue to work together?

808
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:09,080
I have no other choice.

809
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,080
Why don't we continue to work together?

810
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:15,080
I have no other choice.

811
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,080
Why don't we continue to work together?

812
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,080
I have no other choice.

813
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,080
Why don't we continue to work together?

814
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,080
I have no other choice.

815
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,080
Why don't we continue to work together?

816
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:34,080
I have no other choice.

817
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,080
Why don't we continue to work together?

818
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:40,080
I have no other choice.

819
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,080
Why don't we continue to work together?

820
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,080
I have no other choice.

821
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,080
Why don't we continue to work together?

822
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:52,080
I have no other choice.

823
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,080
Why don't we continue to work together?

824
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,080
I have no other choice.

825
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:01,080
Why don't we continue to work together?

826
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,080
I have no other choice.

827
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,080
Why don't we continue to work together?

828
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,080
I have no other choice.

829
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:13,080
Why don't we continue to work together?

830
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,080
I have no other choice.

831
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,080
Why don't we continue to work together?

832
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:22,080
I have no other choice.

833
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,080
Why don't we continue to work together?

834
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:28,080
I have no other choice.

835
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:31,080
Why don't we continue to work together?

836
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,080
I have no other choice.

837
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,080
Why don't we continue to work together?

838
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,080
I have no other choice.

839
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,080
Why don't we continue to work together?

840
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:46,080
I have no other choice.

841
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:50,080
Who is not a god?

842
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,080
The same group.
