Kissing myself thousands of times

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The most reluctant moment is that moment

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Live in the world

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A thousand miles of crazy

00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who never wanders

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Who doesn't know the distance between the two worlds

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The end of the world

The child does not like to eat, do not cut it. Use dragon mother's drum shell. Dragon mother's drum shell invites you to watch Lotus Pavilion.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Oulin.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Who are you?

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I...

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Love is a little bit of a secret.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'll cut you a few more times.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Who are you?

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Sister Qiao.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The beauty in the martial arts world

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
must be compared with you and me.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Then tell me,

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
who is more beautiful?

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But I'm not here to compete with you.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm here to tell you

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
that Li Xiangyi

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
is still alive.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Where is he?

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I also want to know

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
where he is.

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Through this Lotus Pavilion,

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
you are where the Heaven's created you.

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The fragrance of the Lotus is so strong.

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The fragrance of the Lotus Pavilion

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
is a question of the two worlds.

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Unlock it.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The fragrance of the Lotus

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
is created by the eight-storied sky.

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The shadow falls down.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The dead door is in front of the sky.

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The deep door is in the earth.

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The door is in the mountains.

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The door is in the mountains.

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The door is in the mountains.

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The door is in the mountains.

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The door is in the mountains.

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The door is in the mountains.

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,900
The

82
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,900
You can't stop me!

83
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,900
Of course you can't.

84
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,900
But today, all the martial arts groups are here.

85
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,900
You can't make trouble easily.

86
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,900
One more step!

87
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,900
One more step.

88
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,900
Why is the Black Immortal trapped in the Lihua Town?

89
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,900
The devil came to us to catch us.

90
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,900
What?

91
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,900
This is a destroyed town.

92
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,900
Be careful.

93
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,900
You look so old.

94
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,900
It's a pity that you're defeated.

95
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,900
It's been ten years.

96
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,900
Why did you come here today?

97
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,900
It's been ten years.

98
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,900
Your martial arts skills are still not good.

99
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,900
You're not qualified to ask me.

100
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,900
Although I'm not the best martial arts expert,

101
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,900
if you want to help me with the war and let me get married,

102
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,900
don't blame me for being rude.

103
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,900
Ziqi.

104
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,900
Your martial arts skills are much better.

105
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,900
I heard that you can repair internal injuries

106
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,900
with the help of the hammer.

107
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,900
It's hard to resist the power of the people.

108
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,900
Let's go together.

109
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,900
Don't be polite to him.

110
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,900
Go.

111
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,900
Go.

112
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,900
I'll come again.

113
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,900
Bad news.

114
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,900
Something happened in the west.

115
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,900
Miss Qiao went to the west.

116
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,900
Huanbin.

117
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,900
She's recovering.

118
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,900
The cicada in the ice,

119
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,900
cold and cold.

120
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,900
It's the antidote for its poison.

121
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,900
Yangzhou is slow.

122
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,900
It's Qiao Liqiao.

123
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,900
She poisoned Miss Qiao.

124
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,900
I'm sorry.

125
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,900
I'm sorry.

126
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,900
I'm sorry.

127
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,900
I'm sorry.

128
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,900
I'm sorry.

129
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,900
I'm sorry.

130
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,900
I'm sorry.

131
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,900
I'm sorry.

132
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,900
I'm sorry.

133
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,900
I'm sorry.

134
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,900
I'm sorry.

135
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,900
I'm sorry.

136
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,900
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,900
I'm sorry.

138
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,900
I'm sorry.

139
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,900
Eunuch Guan.

140
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,900
You use the golden needle to detoxify the poison.

141
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,900
You can certainly),

142
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,900
masa, take your lessons.

143
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,900
Earlier, I already checked on Miss Qiao.

144
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,900
The cicada Architecture and Cicada will be sterilized.

145
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:48,900
The poison only enters the mouth

146
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,900
And isõ championship title in half an hour.

147
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,900
The poison will have no hjn j.

148
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,900
Conclusion of this poison only uses the ends of the innards of Teeth and Collar.

149
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,900
This attack!!

150
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,900
So after the cicada alters the weapon

151
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,900
The patient playing safely.

152
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,300
If the coldness of the body is too strong,

153
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,180
it will hurt the patient

154
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,740
and make him die

155
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,340
in a very fragile condition.

156
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,060
The only person who can do this

157
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,420
is Yang Zhongman.

158
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,900
That's why I said

159
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,020
to detoxify him.

160
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,980
Otherwise, after three hours,

161
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,780
the ice will be hard to block.

162
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,420
Miss Qiao will die from the ice.

163
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,940
Yang Zhongman?

164
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,780
That's Prime Minister Li's special inner power.

165
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,580
If he can save An Mian,

166
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,900
he can ask me to kneel down and beg him.

167
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,860
But Prime Minister Li has died long ago.

168
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,020
What does the demoness want?

169
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,860
You don't have to use your inner power to save her.

170
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,540
Can you let me see Miss Qiao?

171
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,740
It's none of your business.

172
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,620
Don't touch Wan Mian.

173
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,100
Do you have any other way to save her?

174
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,860
Actually, Mr. Guan and I

175
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,140
have discussed the method of detoxifying poison.

176
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:23,040
We only found that the Bodhisattva's Five-Liang

177
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,340
But it takes three hours

178
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,940
for the Bodhisattva's Five-Liang to come here.

179
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,260
It's too late.

180
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,340
I know one or two

181
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,340
of the Bodhisattva's methods of detoxification.

182
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,340
If you believe me,

183
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,180
can you let me try it on Miss Qiao?

184
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,740
Can you really do it?

185
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,260
If you open your mouth,

186
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,180
do you know the consequences?

187
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,300
It's a matter of life and death.

188
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,580
I dare not to play a trick.

189
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,020
But the blood is cold and cold.

190
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,060
In the new spring,

191
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,420
the summer and autumn are more than 60 degrees.

192
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,300
With the fire burning,

193
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,140
the poison soup can be detoxified.

194
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,460
How can you

195
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,900
find the things you said?

196
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,620
Don't try to protect me.

197
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,260
There are many medicine shops,

198
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,700
fruit shops and tea shops in the town.

199
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,740
They can be gathered.

200
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,780
We can gather together.

201
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,300
I believe Brother Li.

202
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,060
I don't need you.

203
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:13,900
We are here.

204
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,340
I'll go find it.

205
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,540
You take care of Miss Qiao.

206
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,940
Leave the rest to us.

207
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,780
Please prepare three buckets of hot water.

208
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,460
Miss Qiao can detoxify at last.

209
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,580
Yes.

210
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,260
Miss Qiao.

211
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,220
Miss Qiao.

212
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,140
Miss Qiao.

213
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,060
Miss Qiao.

214
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:49,940
Miss Qiao.

215
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,940
Miss Qiao.

216
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:51,860
Miss Qiao.

217
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,740
Miss Qiao.

218
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,780
Miss Qiao.

219
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,740
Miss Qiao.

220
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,660
Miss Qiao.

221
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,580
Miss Qiao.

222
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,660
Miss Qiao.

223
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,660
Miss Qiao.

224
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,660
Miss Qiao.

225
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,580
Miss Qiao.

226
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,540
Miss Qiao.

227
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,420
Miss Qiao.

228
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,260
Miss Qiao.

229
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,140
Miss Qiao.

230
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,060
Miss Qiao.

231
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:05,980
Miss Qiao.

232
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,820
Miss Qiao.

233
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,740
Miss Qiao.

234
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,740
Miss Qiao.

235
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,660
Miss Qiao.

236
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,580
Miss Qiao.

237
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,540
Miss Qiao.

238
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,380
Miss Qiao.

239
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,260
Miss Qiao.

240
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,140
Miss Qiao.

241
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,020
Miss Qiao.

242
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:15,740
Miss Qiao.

243
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,660
Miss Qiao.

244
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,060
Miss Qiao.

245
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:18,900
Miss Qiao.

246
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:19,860
Miss Qiao.

247
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,060
Miss Qiao.

248
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:21,900
Miss Qiao.

249
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,740
Miss Qiao.

250
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,020
You came looking for me.

251
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,580
And this 교.

252
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,540
It spilled.

253
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,220
Mr. Li, I've done with습니다

254
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,700
How's my miss going?

255
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,500
Can you open the door now?

256
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,820
Your Majesty, the situation in the Mumen Villa has changed.

257
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,100
Ming Zhu,

258
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,540
do you have the butcher's knife with you?

259
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,100
Corey.

260
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,380
What are you gonna do about it?

261
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,340
The teacher didn't even do it and it doesn't count.

262
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,340
About what?

263
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,340
I miss you.

264
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,340
Li's Mansion

265
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,380
You risked your life for her.

266
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,580
She's injured.

267
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,860
You even risked your life.

268
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,220
Is it worth it?

269
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,220
How is it?

270
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,420
What's going on?

271
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,660
Mr. Li has been keeping the door closed.

272
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,260
Li Lianhua.

273
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,100
We've prepared everything.

274
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,340
Mr. Guan and the others have been given the medicine.

275
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,020
How is it going?

276
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,820
Li Lianhua.

277
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,580
What's going on?

278
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,780
You should tell us.

279
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,620
I don't want them to know

280
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,140
that I can help you.

281
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,980
What are you doing?

282
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,940
What are you doing?

283
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:45,980
Don't come over.

284
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,180
The sound of the enemy's flying...

285
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,220
To make her alive,

286
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,980
she's been locked in the prison for an hour.

287
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,660
Yan Meng will pay for it with his life.

288
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,380
Wan Ming.

289
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,220
She's injured.

290
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,460
Did the enemy's flying dust hurt her?

291
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,340
I'm fine.

292
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,860
It's just a sudden stroke.

293
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:03,980
Go after her.

294
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,060
How could it be sudden?

295
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,980
Come on, sit down.

296
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,500
How is it?

297
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,780
Where's your waist?

298
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,500
It's in the lotus house.

299
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,500
Go get it for me now.

300
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:19,820
Go.

301
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:21,660
Go.

302
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,020
Okay, hang in there.

303
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,060
I'll be right back.

304
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,380
The poison is like a worm.

305
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,100
The poison will eat the head of the stone.

306
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,500
It will start with a short life.

307
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,540
Then it will go in.

308
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,820
It will go crazy.

309
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,580
It will kill you.

310
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,620
Your Majesty.

311
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,300
She's been detoxified.

312
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,740
She just got a sleepwalk.

313
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,540
She's still unconscious.

314
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,060
I didn't expect

315
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,060
Your Majesty to cover for Li Xiangyi.

316
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,220
Li Xiangyi owes me a match.

317
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,700
I can't let her die so easily.

318
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,540
Besides, they're competing.

319
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,940
There's no need to do this.

320
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,060
Jiao Liqiao is behind your action.

321
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,500
He found Li Xiangyi alive.

322
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,700
He wants to lure her to show himself.

323
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,460
Why does Jiao Liqiao care so much

324
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,500
about Li Xiangyi's life?

325
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,500
She and I are not on the same page.

326
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,540
Go back and watch her every move.

327
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,620
Check how many people are still useful

328
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,220
in the Golden Thread Embroidery.

329
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,420
Yes.

330
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:40,620
Yes.

331
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,020
Di Fisheng.

332
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,260
I've brought the person you want.

333
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,700
I just want Wan Ming to be safe.

334
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,460
Her poison has been reduced.

335
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,660
She's very well now.

336
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:10,940
I'm sorry.

337
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,500
I'm sorry.

338
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,580
Xia Yi.

339
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:17,980
Xia Yi.

340
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,300
Here.

341
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,660
This way, please.

342
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,500
He said he was in a state of panic.

343
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,940
I didn't know it would be so scary.

344
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,460
He hasn't woken up after taking the medicine.

345
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,180
The doctor didn't see anything wrong after he finished his examination.

346
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,420
He didn't give him any prescription.

347
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,340
Brother Guan.

348
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,660
Just look at him.

349
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,780
I thought you had a grudge against Su Yuan.

350
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,860
You always targeted him.

351
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,220
Why are you so anxious?

352
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,300
I was fighting with him.

353
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,980
It's more important to me.

354
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:46,940
Brother Guan.

355
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,820
Just look at Brother Li.

356
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,380
I thought you were having a good rest.

357
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,020
But I'm worried about Brother Li.

358
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,500
The pulse is hard to predict.

359
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,060
Why is it so strange?

360
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,980
The pulse is soft and weak.

361
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,300
The blood is running out.

362
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:19,660
There's no way to stop it.

363
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,860
The pulse is not enough.

364
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,060
Not enough for what?

365
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,860
Is it important, Brother Guan?

366
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,540
His heart is not full of qi and blood.

367
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,420
It's an emergency.

368
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,980
He has no life-threatening worries.

369
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,060
He should get rid of his worries and worries.

370
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,060
He can rest in peace.

371
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,100
It's good that he's fine.

372
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,300
I was hit by a heavy heavy dust.

373
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:15,180
Jiali Qiao said that only Yang Zhongman could save me.

374
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:16,780
Then...

375
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,340
The Golden Moon Alliance

376
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,340
is just trying to create a panic

377
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,340
and put pressure on us.

378
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,460
Di Feisheng wants to threaten me with your life.

379
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,060
He wants me to let King of the Silver go after me.

380
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,260
How can a King of the Silver go after you

381
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,460
who is more important than you?

382
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,460
Just give it to him.

383
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,460
Di Feisheng detoxified me.

384
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,140
Of course.

385
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,740
Li Lianhua

386
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,580
claimed to be able to detoxify you.

387
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,740
I believed him

388
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,820
and let him mess around.

389
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,860
I'm just glad that

390
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,100
the Golden Moon Alliance is asking for it.

391
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,780
Except for Di Feisheng,

392
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,100
no one else has the ability.

393
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:56,900
Zhishen,

394
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,300
today is our good day.

395
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,980
I failed to protect you.

396
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,020
I'm fine now.

397
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,620
We knew

398
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,420
the Golden Moon Alliance would come to provoke us.

399
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,180
But...

400
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,780
They designed it

401
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,220
just to kill King of the Silver?

402
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:22,980
Wan Mian,

403
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,780
just now...

404
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,860
I mean,

405
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,980
no matter who the Golden Moon Alliance is or anyone else,

406
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,380
I will never let them

407
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,980
have the chance to get you.

408
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,980
I have something to discuss with Ji Han and the others.

409
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,420
You still need to rest.

410
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,940
I'm here to tell you

411
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,260
that Li Xiangyi

412
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,380
is still alive.

413
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,740
Xiangyi?

414
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,580
Xiangyi?

415
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,740
Yang Zhongman?

416
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,660
I have Yang Zhongman's inner power in my body.

417
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,140
I saw Xiangyi.

418
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,740
Isn't it a dream?

419
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,500
How is that possible?

420
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,820
Your favorite osmanthus cake.

421
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,060
I've been waiting for it for a long time.

422
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,740
You made this rope knot yourself, right?

423
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,340
It's different from others.

424
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,660
You can't untie it.

425
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,260
How come it's

426
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,500
exactly the same?

427
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,140
It's you.

428
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,140
It's you.

429
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,220
I'm so stupid.

430
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,260
You're alive.

431
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,100
You're still alive.

432
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,620
Brother Li.

433
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,380
Are you okay?

434
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:12,940
I'm fine.

435
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,180
I just feel a little dizzy.

436
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,340
I feel much better.

437
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,020
Brother Guan prescribed a prescription.

438
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,340
The prescription is being taken.

439
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,740
Have some water to warm your throat.

440
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,340
I can't drink it for a while.

441
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,220
I'm not thirsty.

442
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,540
I'm really worried about you.

443
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,180
It's not a big deal.

444
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,580
It's not a big deal.

445
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,740
Miss Si, your wound...

446
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,100
It's okay.

447
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,860
Brother Guan said he had a way.

448
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,220
He'll cure me.

449
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,380
Don't worry.

450
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,420
Brother Li.

451
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,220
I received a letter from my grandfather today.

452
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,340
He said the ice and the fingerprint were not found.

453
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,180
But the incense you took

454
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,660
is definitely the men's incense.

455
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,380
The men's incense

456
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,540
is the same as what Miss Zhi Yu said.

457
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,380
This is the second secret of men's incense.

458
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,620
It's the incense made by Wu Xinhua.

459
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,460
It can make people

460
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,980
fall into the illusion of the contract.

461
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,060
Losing the pain and the feeling of being cut by others

462
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,980
and being torn by the skin of people won't struggle.

463
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,100
If you use a large number of men's incense to deal with the martial artists,

464
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,660
you will lose all your martial arts.

465
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,860
Who on earth

466
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,980
put Wu Xinhua on my brother?

467
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,180
It's said that the third king of the Golden Moon Alliance killed my brother.

468
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,940
It doesn't have to be like this.

469
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,020
But the men's incense has been destroyed.

470
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,780
Wu Xinhua is getting less and less.

471
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,580
This incense is quite precious.

472
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,380
Not everyone

473
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,220
can get a large number of men's incense.

474
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,180
By the way, Brother Li.

475
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,580
Speaking of men's incense,

476
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,340
I saw it in the corner of the bridge today.

477
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,900
I found it was painted by men's incense.

478
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,260
I can't make it out.

479
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,500
But I'm sure it's the men's incense.

480
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,140
I heard my grandfather say that.

481
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,420
He must not know that I can hear it clearly.

482
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,300
Otherwise, he would kill me.

483
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,500
The corner of the bridge?

484
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,860
Actually,

485
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,860
my grandfather sent a letter

486
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,180
to ask me to go home.

487
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,260
But Brother Li,

488
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,420
I think...

489
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,140
Actually...

490
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:30,860
Actually, I think...

491
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,700
What do you think?

492
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,260
Such a big thing happened today.

493
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,380
In less than three days,

494
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,900
it will be passed on to Grandpa Su.

495
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,580
Do you still want him to worry about you?

496
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,100
Besides, the wound on your face

497
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,500
is very painful.

498
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,620
I'm afraid that

499
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,100
you can't get out of the wound.

500
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,380
I'm afraid that

501
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,380
you can't get out of the wound.

502
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,860
Besides, the wound on your face

503
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,060
will be healed if you want to recover early.

504
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,420
You can't delay it.

505
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,460
Go back and pack up.

506
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,700
Leave tomorrow morning.

507
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,420
Okay, Brother Li.

508
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,860
I'll come to you

509
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,100
when I'm recovered.

510
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:13,940
Okay.

511
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,460
Brother Li,

512
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,780
this is the jade pendant of our Su family.

513
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,700
If you need anything,

514
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,500
you can blow this pendant

515
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,420
and send me a letter in exchange for my Su family's song.

516
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:31,740
Brother Guan,

517
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,860
is Miss Su's wound

518
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,380
very serious?

519
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,780
What's the matter with you?

520
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,020
I can't get out of the wound

521
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,140
no matter what poison you are poisoned with.

522
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,660
What's your background?

523
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,700
I'm just an ordinary person

524
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,060
who is unlucky.

525
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,140
I cut your pulse

526
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,540
and you can't survive for four months.

527
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,740
Do you know that you won't live long?

528
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,180
It's been less than four months.

529
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,940
Since you know your situation,

530
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,260
you need to annoy Miss Su again

531
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,300
and let her break your heart.

532
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,340
You

533
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,940
can catch his brain

534
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,780
if he gets old.

535
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,300
Everyone,

536
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,140
he consciousness

537
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,060
is about Black Snake.

538
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:34,100
SinceShe's decided to rectify this dance

539
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,580
and my strong body,

540
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,480
two fortresses that they won't spill out?

541
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,120
If we break they will also give more silver.

542
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,000
If we destroy them,

543
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,160
we will get thorough reward of seven battery.

544
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,720
So, I'are the one that holy.

545
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,040
I must be a bad guy.

546
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,700
Who will upload this to 伦 Talent Page?

547
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,100
You!

548
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,860
I must cut you into pieces.

549
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,480
I won't.

550
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,780
I don't really like those kinds of people.

551
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,100
Why don't you rest at this time?

552
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,540
I've been in the army for many years.

553
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,020
I've been waiting for you to save me.

554
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,780
But my poison is from Yangzhou.

555
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,740
What do you think?

556
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:30,860
Miss Qiao.

557
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,020
Your poison is not from my sister.

558
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,180
Di Feisheng gave you this.

559
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,100
Really?

560
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,340
You took the sachet I embroidered for Xiang Yi

561
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,620
and told me that Xiang Yi was dead.

562
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,020
You watched me make the sachet again

563
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,740
and told me to put it down

564
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,220
and move forward without any worries.

565
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,460
Did you do it on purpose?

566
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,940
No.

567
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,300
No.

568
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,240
No matter

569
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,740
how I see it

570
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,060
you do this off.

571
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,540
You said he was dead

572
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,580
and let him show his dead séorama on purpose.

573
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:38,900
like the self-recommended

574
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:41,980
I of everyone

575
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:42,980
with him,

576
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,460
with one move,

577
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,460
with one dream,

578
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,840
no one is better than me

579
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,860
you could cheat others,

580
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,860
you could not me

581
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,020
why are you not turning around

582
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,020
I won't turn around.

583
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,780
Are you still blaming me?

584
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,180
You blame me

585
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,740
for the letter you wrote

586
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,540
before you went to the East Sea, right?

587
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,180
If you want to lie to me,

588
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,740
can you look at me?

589
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:33,940
Xiang Ying,

590
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,740
you still hate me, right?

591
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,380
You were

592
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,420
so stubborn.

593
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,140
How could I not recognize you?

594
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,260
I've waited for you for ten years.

595
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,260
Are you blaming me?

596
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,300
So you'd rather

597
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,620
run away for ten years

598
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,580
than come back

599
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,380
and give me a heartache, right?

600
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,340
A Min,

601
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,700
look at me.

602
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,740
I'm doing pretty well, right?

603
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,180
I see you now

604
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,460
have your own life.

605
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,100
I'm happy for you.

606
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,300
I'm happy for you, too.

607
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,220
Xiang Ying,

608
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,380
why...

609
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,580
Why have you changed so much?

610
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,420
I can't see

611
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,020
your face anymore.

612
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,220
It's only been ten years.

613
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,620
What happened?

614
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,500
When I fell into the sea,

615
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,340
I was just hanging in the ship's cage.

616
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,340
I didn't sink into the sea.

617
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,780
I went back to the Four Ancient Gates

618
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,380
and saw the letter you wrote to me.

619
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,020
Later,

620
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,340
I just wanted to change a magic.

621
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,340
No.

622
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,620
That's not what I meant.

623
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,260
You hate me for separating from you,

624
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,780
so you left?

625
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,940
You just won't forgive me for this.

626
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,500
Don't blame me.

627
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:39,780
Do you remember

628
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,620
your lover's untimely death,

629
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,220
so she died suddenly?

630
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,540
I remember it clearly,

631
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,580
There was never a moment

632
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:55,100
when she was not dying.

633
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,060
But I suddenly remembered

634
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,820
the expense you had spent

635
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,260
I can't chase after him forever.

636
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,260
But how could that be his fault?

637
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,060
Do you know how much I regret it?

638
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,620
These ten years,

639
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,020
I kept dreaming about you.

640
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,620
I dreamed about the moment when you were about to leave the house.

641
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,660
I tried my best to stop you.

642
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,660
But when I woke up,

643
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:19,060
I only knew that all of this was irreparable.

644
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,420
Now that you're back,

645
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,020
why didn't you tell us?

646
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,420
Why didn't you tell us?

647
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,620
Why didn't you tell us?

648
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,820
Why didn't you tell us?

649
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,820
Why didn't you tell us?

650
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,820
Why didn't you tell us?

651
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,220
The past has been so long.

652
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,020
I'm very tired.

653
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,820
I just want to be free.

654
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,420
Then why did you

655
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,020
appear at my wedding?

656
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,420
I promised you that I'd sleep.

657
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,020
I wanted to leave the sweetest candy

658
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,420
to you.

659
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,820
I was

660
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,420
too busy to make you happy.

661
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,220
At least,

662
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,420
I wanted to do that.

663
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,420
If you hadn't told me

664
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,020
that he was dead

665
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,620
at the Putu Temple,

666
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,420
I wouldn't have married Zi Jin.

667
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,620
You're not sad because you married Zi Jin.

668
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,420
You're not regretting marrying Zi Jin.

669
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,220
Xiang Yi,

670
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,020
you're still...

671
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,820
You're still like this.

672
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,220
You killed someone with a single word.

673
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,820
A-Ming,

674
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,020
you like Zi Jin.

675
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:59,020
It's not wrong to rely on Zi Jin.

676
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,220
Not loving someone alone

677
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,220
is not something you should blame yourself for.

678
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,820
Then you...

679
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,420
Don't you hate me?

680
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,420
I do.

681
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,420
I used to hate you.

682
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,820
In the past,

683
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,420
I hated everyone.

684
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,620
Later, I realized

685
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,020
that it was my own problem.

686
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,220
I was too selfish.

687
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,420
I was also selfish.

688
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,620
Why should I

689
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,820
try to avoid

690
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,020
and not forget Xiang Yi?

691
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,220
A-Ming,

692
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,420
we knew each other.

693
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,020
I was

694
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,620
ignorant at that time.

695
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,020
I didn't understand our feelings.

696
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,020
What was it?

697
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,420
What do you mean?

698
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,620
What do you mean?

699
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,220
You mean

700
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,620
you never loved me?

701
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,220
We were young at that time.

702
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,820
We couldn't do anything.

703
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,820
A-Ming,

704
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,020
life is over.

705
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,020
We are not young anymore.

706
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,220
Forget about it.

707
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,420
Forget about it.

708
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,020
I saved you

709
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,020
because of my friend's feelings.

710
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,620
Don't misunderstand.

711
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,220
You also know that

712
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,420
the thing I hate the most

713
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,820
is being involved in many things.

714
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,220
Now, the world is vast.

715
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,820
It's my life

716
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,820
that I want to live freely.

717
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,620
I also want to trouble you

718
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,220
not to let others know that I'm still alive.

719
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,220
I sincerely hope

720
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,620
you and Zi Jin

721
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,620
can grow old together

722
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,020
and live a long life.

723
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,420
Ten years is not enough.

724
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,020
Don't you have anything else to say to me?

725
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,620
So what?

726
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,020
Ten years is too long.

727
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,820
A-Ming,

728
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,220
today,

729
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,020
we should say goodbye

730
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,620
and live the life you want to live.

731
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,220
Okay.

732
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:55,820
Okay.

733
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,620
Let me ask you again.

734
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,620
Will Li Xiang Yi

735
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,220
really not come back?

736
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,220
He won't come back.

737
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,020
Why did you come in such a pl feet like this?

738
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,960
P mittens stop the blood from evenlyicia

739
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,220
and turn into the body.

740
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,500
You like candy this much.

741
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,700
You really don't look like a hero.

742
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,400
Who said hero can't eat

743
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:51,820
candy?

744
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:52,620
By then,

745
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,020
I'll have some soy bean.

746
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,020
Is it good?

747
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,220
It's good.

748
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,620
Then have another one.

749
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,020
You're busy with such big things every day.

750
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,420
You always make me look at your back.

751
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,820
I'm really tired.

752
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,820
It seems that something really happened to Fei Ying Gang.

753
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:29,020
A Mian, I'll go out for a while.

754
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,020
Oh, right, A Mian.

755
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,420
What did you say just now?

756
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,420
Forget it.

757
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,020
Let's talk about it when I come back.

758
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,020
The sky is still clear.

759
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,020
I can't keep you.

760
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,020
A Mian is a shadow.

761
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,420
I'm tired.

762
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:56,620
But I can't walk with you.

763
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,620
I can't love you like before.

764
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,220
With this heart,

765
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,620
I'll say goodbye to you.

766
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,220
I wish you a long life,

767
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,420
though you have no friends,

768
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,420
and return what you wished for.

769
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,820
A Mian.

770
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,020
A Mian.

771
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,220
You're hiding from everyone.

772
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:31,620
I really don't understand

773
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,420
your indisputable stubbornness.

774
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,220
You scared me.

775
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,620
It's late at night.

776
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,220
Why don't you go to the main gate?

777
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:41,020
Since everyone chose their own way,

778
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,420
why bother?

779
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,620
I don't understand.

780
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,220
But I respect your persistence.

781
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,220
No need, Chief Di.

782
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,820
Just don't argue with me.

783
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:58,620
OK,ffein.

784
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:23,220
But you're always so bright and bright.

785
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,580
But you don't like to be honest.

786
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,740
I just want to confirm it.

787
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,460
Compared to before, you're much more cunning.

788
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,260
You're trying to cover up for me.

789
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,020
I owe you a favor.

790
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:42,460
Why did you bring him here?

791
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:46,380
Didn't you always blame me for killing your senior?

792
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,140
Master asked me to come

793
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:50,780
to explain to Sect Leader Li that

794
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,020
ten years ago,

795
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,060
Emperor Yan, Prince Bai, and the four Qing Zun

796
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,620
received the contract of the Shanku Sword.

797
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,700
We didn't believe it.

798
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,940
But when we arrived at the battle,

799
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,780
we found out that the Shanku Sword was dead.

800
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:06,860
Senior asked about the contract.
