00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm not afraid of death.

72
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm not afraid of death.

73
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm not afraid of death.

74
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The End

75
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Wan Mian

76
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I wanted to give you a surprise.

77
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I didn't expect she would bump into me.

78
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I chose all the flowers for you.

79
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Do you like them?

80
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Zijin

81
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Did you hear about Li Xiangyi's comments?

82
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's just some rumors.

83
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But about her

84
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
you're always nervous.

85
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I've checked.

86
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Those rumors were spread on purpose.

87
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You're suspecting me.

88
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I have no feelings for Xiangyi.

89
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
She's just a friend.

90
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
In the past ten years,

91
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
you were the only one by my side.

92
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Why don't you believe me?

93
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I've been re-established in the Si Gu Sect.

94
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You never helped me with my business.

95
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But Li Xiangyi's rumors

96
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
are spreading.

97
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But you rushed to me.

98
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You have no feelings for her.

99
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You only care about her.

100
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I didn't come to the Yi clan

101
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
because you were the first to establish the Si Gu Sect.

102
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm the old man of the Si Gu Sect.

103
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
If I were there, I'm afraid you would be worried.

104
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
How could you be so narrow-minded?

105
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Narrow-minded?

106
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
She established the Si Gu Sect.

107
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I rebuilt the Si Gu Sect.

108
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
She's the sect leader. I'm also the sect leader.

109
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I don't understand why I'm always not as good as her

110
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
in your heart.

111
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Zi Jin.

112
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We're all tired.

113
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We should calm down

114
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
and think about why we're at this point.

115
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What do you mean?

116
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I thought

117
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
you rebuilt the Si Gu Sect

118
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
just to return Wulin a peace.

119
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But I didn't expect what you wanted

120
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
was just a battle gift.

121
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The problem between us is never her.

122
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's you.

123
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You said I couldn't let her go.

124
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But the one who really can't let her go

125
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
is you.

126
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Wan Mian.

127
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Li Xiang Yi.

128
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Why are you always so restless?

129
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Why are you always so restless?

130
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I want to show the whole world

131
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
what you really are.

132
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Fang Xiang Bao.

133
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What are you doing?

134
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Come on.

135
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Take a good look.

136
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
These are all the paintings I collected before.

137
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm going to find an exhibition hall

138
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
to show the paintings.

139
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'll wait for Yulou Village to find the door.

140
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Fang Xiang Bao.

141
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What's so special about these paintings?

142
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
These paintings

143
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
are all made by the Wulin family.

144
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The people of the Si Gu Sect

145
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
will all have their own martial arts.

146
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
These paintings

147
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
are like a real martial arts secret book.

148
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
If Yulou Village hears them,

149
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
won't they be curious?

150
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I can't stand it.

151
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You're a man of your word.

152
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
If you pick three more paintings,

153
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'll make you sell them all.

154
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Hey, Fang Dou Bing.

155
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Are you talking nonsense?

156
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You asked me to print so many flyers.

157
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Is it useful?

158
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Don't worry.

159
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Soon the whole city will know

160
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
how much I've paid.

161
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What's this?

162
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It seems to be a flyer sent by someone else in the city.

163
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's mixed together.

164
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Si Gu Tea Party?

165
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Xiao Zi Jin is really selfish.

166
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
He just became the leader

167
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
and learned my master to hold a Si Gu Tea Party.

168
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I just read it.

169
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It says that

170
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
the Shan Gu knife was killed by Li Xiang Yi.

171
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And they're asking people in the martial arts world

172
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
to go to the Si Gu Tea Party to make a complaint.

173
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Is that true?

174
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I know it's a mess.

175
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Why bother to make a fuss?

176
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Besides,

177
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
your master has been dead for ten years.

178
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
He can't hear anything with his eyes closed.

179
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The most important thing now

180
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
is to find Yulou Village.

181
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I can hear it.

182
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Don't try to make a mess on my master.

183
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
No.

184
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I have to go to meet him

185
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
and see what tricks he wants to play.

186
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Don't leave my dinner.

187
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Let's go in and have some tea.

188
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's a one-man thing.

189
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Okay.

190
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The ten years of the Si Gu Gate have been passed.

191
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's been a new day.

192
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Today,

193
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm holding a tea party

194
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
to wish you all

195
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
can remember the past.

196
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And have more fun in the future.

197
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yes.

198
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The great master forced the second master to die.

199
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
We should have more fun.

200
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Exactly.

201
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Who's teaching the song?

202
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Stop.

203
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You're trying to kill me.

204
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
But I'm afraid it's not enough to kill me.

205
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Now Li Xiang Yi forced to die for the Shan Gu knife.

206
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Everyone knows about the Shan Gu knife.

207
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yes.

208
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The Si Gu Gate didn't want to deal with

209
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
such rumors.

210
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Why?

211
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
They are getting worse.

212
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So today's tea party

213
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
is to make these rumors

214
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
clear and clear.

215
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
To prove the people's hearts.

216
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
What do you mean?

217
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I know that

218
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
the Golden Abyss Alliance was unstoppable.

219
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The master of the Shan Gate

220
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
united the seven big clans of Jiangnan

221
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
to cut the financial path of the Golden Abyss Alliance.

222
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But I didn't expect that

223
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
the master of the Li Gate

224
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
would leave the Cao Gang overnight.

225
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The master of the Shan Gate

226
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
is in a bad mood.

227
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
When I was in the Cao Gang,

228
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I heard it myself.

229
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Why?

230
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yes.

231
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Isn't it simple?

232
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You know that

233
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
before Li Xiang Yi and the Shan Gu knife

234
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
entered the Shemue Gate,

235
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
it was Qi Er.

236
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Li Xiang Yi was begging on the street.

237
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The whole village was

238
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
seen by the Shan Gu knife.

239
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
How could the one who

240
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
was the only one in the world

241
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
not want to kill him?

242
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Senior.

243
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Bullshit.

244
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's so dirty.

245
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Where did the lonely ghost come from?

246
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Tell me the truth.

247
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yes.

248
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Who are you?

249
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Grandpa is the four-tree sect.

250
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The four tigers and the silver spear.

251
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The bull is like a gold.

252
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The bull is like a gold?

253
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's not like that.

254
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I can't believe it.

255
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:46,260
You are the

256
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,260
Li's wife.

257
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,260
Liu Jiang Chuan, Jiang Hua, Xu Yi.

258
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,260
You three owe hundreds of taels of gambling debt.

259
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,260
You even came to the Four Valley Tea Party.

260
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,260
You are really shameless.

261
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,260
Who are you?

262
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,260
The detective of the Bai Chuan Court.

263
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,260
Li Xiang Yi's apprentice.

264
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,260
Fang Duo Bing.

265
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,260
Well said.

266
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,260
The gamblers and thieves can't be trusted.

267
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,260
What about me?

268
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,260
He Zhang.

269
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,260
He Zhang.

270
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,260
He Zhang.

271
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,260
As the leader of the four tigers and silver spear,

272
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,260
I can't believe what I said.

273
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,260
Kid.

274
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,260
You just called Li Xiang Yi's name unfairly.

275
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,260
You should know his handwriting.

276
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,260
This letter is Li Xiang Yi's secret order.

277
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,260
In the letter, he ordered the Shan Gu knife

278
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,260
to go to the Yangsha Valley alone.

279
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,260
And the Yangsha Valley is the secret shrine of the Golden Abyss Alliance.

280
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,260
So the Shan Gu knife was killed by the fourth king.

281
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,260
It's a secret.

282
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,260
How could my master know?

283
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,260
It's just a coincidence.

284
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,260
I told Li Xiang Yi about this.

285
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,260
If he didn't mean to harm us,

286
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,260
how could he let the Shan Gu knife die?

287
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,260
You just want to frame Li Xiang Yi.

288
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,260
You really don't believe what you said?

289
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,260
I have more evidence.

290
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,260
Master Xiao.

291
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:30,260
Where is the Qing Shi chessboard in the Shan Gu knife yard?

292
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,260
It's still in his room.

293
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,260
It's sealed.

294
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,260
Please send someone to lift it.

295
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,260
What's this?

296
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,260
The Emperor's seal?

297
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,260
The letter from the court.

298
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,260
The letter from the court?

299
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,260
Yes.

300
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,260
It's the letter from the court.

301
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,260
Li Xiang Yi refused to accept the letter from the court.

302
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,260
So the court wrote a secret letter to the Shan Gu knife.

303
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,260
It asked the Shan Gu knife to replace Li Xiang Yi's position

304
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,260
and be the head of the Si Gu Sect.

305
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,260
The head of the Si Gu Sect didn't agree.

306
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,260
So he sealed the letter in the Qing Shi chessboard.

307
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,260
But this kind of thing

308
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,260
is not allowed to happen.

309
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,260
So he came up with a brilliant idea.

310
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:17,260
Li Xiang Yi wanted to destroy the deal with the Golden Abyss Alliance

311
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,260
and unify the world.

312
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,260
But he's a righteous sect leader.

313
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,260
He's not good at leading the war.

314
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,260
So he asked the sect leader to die.

315
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,260
He wanted to destroy the Golden Abyss Alliance

316
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,260
with this as a big step forward.

317
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,260
If his plan was successful,

318
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,260
he would have been able to destroy the sect.

319
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,260
But it's a pity that the heaven is blind.

320
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,260
It's better to be a man than a god.

321
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,260
Liu Ru Jin, let me ask you.

322
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,260
That night, when the sect leader went to the banquet,

323
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,260
we were both there.

324
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:58,260
Did you hear the fight between him and Li Xiang Yi?

325
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:04,260
I heard that the sect leader was killed by the sect leader.

326
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,260
I heard the fight between Li Xiang Yi and Li Xiang Yi.

327
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,260
What's wrong?

328
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:16,260
You dare not say it now?

329
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,260
Why not?

330
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:25,260
I did hear them fight over the court.

331
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,260
Xiang Yi, do you think

332
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,260
what you said is always right and the truth?

333
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,260
Yes.

334
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:41,260
No one can be in the Four Ancient Sects.

335
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:46,260
Without Li Xiang Yi, it's not possible.

336
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,260
Why did I keep it a secret for ten years?

337
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,260
Because Li Xiang Yi's reputation is too high.

338
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,260
I'm innocent.

339
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,260
Today, at the Four Ancient Sects' tea party,

340
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,260
I, He Zhang, ask the sect leader

341
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:11,260
to move Li Xiang Yi's position out of the World's Eagle Festival Hall.

342
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,260
I dare to do it.

343
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,260
If he dares to kill his own brother,

344
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,260
I will let him die.

345
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,260
I want Li Xiang Yi to get out of the World's Eagle Festival Hall.

346
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,260
Get out of the World's Eagle Festival Hall.

347
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,260
Get out of the World's Eagle Festival Hall.

348
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,260
I'll see who dares to touch the sect leader's position.

349
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,260
I'll see who dares to touch the sect leader's position.

350
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,260
I'll see who moves the head.

351
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,260
A group of people are in the dark.

352
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,260
The Four Ancient Sects were created by Li Xiang Yi.

353
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,260
I'll see who dares to do it.

354
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,260
How dare you!

355
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,260
What do you think this place is?

356
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,260
Although the Four Ancient Sects rebuilt,

357
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,260
I bought this place ten years ago.

358
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,260
It's part of my Mu Mian Villa.

359
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,260
I didn't invite you all.

360
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,260
I also never agreed to let you use it.

361
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,260
If you all come to drink a cup of tea,

362
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,260
I welcome you.

363
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,260
But if you humiliate the previous sect leader here,

364
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,260
don't blame me for making a bamboo guest order.

365
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,260
Sorry, everyone.

366
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,260
Let's go.

367
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,260
He Zhang,

368
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,260
you came at the right time.

369
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:35,260
Miss Qiao, you're late.

370
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,260
Young Hero Feng,

371
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,260
this is a complicated matter.

372
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,260
It's not like what they said.

373
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,260
Of course.

374
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,260
I've always believed in Li Xiang Yi.

375
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,260
Thank you for today, young lady.

376
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,260
I'll take my leave.

377
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,260
You arranged all this.

378
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,260
What are you talking about?

379
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:16,260
This chess board has long been missing in Shang Gu Dao's room.

380
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,260
You brought it back on purpose.

381
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,260
That's right.

382
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,260
To blackmail him,

383
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,260
you did such a thing.

384
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,260
I just threw a game

385
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,260
and attracted so many people's attention.

386
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,260
There are so many people who hate Li Xiang Yi.

387
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,260
Do they hate me too?

388
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,260
I thought it would take some time.

389
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,260
You can finally let it go.

390
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,260
I was wrong.

391
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,260
Our marriage...

392
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,260
Let's not talk about it.

393
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,260
I can't live

394
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,260
the rest of my life

395
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,260
with this knot in my heart.

396
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,260
A Mian!

397
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,260
What's going on?

398
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,260
A Mian!

399
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,260
What's going on?

400
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,260
Wait for me.

401
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,260
I'm going to the bathroom.

402
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,260
Wait for me.

403
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,260
The bathroom is on the left.

404
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,260
Don't be afraid.

405
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,260
I won't disturb you.

406
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,260
I'll be back soon.

407
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,260
I'll be back.

408
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,260
I'll be back.

409
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,260
I won't disturb you.

410
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,260
Drink some.

411
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,540
It'll help you to get rid of the thirst.

412
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,940
I'm sorry.

413
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:58,860
A Min.

414
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,260
You didn't do anything wrong.

415
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,060
Why are you apologizing?

416
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,100
Besides,

417
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,020
about the Shhanhudao,

418
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,140
Li Xiangyi is also responsible.

419
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,380
But those rumors were from Zi Jin.

420
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,180
I tried to persuade him.

421
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,260
But he was really upset with the past.

422
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,380
That means he cares about me.

423
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,180
A Min.

424
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,940
It's better than not solving the problem

425
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,820
and not thinking about it.

426
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,700
I shouldn't have come to you.

427
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,180
I came here

428
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,900
to ask you to forgive me.

429
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,540
For the past relationship,

430
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,460
I forgive him for being muddled.

431
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,060
Li Xiangyi is gone.

432
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,940
Li Lianhua

433
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,860
doesn't care about it.

434
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,380
Then,

435
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,060
can you promise me

436
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,820
not to break your promise to Zi Jin?

437
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:01,980
Okay.

438
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,180
I promise you.

439
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,180
Thank you.

440
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,740
I remember the last time I begged him

441
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,220
was 14 years ago.

442
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,380
I begged the Sword Demon

443
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,900
to let him promise to be lenient for a year

444
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,780
and then compete with Li Xiangyi.

445
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,300
Yes.

446
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,340
A year later,

447
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,140
Li Xiangyi succeeded in building the Sword Tree.

448
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,060
He won the Sword Demon

449
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,540
and became the best in the world.

450
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,620
The best in the world?

451
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,540
Time

452
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,140
really flies.

453
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:53,900
Yes.

454
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,220
It flies.

455
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,580
You think it over?

456
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,220
Fei,

457
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,860
are you being polite?

458
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:16,820
Am I?

459
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,780
No.

460
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,140
You like to practice it.

461
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,900
I'll help you tie it back

462
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,340
and exchange it for a secret of my birth.

463
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:27,940
I'm sorry.

464
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,820
I'm sorry.

465
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,820
I'm sorry.

466
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,820
I'm sorry.

467
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,820
I'm sorry.

468
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,820
I'm sorry.

469
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,820
I'm sorry.

470
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,820
I'm sorry.

471
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,820
I'm sorry.

472
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,820
I'm sorry.

473
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,820
I'm sorry.

474
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,820
I'm sorry.

475
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,500
I don't know if you believe it or not.

476
00:19:41,500 --> 00:20:01,820
You

477
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,460
Don't do that kind of nonsense anymore.

478
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,540
Let me tell you.

479
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,580
So I dare not admit it.

480
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,180
What nonsense are you talking about?

481
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,620
Tell me a secret of your life.

482
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,220
What for?

483
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,780
Or I'll go to Xiao Zijing

484
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,580
and tell her that you have a crush on her.

485
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,420
You're so unreasonable.

486
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,140
Will you tell her or not?

487
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:23,700
Okay.

488
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:25,820
Then I'll tell her.

489
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,540
Actually,

490
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,180
your amnesia

491
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,220
was caused by the person you trust.

492
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,460
I trust you, not you.

493
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,620
Then there must be someone else

494
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,660
besides me.

495
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,580
Who?

496
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,420
I'm afraid you don't know it now.

497
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,180
But I tell you,

498
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,460
the person who can harm you

499
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,460
with your martial arts

500
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,060
is the person around you.

501
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:49,660
Lin Lianhua.

502
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:50,820
Oh, no.

503
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,300
What's wrong?

504
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,220
Fang Dengbin.

505
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,060
He...

506
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:53,860
He's crazy.

507
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,100
Let's go.

508
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,020
Fang Xiao Bao.

509
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:06,980
Stop.

510
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,980
Stop it.

511
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,500
Stop it.

512
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,780
I've inquired of the room

513
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,700
where the Hospital Registration ちがелиの法官。

514
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,420
Here.

515
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,540
Take the medicine.

516
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,060
Drink up.

517
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,420
Are you ill?

518
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,700
I'm ill?

519
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,060
I've searched all the nearby areas.

520
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,540
I got all the side area medicine and it's here.

521
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:27,700
It's here.

522
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,840
I've checked the whole place.

523
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,100
There are only so many cakes.

524
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:31,680
No.

525
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:32,820
We were told

526
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,100
I've brought the medicine.

527
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,380
You must drink it today.

528
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,180
Drink it.

529
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,500
You're sick.

530
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,420
You...

531
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,660
Fei,

532
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,260
don't blame Fang Duo for being sick.

533
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,260
Although he's a bit abnormal today,

534
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,020
the medicine he bought is really good.

535
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:58,980
Wang Jia Bao,

536
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,060
I know you're kind,

537
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,020
but Fei

538
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,100
is not a divorcee.

539
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,380
Drinking medicine is useless.

540
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,580
If you really want to help him,

541
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,540
you have to think of other ways.

542
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,100
Got it?

543
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,060
I don't want to help him.

544
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:09,940
I...

545
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,980
I just want to remind him

546
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,540
what happened ten years ago.

547
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,180
Move.

548
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:36,580
The King's Avatar

549
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,580
Tang Jia Bao,

550
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,340
you don't even eat dinner.

551
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,220
You should go to the tea party

552
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,740
and listen to the gossip.

553
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,140
The food is so delicious.

554
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,780
And the good wine from the town.

555
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,060
It's so delicious.

556
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,540
Okay.

557
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,220
If you don't want to eat,

558
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,420
I'll do it myself.

559
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,780
I'm flattered.

560
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,300
Are you telling the truth?

561
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,260
What... What?

562
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,980
You're my master.

563
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,180
You're kind.

564
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,260
You're like a brother.

565
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,100
Is it true?

566
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,580
Yes.

567
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,420
Will he...

568
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,620
Love your father?

569
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,380
I didn't say that.

570
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:45,780
No, Fang Jia Bao,

571
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,980
think about it.

572
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,180
Your father

573
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,540
forced you to marry a princess.

574
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,580
Your mother

575
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,620
cut your money.

576
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:52,820
Then I ask you,

577
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,500
will you hate them?

578
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:56,980
Of course not.

579
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,260
Then it's over.

580
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,260
Li Xiang Yu and Shan Mu Dao

581
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,780
are brothers and family.

582
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,260
There are some contradictions.

583
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,100
But it's not like

584
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,540
he killed his family

585
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,060
for this.

586
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,740
Do you know

587
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,420
what is

588
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,020
Li Xiang Yu's favorite poem?

589
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,980
The nine-year-old is good at finding the common debt.

590
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,700
The sword is not empty, the play is broken.

591
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,420
There are so many things

592
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,220
that are not worth it.

593
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,660
What's worth it

594
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,780
is just a few things.

595
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,940
Li Xiang Yu

596
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,300
will not waste time

597
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,300
on these boring games.

598
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,300
That's right.

599
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,020
My master won't waste his time.

600
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,820
Why should I be so picky?

601
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,420
I was too narrow-minded.

602
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,780
That's right.

603
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,220
Li Lian Hua,

604
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,140
do you think my master

605
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,420
might have hidden himself?

606
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,500
What's wrong?

607
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,780
Because I still think

608
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,820
Yuan Bao Mountain Village's

609
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,180
white-clad hero is strange.

610
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,780
Since Di Fei Sheng is not dead,

611
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,700
maybe my master is still alive.

612
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,740
No, Fang Yan Bo,

613
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,740
are you having a fever?

614
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,940
How is that possible?

615
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,140
He is a person

616
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,060
who loves beauty and is generous.

617
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:19,380
You...

618
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:19,940
How can he

619
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,060
live ten years

620
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,020
secretly?

621
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,940
He doesn't have the same style and character.

622
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,500
That's right.

623
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:27,460
My master

624
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,660
can't be so ungrateful.

625
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,340
He won't show up

626
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,620
even if he sees someone he loves.

627
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:41,940
Drink it up.

628
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,260
What?

629
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,020
You're drinking it up.

630
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,220
Are you waiting for me to die?

631
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:48,660
To be honest,

632
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,100
my father and my master

633
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,940
are both suspicious

634
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:52,740
because they have the wrong name.

635
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:53,860
I don't want us

636
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,740
to repeat the same mistake.

637
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:55,620
Here.

638
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:56,980
Drink it up.

639
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,180
From now on, you're not to be seen.

640
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,500
Fei is a drinker.

641
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,620
I'll get him.

642
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:07,620
Fei?

643
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,540
Li Liehua,

644
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,220
you haven't had this yet.

645
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,500
Fang Xiao Meng,

646
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,780
there are so many calligraphy works.

647
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,900
Are you going to move them to the town?

648
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,660
The more calligraphy works,

649
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,620
the bigger the city will be.

650
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,460
Only Yulou Chuan can notice it.

651
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,780
What are you waiting for?

652
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,740
Help me move them.

653
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,500
How about this?

654
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,620
Well,

655
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,740
I'll give you an idea.

656
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,420
How about you ask Fei

657
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:42,980
to go to Man Yi?

658
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,260
He might come faster than you.

659
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:45,780
Him?

660
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,220
There's a letter from Fang Lan.

661
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:48,980
Whose letter?

662
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:50,980
Yulou Chuan's.

663
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,900
The exhibition hasn't been held yet.

664
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,860
Why did the letter come?

665
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,660
It seems that we want to find them.

666
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,260
They want to find us too.

667
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,260
Weiwei,

668
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,140
is it a rental car or an old car?

669
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:18,660
A flower.

670
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:26,980
Dear guests,

671
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,340
the carriage is ready.

672
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,380
Please get in.

673
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,860
Why are there three carriages?

674
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,340
Xiaoyou,

675
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,020
you and Fei each get one.

676
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,220
I'll get one for Xiaobao.

677
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,180
Go.

678
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:55,780
Go.

679
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:56,820
Go.

680
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:57,380
Go.

681
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:57,860
Go.

682
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,500
It's strange.

683
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,500
Why didn't they come with the carriage?

684
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,780
It's natural.

685
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,540
The smell of the water is so fragrant.

686
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,300
Let's sleep for a while.

687
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,020
Go.

688
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:53,940
Go.

689
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,220
Go.

690
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,180
Why did I fall asleep?

691
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,060
You're awake.

692
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,180
Why are you half-asleep?

693
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,260
I'm half-asleep.

694
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,460
You're half-asleep?

695
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,380
I'm half-asleep.

696
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,860
I'm half-asleep.

697
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,820
You're half-asleep?

698
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,380
Where are we going?

699
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,220
It looks so familiar.

700
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,660
I don't know either.

701
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,500
Why are you sleeping so long?

702
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,940
The carriage was muddled.

703
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,780
It seems that Yulou Spring

704
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,300
doesn't want people to know

705
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,900
where Mai Shanhu is.

706
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,540
Sir,

707
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,660
we're almost there.

708
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,580
Please change the porridge later.

709
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,180
Where are my friends?

710
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,220
Our master only sees

711
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,500
the guests who received the invitation.

712
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,540
I'm here.

713
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,340
Please wait a moment.

714
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,620
We're here to invite the guests.

715
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,860
Please stay here.

716
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,980
We're waiting for you.

717
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,180
When Mai Shanhu is over,

718
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,460
we'll send you back.

719
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,980
You're good at making decisions.

720
00:29:59,220 --> 00:29:59,780
Fine.

721
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,540
I'll follow you

722
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,980
when you come.

723
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,240
☺

724
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,620
Foundation to field

725
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,980
were changed three times.

726
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,580
Past events stood out.

727
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,700
When I realized

728
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,700
is a long journey.

729
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,340
He's so careful.

730
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,660
No wonder no one knows

731
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,860
where the Yulou Village is.

732
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,180
That's funny.

733
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,580
No one has picked me up

734
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,620
for the whole day.

735
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,820
Can't you wait for me?

736
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:03,860
Is anyone here?

737
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,460
You're no match for him.

738
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,060
You little rascal.

739
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,580
If you hadn't stopped me,

740
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,860
I would've flown over.

741
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:22,740
Hello,

742
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,020
friend.

743
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,340
Are you also

744
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,580
attending the Manchurian Red?

745
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,220
So rude.

746
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,700
Who is he?

747
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,060
You said

748
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,980
the people in Yulou Village are all strange.

749
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:49,740
I...

750
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,820
Are you okay, brother?

751
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,420
I...

752
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,140
I'm about to vomit.

753
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,540
God of War?

754
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,020
A benefactor?

755
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,620
Senior Wenjue.

756
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,540
Long time no see.

757
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,420
You're the one

758
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,660
who was killed by Li Lianhua

759
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,740
for the sake of the public.

760
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,020
You're the one who saved Young Master Tie Xiaomeng.

761
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,300
That's me.

762
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,620
Why are you here?

763
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,660
At about seven years old,

764
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,700
you can create a genius with divine power.

765
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,140
But you can't pass the exam.

766
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,580
Isn't that strange?

767
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,660
People say that

768
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,060
a scholar with white face

769
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,220
looks like a man with a face like a bag.

770
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,860
But he doesn't look like a scholar at all.

771
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,660
He's reading

772
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,180
while playing the piano.

773
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,060
How do you say it?

774
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,860
An intern who learns from his son.

775
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,140
He's not easy to fool.

776
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:36,780
You know what?

777
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,100
You can't pass the exam.

778
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,420
You're involved.

779
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:41,700
Brother,

780
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,980
are you also here to enjoy the red leaves?

781
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,740
It seems that you're dressed as Young Master Fang.

782
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,420
You're really good at joking.

783
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:52,100
You're here to enjoy the red leaves.

784
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,340
How can you be a red leaf?

785
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,820
Red leaves.

786
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:55,740
Red leaves.

787
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,620
Gentlemen,

788
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,100
let's hurry up.

789
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,660
We can't catch up if we're late.

790
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,980
There are high mountains and water around here.

791
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,100
The mountains are covered with walls.

792
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,980
No wonder no one has found out

793
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,420
where the Jade Tower City is for so long.

794
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,380
Doctor Li,

795
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,220
Young Master Fang is here.

796
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,700
I've been waiting for you.

797
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,060
You're the legendary Li Lian Hua?

798
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,580
Yes.

799
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,980
I'm here.

800
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:01,020
The so-called medicine that can make you feel better.

801
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,580
Nice to meet you.

802
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,140
I'm Wen Mo from the Li's Mansion.

803
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,300
My friends in the martial arts world

804
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,180
call me Master Yi.

805
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,620
I'm so happy to meet you today.

806
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,820
I'd like to recite a poem.

807
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,380
´ embarrassing.

808
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,620
Miao.

809
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,020
Xiu Zhe.

810
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,820
This.

811
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,820
A one-write poem Competing with another one.

812
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,500
It should be unusual.

813
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,900
The poem is interesting.

814
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,080
The frameless goals are difficult to be traced.

815
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,240
This is the young master of Tianji Villa,

816
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,240
who is with the doctor Li of Changtong.

817
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,240
He is sick, right?

818
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,840
Tianji Villa belongs to my mother.

819
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,920
It has nothing to do with me.

820
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,440
I'm a criminal in the Baichuan Courtyard.

821
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,640
I heard that the Fang family can be defeated.

822
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,800
Today, I met you.

823
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,560
You are really a talent.

824
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,840
I'm Leng Jian, Dong Fang Hao.

825
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,840
I didn't sleep well last night.

826
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,200
It's you.

827
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
I'm fine.

828
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,800
The one who drinks is

829
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,200
the hero of the wine and sword-picking.

830
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,760
He is a master of martial arts.

831
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,160
The one by the cliff is

832
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,440
Mr. Murong Yao.

833
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,680
He is from Yueqian.

834
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,480
He came to the Central Plains for several years

835
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,480
and made the capital with his martial arts skills.

836
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,240
He is known as the Martial Demon.

837
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,400
Everyone,

838
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,680
they are all important guests of my master.

839
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,800
I don't care if they are important guests.

840
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,040
It's more important to let us in.

841
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,160
The rules of the Manchurian Courtyard

842
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,200
are not allowed to bring any foreign goods in.

843
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,720
Please leave your belongings here.

844
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,400
We will take care of them for you.

845
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,040
It's so troublesome to drink.

846
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,400
Should I throw the gift

847
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,520
I brought to your master?

848
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,560
Of course not.

849
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
But the gift

850
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,280
should be presented to master

851
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,640
after we have tasted it.

852
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,800
Brother Lu,

853
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,480
it's useless to bring the ice in.

854
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,800
You'd better stay.

855
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,360
You are right.

856
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,240
Aren't you busy

857
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,600
with the things inside?

858
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,680
I just came to taste the wine.

859
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,680
I don't have time for your nonsense.

860
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,320
I don't have ice.

861
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,560
The gift

862
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,120
should have been delivered earlier.

863
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:29,840
Right.

864
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,400
Mr. Murong's gift

865
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,640
will arrive a few months earlier.

866
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,400
Please wait a moment.

867
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,920
We need to prepare the gift.

868
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,640
By the way, Fang Jingbao.

869
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,960
You must have prepared the gift.

870
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,240
This is the Yeming Pearl.

871
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,360
It's for you.

872
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,200
It's a special invitation from master.

873
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,200
You don't need to prepare it.

874
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,240
Mr. Fang,

875
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,120
you've paid for it.

876
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,480
I'll take it back.

877
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,800
You're good.

878
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,560
You even hid the Yeming Pearl.

879
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,880
I'll hide the valuable things, okay?

880
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,360
Everyone,

881
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,000
choose a rose before entering the house.

882
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,000
If you choose a rose

883
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,040
as the entrance tone

884
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,200

00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,160

Isn't it?

888

The maids and guests

889
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,080
used them aslings these Musapna Roses.

890
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,760
Let's go.

891
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,640
Zhai Xing?

892
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,640
Don't worry.

893
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,440
Mr. Murong, don't worry.

894
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,000
Master has ordered

895
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,440

No, I'll wait for you.

899
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,800
Mr. Fang, it's your turn.

900
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:30,880
I'm thinking about it.

901
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,360
You may go.

902
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,880
Well, since you asked me

903
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,040
to wait, please.

904
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,060
Get to the bottom, listen to her.

905
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,060
Well,

906
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:43,800

908
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,400

Thanks.

910
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,540
Wait,

911
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,800
the girl who is фотографied

912
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,200
Maybe some girl made a mistake.

913
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,960
I'll change it for you later.

914
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,600
No need.

915
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,720
Just this one.

916
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,240
Please come in.

917
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,040
Li Lianhua.

918
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,160
The house in Yulou Village

919
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,480
is not a serious place.

920
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,720
What are you afraid of?

921
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,800
The house is just

922
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,320
a little bit more for girls.

923
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:28,800
I...

924
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,600
I'm not afraid.

925
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,200
I'm afraid

926
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,000
it'll be a big trouble for me.

927
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,280
I thought too much.

928
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,360
You're so well-mannered.

929
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:40,920
You're really

930
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,120
handsome.

931
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,400
How about I give you an idea?

932
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,200
Just take a picture

933
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,120
and put it on your face.

934
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:46,960
That's it.

935
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,360
Don't be ridiculous.

936
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,440
Let's go.

937
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,760
In the house,

938
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,160
except for the owner and the guest,

939
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,560
no other men are allowed to enter.

940
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,800
I'll send you here.

941
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,200
The next road

942
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,520
is to Bihuang.

943
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,840
I'm Bihuang,

944
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,120
the manager of the house.

945
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,600
I'm here to welcome you.

946
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,400
Welcome.

947
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,080
Guests, please come in.

948
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:37,960
Please.

949
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,200
Miss Bihuang,

950
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,120
what's the name of the mountain

951
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,000
where the house is located?

952
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
The name of this mountain

953
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,520
is not written on the map.

954
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,520
It's just a four-季 flower.

955
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,400
The owner named it Xiangshan.

956
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,680
Xiangshan?

957
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,880
Have you heard of the bridge?

958
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,840
What bridge?

959
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,680
The bridge at the gate

960
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,760
was broken

961
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,840
when we came in.

962
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,400
The guard

963
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,920
didn't give orders to block it.

964
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,920
It seems that this Yulou Village

965
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,520
is more cautious than Jingmen Hall.

966
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,880
It's aeriarts to the north.

967
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,120
Miss,

968
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,280
is this Liao Jingyan's year-old pine zaten?

969
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,280
This Brahma pine,

970
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,520
whose dream was to Avenue angled

971
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,680
was culturally sustainable,

972
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,800
which is tarnished by 2021?

973
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,680
And theàno instructor

974
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,640
ills it all?

975
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,600
At least

976
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,580
we need a minimum of three generations,

977
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,440
at least we need a minimum of three generations to warm up with us.

978
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,840
Isn't it the time

979
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,200
to cooperate with the ladies

980
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,200
Welcome.

981
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,200
Everyone, this way please.

982
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,200
Where is Li Lian Huan?

983
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,200
Young Master, please come with me.

984
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,200
Young Master, please come with me.

985
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,200
Miss, what are you doing?

986
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,200
I'm washing the dust for you.

987
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,200
I don't want to take a bath.

988
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,200
Excuse me.

989
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,200
What?

990
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,200
You don't like it?

991
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,200
I don't want to take a bath.

992
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,200
I just took a bath before I left.

993
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,200
The one who entered the prison should be Rong Qiu.

994
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,200
I'm talking to someone else.

995
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,200
Oh, right.

996
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,200
There is another guest.

997
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,200
He is from Yueqian, Shaoyu.

998
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,200
He doesn't like to take a bath.

999
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,200
He is drinking tea in the tea room.

1000
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,200
I'll drink tea too.

1001
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,200
Miss Bi Huan.

1002
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,200
Did you see Li Lian Huan?

1003
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,200
Doctor Li?

1004
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,200
I didn't see him come out of the Hall of Change.

1005
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,200
I think he's in the prison.

1006
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,200
He stayed inside?

1007
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,200
He must be tired from traveling.

1008
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,200
He should take a bath and change his clothes.

1009
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,200
Young Master, please come with me.

1010
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,200
I'll have someone serve you tea.

1011
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,200
Li Lian Huan.

1012
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,200

1013
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,200
