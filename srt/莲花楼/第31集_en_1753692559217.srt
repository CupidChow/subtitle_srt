2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Kissing myself thousands of times

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The most reluctant moment is that moment

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Live in the world

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A thousand miles of crazy

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who doesn't wander

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Who doesn't know the distance between the two worlds

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The moon on the edge of the cliff

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Live in the world

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The youth is crazy

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The youth is drunk like a cup of wine

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
A journey through the world is like a dream

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Live in the world

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
A thousand miles of crazy

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Who doesn't wander

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Who doesn't know the distance between the two worlds

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The moon on the edge of the cliff

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Live in the world

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The youth is crazy

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The youth is drunk like a cup of wine

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
A journey through the world is like a dream

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000

Lian Lian Hua

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You're awake

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Guan He Mu asked me to help you carry a Yangzhou Man every day

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's really useful

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
How do you feel

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
This is Yun Ying Mountain

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You should know the way here

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Do you know how to go up the mountain

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I haven't been here for a long time

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I forgot

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Go, go, go, go, go

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I have something to do

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Where are you going now

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Now go up the mountain to find Qin Bo

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The life that saved your life is the only thing

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Find me my teacher's wife

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Fang Xiao Bao

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Tell you the truth

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm telling you the truth now

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You think I'm lying to you again

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That year it was because I was unfilial

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I was willful and angry to death

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Now you take me to see my teacher's wife

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Maybe my teacher's wife saw me

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What if I make my teacher's wife angry?

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Don't fool me

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Guan He Meng said you

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Guan He Meng

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You also believe in Guan He Meng's words

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
He may not know that Yangzhou Man is a sacred temple

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Besides, everyone is not afraid of death

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm just an ordinary person

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You now have Yangzhou Man's body

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I also know where he is

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Go, go, go

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You have a lot of thoughts now

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I won't believe you now

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's already down the mountain

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm sure of this mountain

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
If you can't go up the mountain, I'll be here with you

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Don't want to go anywhere

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Zeng Shang knew that I was a male royal bloodline

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And asked Luo Moding

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm afraid I know that I was with Wan Sheng when I was a child

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's too late to use Wu Xing Huan to trick him

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
This is a big matter

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Xue Gu, you say

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What will Zeng Shang do to me then?

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Saintess

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Aren't you ready?

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Let's not do it and not embroider

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Don't do it and don't embroider

76
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's been more than ten years

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm tired too

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I still can't warm his heart

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Send a letter to all of us

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Just listen to my order and do it

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And Zongzheng

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
After he gets Luo Moding

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
He wants to see you

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'll go to the temple

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'll go to the temple

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'll go to the temple

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'll go to the temple

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'll go to the temple

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'll go to the temple

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'll go to the temple

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
After Luo Moding

92
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You have to hand it to me

93
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No one can trust

94
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yes

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Di Feisheng

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You forced me

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You think you can get away with it

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
By stealing Luo Moding and the heavenly soldiers?

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Jia Liqiao used you

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You're just a scapegoat

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I never mean to betray you

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I was bewitched by the demon

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You see my Zongzheng family

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
For the sake of close relationship with the court

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You spare my life

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm sorry

107
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm sorry

108
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm sorry

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm sorry

110
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm sorry

111
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm sorry

112
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm sorry

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm sorry

114
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The court has already set up my people

115
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What if you're missing your dog?

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Even if I don't say

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You've already set this stupid thing up

118
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Of course I won't let him

119
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Under your eyes

120
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Di Mengzhu put Zongzheng Mingzhu and Jia Liqiao

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The secret plan told me

122
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That is to say

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Compared with the enemy of the army

124
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You hate more

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The people around you who betray you

126
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Just return to the body of the seven people

127
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Di Mengzhu said he wanted to cooperate with me

128
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Don't you want to ask for debt from Wan Shengdao?

129
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The defeat of the king is all over me

130
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
If you want to cooperate, don't mention it

131
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I set up the Jinyuan Alliance for only one purpose

132
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Become the first person in the martial arts world

133
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The first person in the martial arts world

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The world is my father

135
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And you are not here

136
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm not interested in what you want

137
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Now you and I have a Luo Mo Tianbing in our hands

138
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
No one can beat this Luo Mo Ding

139
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So you and I are naturally the best partners

140
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
it is good

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Di Feisheng, you forced me too hard

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I might as well add some more five-star rings

143
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Let you be a useless person

144
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Di Feisheng, listen to me

145
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'll arrange everything for you

146
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Di Feisheng, listen to me

147
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'll arrange everything for you

148
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
How does Wu Xinghuai feel?

149
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Zisheng

150
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I hate being tricked the most in my life

151
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Ten years ago, the battle of the East Sea

152
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Is the thunder and fire alliance in your hands?

153
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So you know

154
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Twelve protective laws are in order

155
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The Jinyuan Alliance is destroyed

156
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I was seriously injured and drowned for ten years

157
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The Jinyuan Alliance was gradually taken over by you

158
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You have ambition and means

159
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But today, you should settle this account

160
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So you remember

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You are a liar

162
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I miscalculated

163
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You don't ask me why I did this

164
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You don't ask me why I did this

165
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You don't ask me why I did this

166
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You don't need to say it's for me

167
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I have to say

168
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The twelve protective laws are just

169
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
To join the Jinyuan Alliance before me

170
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Their appearance and means are nothing compared to me

171
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Why should I be around you?

172
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
They look at you more

173
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I want to dig their eyes out

174
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
How can you see me if you don't kill them?

175
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The four ancient gates and the Jinyuan Alliance have always been in the same line

176
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But you only care about

177
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Fighting against Li Xiangyi

178
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You know I hate him the most

179
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But the whole world only remembers him

180
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What about me?

181
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So I killed the Jinyuan Alliance and the four ancient gates at the same time

182
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And helped you kill Li Xiangyi

183
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yes, there is no arrangement that is perfect

184
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I don't want you to be injured

185
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You are injured, I am as painful as you

186
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So I found you and saved you

187
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You are closed and healed

188
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I found the world's holy medicine for you

189
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I rebuilt the Jinyuan Alliance for you and waited for you to come back

190
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I was in pain every day

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I helped you find what you lost

192
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
When the dragon-slaying top is opened

193
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The world's first martial arts master you want

194
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I will give you both my hands

195
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Di Fensheng

196
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
No one loves you more than I do

197
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Why don't you understand?

198
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Why don't you appreciate it?

199
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Your love

200
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I have no luck to enjoy it

201
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Di Fensheng

202
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You are always mine

203
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The Jinyuan Alliance or the martial arts master

204
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I don't want it

205
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I can't get it

206
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Di Fensheng

207
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You shouldn't refuse me

208
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Kill

209
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Take Di Fensheng down

210
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
But don't kill him

211
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Master

212
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The Jinyuan Alliance has been destroyed

213
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
We have control of the Xianren Year

214
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
All the innocent people are killed

215
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Only Xue Gong escaped

216
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I have already found you

217
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Jiao Liqiao, it's over

218
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Di Fensheng

219
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You are so cruel

220
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I just want you to look at me

221
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Is this wrong?

222
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Is this wrong?

223
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yunju Pavilion

224
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It should be here

225
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Senior Qin

226
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I am Fang Duobi from Tianji Manor

227
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I have a visit to you

228
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I hope to see you

229
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I have a visit to you

230
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It seems that he is not here

231
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
My wife loves to travel abroad

232
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's hard to make a plan

233
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It may take ten years

234
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It may not come back

235
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Let's go back

236
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's not too late to go back after we finish the Heavenly Soldiers

237
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
This is a big deal

238
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
All the gangs will be careful

239
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You are a patient, don't worry about it

240
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Besides

241
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You were screaming all day

242
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
These grudges have nothing to do with you

243
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
We are here waiting for Qingpuo to come back

244
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You can't go anywhere

245
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's really hard to cheat

246
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Why did you go in yourself?

247
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Li Lianhua

248
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You slow down

249
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I am sorry

250
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I am sorry

251
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I am sorry

252
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I am sorry

253
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I am sorry

254
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I am sorry

255
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I am sorry

256
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I am sorry

257
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I am sorry

258
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I am sorry

259
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I am sorry

260
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I am sorry

261
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I am sorry

262
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I am sorry

263
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I am sorry

264
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You like to drink

265
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You learned it from your master

266
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Master is alive

267
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I never knew

268
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
What's the good of drinking

269
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Only know martial arts

270
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Master always said

271
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Life is a game

272
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
There are many romantic places

273
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I

274
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Only know the heart of the god

275
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Boring

276
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Until I die

277
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I understand

278
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Master

279
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
What you said

280
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
All right

281
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I really regret

282
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Really regret

283
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Why at that time

284
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Not drink with you

285
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I will drink with you

286
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I will drink with you

287
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I will drink with you

288
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
This must be your room

289
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I guess this bed must be my dad's

290
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
How do you know

291
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Li Xiangying is a martial arts equipment

292
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yes

293
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
My dad is with you

294
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
This must be a lot of pressure

295
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
My dad is collecting a pile of rubble

296
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
What

297
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Senior brother, you lost again

298
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Not enough, come again

299
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
These sword moves

300
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I practice three or four hours more every day

301
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I don't believe

302
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Down

303
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I go down

304
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
OK

305
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,520
It's interesting

306
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Senior brother

307
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,200
Where did you get it?

308
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,800
I got it on behalf of him.

309
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,400
You like it, so I gave it to you.

310
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,200
Whose knife is this?

311
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,000
It's quite unique.

312
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,800
Senior Zeng?

313
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,200
Did you make it?

314
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,400
Did you make it?

315
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,200
It seems that year,

316
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,400
I was very obsessed with this kind of ice blade.

317
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,200
I should have made this one for Senior Zeng

318
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,800
and gave it to him.

319
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,400
It might be because I couldn't get home on time.

320
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,000
I used it for a few times,

321
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,200
and it broke.

322
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,400
But this blade has never been used.

323
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,600
The blade is broken by a living person.

324
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
And,

325
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,600
why is every one broken?

326
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,000
How could it be like this?

327
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,400
This...

328
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,400
I've waited for a short time

329
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,400
But I still have a lot of longing

330
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:13,400
I've asked myself thousands of times

331
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:19,400
The most reluctant moment is that moment

332
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,400
On the earth, thousands of miles of wind and waves

333
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,400
Who has never wandered

334
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:31,400
Who is not the clouds and the sun that stays in the sky

335
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,400
On the earth, the youthful feelings

336
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,400
The sword is not drunk as the wine

337
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,400
A journey to the world is like a dream

338
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,400
To the world

339
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,400
To the world

340
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,400
To the world

341
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,400
To the world

342
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,400
To the world

343
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,400
To the world

344
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,400
Dearest one,

345
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:32,000
great

346
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Come on

347
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'll boil you some wine

348
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,400
Come on.

349
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,880
Let's drink together.

350
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,120
Spit out all your pain.

351
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,120
Come on.

352
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,400
Senior and I are like brothers.

353
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,400
I thought that

354
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,400
even if we have different ideas,

355
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,400
it wouldn't affect

356
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,400
the feelings between brothers.

357
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
But what I didn't expect

358
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
was that

359
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,400
he hates me so much.

360
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,400
You never noticed these before.

361
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,400
I didn't know.

362
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
I never noticed these.

363
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,400
In the past,

364
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,400
he always protected me.

365
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,400
He also helped me love my master.

366
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,400
At that time,

367
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,400
I had a lot of ideas.

368
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,400
I was stubborn.

369
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,400
My master punished me.

370
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
When I was in trouble,

371
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,400
my senior gave me sugar.

372
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,400
He said he would rather be punished.

373
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,400
Then,

374
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,400
slowly,

375
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,400
he became more and more afraid of me.

376
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,400
You are so stubborn.

377
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,400
You are not allowed to practice new moves today.

378
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,400
You are going to be in trouble.

379
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,400
Senior.

380
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,400
I won.

381
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,400
Master.

382
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,400
You don't need to hide from the same move.

383
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,400
Why did you do that just now?

384
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,400
The one who practices martial arts is in the new city.

385
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,400
You lost on purpose.

386
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,400
I was just trying to help you.

387
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,400
I was just trying to help you.

388
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,400
I was just trying to help you.

389
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,400
I was just trying to help you.

390
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,400
I was just trying to help you.

391
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
Then you can see your opponent clearly.

392
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,400
At the same time, you can see yourself clearly.

393
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
I don't need you to surrender.

394
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,400
Li Xiang Yi, don't look down on people.

395
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,400
After that,

396
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,400
I never surrendered.

397
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,400
I thought that

398
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,400
he wouldn't be angry anymore.

399
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,400
Actually, he had already

400
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,400
hidden his emotions.

401
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,400
But I never found out.

402
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,400
Later,

403
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,400
Master and I had a fight.

404
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,400
We didn't know each other.

405
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,400
So they decided

406
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,400
to make a bet.

407
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,400
Let's see who can bring out the better disciple.

408
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,400
Master and Master caught each other.

409
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,400
I followed Master.

410
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,400
Shiniang took Senior away.

411
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
They made a promise.

412
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
This promise

413
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
is to have a competition

414
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
every month.

415
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,400
Since then,

416
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,400
my father always lost to you in every competition.

417
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,400
I'm afraid he's even more ruthless.

418
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,400
Maybe

419
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,400
I've never been right.

420
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,400
This isn't your fault.

421
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,400
Life is in the world, and everything is in the way.

422
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,400
Some people can see it,

423
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,400
some can't.

424
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
When I was young,

425
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,400
I was a poor monk.

426
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,400
He always said that

427
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,400
I had no Buddha-like qualities.

428
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
At that time,

429
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
I was proud

430
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,400
and didn't put his words in my heart.

431
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,400
But I thought

432
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,400
some people entered the martial arts world

433
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,400
for the sake of their heart.

434
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,400
Some people entered the martial arts world

435
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,400
for the sake of their life.

436
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,400
I didn't know

437
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,400
what I really wanted.

438
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,400
You're the best in martial arts.

439
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
You're the best in the world.

440
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,400
I didn't know what others thought.

441
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,400
To be like him

442
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,400
is my dream since I was young.

443
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,400
When I was young, I was too rich.

444
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,400
I had a group of friends

445
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
who were all Taoist.

446
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,400
In my heart,

447
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,400
Senior Brother was special.

448
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,400
But in the end,

449
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,400
I've never been interested in this kind of relationship.

450
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,400
You blame yourself for this?

451
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,400
In my opinion,

452
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,400
I should blame myself.

453
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,400
My mother once told me

454
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,400
that the relationship between people

455
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,400
is like drinking.

456
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,400
You come and go,

457
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,400
I come and go.

458
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,400
You can only be more and more careful.

459
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
But I forgot

460
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,400
that Ni Li and I,

461
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,400
Lian Hua,

462
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,400
have long been true to each other.

463
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,400
Why should we be humble and clean?

464
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,400
The relationship between people

465
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,400
is also like this.

466
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
I think

467
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,400
it's the same.

468
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
You're right.

469
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,400
I'm just a little bit more careful.

470
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,400
I'm sorry.

471
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,400
I'm sorry.

472
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,400
I'm sorry.

473
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,400
I'm sorry.

474
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,400
I'm sorry.

475
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,400
I'm sorry.

476
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,400
I'm sorry.

477
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,400
I'm sorry.

478
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,400
I'm sorry.

479
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,400
I'm sorry.

480
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,400
Although there are people cleaning here,

481
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,400
there are no signs of life.

482
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,400
When I first came in,

483
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,400
I found a needle and needle.

484
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,400
There's no needle here.

485
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
I think it was someone who cleaned it often

486
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,400
and left it here.

487
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,400
I saw the southern peak of the south wind.

488
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,400
It's a dense forest.

489
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,400
I think that's where Qin Po lives.

490
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,400
You're still fooling around about your life.

491
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,400
It's late.

492
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,400
Come with me.

493
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
It's late.

494
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,400
XiaoMei?

495
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,200
You even know this place?

496
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,400
The people who were locked up here

497
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,200
were all your martial arts friends.

498
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,800
They were poisoned and drugged by you.

499
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,000
They were tortured by you.

500
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,200
If I were in your hands,

501
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,600
I'm afraid it would end up like this.

502
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,800
Then you're wrong.

503
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,000
I love you so much.

504
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,400
How much do I love you?

505
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,400
How much do I love you?

506
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,200
I would put you here.

507
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,400
I would put you

508
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,400
by my side forever.

509
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,200
I would feed you with the most powerful poison.

510
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,000
Until you beg me to kneel down

511
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,400
and ask for my love.

512
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,800
All the cause and effect are different.

513
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,800
Just bear it, you lunatic.

514
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,800
Di Fen Sheng.

515
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,800
You really put me here?

516
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,600
Your Majesty.

517
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,000
Your Majesty, the information network that the Golden Fist Alliance had in the Jiao Li Bridge

518
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,400
is being restored one by one.

519
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,400
We got the last news from Li Lian Hua.

520
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,800
She left the Dream Manor a month ago.

521
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,600
We don't know where she went.

522
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,000
Her life and death are unknown.

523
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,200
Go to Wang Chuan Hua as soon as possible.

524
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,200
Tell Wan Sheng Da that

525
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,600
Li Lian Hua's life is mine.

526
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,200
Yes.

527
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,400
Is this the place?

528
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,800
The old woman has made a vow.

529
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,600
She will never leave the mountain gate and never see outsiders.

530
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,200
Senior Qin,

531
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,200
I have been sick for Tian Ji Hall.

532
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,600
There are people who came with me,

533
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,000
and even Li Xiang Yi.

534
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,400
Please open the gate and see her.

535
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,200
Li Xiang Yi has been dead for ten years.

536
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,800
But she's still been making rumors and rumors

537
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,800
about her.

538
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,600
There's no benefit for the old woman here.

539
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,200
Get lost.

540
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,600
I'm not doing it for you.

541
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,600
I'm doing it for you.

542
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,000
I'm not doing it for you.

543
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,200
Say something.

544
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,200
Okay.

545
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,800
I can only act on my own.

546
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,200
The one who is good at it will be punished.

547
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,800
You can only trust the old woman's sword formation.

548
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,600
Madam, please have mercy.

549
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,400
Xiang Yi?

550
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,000
Where is she?

551
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,800
Madam.

552
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,000
It's you.

553
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,800
It's really Xiang Yi's voice.

554
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,200
Xiang Yi.

555
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,400
Disloyal disciple.

556
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,800
Greetings, Madam.

557
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,200
Xiang Yi,

558
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,800
all these years, you've been in the mountain gate and never seen outsiders.

559
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,000
You're not even a child.

560
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,800
You're not even a child.

561
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,400
Xiang Yi, where have you been all these years?

562
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,600
Senior Qin,

563
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,400
Li Xiang Yi was in a battle with the Golden Thread Embroidery for ten years.

564
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,400
She was seriously injured.

565
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,800
Now she's been poisoned with the poison of tea.

566
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,000
She's been suffering for so many years.

567
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
It's not too late now.

568
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,400
Please help us.

569
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,400
Poisoned?

570
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,600
You're being rude. Let's go.

571
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,800
This young man is your disciple.

572
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,400
He's quite talented.

573
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,200
Madam, he's definitely my disciple.

574
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,600
I've never taught him anything.

575
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,800
Come, sit.

576
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,400
Xiang Yi,

577
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,600
if your teacher knew about this,

578
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,600
and he knew that you're returning to Cloud Mountain today,

579
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,600
he would be very happy.

580
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,800
You're his favorite disciple.

581
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,200
He's the most important disciple in the world.

582
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,200
He's very happy.

583
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,400
You're his favorite disciple.

584
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,800
When he knew that you were in trouble,

585
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,600
he was very sad and depressed.

586
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,200
He didn't want to see anyone.

587
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,800
He locked himself up.

588
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,800
He said that he was

589
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,800
closed off to practice martial arts.

590
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,400
But not long after,

591
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,200
he went into a coma

592
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,400
and died.

593
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,400
After he got hurt,

594
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,400
I came back.

595
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,800
When he died,

596
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,000
I didn't have the face to come in.

597
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,600
You silly child.

598
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,400
You just didn't dare to go back to Cloud Mountain because of this?

599
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,400
I'm not like him.

600
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,400
I caused him to become like this.

601
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,600
This is also blaming us.

602
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,200
Your teacher and I

603
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,600
have been fighting for half our lives.

604
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,400
After a while,

605
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,000
I realized

606
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,600
that I actually can't bear to part with him.

607
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,000
I also can't bear to part with you

608
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
and Shan Gu Dao.

609
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
When you all left,

610
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,600
I'm so regretful now.

611
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,400
I even made you suffer so much.

612
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,000
Shiniang,

613
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I'm pretty good at this, right?

614
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,400
Pretty good.

615
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,000
It's good that you're back.

616
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,800
I won't let you suffer anymore.

617
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,400
I know how to deal with Guan He Meng.

618
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,600
Don't worry. I'll help you

619
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,800
to cure the poison in your body.

620
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,600
You don't need to think about this.

621
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,400
I don't want you to risk your life to save me.

622
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,400
Guan He Meng told me that you can save me.

623
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,400
It's just that your inner power is the same as mine.

624
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:49,600
If you force your inner power to draw the poison into your body,

625
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,800
it's just a life for a life.

626
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,800
Shiniang,

627
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,600
I don't want to.

628
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,200
If you know this,

629
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,800
you won't agree.

630
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,400
Come on, kid. Get up.

631
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,800
Get up first.

632
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,800
Xiang Yi,

633
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,200
your teacher knows everything.

634
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,400
He's willing to let you do this.

635
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,200
Even if he's alive,

636
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,000
he'll still use his own life to save you.

637
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,800
Because your parents are his benefactors,

638
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,200
today, I'm saving you

639
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,000
to repay your teacher's kindness.

640
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,800
Li Xiang Yi,

641
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,400
what are you doing?

642
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,800
Are you going to kill yourself in front of me?

643
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,200
Shiniang,

644
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,800
we all have our own lives.

645
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,000
There are some things that we don't have to force.

646
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,800
How can I be at peace?

647
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,800
How can your teacher be at peace?

648
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,200
Fine. It's fine.

649
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,400
If you don't want us to save you,

650
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,000
then you can stay and recuperate.

651
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,400
Let me take care of you.

652
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,200
Shiniang,

653
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
there are some things

654
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,600
that I need to take care of myself.

655
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,000
You have to let me give you some of my life.

656
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
You can protect yourself in times of danger.

657
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,800
Also,

658
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,200
the man at the door,

659
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,400
he's my teacher.

660
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,800
The man at the door, can you fool him?

661
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,000
So, I hope that you will listen to my advice for now.

662
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,000
How is it?

663
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,800
Yi Wu Ai.

664
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,000
You can't touch anything. The poison has just been cured.

665
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,000
That's great.

666
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
The poison was cured and everything is gone.

667
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,600
Uncle Shiguang, you're impressive.

668
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,200
My inner strength

669
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,400
is only about to recover.

670
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,400
Yes.

671
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,000
That's why I need to recuperate well.

672
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,600
It's my fault.

673
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,600
I was too happy and ignored everything.

674
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,000
Thank you for reminding me.

675
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,600
If I had asked you,

676
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,400
if you could cure the poison of tea,

677
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,000
why didn't you come back earlier?

678
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,600
It's not my fault.

679
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,600
I should have come back earlier.

680
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,520
I can only say that I was lucky.

681
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,160
This Shiniang

682
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,120
used her years of power in the early stage

683
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,200
to make a green poison.

684
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,920
Now, with her inner power,

685
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,000
she can get rid of the poison on me.

686
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,800
So I'm recovering very well now.

687
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,720
Right, Shiniang?

688
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,440
Yes.

689
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,800
Yes.

690
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,560
This green poison

691
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,680
was made by me after more than a decade of hard work.

692
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,680
This green poison is for you.

693
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,320
Don't forget to promise me one thing.

694
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,040
I'll give you a month

695
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,440
to go down the mountain and get rid of your problems.

696
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,040
Then you can come back and take over the sect.

697
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,000
Don't make any mistakes.

698
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,800
I understand, Shiniang.

699
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,320
Why do you have conditions?

700
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,280
Do you know why I didn't come back?

701
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,760
You saw it.

702
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,800
My Shiniang's temper

703
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,880
made me inherit the sect.

704
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,120
I had to stay in Yun Yin Mountain.

705
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,160
Although I got my life back,

706
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,720
I lost my freedom.

707
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,720
No matter what,

708
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,480
you'll always be the first.

709
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,520
You'll be able to do it in the future.

710
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,880
Besides,

711
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,640
the Master of Qin didn't tell you.

712
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,320
You have to stay in Yun Yin Mountain forever.

713
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,080
Speaking of the sect, Wang Doubi,

714
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,040
you'll be the queen of Yun Yin Mountain.

715
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,560
Why don't you betray your grandmaster and mother-in-law

716
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,040
and bow to your master and me?

717
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,760
You'll be in charge of Yun Yin Mountain in the future.

718
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,240
It's just a play.

719
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,360
How can you take it seriously?

720
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,000
You're a bad boy. You want to be a traitor.

721
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,080
I remember when I first met you in Lingshan,

722
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,960
you said you were my apprentice.

723
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,800
You're kidding.

724
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,800
I've been bowing to you since I was a kid.

725
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,800
You're dreaming.

726
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,840
Don't try to be a traitor.

727
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,640
You're not a good boy.

728
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,720
Why are you here?

729
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,280
Try it.

730
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,120
This porridge has Yun Yin Mountain's special ingredients,

731
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,120
the Shizhu root,

732
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,800
which is good for your wound.

733
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,600
Wound?

734
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,520
Drink it.

735
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,760
Why are you talking so much?

736
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,480
It tastes good today.

737
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,360
It's good.

738
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,160
It's good.

739
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,000
It's good.

740
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,800
It's good.

741
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,840
It's good.

742
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,760
It's good.

743
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,640
It's good.

744
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,520
It's good.

745
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,520
It's good.

746
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,520
It's good.

747
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,360
It tastes good today.

748
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,600
I always make mistakes.

749
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,640
You don't plan to go back to your past identity?

750
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,320
Fang Xiao Bao,

751
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,160
look at this Yun Yin Mountain.

752
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,200
The right tooth is deep and the heart is not swollen.

753
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,320
The same goes for Wulin.

754
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,480
What about the future?

755
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,120
Who can make it clear?

756
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,560
The world is full of people.

757
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,000
There will always be a new legend.

758
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,640
Mr. Fang,

759
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,200
there are fewer empty houses on the mountain.

760
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,520
This is where

761
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,920
Shang Gu Dao practiced martial arts.

762
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,480
Please forgive him.

763
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,480
Senior Qin,

764
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,600
what kind of person is he?

765
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,480
He and Li Xiang Yi

766
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,520
founded the Four Gu Sect together.

767
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,280
But the people on the martial arts world

768
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,920
seem to have a very vague opinion of him.

769
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,320
Shang Gu Dao looks very casual,

770
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,320
but he is willing to hide himself.

771
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,920
He is actually a person

772
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,320
who is competitive and competitive.

773
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,560
He is not very tolerant.

774
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,800
He fought against Li Xiang Yi back then.

775
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,840
In order to win,

776
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,040
he could use some other means.

777
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,080
He left early.

778
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,800
He also blamed me for not

779
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,920
bringing him to a good path.

780
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,160
It's getting late.

781
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,120
Go to bed early.

782
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,120
Thank you, Senior Qin.

783
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,940
Open the Xops.

784
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:46,560
The

785
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,960
hidden three 거의 of Nan Yin

786
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,960
– банان, 5-star liquid elixir and the laxative –

787
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,920
were passed down to the Royal Family of Nan Yin.

788
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,040
Nan Yin was Sancturnal and marshy.

789
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,920
Princess and Prince Qi bury Consort Xian.

790
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,700
Consort Xian departs Nanying to rejuvenate the state.

791
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,780
Then repair Songwu at the bottom of the Ni sleeper.

792
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:22,000
Duke Zonguments

793
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,360
Madam Xiao is aware of everything.

794
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,720
How did you get here?

795
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,200
All of this.

796
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,720
But I don't accept it.

797
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:35,960
Who did it?

798
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,960
But whoever.

799
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,680
He's been checking this thing.

800
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,160
The answer is in this container.

801
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,640
There's a lock on it.

802
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,360
There are also self-destructing devices.

803
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,560
I don't dare to squeeze it out.

804
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,800
This is the gaze pin.

805
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,560
Right.

806
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,240
This is college exam.

807
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,440
He has einige arrived in genes-viscering still ny in his body.

808
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,080
The next present hematoma,

809
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:15,300
are 0.CKV bacilli's

810
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,800
There's a photo on our flyer,

811
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,200
through the online groups,

812
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:26,800
He's the only one who can

813
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,480
If turnout for your experience

814
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,480
We Unit

815
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,040
I'm in

816
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,600
Since the blood of the royal family of Nan Yin was close,

817
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,560
he dared to go to the main

818
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,160
and take over Wu'er.

819
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,080
Then he contacted the four people of the Golden Jade Emperor

820
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,480
to fulfill the wish of Xuan Wei.

821
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,320
He was able to restore Nan Yin.

822
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,240
So Consort Xuan

823
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,920
has always wanted to restore Nan Yin

824
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,080
and even made such a great achievement.

825
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,000
But this Feng A'lu

826
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,840
didn't take over the son of Consort Xuan.

827
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,640
The wealth and the talent of the people of Nan Yin

828
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,120
were all split by the four people of the Golden Jade Emperor.

829
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,040
Maybe something happened at that time.

830
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,080
It's not an accident.

831
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,080
But now,

832
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,840
the descendant of Consort Xuan

833
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,680
is indeed found by the people of Nan Yin.

834
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,440
Otherwise, these stars

835
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,440
wouldn't have appeared here.

836
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,640
You mean

837
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,760
my father is the descendant of Consort Xuan,

838
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,600
the blood of the royal family of Nan Yin?

839
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,800
I have a good feeling about this.

840
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,840
I'm going to the capital.

841
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:49,720
I'll go with you.

842
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,680

I'll go with you.

00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,920
I'll go with you.

848
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,360

I'll go with you.

I'll go with you.

00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,840
I'll go with you.

859
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,200
I'll go with you.

860
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,640
I'll go with you.

861
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,840
I'll go with you.

862
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,040
