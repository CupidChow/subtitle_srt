Physician Li,

5
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,190
may I have a word with you?

6
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,450
Li Lianhua, come here.

7
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,200
I got something for you.

8
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,220
This is Wuxiang Golden Needles.

9
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,800
They were used by the Immortal Healer in Dazhou a hundred years ago.

10
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,920
They can cure every disease

11
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,289
and be used for acupuncture.

12
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,640
It took my grandpa a long time

13
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,780
to find this set of needles.

14
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,960
You helped me just now.

15
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,130
Take it as a thank-you gift.

16
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,330
Guan,

17
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,780
I don't think it's proper.

18
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,300
I insist.

19
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:21,930
Then thank you, Guan.

20
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,700
You flatterer.

21
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,130
After I go back home,

22
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,980
I can give you a dozen better needles.

23
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,700
That'll be too late.

24
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,570
He's childish.

25
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,070
You're much better than him.

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,040
We're here to investigate the case.

27
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,290
Why are you following us?

28
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,860
I'm not following you.

29
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,100
I'm following Li Lianhua.

30
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,310
Besides,

31
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,700
I'm here to investigate the case too.

What's that?

36
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,010
I prepared clean clothes

37
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,210
for Master Jin.

38
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:15,980
I'll put them on for him.

39
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,860
How did Dong Ling come in

40
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,350
without triggering the Thousand Bell Formation?

41
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,700
Had he been hiding in this secret room?

42
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,140
The last time we came here,

43
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,870
the comb was right up there.

44
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,950
He had checked all the treasures.

45
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,620
Why didn't he notice it?

46
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:55,740
Look.

Date of pawning.

50
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,090
This is a pawn ticket.

51
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,050
It's all black. How could you tell?

52
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,870
Let me have a look at it.

53
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,230
Guan.

54
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,320
There were lots of people here

55
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,140
so I didn't notice this incense burner.

56
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:31,070
Take a look.

57
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,460
Jin Mantang owned a pawn shop

58
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,070
so it's not surprising that he had pawn tickets.

59
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,840
There's more than one kind of incense in it.

60
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,470
Inhaling it for a long time causes dizziness.

61
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,360
This is a kind of knockout incense

62

with a woody scent.

63
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,659
Careful.

64
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,020
Was this incense

65
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,060
used to knock out Jin Mantang

66
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,590
before he got strangled to death?

67
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,290
Or did Jin Mantang

68
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,580
plan to use this incense

69
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,830
to deal with Dong Ling?

70
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,900
Unfortunately, I don't know the name of this incense.

71
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,610
Otherwise, we can get more clues.

72
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,460
If only

00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,750
He definitely knows what this is.

76
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,020
That old man is a grumpy wanderer.

77
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,580
It's almost impossible to ask him questions.

78
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,640
So forget about him.

79
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,930
There's something you don't know.

80
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,330
Su Wencai's granddaughter is my sworn sister.

He won't refuse to help me.

82
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,040
You've been quiet. What are you thinking?

83
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,380
I think I've smelled

84
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:45,659
this scent before.

85
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,210
Woody scent.

86
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:51,750
Yes.

87
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,190
The woody scent you mentioned,

88
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,820
Miss Zhiyu smelled like it.

89
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,159
It can't be a coincidence.

90
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,480
Bracelets.

91
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,159
What bracelets?

92
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,840
Something is wrong with her bracelets.

93
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,780
Let's go.

94
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,000
She's gone.

95
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:31,810
Let's split up to find her.

96
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:32,870
Okay.

97
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,110
Wait.

98
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,020
Miss Zhiyu.

99
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,450
Where are you going in that outfit?

100
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,780
You went to Jin Mantang's room last night.

101
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,340
Was the knockout incense your doing?

102
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,620
N-No.

103
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,390
You smelled like the knockout incense.

104
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,450
Your foster father just died.

105
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,340
As his daughter,

106
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:03,650
instead of waiting to attend his funeral,

107
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,970
you tried to escape in disguise.

108
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,780
What happened between you and Jin Mantang?

109
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,090
You won't talk?

110
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,260
You wore so many bracelets

111
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,700
to cover

112
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,900
the scratches left by Jin Mantang, right?

113
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,660
She thinks she can get away with it.

114
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,540
What are you doing?

115
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,020
The murderer has been found.

116
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,700
She shall be locked in the woodshed

117
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,660
and interrogated.

118
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,110
Take her away.

119
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:39,770
Yes.

120
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,580
I really hate to hurt

121
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,580
a beautiful girl like you.

122
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,210
Tell me.

123
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,159
Where is the opal skull?

124
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,290
I don't know.

125
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,820
I didn't kill anyone.

126
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,580
I didn't take the opal skull.

127
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:10,990
Guess we have to do this the hard way.

128
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,320
You can't punish her without trial.

129
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,070
If someone files a complaint about it in the court,

130
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,180
do you think His Majesty will be infuriated?

131
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,950
Keep an eye on her.

132
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,800
No one is allowed to come near her.

133
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,000
She can't eat or drink

134
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,140
until she confesses.

135
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,180
Let's see how long she can last.

136
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,550
Mr. Fang.

137
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:43,280
Please.

138
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,120
Oh, no.

139
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:27,610
Stop!

140
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,700
Guan, are you all right?

141
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,850
I'm fine.

142
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,940
Miss Zhiyu, come out.

143
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:47,930
You…

144
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,980
What's going on?

145
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,480
We thought

146
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,580
Miss Zhiyu wore those bracelets

147
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,300
to cover the scratches Jin Mantang left when he struggled.

148
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,000
But it turned out that we were wrong.

149
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,210
Those are knife wounds.

150
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,010
So you made a wrong judgment?

151
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,770
Sorry that we misunderstood you.

152
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,640
Then how did Miss Zhiyu get those wounds

153
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,380
and why did she have the woody scent?

154
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:29,810
Miss,

155
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,170
say something.

156
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,690
How can we help you if you don't tell us anything?

157
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,620
At this point,

158
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,310
I can tell you the truth.

159
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,840
Everyone thinks I'm Jin Mantang's adopted daughter

160
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,950
and lives a carefree

161
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,980
and luxurious life.

162
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,010
But in fact,

163
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,830
he just wanted my blood to make medicine.

164
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,340
What? Your blood?

165
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,060
After I was sold to the Yuanbao Villa when I was six,

166
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,850
I had to take dozens of herbs every day.

167
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,790
After a decade, my blood became his nostrum.

168
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,180
He used incense

169
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,220
to knock me out every few days

170
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:07,650
so I wouldn't feel the pain

171
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,340
when he took my blood.

172
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,450
He soaked herbs in my blood

173
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,240
and drank them from the opal skull.

174
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,980
He believed that could cure his disease.

175
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,120
Is that true?

176
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,980
Can't believe

177
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,700
there's such a cruel treatment in the world.

178
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,590
Jin Mantang was heartless!

179
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,240
Someone like him

180
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,460
deserved a tragic death.

181
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,360
What was his disease?

182
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,520
He never talked about it

183
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,080
and never trusted anyone.

184
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,410
Neither did he ever use the opal skull

185
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,680
in front of me.

186
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,730
Since that's the case,

187
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,240
why didn't you tell us the truth?

188
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,980
Why did you disguise yourself and run away?

189
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,180
I was worried that what he did to me

190
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,420
would be revealed sooner or later

191
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,040
and I'd be suspected of killing him.

192
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,980
On the night Jin Mantang died,

193
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,110
you went to his room to give him your blood.

194
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,750
That's why you and his room

195
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,500
had that woody scent.

196
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,170
After you left,

197
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,610
he deactivated the Thousand Bell Formation and led me in.

198
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,460
I left after he took my blood.

199
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,700
I really didn't do anything.

200
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,100
Try to recall that night.

201
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,240
Before Jin Mantang died,

202
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,620
was there something off with him?

203
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,460
Yes.

204
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,120
He usually took his time when he took my blood,

205
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,970
but he was absent-minded that night

206
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,980
as if he was in a hurry to do something else.

207
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,710
He even got blood under his nails.

208
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,850
I guess Jin Mantang

209
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,970
was in a hurry to go to the secret room

210
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,010
to check on Dong Ling.

211
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,060
So you still think

212
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,420
before we set the Thousand Bell Formation,

213
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,190
Dong Ling had already been in the room.

214
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,260
Not on the day we arrived.

215
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,140
He'd been there

216
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,570
since half a month ago.

217
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:12,770
Was Dong Ling from Zhuzhou?

218
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,980
How did you know that?

219
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,180
That pawn ticket.

220
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,650
I got it.

221
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,840
Dong Ling must have pawned something

222
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,050
in Jin Mantang's shop when he was young.

223
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,740
Now he wanted to redeem it.

224
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,730
Maybe it was the opal skull.

225
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,190
But Jin Mantang refused to return it to him.

226
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,250
That's how they became enemies.

227
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,510
Here is my guess.

228
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,430
Dong Ling threatened Jin Mantang,

229
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,570
but Jin Mantang didn't use the ransom note

230
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,530
as solid evidence to turn him in.

231
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,860
It means that Dong Ling had long been under his control.

232
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,870
It's not that Dong Ling hid in the secret room to get back at Jin Mantang

233
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:49,670
but that Jin Mantang

234
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,570
managed to hold Dong Ling captive.

235
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,360
Dong Ling came to see Master Jin.

236
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,690
Luckily, Master Jin took him down using the arrow hidden in his sleeve.

237
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,490
He reacted swiftly

238
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,630
or he'd have been hurt by Dong Ling.

239
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,840
No one saw it coming

240
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,180
so we didn't arrive in time

241
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,100
and let Dong Ling run away.

242
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,940
After that, we guards got flogged by the butler

243
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,100
for our negligence.

244
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:07,940
Yes.

245
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,220
Everyone in the Yuanbao Villa

246
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,920
said Dong Ling was chased away by Jin Mantang.

247
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,580
But no one saw it with their own eyes.

248
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,280
So,

249
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,870
Jin Mantang was lying.

250
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:19,970
It doesn't make sense.

251
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,650
Dong Ling was good at martial arts.

252
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,460
Jin Mantang was no match for him.

253
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,880
How could he take him captive?

254
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,820
Don't you remember this?

255
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,450
This empty box was on the floor.

256
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,130
Why is it up there now?

257
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,420
I thought

258
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,310
a third person entered the secret room

259
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,890
and took away the thing in the box.

260
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,320
But if someone tried to come in,

261
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,060
the Thousand Bell Formation at the door

262
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,030
would definitely be triggered.

263
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,140
The empty box?

264
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,400
It was a bait Jin Mantang used to distract Dong Ling.

265
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:57,420
Hurry!

266
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,290
Don't get clever with me.

267
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,270
I…

268
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,910
I've promised to give it to you.

269
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,700
There's nothing you need to worry about.

270
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,700
Where is the opal skull?

271
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:09,930
Over there.

272
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,580
In that box.

273
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:17,490
You played me!

274
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:21,980
Jin Mantang!

275
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,060
Let me out!

276
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:23,940
Jin Mantang!

277
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,420
Half a month later,

278
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,320
Jin Mantang thought Dong Ling was dead,

279
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,270
so he was in a hurry to check it out.

280
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,220
But he didn't expect that

281
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,740
Dong Ling was still alive.

282
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,700
So Zongzheng Mingzhu was right.

283
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,340
They killed each other.

284
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,820
It's not that simple.

285
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,200
Why was Dong Ling still alive

286
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,150
after being trapped here for half a month?

287
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,580
He even still had the strength to strangle Jin Mantang.

288
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,070
And why was Jin Mantang

289
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,030
wearing only one shoe?

290
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,240
In my opinion,

291
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,840
just because there is no trace

292
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,610
of a third person in the secret room

293
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,210
doesn't mean there wasn't a third person

294
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,390
in this story.

295
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,220
Could it be that man in black?

296
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,740
Why did he want Miss Zhiyu dead?

297
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,100
Maybe

298
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,140
he wanted a scapegoat.

299
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,450
It's also possible

300
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,120
that he didn't get what he wanted.

301
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,100
It seems that only by catching that man in black

302
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,530
can we find out the truth.

303
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,340
So that was a trap you set.

304
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,410
It's my fault

305
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,890
that he escaped.

306
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,300
I can't help but wonder

307
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,230
if you two are on his side.

308
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,380
Fang Duobing.

309
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,160
Don't let him escape next time.

310
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,820
There's no next time.

311
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,180
You again.

312
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,820
You beat my subordinates

313
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:48,850
and took away the suspect.

314
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,410
What do you want?

315
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,340
Miss Zhiyu isn't the murderer.

316
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,280
We're here

317
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,570
to find out the truth.

318
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,950
Find out the truth?

319
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,310
I've sent someone to check

320
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,030
the payroll of the Baichuan Court.

321
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,100
Fang Duobing,

322
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,180
you're a downright impostor!

323
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,110
You don't have the right to conduct an investigation here.

324
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,990
[Yuanbao Villa]

325
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,010
Get lost!

326
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,319
Zongzheng Mingzhu!

327
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,859
Open the door!

328
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,310
I was sent here by the Baichuan Court!

329
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,200
I'm an authorized detective!

330
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,550
How dare you call me an impostor?

331
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,310
That's a wild accusation!

332
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,040
Fang Duobing.

333
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:28,940
Calm down.

334
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:29,890
I'm not done yet.

335
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,780
Zongzheng Mingzhu, listen carefully!

336
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,060
You violated the laws

337
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,060
and got away with it.

338
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,980
I don't care what you want this time.

339
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,380
You can't get off the hook!

340
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,180
I'll get to the bottom of it

341
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,700
and throw you into jail!

342
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:41,670
Let's wait and see!

343
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:46,510
I'm so mad.

344
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,680
-I'm so mad.
-So hot-blooded.

345
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,020
No.

346
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,700
In just a few days,

347
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,700
even if the Gang Qi in his body is dispersed,

348
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,430
he won't be able to practice martial arts again.

349
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,630
We must find the opal skull as soon as possible.

350
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:22,820
Zongzheng Mingzhu!

351
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,480
Morning.

352
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,170
Does your throat feel better?

353
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,370
I'll write a letter to the Baichuan Court.

354
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,140
I've solved three cases.

355
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,020
They must keep their promise.

356
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,190
I'd rather die than be humiliated like that again!

357
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,750
Wait. I…

358
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,380
Fox Spirit.

359
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,320
Guan.

360
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:57,970
Well,

361
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,140
what brought you here?

362
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,150
I'm here to visit you

363
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:02,710
and the impostor.

364
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,860
I know you want to know

365
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,530
the situation in the Yuanbao Villa.

366
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,030
You know what?

367
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,980
Zongzheng Mingzhu is worried

368
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,550
that someone may sneak the opal skull out

369
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,320
and searched me before letting me go.

370
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,220
Is he still

371
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,700
grilling Miss Zhiyu?

372
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:21,510
Yes.

373
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,200
He said he couldn't risk releasing a murderer.

374
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,940
He's still searching for the opal skull

375
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,380
in the Yuanbao Villa.

376
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,180
Everyone is cooperative.

377
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,660
They all want to find the murderer

378
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,800
and seek justice for Jin Mantang.

379
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,900
They're all very righteous.

380
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,360
But Butler Jin is in a bad mood.

381
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,320
I don't know if it's because

382
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,190
he's grieving over Jin Mantang's death.

383
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,310
Since last night,

384
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,250
he's been devastated.

385
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,400
He wouldn't talk to anyone.

386
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,270
Were they so close?

387
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,350
I didn't expect you

388
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,520
to love flowers too.

389
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,860
I just like to use flowers as medicine.

390
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,370
You're a physician too.

391
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,460
You should know

392
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,350
the medical value of these flowers.

393
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,620
Li Lianhua.

394
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,720
What are you thinking?

395
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,580
It's the first time you came to my place.

396
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,120
Come.

397
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,410
I'll cook for you.

398
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,640
Not for you.

399
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,220
Li Lianhua,

400
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,260
you're actually such a great cook.

401
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,160
Eat.

402
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,060
You're not only a great physician

403
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:40,700
but also a well-mannered man

404
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:41,880
who's good at cooking.

405
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,350
Pork tripe with chicken.

406
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,620
Braised fish.

407
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,140
What's wrong with you?

408
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,420
I asked you to make them so many times but you never did.

409
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,600
Now you made them for her willingly.

410
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,940
So delicious.

411
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,300
Don't be rude to the guest.

412
00:20:59,230 --> 00:20:59,710
Slow down.

413
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:05,240
Guan.

414
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,740
To be honest,

415
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,420
now that we were kicked out of the Yuanbao Villa,

416
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,920
it's hard for us to continue with the investigation.

417
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,420
Since you can still go there,

418
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,280
why don't you

419
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,430
be our man on the inside?

420
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,240
What do you think?

421
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,440
Well…

422
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,130
I need to think about it.

423
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,420
After all, I'm a big name

424
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,080
in the martial world.

425
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,850
I don't do people favors just because they make lunch for me.

426
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,080
Miss Su,

427
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:38,050
why don't you give it a second thought?

428
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:43,890
Miss Su?

429
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:45,250
Who is that?

430
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,670
Guan Hemeng, the Miracle Healer with Needles,

431
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,500
is good at acupuncture.

432
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,460
When we arrived at the villa,

433
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,020
we saw you chasing someone with moxibustion tools.

434
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,020
That's not the treatment

435
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,590
Guan Hemeng would use.

436
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,460
When you first saw the body,

437
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,900
you didn't have any idea about the cause of death.

438
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,810
You were even surprised by the Tree Man Syndrome.

439
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:04,830
So I guess

440
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,370
you don't know medicine at all.

441
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,060
So?

442
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,420
The Yuanbao Villa is worldwide famous.

443
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,660
That's why

444
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,550
all the great physicians in the martial world are gathered there.

445
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,480
Everyone knows that.

446
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,230
You pretend to be Guan Hemeng

447
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,940
and no one came to blow your cover.

448
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,670
It means Guan Hemeng knows about it.

449
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:24,900
Anything else?

450
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,760
You mentioned Su Wencai before.

451
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,350
So my guess

452
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,920
is that you're Physician Guan's sworn sister,

453
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,020
Su Wencai's granddaughter,

454
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,140
Su Xiaoyong.

455
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:37,980
You're so smart.

456
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:38,870
Yes.

457
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,490
[Su Xiaomeng]

458
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,560
I'm Su Xiaoyong.

459
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,250
What?

460
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,930
You're a girl?

461
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,620
Yep.

462
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,390
You searched her bag

463
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,700
and groped her.

464
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,030
If the princess finds out,

465
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,670
how will you explain?

466
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,220
I didn't know…

467
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:57,890
Wait.

468
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,000
Why should I explain to the princess?

469
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,530
I never said I'd marry her.

470
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,500
That's nonsense.

471
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,010
That night, Jian Lingxiao

472
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,040
saw you sneaking out.

473
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,250
I guess you were going somewhere out of view

474
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,060
to wash up.

475
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:14,740
Yes.

476
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,730
I'm curious about the opal skull

477
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:17,870
so I came to see it.

478
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:20,570
I didn't expect to be recognized.

479
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:23,780
Li Lianhua.

480
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,140
Are you going to use my real identity to threaten me

481
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,870
into helping you?

482
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,460
I'm not that kind of person.

483
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,400
I can help you,

484
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,080
not because I'm afraid that you'll expose me,

485
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,900
but because

486
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:38,790
I like you.

487
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:44,460
You…

488
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,260
I…

489
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,280
There is a rule in the Su family in Jinling.

490
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,230
The Su family's daughters don't give out gifts easily.

491
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,500
When we do,

492
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,010
the gift is a token of love.

493
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,850
You accepted my golden needles.

494
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,000
You're mine now.

495
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,300
What's so funny?

496
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,160
Stop eating.

497
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:04,590
It's all because of him.

498
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,980
It's because I need to feed him

499
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,900
that I accepted those needles.

500
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,210
I'm an honest man.

501
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,290
Why would I do something like that?

502
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:11,300
So it's all your fault.

503
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,220
Li Lianhua,

504
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,640
how could you talk to her like that?

505
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,260
I think Miss Su is nice.

506
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,150
You won't lose anything.

507
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,420
Miss Su,

508
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,860
to be honest,

509
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,580
I'm engaged.

510
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:27,970
Besides,

511
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,150
-I…
-He's not engaged.

512
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,550
He never mentioned it before.

513
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,850
And when he met you for the first time,

We don't need to get married immediately.

I've told Li Lianhua everything I know.

I really don't have the opal skull.

why can't you get off my back?

Rest assured.

those pedals you stepped

You're right.

589
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,330

on Jin Mantang's hand

by the blood under his nails.

So I didn't pay much attention to it.

those bees outside your room

597
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,490
were not there by accident.

598

You planted those flowers

You set me up,

602
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,650
so you must know

603
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,720
that I don't have the opal skull.

when I pretended to be Miss Zhiyu,

610
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,000
I found that you didn't want to kill her,

611
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,900
so it's clear

612
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,540
that you tried to snatch her away

613
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,780
because you wanted

614
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,020
to get the opal skull from her.

685
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:11,810
It seems

686
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,480
that Dong Ling

687
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,030
was related to the Jin family too.

688
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,990
That's also my guess.

689
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,640
I didn't expect

690
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,990
Jin Mantang to be so cold-hearted.

691
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,950
He'd rather watch his family die

692
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,820
than take out the opal skull.

693
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,560
I learned from Miss Zhiyu

694
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,770
that every few days,

695
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,140
Jin Mantang drank her blood from the opal skull

696
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:37,370
to suppress his symptoms.

697
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,750
It's so cruel

698
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,110
to hurt a girl like that.

699
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:42,970
Jian,

700
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,320
you're a kind physician.

701
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,700
I'm sure you can't bring yourself to do that

702
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,230
if you get the opal skull.

703
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,350
We're not making any progress.

704
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,440
It's not that bad.

705
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:01,320
At least we're sure

706
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,510
that Dong Ling

707
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,640
had been trapped

708
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,480
in that secret room since half a month ago.

709
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,620
Now we need to figure out

710
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:10,060
how he survived in the secret room.

711
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,400
Withered agave

712
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,180
can cause nausea

713
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,250
and weakness in legs and hands.

714
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,620
But Dong Ling broke the back of his head

715
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,570
and died from excessive bleeding.

716
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:22,970
Not on the day we arrived,

717
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,430
but since half a month ago.

718
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,310
Miss Su,

719
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:28,570
can you

720
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,670
do me another favor?

721
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:37,860
Why did you send Su Xiaoyong

722
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,020
back to the secret room?

723
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,120
We didn't find any clues there.

724
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,070
Do you count on her to find anything?

725
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,730
So I asked her to bring an assistant with her.

726
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,270
Assistant?

727
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:47,930
Here you are.

728
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,070
Look.

729
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,700
Bun crumbs?

730
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,420
So the assistant you brought with you

731
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,650
helped a lot.

732
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,390
Dude,

733
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:08,740
I'm counting on you.

734
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,110
Li Lianhua is so smart.

735
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:34,699
He thought of using a rat to find clues.

736
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:36,860
Fang Xiaobao.

737
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,360
You asked me why Dong Ling didn't starve to death

738
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,070
after being trapped there for so many days.

739
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,489
This is the answer.

740
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:46,139
Someone sent him food.

741
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:48,389
But wasn't Jin Mantang the only one

742
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,340
who could open the door of the secret room?

743
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,000
Is there…

744
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,000
Su Xiaoyong.

745
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,530
Did you find these crumbs

746
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,699
near the wall facing the courtyard?

747
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,350
How did you know that?

748
00:35:02,739 --> 00:35:03,860
Is there an uneven place

749
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,300
somewhere high on the wall?

750
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:15,880
Yes!

751
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,530
There must be a vent

752
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:18,700
up there.

753
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,030
It's simple.

754
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,300
Someone sent food to Dong Ling

755
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,320
from that vent.

756
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,350
That's how he survived.

757
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,480
Later, to cover his tracks,

758
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,430
that guy blocked the vent again.

759
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,840
In that case,

760
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,890
the guy who helped Dong Ling is the most suspicious.

761
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,780
He helped Dong Ling stay alive

762
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,000
so that he and Jin Mantang could kill each other.

763
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:49,750
It's not that simple.

764
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:51,200
There are also cinders.

765
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,220
Cinders.

766
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,130
Food.

767
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:56,760
The blocked vent.

768
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,620
Did Dong Ling die of smoke inhalation

769
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,320
instead of poison?

770
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,320
Smoke?

771
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,100
The guy who sent him food

772
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,730
burned charcoal near the vent after his goal was achieved.

773
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,790
Dong Ling inhaled a lot of smoke.

774
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,310
After he fainted,

775
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:13,930
he hit his head

776
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,480
and died from excessive bleeding.

777
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,890
I've been confused about it.

778
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,610
Dong Ling was indeed wounded

779
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,510
by a poisonous arrow

780
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:39,890
but the wound was shallow

781
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,390
and Dong Ling had strong internal force.

782
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:44,620
How could a little bit of poison knock him out?

783
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,350
I didn't find traces of any other poisons,

784
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:48,380
so

785
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:49,660
I ignored it.

786
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:50,860
That's it.

787
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,280
Now we can explain

788
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,330
why Jin Mantang was wearing only one shoe.

789
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,790
The door of the secret room opens from the inside

790
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,450
with a formation instead of a key.

791
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,060
So Dong Ling

792
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,330
couldn't find a key

793
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,360
even if he searched Jin Mantang all over.

794
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,410
Keep your voice down.

795
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,770
That guy knew that he could send Dong Ling food

796
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,380
through the vent.

797
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,840
So he must be someone

798
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,020
living in the Yuanbao Villa.

799
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,420
You're right.

800
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,470
But there are so many servants

801
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,580
in the Yuanbao Villa.

802
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:23,450
Who could it be?

803
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:31,980
Li Lianhua.

804
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:32,980
Where are we going now?

805
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:34,790
Fang Xiaobao.

806
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:35,940
Have you forgotten

807
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:36,970
the cinders just now?

808
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,270
What's wrong with the cinders?

809
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,020
Take a closer look at them.

810
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,370
They're soft and gray.

811
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,260
They're the cinders of silver coal.

812
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,300
So what?

813
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,820
It's not winter yet.

814
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,870
Coal

815
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,290
is kept in the warehouse now.

816
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,310
So who was the guy

817
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,290
stealing silver coal in this season?

818
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,740
The butler Jin Changbao.

819
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,610
He's the only one who has the key to the warehouse.

820
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,340
Yes.

821
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:07,350
Zongzheng Mingzhu searched the entire Yuanbao Villa

822
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:08,780
but couldn't find the opal skull.

823
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,220
Perhaps the opal skull

824
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,680
has never left

825
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,980
Jin Mantang's room.

826
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:16,670
I got it.

827
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,250
I'll go to the Yuanbao Villa now.

828
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,670
Wait!

829
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,140
I heard that you're guests of the Yuanbao Villa.

830
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,990
Here are the medicines

831
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,720
that Master Jin used to take.

832
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,620
For some reason,

833
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,150
Butler Jin hasn't come to take them.

834
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,170
Jin Mantang's medicines?

835
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,060
Yes.

836
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,300
Could you please take them

837
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,420
to the Yuanbao Villa for me?

838
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,120
The dose is different every day.

839
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:44,210
I've marked them.

840
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,480
Give them to me.

841
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,050
Okay.

842
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:49,440
Why are there two bags of every medicine?

843
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,350
At first,

844
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:53,050
one bag per day was enough.

845
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,370
Later,

846
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,500
Butler Jin said

847
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:57,700
Master Jin's condition worsened

848
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,790
and the physician they consulted suggested increasing the dosage.

849
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:03,030
So the dosage was doubled.

850
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,710
I've been keeping an eye on

851
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,490
the medicines Jin Mantang took.

852
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,910
Judging from the prescription,

853
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,630
it indeed helps with the Tree Man Syndrome.

854
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,320
But from what I could tell,

855
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,300
he didn't take two doses of medicine every day.

856
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:14,950
That's weird.

857
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,870
Butler Jin told me in person

858
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:19,240
to double the dosage.

859
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:20,820
Did Jin Changbao

860
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:23,670
come to take the medicines himself?

861
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:24,370
Yes.

862
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,120
Butler Jin is loyal to Master Jin.

863
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:30,680
He did all these small things himself.

864
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:31,870
Li Lianhua.

865
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:32,890
Does…

866
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:35,100
Does Jin Changbao has the Tree Man Syndrome too?

867
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,250
Is he Jin Mantang's half-brother too?

868
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:47,490
[Yuanbao Villa]

869
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,380
The commander has banned

870
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,750
you two from entering.

871
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,720
We've found an important clue.

872
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:48,780
If you don't let us in

873
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,420
and cause the suspect to run away,

874
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,030
the Supervision Bureau will be held accountable.

875
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,020
We let you go last time

876
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,950
as a favor to Minister Fang.

877
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,290
Please leave.

878
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:56,830
You…

879
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,020
Li.

880
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:03,620
Fang.

881
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,100
Yang.

882
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,330
I heard that Zongzheng Mingzhu

883
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,360
is here with men from the Supervision Bureau.

884
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:06,950
I'm worried

885
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,240
so I came to check it out.

886
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,940
The Supervision Bureau

887
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,970
is now in the charge of a criminal.

888
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,550
I wonder

889
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,110
whether the founders of the Supervision Bureau

890
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,010
are turning in their graves.

891
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:18,440
Forget it.

892
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,300
We have other things to do.

893
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,580
But…

894
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:22,550
Something's wrong.

895
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,310
Something's wrong.

896
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,510
Deputy Commander Yang, something's wrong.

897
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:27,600
What happened?

898
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,190
The butler of the Yuanbao Villa, Jin Changbao,

899
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,400
hung himself.

900
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,610
How dare you come in?

901
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:43,550
Yang Yunchun?

902
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,170
Why did you collude with these two impostors

903
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,200
with ulterior motives?

904
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:51,080
I saw Miss Shi Shui from the Baichuan Court

905
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:52,420
assigning tasks to Fang Duobing.

906
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:53,670
He's not an impostor.

907
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,310
These two guys are suspicious

908
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,450
and I kicked them out.

909
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,540
You're just the deputy commander.

910
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,360
I'm your superior.

911
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,080
How dare you disobey my order?

912
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:02,410
I'm just the deputy commander

913
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,110
but I was granted the title of the Royal Dragon

914
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,110
and have the Royal Dragon Badge.

915
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,140
I can act independently.

916
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:06,640
You…

917
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,530
I heard

918
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,950
that something happened to Butler Jin.

919
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,610
If there's nothing else,

920
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,730
I need to go in for a check.

921
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,050
Fang Xiaobao.

922
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:20,550
He's much more powerful than the Baichuan Court.

923
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,380
What happened?

924
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,670
Why did he suddenly commit suicide?

925
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,160
Perhaps Butler Jin went mad

926
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,390
because he was too sad about Master Jin's death.

927
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:47,160
In the past few days,

928
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,400
he was either absent-minded

929
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,920
or very emotional.

930
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:51,740
He cried and laughed,

931
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:54,550
keeping mumbling things like "Why can't I?"

932
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:57,390
and "Why didn't it work?"

933
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:06,940
A few days ago,

934
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,750
I started treating Butler Jin's condition.

935
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,540
The needles on his head

936
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,960
were used by me

937
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:15,530
to alleviate his depression.

938
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,120
Unexpectedly,

939
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,010
after performing acupuncture on him,

940
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,310
I went out to prepare his medicine

941
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:23,390
and was told that Butler Jin killed himself.

942
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,930
What a pity.

943
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,050
It's indeed a pity.

944
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:31,550
We planned to ask him some questions.

945
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,210
Mr. Gongyang,

946
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:34,350
it seems

947
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,560
that I have to find the answers myself.

948
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:03,460
He…

949
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,360
Sure enough, Jin Changbao had the Tree Man Syndrome.
