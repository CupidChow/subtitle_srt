Physician Li,

5
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,190
may I have a word with you?

6
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,450
Li Lianhua, come here.

7
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,200
I got something for you.

8
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,220
This is Wuxiang Golden Needles.

9
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,800
They were used by the Immortal Healer in Dazhou a hundred years ago.

10
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,920
They can cure every disease

11
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,289
and be used for acupuncture.

12
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,640
It took my grandpa a long time

13
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,780
to find this set of needles.

14
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,960
You helped me just now.

15
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,130
Take it as a thank-you gift.

16
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,330
Guan,

17
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,780
I don't think it's proper.

18
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,300
I insist.

19
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:21,930
Then thank you, Guan.

20
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,700
You flatterer.

21
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,130
After I go back home,

22
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,980
I can give you a dozen better needles.

23
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,700
That'll be too late.

24
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,570
He's childish.

25
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,070
You're much better than him.

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,040
We're here to investigate the case.

27
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,290
Why are you following us?

28
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,860
I'm not following you.

29
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,100
I'm following Li Lianhua.

30
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,310
Besides,

31
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,700
I'm here to investigate the case too.

What's that?

36
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,010
I prepared clean clothes

37
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,210
for Master Jin.

38
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:15,980
I'll put them on for him.

39
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,860
How did Dong Ling come in

40
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,350
without triggering the Thousand Bell Formation?

41
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,700
Had he been hiding in this secret room?

42
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,140
The last time we came here,

43
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,870
the comb was right up there.

44
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,950
He had checked all the treasures.

45
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,620
Why didn't he notice it?

46
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:55,740
Look.

Date of pawning.

50
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,090
This is a pawn ticket.

51
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,050
It's all black. How could you tell?

52
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,870
Let me have a look at it.

53
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,230
Guan.

54
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,320
There were lots of people here

55
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,140
so I didn't notice this incense burner.

56
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:31,070
Take a look.

57
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,460
Jin Mantang owned a pawn shop

58
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,070
so it's not surprising that he had pawn tickets.

59
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,840
There's more than one kind of incense in it.

60
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,470
Inhaling it for a long time causes dizziness.

61
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,360
This is a kind of knockout incense

62

with a woody scent.

63
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,659
Careful.

64
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,020
Was this incense

65
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,060
used to knock out Jin Mantang

66
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,590
before he got strangled to death?

67
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,290
Or did Jin Mantang

68
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,580
plan to use this incense

69
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,830
to deal with Dong Ling?

70
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,900
Unfortunately, I don't know the name of this incense.

71
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,610
Otherwise, we can get more clues.

72
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,460
If only

He definitely knows what this is.

76

That old man is a grumpy wanderer.

77
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,580
It's almost impossible to ask him questions.

78
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,640
So forget about him.

79
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,930
There's something you don't know.

80
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,330
Su Wencai's granddaughter is my sworn sister.

He won't refuse to help me.

82
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,040
You've been quiet. What are you thinking?

83
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,380
I think I've smelled

84
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:45,659
this scent before.

85
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,210
Woody scent.

86
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:51,750
Yes.

87
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,190
The woody scent you mentioned,

88
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,820
Miss Zhiyu smelled like it.

89
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,159
It can't be a coincidence.

90
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,480
Bracelets.

91
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,159
What bracelets?

92
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,840
Something is wrong with her bracelets.

93
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,780
Let's go.

94
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,000
She's gone.

95
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:31,810
Let's split up to find her.

96
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:32,870
Okay.

97
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,110
Wait.

98
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,020
Miss Zhiyu.

99
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,450
Where are you going in that outfit?

100
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,780
You went to Jin Mantang's room last night.

101
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,340
Was the knockout incense your doing?

102
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,620
N-No.

103
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,390
You smelled like the knockout incense.

104
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,450
Your foster father just died.

105
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,340
As his daughter,

106
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:03,650
instead of waiting to attend his funeral,

107
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,970
you tried to escape in disguise.

108
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,780
What happened between you and Jin Mantang?

109
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,090
You won't talk?

110
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,260
You wore so many bracelets

111
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,700
to cover

112
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,900
the scratches left by Jin Mantang, right?

113
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,660
She thinks she can get away with it.

114
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,540
What are you doing?

115
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,020
The murderer has been found.

116
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,700
She shall be locked in the woodshed

117
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,660
and interrogated.

118
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,110
Take her away.

119
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:39,770
Yes.

120
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,580
I really hate to hurt

121
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,580
a beautiful girl like you.

122
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,210
Tell me.

123
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,159
Where is the opal skull?

124
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,290
I don't know.

125
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,820
I didn't kill anyone.

126
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,580
I didn't take the opal skull.

127
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:10,990
Guess we have to do this the hard way.

128
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,320
You can't punish her without trial.

129
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,070
If someone files a complaint about it in the court,

130
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,180
do you think His Majesty will be infuriated?

131
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,950
Keep an eye on her.

132
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,800
No one is allowed to come near her.

133
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,000
She can't eat or drink

134
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,140
until she confesses.

135
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,180
Let's see how long she can last.

136
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,550
Mr. Fang.

137
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:43,280
Please.

138
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,120
Oh, no.

139
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:27,610
Stop!

140
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,700
Guan, are you all right?

141
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,850
I'm fine.

142
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,940
Miss Zhiyu, come out.

143
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:47,930
Youâ€¦

144
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,980
What's going on?

145
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,480
We thought

146
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,580
Miss Zhiyu wore those bracelets

147
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,300
to cover the scratches Jin Mantang left when he struggled.

148
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,000
But it turned out that we were wrong.

149
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,210
Those are knife wounds.

150
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,010
So you made a wrong judgment?

151
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,770
Sorry that we misunderstood you.

152
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,640
Then how did Miss Zhiyu get those wounds

153
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,380
and why did she have the woody scent?

154
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:29,810
Miss,

155
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,170
say something.

156
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,690
How can we help you if you don't tell us anything?

157
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,620
At this point,

158
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,310
I can tell you the truth.

159
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,840
Everyone thinks I'm Jin Mantang's adopted daughter

160
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,950
and lives a carefree

161
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,980
and luxurious life.

162
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,010
But in fact,

163
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,830
he just wanted my blood to make medicine.

164
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,340
What? Your blood?

165
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,060
After I was sold to the Yuanbao Villa when I was six,

166
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,850
I had to take dozens of herbs every day.

167
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,790
After a decade, my blood became his nostrum.

168
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,180
He used incense

169
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,220
to knock me out every few days

170
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:07,650
so I wouldn't feel the pain

171
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,340
when he took my blood.

172
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,450
He soaked herbs in my blood

173
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,240
and drank them from the opal skull.

174
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,980
He believed that could cure his disease.

175
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,120
Is that true?

176
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,980
Can't believe

177
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,700
there's such a cruel treatment in the world.

178
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,590
Jin Mantang was heartless!

179
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,240
Someone like him

180
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,460
deserved a tragic death.

181
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,360
What was his disease?

182
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,520
He never talked about it

183
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,080
and never trusted anyone.

184
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,410
Neither did he ever use the opal skull

185
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,680
in front of me.

186
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,730
Since that's the case,

187
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,240
why didn't you tell us the truth?

188
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,980
Why did you disguise yourself and run away?

189
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,180
I was worried that what he did to me

190
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,420
would be revealed sooner or later

191
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,040
and I'd be suspected of killing him.

192
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,980
On the night Jin Mantang died,

193
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,110
you went to his room to give him your blood.

194
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,750
That's why you and his room

195
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,500
had that woody scent.

196
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,170
After you left,

197
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,610
he deactivated the Thousand Bell Formation and led me in.

198
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,460
I left after he took my blood.

199
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,700
I really didn't do anything.

200
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,100
Try to recall that night.

201
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,240
Before Jin Mantang died,

202
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,620
was there something off with him?

203
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,460
Yes.

204
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,120
He usually took his time when he took my blood,

205
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,970
but he was absent-minded that night

206
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,980
as if he was in a hurry to do something else.

207
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,710
He even got blood under his nails.

208
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,850
I guess Jin Mantang

209
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,970
was in a hurry to go to the secret room

210
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,010
to check on Dong Ling.

211
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,060
So you still think

212
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,420
before we set the Thousand Bell Formation,

213
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,190
Dong Ling had already been in the room.

214
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,260
Not on the day we arrived.

215
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,140
He'd been there

216
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,570
since half a month ago.

217
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:12,770
Was Dong Ling from Zhuzhou?

218
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,980
How did you know that?

219
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,180
That pawn ticket.

220
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,650
I got it.

221
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,840
Dong Ling must have pawned something

222
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,050
in Jin Mantang's shop when he was young.

223
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,740
Now he wanted to redeem it.

224
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,730
Maybe it was the opal skull.

225
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,190
But Jin Mantang refused to return it to him.

226
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,250
That's how they became enemies.

227
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,510
Here is my guess.

228
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,430
Dong Ling threatened Jin Mantang,

229
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,570
but Jin Mantang didn't use the ransom note

230
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,530
as solid evidence to turn him in.

231
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,860
It means that Dong Ling had long been under his control.

232
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,870
It's not that Dong Ling hid in the secret room to get back at Jin Mantang

233
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:49,670
but that Jin Mantang

234
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,570
managed to hold Dong Ling captive.

235
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,360
Dong Ling came to see Master Jin.

236
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,690
Luckily, Master Jin took him down using the arrow hidden in his sleeve.

237
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,490
He reacted swiftly

238
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,630
or he'd have been hurt by Dong Ling.

239
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,840
No one saw it coming

240
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,180
so we didn't arrive in time

241
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,100
and let Dong Ling run away.

242
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,940
After that, we guards got flogged by the butler

243
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,100
for our negligence.

244
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:07,940
Yes.

245
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,220
Everyone in the Yuanbao Villa

246
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,920
said Dong Ling was chased away by Jin Mantang.

247
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,580
But no one saw it with their own eyes.

248
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,280
So,

249
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,870
Jin Mantang was lying.

250
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:19,970
It doesn't make sense.

251
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,650
Dong Ling was good at martial arts.

252
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,460
Jin Mantang was no match for him.

253
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,880
How could he take him captive?

254
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,820
Don't you remember this?

255
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,450
This empty box was on the floor.

256
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,130
Why is it up there now?

257
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,420
I thought

258
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,310
a third person entered the secret room

259
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,890
and took away the thing in the box.

260
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,320
But if someone tried to come in,

261
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,060
the Thousand Bell Formation at the door

262
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,030
would definitely be triggered.

263
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,140
The empty box?

264
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,400
It was a bait Jin Mantang used to distract Dong Ling.

265
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:57,420
Hurry!

266
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,290
Don't get clever with me.

267
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,270
Iâ€¦

268
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,910
I've promised to give it to you.

269
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,700
There's nothing you need to worry about.

270
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,700
Where is the opal skull?

271
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:09,930
Over there.

272
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,580
In that box.

273
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:17,490
You played me!

274
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:21,980
Jin Mantang!

275
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,060
Let me out!

276
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:23,940
Jin Mantang!

277
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,420
Half a month later,

278
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,320
Jin Mantang thought Dong Ling was dead,

279
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,270
so he was in a hurry to check it out.

280
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,220
But he didn't expect that

281
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,740
Dong Ling was still alive.

282
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,700
So Zongzheng Mingzhu was right.

283
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,340
They killed each other.

284
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,820
It's not that simple.

285
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,200
Why was Dong Ling still alive

286
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,150
after being trapped here for half a month?

287
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,580
He even still had the strength to strangle Jin Mantang.

288
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,070
And why was Jin Mantang

289
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,030
wearing only one shoe?

290
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,240
In my opinion,

291
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,840
just because there is no trace

292
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,610
of a third person in the secret room

293
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,210
doesn't mean there wasn't a third person

294
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,390
in this story.

295
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,220
Could it be that man in black?

296
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,740
Why did he want Miss Zhiyu dead?

297
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,100
Maybe

298
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,140
he wanted a scapegoat.

299
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,450
It's also possible

300
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,120
that he didn't get what he wanted.

301
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,100
It seems that only by catching that man in black

302
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,530
can we find out the truth.

303
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,340
So that was a trap you set.

304
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,410
It's my fault

305
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,890
that he escaped.

306
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,300
I can't help but wonder

307
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,230
if you two are on his side.

308
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,380
Fang Duobing.

309
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,160
Don't let him escape next time.

310
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,820
There's no next time.

311
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,180
You again.

312
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,820
You beat my subordinates

313
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:48,850
and took away the suspect.

314
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,410
What do you want?

315
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,340
Miss Zhiyu isn't the murderer.

316
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,280
We're here

317
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,570
to find out the truth.

318
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,950
Find out the truth?

319
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,310
I've sent someone to check

320
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,030
the payroll of the Baichuan Court.

321
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,100
Fang Duobing,

322
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,180
you're a downright impostor!

323
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,110
You don't have the right to conduct an investigation here.

324
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,990
[Yuanbao Villa]

325
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,010
Get lost!

326
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,319
Zongzheng Mingzhu!

327
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,859
Open the door!

328
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,310
I was sent here by the Baichuan Court!

329
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,200
I'm an authorized detective!

330
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,550
How dare you call me an impostor?

331
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,310
That's a wild accusation!

332
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,040
Fang Duobing.

333
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:28,940
Calm down.

334
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:29,890
I'm not done yet.

335
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,780
Zongzheng Mingzhu, listen carefully!

336
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,060
You violated the laws

337
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,060
and got away with it.

338
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,980
I don't care what you want this time.

339
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,380
You can't get off the hook!

340
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,180
I'll get to the bottom of it

341
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,700
and throw you into jail!

342
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:41,670
Let's wait and see!

343
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:46,510
I'm so mad.

344
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,680
-I'm so mad.
-So hot-blooded.

345
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,020
No.

346
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,700
In just a few days,

347
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,700
even if the Gang Qi in his body is dispersed,

348
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,430
he won't be able to practice martial arts again.

349
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,630
We must find the opal skull as soon as possible.

350
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:22,820
Zongzheng Mingzhu!

351
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,480
Morning.

352
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,170
Does your throat feel better?

353
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,370
I'll write a letter to the Baichuan Court.

354
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,140
I've solved three cases.

355
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,020
They must keep their promise.

356
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,190
I'd rather die than be humiliated like that again!

357
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,750
Wait. Iâ€¦

358
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,380
Fox Spirit.

359
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,320
Guan.

360
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:57,970
Well,

361
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,140
what brought you here?

362
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,150
I'm here to visit you

363
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:02,710
and the impostor.

364
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,860
I know you want to know

365
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,530
the situation in the Yuanbao Villa.

366
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,030
You know what?

367
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,980
Zongzheng Mingzhu is worried

368
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,550
that someone may sneak the opal skull out

369
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,320
and searched me before letting me go.

370
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,220
Is he still

371
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,700
grilling Miss Zhiyu?

372
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:21,510
Yes.

373
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,200
He said he couldn't risk releasing a murderer.

374
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,940
He's still searching for the opal skull

375
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,380
in the Yuanbao Villa.

376
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,180
Everyone is cooperative.

377
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,660
They all want to find the murderer

378
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,800
and seek justice for Jin Mantang.

379
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,900
They're all very righteous.

380
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,360
But Butler Jin is in a bad mood.

381
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,320
I don't know if it's because

382
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,190
he's grieving over Jin Mantang's death.

383
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,310
Since last night,

384
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,250
he's been devastated.

385
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,400
He wouldn't talk to anyone.

386
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,270
Were they so close?

387
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,350
I didn't expect you

388
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,520
to love flowers too.

389
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,860
I just like to use flowers as medicine.

390
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,370
You're a physician too.

391
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,460
You should know

392
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,350
the medical value of these flowers.

393
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,620
Li Lianhua.

394
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,720
What are you thinking?

395
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,580
It's the first time you came to my place.

396
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,120
Come.

397
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,410
I'll cook for you.

398
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,640
Not for you.

399
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,220
Li Lianhua,

400
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,260
you're actually such a great cook.

401
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,160
Eat.

402
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,060
You're not only a great physician

403
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:40,700
but also a well-mannered man

404
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:41,880
who's good at cooking.

405
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,350
Pork tripe with chicken.

406
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,620
Braised fish.

407
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,140
What's wrong with you?

408
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,420
I asked you to make them so many times but you never did.

409
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,600
Now you made them for her willingly.

410
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,940
So delicious.

411
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,300
Don't be rude to the guest.

412
00:20:59,230 --> 00:20:59,710
Slow down.

413
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:05,240
Guan.

414
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,740
To be honest,

415
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,420
now that we were kicked out of the Yuanbao Villa,

416
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,920
it's hard for us to continue with the investigation.

417
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,420
Since you can still go there,

418
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,280
why don't you

419
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,430
be our man on the inside?

420
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,240
What do you think?

421
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,440
Wellâ€¦

422
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,130
I need to think about it.

423
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,420
After all, I'm a big name

424
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,080
in the martial world.

425
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,850
I don't do people favors just because they make lunch for me.

426
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,080
Miss Su,

427
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:38,050
why don't you give it a second thought?

428
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:43,890
Miss Su?

429
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:45,250
Who is that?

430
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,670
Guan Hemeng, the Miracle Healer with Needles,

431
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,500
is good at acupuncture.

432
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,460
When we arrived at the villa,

433
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,020
we saw you chasing someone with moxibustion tools.

434
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,020
That's not the treatment

435
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,590
Guan Hemeng would use.

436
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,460
When you first saw the body,

437
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,900
you didn't have any idea about the cause of death.

438
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,810
You were even surprised by the Tree Man Syndrome.

439
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:04,830
So I guess

440
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,370
you don't know medicine at all.

441
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,060
So?

442
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,420
The Yuanbao Villa is worldwide famous.

443
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,660
That's why

444
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,550
all the great physicians in the martial world are gathered there.

445
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,480
Everyone knows that.

446
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,230
You pretend to be Guan Hemeng

447
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,940
and no one came to blow your cover.

448
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,670
It means Guan Hemeng knows about it.

449
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:24,900
Anything else?

450
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,760
You mentioned Su Wencai before.

451
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,350
So my guess

452
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,920
is that you're Physician Guan's sworn sister,

453
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,020
Su Wencai's granddaughter,

454
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,140
Su Xiaoyong.

455
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:37,980
You're so smart.

456
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:38,870
Yes.

457
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,490
[Su Xiaomeng]

458
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,560
I'm Su Xiaoyong.

459
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,250
What?

460
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,930
You're a girl?

461
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,620
Yep.

462
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,390
You searched her bag

463
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,700
and groped her.

464
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,030
If the princess finds out,

465
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,670
how will you explain?

466
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,220
I didn't knowâ€¦

467
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:57,890
Wait.

468
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,000
Why should I explain to the princess?

469
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,530
I never said I'd marry her.

470
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,500
That's nonsense.

471
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,010
That night, Jian Lingxiao

472
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,040
saw you sneaking out.

473
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,250
I guess you were going somewhere out of view

474
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,060
to wash up.

475
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:14,740
Yes.

476
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,730
I'm curious about the opal skull

477
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:17,870
so I came to see it.

478
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:20,570
I didn't expect to be recognized.

479
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:23,780
Li Lianhua.

480
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,140
Are you going to use my real identity to threaten me

481
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,870
into helping you?

482
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,460
I'm not that kind of person.

483
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,400
I can help you,

484
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,080
not because I'm afraid that you'll expose me,

485
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,900
but because

486
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:38,790
I like you.

487
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:44,460
Youâ€¦

488
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,260
Iâ€¦

489
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,280
There is a rule in the Su family in Jinling.

490
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,230
The Su family's daughters don't give out gifts easily.

491
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,500
When we do,

492
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,010
the gift is a token of love.

493
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,850
You accepted my golden needles.

494
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,000
You're mine now.

495
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,300
What's so funny?

496
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,160
Stop eating.

497
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:04,590
It's all because of him.

498
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,980
It's because I need to feed him

499
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,900
that I accepted those needles.

500
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,210
I'm an honest man.

501
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,290
Why would I do something like that?

502
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:11,300
So it's all your fault.

503
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,220
Li Lianhua,

504
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,640
how could you talk to her like that?

505
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,260
I think Miss Su is nice.

506
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,150
You won't lose anything.

507
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,420
Miss Su,

508
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,860
to be honest,

509
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,580
I'm engaged.

510
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:27,970
Besides,

511
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,150
-Iâ€¦
-He's not engaged.

512
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,550
He never mentioned it before.

513
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,850
And when he met you for the first time,

514

he said you two hit it off

515
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:34,960
and he hoped he'd met you earlier.

I've told Li Lianhua everything I know.

I really don't have the opal skull.

those pedals you stepped

You're right.

those bees outside your room

597

were not there by accident.

598

You planted those flowers

You set me up,

that I don't have the opal skull.

when I pretended to be Miss Zhiyu,

610

I found that you didn't want to kill her,

611
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,900
so it's clear

612
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,540
that you tried to snatch her away

613
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,780
because you wanted

614
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,020
to get the opal skull from her.

and was never taken back to the Yuanbao Villa.

685
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:11,810
It seems

686
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,480
that Dong Ling

687
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,030
was related to the Jin family too.

688
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,990
That's also my guess.

689
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,640
I didn't expect

690
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,990
Jin Mantang to be so cold-hearted.

691
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,950
He'd rather watch his family die

692
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,820
than take out the opal skull.

693
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,560
I learned from Miss Zhiyu

694
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,770
that every few days,

695
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,140
Jin Mantang drank her blood from the opal skull

696
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:37,370
to suppress his symptoms.

697
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,750
It's so cruel

698
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,110
to hurt a girl like that.

699
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:42,970
Jian,

700
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,320
you're a kind physician.

701
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,700
I'm sure you can't bring yourself to do that

702
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,230
if you get the opal skull.

703
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,350
We're not making any progress.

704
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,440
It's not that bad.

705
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:01,320
At least we're sure

706
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,510
that Dong Ling

707
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,640
had been trapped

708
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,480
in that secret room since half a month ago.

709
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,620
Now we need to figure out

710
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:10,060
how he survived in the secret room.

711
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,400
Withered agave

712
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,180
can cause nausea

713
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,250
and weakness in legs and hands.

714
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,620
But Dong Ling broke the back of his head

715
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,570
and died from excessive bleeding.

716
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:22,970
Not on the day we arrived,

717
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,430
but since half a month ago.

718
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,310
Miss Su,

719
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:28,570
can you

720
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,670
do me another favor?

721
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:37,860
Why did you send Su Xiaoyong

722
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,020
back to the secret room?

723
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,120
We didn't find any clues there.

724
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,070
Do you count on her to find anything?

725
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,730
So I asked her to bring an assistant with her.

726
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,270
Assistant?

727
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:47,930
Here you are.

728
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,070
Look.

729
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,700
Bun crumbs?

730
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,420
So the assistant you brought with you

731
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,650
helped a lot.

732
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,390
Dude,

733
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:08,740
I'm counting on you.

734
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,110
Li Lianhua is so smart.

735
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:34,699
He thought of using a rat to find clues.

736
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:36,860
Fang Xiaobao.

737
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,360
You asked me why Dong Ling didn't starve to death

738
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,070
after being trapped there for so many days.

739
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,489
This is the answer.

740
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:46,139
Someone sent him food.

741
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:48,389
But wasn't Jin Mantang the only one

742
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,340
who could open the door of the secret room?

743
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,000
Is thereâ€¦

744
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,000
Su Xiaoyong.

745
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,530
Did you find these crumbs

746
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,699
near the wall facing the courtyard?

747
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,350
How did you know that?

748
00:35:02,739 --> 00:35:03,860
Is there an uneven place

749
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,300
somewhere high on the wall?

750
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:15,880
Yes!

751
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,530
There must be a vent

752
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:18,700
up there.

753
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,030
It's simple.

754
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,300
Someone sent food to Dong Ling

755
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,320
from that vent.

756
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,350
That's how he survived.

757
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,480
Later, to cover his tracks,

758
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,430
that guy blocked the vent again.

759
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,840
In that case,

760
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,890
the guy who helped Dong Ling is the most suspicious.

761
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,780
He helped Dong Ling stay alive

762
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,000
so that he and Jin Mantang could kill each other.

763
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:49,750
It's not that simple.

764
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:51,200
There are also cinders.

765
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,220
Cinders.

766
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,130
Food.

767
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:56,760
The blocked vent.

768
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,620
Did Dong Ling die of smoke inhalation

769
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,320
instead of poison?

770
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,320
Smoke?

771
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,100
The guy who sent him food

772
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,730
burned charcoal near the vent after his goal was achieved.

773
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,790
Dong Ling inhaled a lot of smoke.

774
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,310
After he fainted,

775
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:13,930
he hit his head

776
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,480
and died from excessive bleeding.

777
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,890
I've been confused about it.

778
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,610
Dong Ling was indeed wounded

779
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,510
by a poisonous arrow

780
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:39,890
but the wound was shallow

781
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,390
and Dong Ling had strong internal force.

782
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:44,620
How could a little bit of poison knock him out?

783
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,350
I didn't find traces of any other poisons,

784
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:48,380
so

785
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:49,660
I ignored it.

786
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:50,860
That's it.

787
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,280
Now we can explain

788
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,330
why Jin Mantang was wearing only one shoe.

789
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,790
The door of the secret room opens from the inside

790
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,450
with a formation instead of a key.

791
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,060
So Dong Ling

792
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,330
couldn't find a key

793
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,360
even if he searched Jin Mantang all over.

794
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,410
Keep your voice down.

795
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,770
That guy knew that he could send Dong Ling food

796
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,380
through the vent.

797
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,840
So he must be someone

798
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,020
living in the Yuanbao Villa.

799
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,420
You're right.

800
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,470
But there are so many servants

801
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,580
in the Yuanbao Villa.

802
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:23,450
Who could it be?

803
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:31,980
Li Lianhua.

804
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:32,980
Where are we going now?

805
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:34,790
Fang Xiaobao.

806
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:35,940
Have you forgotten

807
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:36,970
the cinders just now?

808
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,270
What's wrong with the cinders?

809
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,020
Take a closer look at them.

810
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,370
They're soft and gray.

811
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,260
They're the cinders of silver coal.

812
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,300
So what?

813
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,820
It's not winter yet.

814
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,870
Coal

815
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,290
is kept in the warehouse now.

816
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,310
So who was the guy

817
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,290
stealing silver coal in this season?

818
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,740
The butler Jin Changbao.

819
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,610
He's the only one who has the key to the warehouse.

820
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,340
Yes.

821
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:07,350
Zongzheng Mingzhu searched the entire Yuanbao Villa

822
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:08,780
but couldn't find the opal skull.

823
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,220
Perhaps the opal skull

824
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,680
has never left

825
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,980
Jin Mantang's room.

826
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:16,670
I got it.

827
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,250
I'll go to the Yuanbao Villa now.

828
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,670
Wait!

829
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,140
I heard that you're guests of the Yuanbao Villa.

830
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,990
Here are the medicines

831
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,720
that Master Jin used to take.

832
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,620
For some reason,

833
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,150
Butler Jin hasn't come to take them.

834
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,170
Jin Mantang's medicines?

835
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,060
Yes.

836
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,300
Could you please take them

837
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,420
to the Yuanbao Villa for me?

838
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,120
The dose is different every day.

839
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:44,210
I've marked them.

840
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,480
Give them to me.

841
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,050
Okay.

842
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:49,440
Why are there two bags of every medicine?

843
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,350
At first,

844
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:53,050
one bag per day was enough.

845
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,370
Later,

846
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,500
Butler Jin said

847
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:57,700
Master Jin's condition worsened

848
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,790
and the physician they consulted suggested increasing the dosage.

849
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:03,030
So the dosage was doubled.

850
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,710
I've been keeping an eye on

851
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,490
the medicines Jin Mantang took.

852
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,910
Judging from the prescription,

853
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,630
it indeed helps with the Tree Man Syndrome.

854
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,320
But from what I could tell,

855
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,300
he didn't take two doses of medicine every day.

856
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:14,950
That's weird.

857
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,870
Butler Jin told me in person

858
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:19,240
to double the dosage.

859
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:20,820
Did Jin Changbao

860
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:23,670
come to take the medicines himself?

861
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:24,370
Yes.

862
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,120
Butler Jin is loyal to Master Jin.

863
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:30,680
He did all these small things himself.

864
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:31,870
Li Lianhua.

865
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:32,890
Doesâ€¦

866
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:35,100
Does Jin Changbao has the Tree Man Syndrome too?

867
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,250
Is he Jin Mantang's half-brother too?

868
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:47,490
[Yuanbao Villa]

869
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,380
The commander has banned

870
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,750
you two from entering.

871
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,720
We've found an important clue.

872
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:48,780
If you don't let us in

873
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,420
and cause the suspect to run away,

874
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,030
the Supervision Bureau will be held accountable.

875
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,020
We let you go last time

876
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,950
as a favor to Minister Fang.

877
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,290
Please leave.

878
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:56,830
Youâ€¦

879
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,020
Li.

880
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:03,620
Fang.

881
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,100
Yang.

882
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,330
I heard that Zongzheng Mingzhu

883
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,360
is here with men from the Supervision Bureau.

884
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:06,950
I'm worried

885
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,240
so I came to check it out.

886
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,940
The Supervision Bureau

887
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,970
is now in the charge of a criminal.

888
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,550
I wonder

889
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,110
whether the founders of the Supervision Bureau

890
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,010
are turning in their graves.

891
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:18,440
Forget it.

892
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,300
We have other things to do.

893
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,580
Butâ€¦

894
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:22,550
Something's wrong.

895
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,310
Something's wrong.

896
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,510
Deputy Commander Yang, something's wrong.

897
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:27,600
What happened?

898
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,190
The butler of the Yuanbao Villa, Jin Changbao,

899
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,400
hung himself.

900
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,610
How dare you come in?

901
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:43,550
Yang Yunchun?

902
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,170
Why did you collude with these two impostors

903
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,200
with ulterior motives?

904
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:51,080
I saw Miss Shi Shui from the Baichuan Court

905
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:52,420
assigning tasks to Fang Duobing.

906
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:53,670
He's not an impostor.

907
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,310
These two guys are suspicious

908
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,450
and I kicked them out.

909
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,540
You're just the deputy commander.

910
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,360
I'm your superior.

911
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,080
How dare you disobey my order?

912
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:02,410
I'm just the deputy commander

913
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,110
but I was granted the title of the Royal Dragon

914
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,110
and have the Royal Dragon Badge.

915
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,140
I can act independently.

916
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:06,640
Youâ€¦

917
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,530
I heard

918
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,950
that something happened to Butler Jin.

919
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,610
If there's nothing else,

920
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,730
I need to go in for a check.

921
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,050
Fang Xiaobao.

922
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:20,550
He's much more powerful than the Baichuan Court.

923
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,380
What happened?

924
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,670
Why did he suddenly commit suicide?

925
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,160
Perhaps Butler Jin went mad

926
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,390
because he was too sad about Master Jin's death.

927
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:47,160
In the past few days,

928
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,400
he was either absent-minded

929
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,920
or very emotional.

930
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:51,740
He cried and laughed,

931
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:54,550
keeping mumbling things like "Why can't I?"

932
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:57,390
and "Why didn't it work?"

933
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:06,940
A few days ago,

934
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,750
I started treating Butler Jin's condition.

935
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,540
The needles on his head

936
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,960
were used by me

937
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:15,530
to alleviate his depression.

938
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,120
Unexpectedly,

939
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,010
after performing acupuncture on him,

940
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,310
I went out to prepare his medicine

941
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:23,390
and was told that Butler Jin killed himself.

942
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,930
What a pity.

943
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,050
It's indeed a pity.

944
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:31,550
We planned to ask him some questions.

945
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,210
Mr. Gongyang,

946
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:34,350
it seems

947
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,560
that I have to find the answers myself.

948
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:03,460
Heâ€¦

949
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,360
Sure enough, Jin Changbao had the Tree Man Syndrome.
