[Episode 10]

4
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,320
Physician Li,

5
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,830
I've been thinking about a small question.

6
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,370
Why don't you reveal your face?

7
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,680
Master Bai.

8
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,470
Here's the thing.

9
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,020
I'm just a physician who wanders in the martial arts world.

10
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,350
I'm rootless.

11
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,410
It's also my duty to cure people and save people's lives.

12
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,090
Besides,

13
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,990
when I cure good people,

14
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,759
bad people want to kill me.

15
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,090
When I cure bad people,

16
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,890
good people are not happy.

17
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,540
There are so many people in the Sword-Appreciation Ceremony.

18
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,420
There are also many enemies.

19
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,990
It's not too much for me

20
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,790
to wear this mask, right?

21
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,560
Physician Li.

22
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,540
But why

23
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,720
do I seem to have seen you somewhere before?

24
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,770
You've seen me before?

25
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:39,300
Yes.

26
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,740
Could it be

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,329
that you've seen my elder brother before?

28
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,560
Your elder brother?

29
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,790
Have you really seen my elder brother before?

30
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,240
I'm sorry, Master Yun.

31
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:55,850
Yes.

32
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,670
I do have a twin brother.

33
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,060
My mother named us

34
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,450
Li Lianpeng

35
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,150
and Li Lianhua respectively.

36
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,260
-Li Lianpeng.
-Lianpeng is my elder brother.

37
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,050
I'm the younger brother.

38
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,460
We were born in a poor family.

39
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,960
Soon after my brother was born,

40
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,700
he was taken away by an old man

41
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,430
as his adopted son.

42
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,230
Since then, I've never seen him again.

43
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,110
But I also heard

44
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,550
that my brother is quite awesome.

45
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,300
So in this world,

46
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,310
there is a person who resembles me.

47
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,780
Li Lianpeng?

48
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,020
It's true. I never lie.

49
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,270
Physician Li.

50
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,920
Your family is poor,

51
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,210
but the Lotus Tower has a unique structure

52
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,540
and shows exquisite craftsmanship.

53
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,400
It's valuable.

54
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,160
Where did you get it?

55
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,050
A few years ago, I saw a big shabby boat

56
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,130
floating on the sea.

57
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,570
No one had interest in it.

58
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,130
So I picked up the wood

59
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,310
and made it into a Lotus Tower.

60
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,790
You can ask the fishermen about it by the sea.

61
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,430
I didn't steal it.

62
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,370
Physician Li, what are you talking about?

63
00:04:22,649 --> 00:04:24,970
Biqiu just asked casually.

64
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:28,490
Pingchuan.

65
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,700
I was reckless just now.

66
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,550
I guess

67
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,100
you haven't eaten anything since last night.

68
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,480
This is the peanut porridge

69
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,090
I specially asked someone to buy from Zuijiang Restaurant.

70
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:41,890
Physician Li.

71
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,510
Try it.

72
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,909
Thank you, Master Yun.

73
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,750
Sir, put it here.

74
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,909
I'll drink it later.

75
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,280
If the peanut porridge gets cold,

76
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,760
then my kindness is for nothing.

77
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,710
Drink it while it's hot.

78
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,180
Thank you.

79
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,610
It smells good.

80
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,750
It looks good.

81
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,110
Why are there peanuts in the porridge?

82
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,170
Why can't there be?

83
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,190
Xiangyi has an allergy to peanuts.

84
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:20,730
This...

85
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,440
I have an allergic reaction again.

86
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,190
Since you've been poisoned with the deadliest poison,

87
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,010
no poison can harm you anymore.

88
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:42,330
Physician Li.

89
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,110
You still need to rest.

90
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,830
We won't disturb you then.

91
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,740
I've had enough porridge.

92
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,340
Thank you.

93
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,960
I won't see you off.

94
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:51,240
Let's go.

95
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,110
Li Lianhua.

96
00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:09,550
Someone poisoned his friend who he respected most

97
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,990
for a woman

98
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,700
and caused his friend to fall into the East Sea and die.

99
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:17,620
Do you think

100
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,860
this person deserves to die?

101
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,870
Yes. He indeed deserves to die.

102
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,440
Did this person have intention to kill his friend?

103
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,700
That woman said

104
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,450
she didn't want Li Xiangyi to appear in the East Seaside.

105
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,530
She didn't allow Di Feisheng to be killed by others.

106
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,980
But Sect Leader's martial art skills are unpredictable.

107
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,490
If I hadn't poisoned him with the deadliest poison,

108
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,090
I couldn't have stopped him.

109
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,780
I thought I only needed to stop him for a while.

110
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,650
I had the antidote anyway.

111
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,030
I thought it didn't matter.

112
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,080
But things weren't like that.

113
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,440
The antidote is fake.

114
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,800
All the things happened because I was too stupid.

115
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,290
Even if I didn't want to kill him,

116
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,840
I did kill him.

117
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,280
If you were Sect Leader,

118
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,570
you would hate me to the core, right?

119
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,520
If I were him,

120
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,460
I would definitely hate you.

121
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,360
But think about it.

122
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,120
You said he has died.

123
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,170
Why would the dead hate you?

124
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,740
Besides,

125
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,870
all grudges are gone.

126
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,110
They've become the past.

127
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,650
I think you should forget it.

128
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,050
Should I really forget it?

129
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:52,590
How is it?

130
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,590
We've tested it.

131
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,870
He's not him at all.

132
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,690
He's really not him.

133
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,370
Mr. Li.

134
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:15,730
Ms. Qiao.

135
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,970
Last time, you asked me to investigate the whereabouts of Shi Hun.

136
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,120
I found some clues.

137
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,100
[To Qiao Wanmian. May 28, the year of Renyin.]

138
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,800
When we let him go ten years ago,

139
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,820
he wrote a letter to thank us.

140
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,990
It was sent from Cailian Manor in Xueyu Town.

141
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,600
But it happened ten years ago.

142
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,400
There is a sea of faces in the world.

143
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,590
It's not easy to get some clues.

144
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,030
Thank you, Ms. Qiao.

145
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,549
You're welcome, Mr. Li.

146
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,230
Actually, I'm here today also for another thing.

147
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:47,919
Say it, Ms. Qiao.

148
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,000
The sachet...

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,880
You reminded me.

150
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,940
Mr. Xiao took you away in a hurry yesterday.

151
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,100
I kept it.

152
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,750
It belonged to your deceased friend.

153
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,250
I should return it to you.

154
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,350
Ms. Qiao.

155
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,860
I made this sachet for him.

156
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,370
It's been ten years.

157
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,250
I've held out hope

158
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,650
for ten years.

159
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,180
Although I thought about it before,

160
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,560
the fact that he doesn't come back

161
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,490
is the answer.

162
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:57,530
Although

163
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,630
I'm mentally prepared,

164
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,590
when

165
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,730
I heard he is dead,

166
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,380
I still...

167
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,700
I still...

168
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,330
Ms. Qiao.

169
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,590
He's already passed away.

170
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,080
Don't be too sad.

171
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,500
Mr. Li.

172
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:30,640
I...

173
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,360
I once had

174
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,520
some ridiculous thoughts.

175
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,280
It was just because I couldn't accept the reality.

176
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,770
I deceived myself.

177
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,470
Now,

178
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,200
I should clear my mind.

179
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,630
This is his personal item.

180
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,600
It's good to let it go with him.

181
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:32,110
The ten-year wait has ended.

182
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,210
Since he's your deceased friend,

183
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,660
let him stay in the story.

184
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,390
Ms. Qiao, you should move on without worries.

185
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,020
Mr. Li.

186
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,510
Thank you.

187
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:14,480
Ms. Qiao.

188
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,980
Why did Ms. Qiao also come here?

189
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,570
Let me remind you.

190
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,740
Ms. Qiao is already spoken for.

191
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,430
Don't have designs on her.

192
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,110
I heard from the little monks in the courtyard

193
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:36,440
that all the masters of the Baichuan Court came here before.

194
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,990
You didn't come at that time.

195
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:39,990
Do you know

196
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,390
what Master Ji brought me?

197
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,440
Shaoshi Sword.

198
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,640
Shaoshi Sword?

199
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:47,760
Did you touch it?

200
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,890
Of course.

201
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:50,540
To be honest,

202
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,110
I saved Ms. Qiao in the tunnel.

203
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,920
In order to thank me,

204
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,070
they let me have a look

205
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,310
and touch it.

206
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:58,750
Let me tell you.

207
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,530
This sword is really heavy.

208
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,960
My hand hurt when I touched it.

209
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,580
I couldn't lift it immediately.

210
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,440
You're so lucky.

211
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,870
I can't even touch it.

212
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:08,900
Look.

213
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,510
My hand became callused after I touched it.

214
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,200
Cut it out.

215
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,830
How rude of you!

216
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,500
You've taken your medicine?

217
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,040
I've told Bhante Wuliao.

218
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,440
He'll check on you later.

219
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:19,650
Thanks.

220
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,220
How long do you think your life

221
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,880
will let you suffer like this?

222
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,560
I've warned you many times.

223
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,590
You have the unique Yangzhouman.

224
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,820
That's why you still have

225
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,650
ten percent of the internal power which can protect your heart.

226
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:48,430
Every time you use it, the effect of the poison accelerates.

227
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,910
Why don't you listen?

228
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:53,920
Bicha Poison will affect your brain.

229
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,470
You're a smart person.

230
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,040
If you suddenly become crazy and stupid,

231
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,940
I... I won't be used to it.

232
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,080
You have to get used to it.

233
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,220
Old Monk, stop talking.

234
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,550
If you continue to talk,

235
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,820
I will have a headache

236
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,350
and won't hear you clearly.

237
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,480
Don't interrupt.

238
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,960
If you continue to use Genuine Qi at will,

239
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,780
I'm afraid you'll only have six months to live.

240
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,530
It's fine.

241
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,130
When she was in trouble,

242
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,460
I couldn't just stand by and watch her die.

243
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,680
Is it because you couldn't stand by and watch her die

244
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,610
or you still have feelings for Ms. Qiao?

245
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,120
Old Monk, don't talk nonsense.

246
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,470
Mian is the only one

247
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,770
who can offer me clues to find the corpse of my senior.

248
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,230
Of course I care about her.

249
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,930
People go to heaven when they die.

250
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,060
Why do you insist

251
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,370
on finding the corpse of Mr. Shan?

252
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,790
Why don't you come back?

253
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,710
You've met Yun Biqiu.

254
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,330
I know you don't mind

255
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,700
that he was bewitched by Jiao Liqiao

256
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,180
and poisoned you with Bicha Poison.

257
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,260
Bicha Poison?

258
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,550
I won.

259
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,270
Ten years ago, Di Feisheng wanted to battle with you.

260
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,850
But he didn't expect

261
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,510
the one he won in the end

262
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,220
was poisoned with a deadly poison.

263
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,050
Since

264
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,850
you don't mind that he helped Di Feisheng harm you,

265
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,270
why don't you come back?

266
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,070
If you don't want to say it, I'll say it for you.

267
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,340
You always think it was because you acted willfully

268
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,940
and declared war on the Jinyuan Alliance

269
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,020
that

270
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,250
the 58 heroes of the Sigu Sect died tragically

271
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,640
and that the Sigu Sect split.

272
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,350
It's not that you can't forgive others.

273
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,900
It's that you refuse to forgive yourself.

274
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,080
Are you done?

275
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,880
If you're done, let me say something.

276
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:51,510
Old Monk.

277
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,490
When did you become an old storyteller monk?

278
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,000
I just think

279
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,510
being Li Xiangyi is too tiring.

280
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,680
Isn't it good to be Li Lianhua?

281
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,190
I can drink tea with you.

282
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,930
Stop it.

283
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,970
It's time for you

284
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,510
to give lessons to the little monks.

285
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,990
Why are you still sitting here?

286
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,990
Otherwise, those little monks will raise the roof again.

287
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:13,910
Hurry up and go.

288
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,510
Li Xiangyi!

289
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,020
Li Xiangyi.

290
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,100
What are you doing?

291
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:39,620
Ten years ago,

292
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,540
you lost to me because you were poisoned.

293
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,400
Let me tell you.

294
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,280
Eavesdropping is not a good habit.

295
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,110
What are you doing?

296
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,540
In the battle at the East Sea ten years ago,

297
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,440
I thought I was the world number one

298
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,170
because I won a narrow victory.

299
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:59,630
Today I heard that I won in an unfair way.

300
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,570
You mean you didn't know anything about this?

301
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,460
Are you insulting me?

302
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,800
I see.

303
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:11,569
Forget it.

304
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,319
Let bygones be bygones.

305
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:14,940
It doesn't matter who won or lost.

306
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,599
It matters.

307
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,910
I treated you as a worthy opponent.

308
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,680
You made me a joke.

309
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,650
Director Di.

310
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,480
It's been so long.

311
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:29,480
Just pretend that you didn't hear it, okay?

312
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,660
No.

313
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,079
I want to compete with you again.

314
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,480
Let's compete in a fair way.

315
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,670
The problem is that I can't compete with you again.

316
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,130
You know that.

317
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,220
Since you've eavesdropped.

318
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:44,840
Now,

319
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,170
the poison has entered my bone marrow.

320
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,140
I only have ten percent of my inner power.

321
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,800
Why don't you take a look at the new ranking list?

322
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,640
I heard Buddhist San Sheng is quite awesome.

323
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,560
Go and compete with them.

324
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,570
I have only one opponent in my life.

325
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,430
That is Li Xiangyi.

326
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,260
I only have one wish in my life.

327
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,840
That is to beat him.

328
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,790
I'm sorry.

329
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,080
I can't help you.

330
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,600
Now,

331
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,420
you're the world number one.

332
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,460
I don't need you to let me win.

333
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,460
It's just Bicha Poison.

334
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,400
I'll find a way to cure you.

335
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,030
I heard the poison

336
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,230
was created by Medicine Demon.

337
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
No one can detoxify it in this world.

338
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,860
Besides, Bhante Wuliao has excellent medical skills.

339
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,560
He hasn't cured me during these ten years.

340
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,380
It doesn't mean I can't cure you.

341
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,820

342
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,210

although Fei is not skilled in martial arts,

he's ruthless when he fights.

386
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,980
You can't let this kind of person stay by your side.

Maybe one day when I'm not with you,

I also followed that person.

Unfortunately, that person ran away.

But I'm sure

565
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,940
he must be hiding something from us.

Yes.

is obsessed with martial arts.

586
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,500
That's why he's short-sighted.

587

Don't take it to heart.

588

But his only strength

589

is that his martial art skills are unpredictable.

590
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,410
So you'd better not provoke him.

591

and that you know each other well.

Master Guo.

682
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,270
I think people of your manor

683
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,560
are still in mourning.

684
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:01,740
Yes.

685
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,730
My son got married.

686
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:07,150
But his new bride drowned in an accident.

687
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,760
The new bride was the daughter of the Weiyuan Escort Agency.

688
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,530
She was involved in the martial arts world.

689
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,570
So the Baichuan Court has come to investigate it before.

690
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:16,480
It was an accident.

691
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,610
The case has been closed.

692
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:20,970
If the records in the casebook of the Baichuan Court are correct,

693
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:23,500
she should be the third bride

694
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,110
who died in Cailian Manor during these years.

695
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,560
They all happened in the past.

696
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:37,910
The government also sent people to investigate it during those years.

697
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,130
They fell into the water by accident.

698
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,500
There's nothing to be suspicious of.

699
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,280
People of Cailian Manor never learn martial arts.

700
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,210
Cailian Manor is not a sect either.

701
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,810
We are just ordinary people.

702
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,820
We don't want to bother you with our problems.

703
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,300
My friend

704
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,470
is not only a detective from the Baichuan Court,

705
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,610
but also the son of the minister. He also works in the Supervision Bureau.

706
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:57,900
He has always been interested in strange cases.

707
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,700
Fang Duobing.

708
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,600
Show your sword to Master Guo.

709
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,580
You're Lord Fang.

710
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,180
Excuse me.

711
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,050
I, the young master...

712
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,990
I thought it was an accident.

713
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,540
But the fact that they happened in a row made them suspicious.

714
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,800
I must investigate it.

715
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,160
Master Guo.

716
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,400
Please tell me

717
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,520
what happened these years in detail.

718
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,450
My wife died when she was young.

719
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,830
I remarried ten years ago.

720
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,040
I didn't expect the bride

721
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:43,330
to drown in an accident on the wedding night.

722
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,080
Seven years ago, I remarried again.

723
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,850
But the same tragedy happened.

724
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,600
So I decided

725
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,880
not to get married anymore.

726
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,900
I didn't expect that after so many years,

727
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:59,720
the same tragedy happened to my son's new bride.

728
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,960
I really don't know why the Guo family is so unlucky.

729
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:06,990
I heard that the three brides

730
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,720
died in the same wedding dress.

731
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,540
Ms. Jiang.

732
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,850
You've been in Cailian Manor for many years, right?

733
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,630
Have you experienced these?

734
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:20,050
They all wore the grand Pomegranate Dress of Cailian Manor

735
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,100
and drowned in the pond.

736
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,949
I saw it with my own eyes.

737
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:26,530
There must be something wrong with the wedding dress.

738
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,860
-There must be something wrong.
-Shut up!

739
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,830
People in the town like to gossip

740
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,320
and spread rumors.

741
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,580
So we didn't make the funeral public this time.

742
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:47,159
Master Guo,

743
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,420
you don't believe the brides died from the wedding dress.

744
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,610
But there's a long interval between each wedding.

745
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:52,940
Why did the three brides

746
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,770
wear the same wedding dress?

747
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,730
My ancestors were Zhao people.

748
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,639
This Pomegranate Dress

749
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:02,850
was passed down through generations.

750
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:05,870
Every generation of our descendants must pass it down.

751
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,900
I'm not interested in how these people died.

752
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,400
I just want to know where Shi Hun is.

753
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,600
Shi Hun?

754
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,300
Who is Shi Hun?

755
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,030
His right hand has six fingers.

756
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,490
His body got burnt before,

757
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:20,920
so he's ugly.

758
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,610
After hearing what I said,

759
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,920
do you know who I was talking about?

760
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,780
I've never seen anyone who has six fingers.

761
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:36,070
Why did you ask it?

762
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,570
You really don't know?

763
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,470
You'd better think it through.

764
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:07,720
You wretch, how dare you be here?

765
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,030
How dare you be here?

766
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:23,320
Look! What a beautiful lotus!

I have guests.

I'll take the punishment later.

00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,630
I asked you to keep an eye on your uncle.

780
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,450
Why did you let him come here

781
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,660
and startle the guests?

782
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:49,800
I'm sorry.

00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,620
This is my younger brother, Guo Kun.

784

He's got a strange disease since he was little.

785

Master Guo, there's no hurry.

804
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:31,030
I have a request.

805
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:34,340
I heard Cailian Manor is famous for its lotuses.

806
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,370
I wonder if we can

807
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:37,410
admire the lotuses in the manor?

808
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:38,700
Sure.

809
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,630
Please go ahead.

810
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:56,420
Be careful.

811
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,320
Along the way, there are Shoushan stones which Master bought at a high price.

812
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,320
Don't touch them.

813
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,630
The master who was prevaricating.

814
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:07,070
The madman who suddenly broke in.

815
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,710
The young master who seemed to be compliant.

816
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,520
And the housekeeper who talked strangely .

817
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,280
Why did they all look weird?

818
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:18,790
The three women married into the Guo family in succession.

819
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:20,120
They had no connection.

820
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:23,180
But they all died in the pond of Cailian Manor.

821
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,510
What a coincidence!

822
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,840
So there must be some secrets

823
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,380
hidden in Cailian Manor.

824
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,390
I'm here to look for Shi Hun,

825
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,610
not to investigate cases.

826
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,030
I don't want to listen to your analysis.

Why are you so impatient?

I didn't finish speaking yet.

830
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:37,730
But you interrupted.

831
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:39,050
He just wanted to ask

832
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,430
the past about Shi Hun.

833
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:41,930
Wait.

834
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:43,880
What are you talking about?

835
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,680
Is there a past

836
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,680
I don't know?

837
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:49,620
When we find Shi Hun,

838
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,940
you'll know it.

839
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,240
Let's go.

840
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:01,980
Enjoy!

841
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,900
This is the best place to admire the lotuses.

842
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,500
Thank you.

843
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,270
This is indeed a good place.

844
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,550
It's such a big pond.

845
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,450
We might be able to even catch fishes here.

846
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:20,250
It's useless for you to be anxious.

847
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,440
What if Master Guo hides something deliberately?

848
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,440
If you ask him now, you'll alert him.

849
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,380
Why don't you

850
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,010
investigate the case about Cailian Manor

851
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:28,910
and find out what happened ten years ago?

852
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,570
Maybe there will be new clues.

853
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:34,610
You still want me to help you investigate the case.

854
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:35,870
It's easy.

855
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:38,290
I'll go and torture Guo Qian.

856
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:39,580
Fei.

857
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,650
Don't act recklessly.

858
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:41,520
Fang Duobing, don't chase him.

859
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,120
Let him go.

860
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,340
He has no experience in investigating cases.

861
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,390
He's also violent.

862
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:46,740
If he gets angry and hits others,

863
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,160
then...

864
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,320
He won't. Don't worry.

865
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,360
He's an adult.

866
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,050
Li Lianhua.

867
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,460
I'm becoming more and more curious.

868
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,920
Do you trust him that much?

869
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,190
Trust?

870
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,350
The deceased hasn't been buried yet.

871
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:04,140
Why don't we go to the mourning hall and burn incense sticks for her?

872
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:04,490
Let's go.

873
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:04,890
You...

874
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,330
The coffin should be kept here for seven days.

875
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:14,260
Only three days passed, but no one is here now.

876
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,450
People of Cailian Manor really don't care about

877
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,180
this young madam who just died.

878
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:24,900
Look.

879
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:25,980
Abdominal distension.

880
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,040
There's water inside.

881
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,700
It does look like she drowned.

882
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:29,920
The body is swollen.

883
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,440
The spots are light red.

884
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,960
It does look like the spots appeared slowly

885
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,080
because the body was soaked before.

886
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,220
She has a lot of bruises on her neck.

887
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:44,920
What are you doing?

888
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,120
Young Master Guo.

889
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,930
There's still something fishy about your wife's death.

890
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:50,260
We want to check it again

891
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:52,230
to bring justice to the deceased.

892
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:54,220
What should be checked has already been checked.

893
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,270
She has already passed away.

894
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:57,270
Please don't disturb the deceased.

895
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,780
Young Master Guo.

896
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,660
To be honest,

897
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,120
your wife appeared in my dream a few days ago.

898
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,150
She cried and expressed her grievances.

899
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,290
She said she couldn't rest in peace.

900
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:06,020
That's why we came to Cailian Manor.

901
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,550
She appeared in your dream?

902
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,410
This is the master of Lotus Tower.

903
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,220
People call him Physician Li.

904
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,340
He's psychic.

905
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:15,260
His dreams are believable.

906
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,230
Even so,

907
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,270
I should tell my father first

908
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,070
and get his permission.

909
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:23,220
You seem to be afraid of Master Guo.

910
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,890
It's right and proper that children obey their fathers' orders.

911
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:26,890
Young Master Guo.

912
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:28,920
Now that the coffin has been opened,

913
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,580
she's already been offended.

914
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,700
I'll apologize to Master Guo later.

915
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,960
If he really blames us,

916
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:36,030
I'll take full responsibility.

917
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,230
This body didn't just have superficial injuries.

918
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:43,070
Her carpal bones were fractured.

919
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:45,670
Her cervical spine was also severely damaged.

920
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:47,920
We never hit her.

921
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:50,340
The people from the government have already investigated before.

922
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,500
They said the bride fell into the water by accident

923
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,750
and that the injuries were caused when she struggled.

924
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,860
It doesn't seem like she was beaten up.

925
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,860
Young Master Guo.

926
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,700
Did anything happen before the bride died?

927
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:04,230
There was nothing special.

928
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:07,650
After she had dinner that night,

929
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,310
Su went back to our room alone.

930
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:12,240
She said she wanted to try on the wedding dress again.

931
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,070
No one knows what happened

932
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,710
after the bride went back to the room?
