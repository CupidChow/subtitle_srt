4
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,670
Kid,

5
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,920
don't say I didn't remind you.

6
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,800
This is the tomb of Prince Fangji and Princess Nanyin.

If you touch it, your whole family will be executed.

[Weeping Guanyin]

00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,560
Weeping Guanyin?

10
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,010
Hand over the Weeping Guanyin!

11
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,020
Do you want to die?

12
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,750
It's rare that someone can sustain my attack.

13
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,400
But...

14
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,520
What a pity.

15
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,560
So this is what you want.

16
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,170
Goodbye.

17
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,040
You're chasing me so closely.

18
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,170
I don't want it then.

19
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,329

20
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,579
It's really you.

Finally, all my old injuries have been healed.

24
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,870
It's worth my effort to hide my identity

25
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,820
with the Bone Constriction Skill.

26
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,880
Li Xiangyi, I’m going to meet you now.

27
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,570
It’s been ten years.

28
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,450
Li Xiangyi, how've you been?

29
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,970
Director Di.

30
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,120
You're still so clingy after not seeing each other for ten years.

31
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,440
That's why you recognized me at Wei Manor.

32
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,120
Or what?

33
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,100
Every day, for the past ten years, I've been wanting to

34
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,560
have a duel with you again.

35
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,740
But they said you were dead.

36
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,670
Why are you so happy that I'm not dead?

37
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,160
Excuse me. I've to go.

38
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,520
I have to go back to cook.

39
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,720
Why do you only have 10% of your power left?

40
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:34,690
You were poisoned by my Mingyue Chenxihai

41
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,010
and I was poisoned by your Beifeng Cuibahuang.

42
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,650
It's normal to be injured.

43
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,840
Even before taking Weeping Guanyin,

44
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,300
I still had 60% of my power.

45
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,600
What have you been doing for the past ten years?

46
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,350
To be honest,

47
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,400
I've been busy for the past ten years.

48
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,130
I was busy taking care of myself

49
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,640
and living a good life.

50
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,550
By the way,

51
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,510
I also learned how to cook.

52
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,180
Cooking?

53
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,480
Yes, cooking.

54
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,290
I'm quite good at it.

55
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,590
How could Li Xiangyi, the great Sect Leader of the Sigu Sect

56
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,480
and the best martial artist in the world,

57
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,140
have spent ten years doing such mundane things?

58
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,160
Director Di, you're too assertive.

59
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,980
These daily life skills are harder than martial arts training.

60
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,110
You know what? Cooking is even harder.

61
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,640
To cook a good dish,

62
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,700
you have to be very particular to its quality.

63
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,950
Try it someday if you don't believe me.

64
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,040
-I don’t want to listen to your nonsense.
-Make a dish of stir-fried cabbage.

65
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,330
Come with me now to find the elixir.

66
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:23,880
Wait.

67
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,270
If supplements really work,

68
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,360
why did you have to use the Bone Constriction Skill

69
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,690
to get Weeping Guanyin?

70
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,980
They're useless.

71
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,140
Besides,

72
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,190
I don't care to use them now.

73
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:36,830
Moreover,

74
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,250
I'm fine now.

75
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,360
I have more vitality than before.

76
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,520
I didn't expect you to have been

77
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,720
living like a dog for the past ten years.

78
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,950
You are the dog.

79
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,380
You want to be a loser?

80
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:46,990
Fine.

81
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,760
I'll grant you your wish.

82
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,100
I'll take you to Baichuan Court now

83
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,310
and let your men see

84
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,700
what Li Xiangyi, the Sect Leader of the Sigu Sect,

85
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,750
has become.

86
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,340
If you don't want dignity,

87
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,530
I'll make you lose all your dignity.

88
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,000
Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.

89
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,330
I can't take it anymore.

90
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,820
I'm going to throw up.

91
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:13,670
Throw up.

92
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,130
I-I can't.

93
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,290
I just lied to get you to stop.

94
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,880
You were flying too high.

95
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:23,820
If your inner power is interrupted,

96
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,540
you'll suffer a terrible fall.

97
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,470
What do you mean?

98
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,580
My inner power?

99
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,700
Stop trying.

100
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,060
Your inner power has been blocked.

101
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,810
The Weeping Guanyin?

102
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,460
Smart.

103
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:42,880
You poisoned it.

104
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,150
Don't come over.

105
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,850
A gentleman doesn’t resort to violence.

106
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,659
It's Asura Grass from the Yipin Tomb.

107
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,409
One of Nanyin's Three Magical Techniques, Asura Grass?

108
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,230
Not bad.

109
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,190
Director Di is really knowledgeable indeed.

110
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,250
It's been 100 years

111
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,940
but the corpse of Princess Nanyin in the tomb hasn't rotted

112
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,140
because she has Asura Grass in her body.

113
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,320
But just now,

114
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,660
I also took some grass seeds from her body

115
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,840
and put them in the Weeping Guanyin.

116
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,910
This thing grows rapidly when it's met with blood.

117
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,640
Now, the Asura Grass has blocked your meridians.

118
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:23,570
Li Xiangyi.

119
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,290
Did you plan all this long ago?

120
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,990
I just went to Yu City,

121
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,930
and found out you're still alive.

122
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,520
After you left the borders,

123
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,220
you'd definitely go look for the elixir to heal your injuries.

124
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,220
Then it must be the Weeping Guanyin.

125
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,490
I've heard some old stories before,

126
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,059
that the Weeping Guanyin was buried with Prince Fangji.

127
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,320
Isn't it a coincidence

128
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,930
that strange things also happened on Mount Puchu?

129
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,300
Then, I wanted to go out and have some fun.

130
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:50,790
I didn't expect

131
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,000
to see a kid with a sword on his back

132
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,430
throwing a tantrum in broad daylight.

133
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,420
It's been so many years

134
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,690
and you still haven't changed a bit.

135
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,730
I can tell that.

136
00:08:58,930 --> 00:08:59,620
Li Xiangyi.

137
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,410
You haven't been training your martial arts skills,

138
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,270
but you've become more scheming.

139
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,170
Don't.

140
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,740
You want to kill me with Asura Grass?

141
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,100
Before that,

142
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,760
do you believe I'll kill you first?

143
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,600
You're thinking too much.

144
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,660
I just

145
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,450
need your help with something.

146
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,680
Are you threatening me?

147
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,150
How could I threaten you?

148
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,720
We've known each other for a long time.

149
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,430
I know you.

150
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,550
You

151
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,830
are the least susceptible to threats.

152
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,600
How about this?

153
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,010
Put down your sword first and let's talk.

154
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,730
After this matter is settled,

155
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,170
I'll give you a gift.

156
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,900
The Mantra of Inner Body Cleansing.

157
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,960
Your master's ultimate skill?

158
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,760
That's right.

159
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,650
This skill can reverse the heart's pulse

160
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,750
and expel the strands of Asura Grass out of your body,

161
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,050
and restore your inner power.

162
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:01,650
Of course.

163
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,930
If you don't agree,

164
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,040
I won't force you.

165
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,110
You can just kill me with the sword.

166
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,860
What's the matter?

167
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,100
It's simple.

168
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,630
Firstly,

169
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,150
keep the secret of my identity for me.

170
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:20,850
Secondly,

171
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,860
where are the remains of my senior Shan Gudao?

172
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,300
I thought you wanted me to dissolve the Jinyuan Alliance,

173
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,020
or not hurt anyone in the martial world.

174
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,630
I can help you with the first thing.

175
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,610
I don't care if you're self-abasing.

176
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,240
I can't help you with the second thing.

177
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,680
Your senior has been dead for ten years.

178
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,040
The martial arts world has been in chaos for ten years.

179
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,240
I can't find his body.

180
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,960
Then, the Jinyuan Alliance killed my senior

181
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,250
and stole his remains.

182
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,800
That's why I fought against you at the East Sea.

183
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,130
Over the past ten years,

184
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,090
I've been looking for his remains.

185
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,790
But I never found them.

186
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,180
With your order,

187
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,690
I'm sure you can summon the Jinyuan Alliance to investigate the past again

188
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,150
and help me find my senior.

189
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,200
It's not impossible that your senior was eaten by a wild dog.

190
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,120
Do you want me to kill all the wild dogs in the world

191
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,050
to find the remains of your senior?

192
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,860
If that's the case,

193
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,420
Director Di,

194
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,250
I'm afraid you'll have to say goodbye

195
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,880
to your supreme martial arts skills.

196
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,660
Li Xiangyi.

197
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,530
Do you really think I won’t exhaust the torture methods

198
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,060
to force you to detoxify me?

199
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:33,710
You will.

200
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,720
Of course you will.

201
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,600
When you were feeling out my aura,

202
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,110
you realized that I don't have long to live.

203
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,970
What's the point of doing all that

204
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,930
to a dying man like me?

205
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,080
Stop wasting your time.

206
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,130
Otherwise, if I die before

207
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:48,660
I find my senior,

208
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,820
you'll be wasting your energy.

209
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,830
Greetings, My Lord.

210
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,720
Which coroner examined

211
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,220
Shan Gudao's corpse ten years ago?

212
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:15,880
My Lord.

213
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,400
Among the coroners in the Alliance,

214
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,060
Shi Hun has the best technique.

215
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,350
He must have been in charge of what you ordered.

216
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,390
Where is he now?

217
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,490
Because of the great battle ten years ago,

218
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,920
all the outstanding people in the Alliance were dispersed.

219
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,520
With the status of a coroner,

220
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,590
he has long disappeared and hidden from the martial arts world.

221
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,070
But I remember that

222
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,550
when Shi Hun was young,

223
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,410
he was adopted by a monk from Pudu Temple.

224
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,120
After he left the Alliance,

225
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,890
he might have returned to Pudu Temple.

226
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:41,150
My Lord, do you want me to investigate it?

227
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:41,640
No need.

228
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:45,420
Pudu Temple and Baichuan Court were built together.

229
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,900
I'll go there myself.

230
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,010
Don't tell anyone about this.

231
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,890
Tell the Alliance I have something personal to deal with.

232
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,180
Tell them not to bother me.

233
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:52,620
Yes.

234
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:58,460
Let's go,

235
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,840
to Pudu Temple.

236
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,070
Do you not dare to go?

237
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,050
Are you afraid that your men at Baichuan Court will see you like this?

238
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:11,890
That's not it.

239
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,690
Before I leave,

240
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,740
I have to bring someone with me.

241
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:16,750
Fang Duobing?

242
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,080
Smart.

243
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,610
You are really troublesome now.

244
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,180
Fang Duobing.

245
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,360
Fang Duobing?

246
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,360
Li Lianhua.

247
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,390
Are you okay?

248
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,190
Calm down.

249
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,720
Don't worry.

250
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:21,860
I'm fine.

251
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,570
I'm skilled at running away.

252
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,720
That brat is so good at martial arts.

253
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:30,410
By the way,

254
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,560
where is that little thing?

255
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,220
Where is he?

256
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,460
He left.

257
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,060
He left?

258
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,700
What about the Weeping Guanyin?

259
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,550
Hurry and go after him!

260
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,800
Calm down. Calm down.

261
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,360
You haven't recovered yet.

262
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,420
I told you.

263
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,470
He took it.

264
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,050
Actually, this brat

265
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,190
meticulously planned all this

266
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,190
to cure his illness.

267
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,070
So,

268
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,210
I used this Weeping Guanyin

269
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,180
to exchange a lifetime of him not doing evil again,

270
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,580
and he naturally agreed.

271
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,710
That simple?

272
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,450
Not at all.

273
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,540
In order to convince him,

274
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,070
I'd exhausted all my words.

275
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,230
But luckily,

276
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,670
that brat is a man of his word.

277
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,300
He's just a bit impolite.

278
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,620
What about you?

279
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,570
Without the Weeping Guanyin, your heart disease...

280
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,610
I'll be fine.

281
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,430
I've survived for so many years.

282
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,870
Don't worry. I won't die.

283
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,320
After all, it's quite nice now.

284
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,940
Since I could convince that brat to stop hurting people,

285
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,800
it's all worth it.

286
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,310
You're still quite chivalrous.

287
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,640
Don't worry.

288
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,670
I've long regarded you as my partner.

289
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,090
Even if I have to search all the magical herbs in the world for your heart disease's elixir,

290
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,290
I will find it for you.

291
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,850
As for whether you regard me as a partner,

292
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,460
I don't care.

293
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,720
What else can I do?

294
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,680
I can't get rid of you anyway.

295
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,270
Take this.

296
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,230
Let me tell you.

297
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,590
Now that the entrance of Yipin tomb is open,

298
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,670
many bandits will barge in

299
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,160
to steal these treasures.

300
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,340
There's no time to lose.

301
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,500
Go and report it.

302
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,480
Besides,

303
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,070
you should be solving your second big case now.

304
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,360
Can you stop mentioning it?

305
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,560
Everyone is dead now.

306
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,880
Who can testify for me?

307
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,640
Have you forgotten

308
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,650
that the one you hit at the entrance

309
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:11,910
is still alive?

310
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,710
That's right.

311
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,750
Who is blocking the way?

312
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,150
He's one of us.

313
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,860
He's the Iron Head Slave

314
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,540
who wore an iron helmet.

315
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,370
Remember?

316
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,140
The Iron Head Slave.

317
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,050
No wonder he looks so cold.

318
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,020
When did Iron Head Slave become one of us?

319
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,280
His name is Fei.

320
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:16,790
He's from the South Sea.

321
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,740
Many years ago,

322
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,400
I got acquainted with him.

323
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,280
Later, he was tricked by Master Wei

324
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,700
and was taken in as their Iron Head Slave.

325
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,829
I felt sorry for him.

326
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,310
I saw that he was homeless,

327
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,800
so I decided to take him in for a while.

328
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,970
It's just nice. You're taking Ge Pan to Baichuan Court

329
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,220
while I'm taking him to Pudu Temple

330
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,190
to find another old friend of his.

331
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,170
You talk so much nonsense.

332
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,290
You...

333
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,620
Who are you scolding?

334
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,470
How rude.

335
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,540
You don't have to argue with him.

336
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,860
It will degrade your status.

337
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,490
No.

338
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,260

00:26:58,690 --> 00:26:59,890
I was wrong about you.

506
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:02,060
Life is unpredictable.

507
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,160
Entanglements are unintentional.

508
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,630
Look.

509
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,670
The scenery here is so beautiful.

510
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:11,320
Just treat it like I no longer have any desires.

511
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,770
Right now, I just want to find my senior's remains.

512
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,780
Let's split up later.

513
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,800
Go the monks at Pudu Temple and investigate

514
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,710
the whereabouts of Shi Hun.

515
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:22,440
I'll go check if there's any record on the name list.

516
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:22,960
Thanks.

517
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:23,940
Here.

518
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,610
Give me a hand. I really can't walk anymore.

519
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:44,640
[Pudu Temple]

520
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,740
Slowly.

521
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:06,810
Bhante.

522
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:10,050
How's it going about what I'd asked you?

523
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,520
What Shi Hun? What Huiyuan?

524
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,330
I know nothing about it.

525
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,630
Ever since you became the abbot,

526
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,430
your temper has been very bad.

527
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,500
Listen.

528
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,980
You need to cultivate yourself.

529
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,020
I was seeking for some peace and quiet,

530
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,290
but secular affairs are inherently disturbing.

531
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,470
No matter how good my cultivation is,

532
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:31,120
you'd still manage to infuriate me.

533
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,840
Are you aware of your physical condition?

534
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,170
That's why I'm anxious.

535
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:35,840
Bhante.

536
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,830
If you can't find Shi Hun,

537
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:40,610
I wouldn't be able to find my senior's remains.

538
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:43,090
Then, how can I face my master?

539
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,220
Besides,

540
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:47,260
I'm afraid I'll become a lonely wild ghost.

541
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,910
Look at you.

542
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,430
You've already thought about becoming a ghost.

543
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,270
So I'm really worried.

544
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,200
Can you stop being stubborn?

545
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,550
Who dares to be stubborn in front of the Almsgiver Li?

546
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,840
I thought you would come back after you made up your mind.

547
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,160
But you actually left for ten years.

548
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:10,470
I wrote to you once I heard some news.

549
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,150
Where is the letter?

550
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,190
Was it sent into the dog's stomach?

551
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:16,880
Letter?

552
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,540
You actually wrote to me?

553
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:21,980
You...

554
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,830
Where is the letter?

555
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:24,970
Was it you?

556
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,280
Bhante.

557
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,570
I don't have a fixed place to live.

558
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,620
I'm afraid it's lost.

559
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,580
You're being willful.

560
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,690
Then, I shortened your life to ten years,
but you didn't save yourself.

561
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:44,150
Now you should have one out of ten years left.

562
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,010
But your pulse

563
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,300
is much weaker than I expected.

564
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,810
It won't even last a year.

565
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,490
You should have gone back to Baichuan Court earlier.

566
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,140
Coincidentally,

567
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:58,330
everyone is there today.

568
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,530
All your old friends of Sigu Sect are here.

569
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:03,130
I'll take you back and vouch for your identity.

570
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,090
The martial arts world is huge.

571
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:08,690
If everyone put their heads together, they'll definitely figure a way to save you.

572
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,680
Why are you resisting me with your life?

573
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,270
In the year of Dingyou,

574
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,600
a greedy thief was

575
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,270
expelled from the temple.

576
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,890
Then, he joined the Jinyuan Alliance

577
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,550
and took on the name of Shi Hun.

578
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,640
It's recorded here.

579
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,200
You're so stubborn.

580
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,960
I really can't force you.

581
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,220
Did something happen in Baichuan Court?

582
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:39,160
I thought you're stone-hearted

583
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,490
and have completely erased your past.

584
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,370
So you still care about them.

585
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,050
I heard that

586
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,580
Yun Piqiu has been isolating himself in Baichuan Court for ten years.

587
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,700
I hastily guessed that

588
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,500
he was the one who poisoned you

589
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,010
with Bicha Poison then.

590
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:03,250
After he knew something happened to you,

591
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,170
Yun Biqiu regretted it so much,

592
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:09,050
so he rushed to the East Sea and searched for you for months but to no avail.

593
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,640
When Master Bai found him,

594
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,540
he had no intention to resist,

595
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,420
and was stabbed through the chest by Master Bai.

596
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:19,060
Fortunately, Master Ji found out that

597
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,800
he was indeed bewitched by the evil.

598
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:24,130
He didn't mean to hurt you.

599
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,280
So Master Ji sent someone to save him and made him stay.

600
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:32,530
But Yun Biqiu has been imprisoning himself for ten years,

601
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,020
and refuses to forgive himself.

602
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,120
Let me guess again.

603
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:42,140
It's not this matter that you can't let go of.

604
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:46,760
After all, what happened back then is like a chain reaction.

605
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,580
Someone has to let it go first.

606
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:51,480
Bhante.

607
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:55,130
You are really good at guessing.

608
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,970
But don't worry and talk about him anymore.

609
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:01,690
Tell me.

610
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:06,980
Did something happen to Baichuan Court?

611
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,050
Don't worry.

612
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,490
Baichuan Court is fine.

613
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,860
It just recently got a new sword.

614
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,090
So they

615
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:19,340
sent out invitations to all the friends of Sigu Sect

616
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,340
to a Sword-Appreciation Ceremony.

617
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,080
This sword

618
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,320
was your personal sword in the past,

619
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,010
the Shaoshi Sword.

620
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:34,480
Then, many people followed the Shaoshi Sword into the East Sea.

621
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:37,800
Several years later, someone went fishing in the East Sea

622
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,260
and recovered this sword.

623
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,570
After that, the sword was resold repeatedly

624
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,590
until it returned to Baichuan Court.

625
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,970
It'd been used by 43 hands.

626
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,430
The fate of a famous sword.

627
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,460
Don't you think

628
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:55,690
it's time the sword return to its owner?

629
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,310
This famous sword

630
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,230
will naturally find a good master.

631
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,700
What about people?

632
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,680
Forget about others.

633
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,350
There's someone you have to meet.

634
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:17,980
Miss Qiao is also in Baichuan Court.

635
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,130
All these years,

636
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:24,570
she has been going to the temple to pray for you every year,

637
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,030
but she never lit the Rebirth Lantern.

638
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,330
Because no matter what, she refused to believe

639
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,070
that you're dead.

640
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:34,750
All these years,

641
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:37,340
Mr. Xiao has been guarding her laboriously.

642
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,139
She's waiting intently for you,

643
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,850
but you refuse to return even though you're alive.

644
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,000
Don't you want to

645
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,540
resolve this misery?

646
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:49,909
Me not intervening

647
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,920
would be the best solution.

648
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,179
But you'll regret it in the end.

649
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,340
Life

650
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,450
is full of regrets.

651
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,460
It's been ten years.

652
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,380
There's nothing you can't let go.

653
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,920
And there's nothing that can't be solved.

654
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,280
I'm to blame for my incompetence.

655
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:15,190
I failed to persuade someone with a cold heart.

656
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,180
Bhante.

657
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,520
Would you answer my question now?

658
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:30,200
About Shi Hun of the Jinyuan Alliance?

659
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,140
Yes.

660
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:35,030
He's indeed Huiyuan who was expelled from Pudu Temple.

661
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,230
After the battle at the East Sea,

662
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,610
did you hear anything about Shi Hun?

663
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,730
When Baichuan Court was newly established,

664
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:47,660
they once captured the remnants of the defeated troops of Jinyuan Alliance from everywhere

665
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:50,410
and imprisoned hundreds of thousands men.

666
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,560
After that, Miss Qiao suggested

667
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:56,770
releasing ordinary allies who have never done evil.

668
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,100
The name list of the released

669
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:01,460
was decided by Miss Qiao herself.

670
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:05,380
She must know who you are looking for.

671
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:08,930
The matters of the world are so mysterious.

672
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,860
You end up having to meet someone you don't want to.

673
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:22,860
Time to eat.

674
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,220
I cherish my life.

675
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,010
I never treat myself badly.

676
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:26,820
Come on.

677
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,270
Share the meal with me.

678
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:32,170
There's a new chef named Jingren in the temple.

679
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:33,430
He's quite a good cook.

680
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,410
Over the past half a month,

681
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,230
I've been eating a lot more.

682
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,630
I've sinned.

683
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,030
Oil paper,

684
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,710
and charcoal residue?

685
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:46,860
Come on.

686
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:49,120
Bhante.

687
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,160
Has your new cook been eating secretly?

688
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:55,620
I won't join you in the meal.

689
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,260
Goodbye.

690
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:04,840
How did your investigation go?

691
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,850
Over the past ten years,

692
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,690
there are no records of Shi Hun visiting Pudu Temple.

693
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:09,550
Qiao Wanmian is the only clue now.

694
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,140
I'll go if you don't want to.

695
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:16,220
Don't worry.

696
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,700
We'll definitely figure everything out.

697
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,460
Director Di.

698
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,570
Now that you have no inner power,

699
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:23,250
you should keep a low profile.

700
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:30,820
[Baichuan Court]

701
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,210
For today's Sword-Appreciation Ceremony at Baichuan Court,

702
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:34,670
you need an invitation or referrer to enter.

703
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:35,920
Li Lianhua.

704
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,310
You came.

705
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:40,550
Yes.

706
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,950
It's the Sword-Appreciation Ceremony.

707
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:45,160
Fei insisted on joining in the fun.

708
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,060
By the way,

709
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:49,490
this is my friend.

710
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,240
He got quite famous recently.

711
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,640
He's the master of Lotus Tower, Li Lianhua.

712
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:54,540
As for this,

713
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,200
he's just a handyman.

714
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,830
I'll be the referrer and bring them in.

715
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,520
Let's go. Let's go.

716
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,920
Let me take you to a place.

717
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,270
Come on.

718
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,530
Before the Sword-Appreciation Ceremony,

719
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,860
let me formally introduce someone to you.

720
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,780
This is the portrait of my master, Li Xiangyi.

721
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:35,730
It looks quite ordinary.

722
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,790
It can really ward off evil spirits.

723
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:39,830
Watch your mouth.

724
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:40,840
Be careful.

725
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,940
Since Baichuan Court was established,

726
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,780
his portrait has been hung up here.

727
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,910
It's been ten years.

728
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,420
No one can forget him.

729
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:53,740
By the way,

730
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,260
do you have candy with you?

731
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:55,920
Give me two.

732
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,280
What are you looking at?

733
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,520
I know you like candy.

734
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,160
Don't be stingy. Hurry up.

735
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:06,620
One more.

736
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,870
I only have one. Take it or leave it.

737
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:33,640
I bring him some every time I come here.

738
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,460
In everyone's eyes,

739
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,730
he is the sect leader of Sigu Sect, Li Xiangyi.

740
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,520
Many people rely on him

741
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,870
and many people want to challenge him.

742
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,290
But not many people

743
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:52,690
really paid attention to his preferences.

744
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,760
Let me tell you secretly.

745
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,840
I've seen him

746
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,250
avoiding everyone to eat candy secretly.

747
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,420
Who would have thought

748
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:04,020
the number one martial artist Li Xiangyi

749
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,550
would be as happy as a child when eating candy?

750
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:29,790
Come to think of it,

751
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:32,700
-you are quite similar to my master...
-He’s not.

752
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,300
Not what?

753
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,760
In the great battle at the East Sea,

754
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,690
Li Xiangyi lost.

755
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,250
He should be the second best.

756
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,730
Are you saying Li Xiangyi lost to Di Fengsheng?

757
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:46,790
Did you witness it?

758
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:48,190
They fought at sea.

759
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,000
Where were you?

760
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,200
Are you a Fish Spirit or a Turtle Spirit?

761
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,100
Stop arguing.

762
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:54,210
Did you hear that?

763
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,470
It's about to start.

764
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:56,580
Let's go.

765
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,370
Don't talk nonsense.

766
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,820
There has been no news of the Shaoshi Sword for ten years.

767
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,040
It was found and reappeared

768
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,440
only because of the help of all my friends in the martial world.

769
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,700
More fortunately, we had two old friends who ran around with all their might.

770
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,720
So, it's Miss Qiao and Mr. Xiao

771
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,320
who found the Shaoshi Sword.

772
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:42,980
♫I'm only getting into character after half of my life♫

773

788
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:34,430
After all these years,

789
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:39,050
to have found the Shaoshi Sword that never left Xiangyi's hand,

790
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:40,580
we're also very comforted.

791
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,320
Today, I hope the people of the martial arts world

792
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,830
don't forget the ideal of punishing evil, promoting good

793
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,630
and bringing peace to the world.

794
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:53,440
So that we don't let Xiangyi down.
