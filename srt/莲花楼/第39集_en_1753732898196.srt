Episode 1

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Everyone, you are all the disciples of the Holy Land.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You are also loyal citizens of Nanyin.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Our clan has been subdued for over a hundred years.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Today is the day of our revival.

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We are here to pray for the sky and earth.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
In memory of Sun Yan, the Star Fire,

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
we pray for Nanyin to be prosperous and prosper!

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Congratulations, My Lord.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I, Shang Gu Dao,

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
have finally come to this day.

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Today, I am going to wear the Magnificent Talisman of Nanyin

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,600
Let everyone in the world bow at my feet.

53
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,800
Welcome to the Night Fire Hall.

54
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
What are you going to do?

55
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,400
You crazy bandits.

56
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,000
You won't succeed.

57
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,400
His Majesty and thousands of people

58
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,200
will never let you off.

59
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,800
Xiaobao.

60
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
You're sick.

61
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,000
Go away.

62
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
Go away.

63
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,000
Master.

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,600
Madam.

65
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,200
Master.

66
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,600
Are you okay?

67
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,200
I'm fine.

68
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,800
Madam.

69
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,600
I'll take care of this.

70
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
I'll go find Mutang.

71
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,200
Xiaobao.

72
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,000
Be careful.

73
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,200
Father is still sick.

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,200
You should be more careful.

75
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,200
Don't worry.

76
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,600
Protect my master and Lord Bao.

77
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,400
Go.

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,600
Master.

79
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,600
Master.

80
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,400
Master.

81
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,000
The bandit brought people in.

82
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,400
What's the hurry?

83
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,400
Bandit?

84
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,800
This unfilial son

85
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,600
is always against me.

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,200
I've spared his life.

87
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,200
He dares to come here again.

88
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
What should we do now?

89
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,200
Please try it.

90
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,200
As long as the Night Fire Hall is in my hands,

91
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,600
they can't succeed.

92
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
I'll leave it to you.

93
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,200
Okay.

94
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,200
Master.

95
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,000
Master.

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,800
Master.

97
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
Master.

98
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,800
Master.

99
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Master.

100
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
Master.

101
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Master.

102
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Master.

103
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,400
Master.

104
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,400
Master.

105
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,400
Master.

106
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,800
My junior is looking for you.

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,800
You're here to see me off.

108
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Shan Gu Dao.

109
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,800
You're so ugly

110
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
in this dress.

111
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,600
What did you say?

112
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,800
You don't look like an emperor

113
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,800
in this dragon robe.

114
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,000
How long do you think you can be a hero?

115
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,600
Open your eyes and look around.

116
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You're all mine.

117
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,800
Everything is under my control.

118
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,600
How dare you stop me?

119
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,600
Today,

120
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,400
you'll see how I'll conquer the world.

121
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,200
The ceremony outside has failed.

122
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,000
I guess Fang Xiao Bao

123
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,000
has ruined your Wuteng.

124
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Now you're gone.

125
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,400
What will you take to conquer the world?

126
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,800
Si Gu Men.

127
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You know it.

128
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,000
Attack.

129
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,000
Protect the princess and the people.

130
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,000
I'll go to receive them.

131
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yes.

132
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,800
The world is in chaos.

133
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,800
The evil is out.

134
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,200
The evil is out.

135
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Today,

136
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,800
I'll help you

137
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,400
clear the door.

138
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,800
If you want to die,

139
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,000
I'll help you.

140
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,000
You killed Master.

141
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,000
You still have the nerve to use his inner power.

142
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,400
You don't deserve it.

143
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,000
Fei, don't bother.

144
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,200
The revenge of the sect

145
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,000
and the debt of Si Gu Men.

146
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
Today,

147
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,200
I'll ask for your help.

148
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,400
Today, I'll use your head

149
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,000
to enter my Red Earth.

150
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,600
Come on.

151
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,200
Come on.

152
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
Li Xiang Yi

153
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
really surprised me.

154
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,800
It's just a few moves.

155
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,400
It's enough to deal with you.

156
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,800
Then I'll let you taste

157
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,800
my master's most powerful martial arts.

158
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,600
Come on.

159
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,600
Come on.

160
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,880
Please.

161
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,800
Please.

162
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,200
Please.

163
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,600
Please.

164
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Could it be?

165
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,200
Master.

166
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,400
From that time to now,

167
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,600
I earned ten trillion yuan

168
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,600
since I met you at the Seven cables bridge.

169
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,200
How about this one?

170
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,120
It's not a big deal.

171
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,640
But the peony can be removed.

172
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,720
As long as the peony is dead,

173
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,160
the purple peony will be in danger again.

174
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,040
How can we get rid of the peony?

175
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,720
It's better to live than die.

176
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,360
The blood of the purple peony

177
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,680
can be destroyed.

178
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,440
Now, the Night Fire Pond

179
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,640
is the princess of South Ying,

180
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,760
the princess of the Western Fangji,

181
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,440
of the Xuan Fei.

182
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,480
So as long as we can find the blood of the Xuan Fei,

183
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,640
we can destroy the peony.

184
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,680
The divine dance.

185
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,760
Let me go.

186
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,560
Na Ying.

187
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,160
Why didn't it work?

188
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,840
How could you break the measured sword of my stone star?

189
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,920
Master,

190
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,120
he did truly give you the first-class swordsmanship

191
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,800
from he can competitors any martial arts world.

192
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,320
This is Master's time-ाndro party's profitable trade.

193
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,280
This is the first-class swordsmanship

194
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,880
重要 to our master when he was defeated byure.

195
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,040
Impossible, thoseuntae

196
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,680
could not beendered.

197
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,120
Nicht vor require.

198
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,120
Impossible.

199
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,720
Impossible.

200
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,240
You can't win me

201
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,480
with your martial arts.

202
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,200
I don't believe

203
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,400
whatever you say.

204
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,600
Ji Bai, you don't need to try your best.

205
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,880
You were like this before.

206
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,720
Today, you're alone.

207
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,040
I just let you be.

208
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,800
Now,

209
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,080
I'll use the first lesson of Master Chuan

210
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,480
to clear the fog.

211
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,840
So what if you can win me with your martial arts?

212
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,280
In the end,

213
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,840
the whole situation is still in my control.

214
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,640
In the end, the winner

215
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,720
is still me.

216
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,840
Just wait and see.

217
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,440
Xuan Yun Xiao, protect the emperor.

218
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,280
Fang Duo Bin.

219
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,840
You're so unfilial.

220
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,600
I can't do it.

221
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,400
I'll help you.

222
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,000
Are you okay?

223
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,680
I'm fine.

224
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,560
Brother, take the blood.

225
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,600
The peony is the blood of Princess Xuan.

226
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,560
Master is the blood of Princess Xuan.

227
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,760
Why can't we control the peony?

228
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,720
Why?

229
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,040
How could this happen?

230
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,600
It seems that God is helping me.

231
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,920
Now,

232
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,560
I'll see how you can help me.

233
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,440
Go.

234
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,640
Master.

235
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,520
You can put it down.

236
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,600
The peony is melted.

237
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,400
Why?

238
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,520
How could it be melted?

239
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,280
What's wrong with me?

240
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,840
Why?

241
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,920
Only the blood of Princess Xuan

242
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,080
can destroy the Night Fire Peony.

243
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,520
Could it be...

244
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,160
The blood of the Night Fire Peony

245
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,600
is the only thing that can destroy the Night Fire Peony?

246
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,600
Could it be...

247
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,760
Could it be that the peony

248
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,080
is the real blood of Prince Fang and Princess Xuan?

249
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,560
Impossible.

250
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,040
It's impossible.

251
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,600
I have the blood of Princess Xuan.

252
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,680
There's a jade pendant

253
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,480
of the South Indian Tudeng.

254
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,520
Look.

255
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,080
Look at it carefully.

256
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,120
I'm the descendant of Princess Xuan.

257
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,360
The most respected person of South India.

258
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,480
This is your Fengqing.

259
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,760
She recognized me.

260
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,040
And...

261
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,280
Wan Shang's scar

262
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,840
is the important clue

263
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,240
that you've been looking for.

264
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,640
Do you dare to say

265
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,760
that I'm not the person you're looking for?

266
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,000
Ridiculous.

267
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,160
Shanggu Dao,

268
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,280
do you really think

269
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,040
that you're a noble man of South India?

270
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,800
You're just a little beggar

271
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,960
that I and Qi Mushan

272
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,040
picked up from the beggar team.

273
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,360
I can tell you now

274
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,600
what the hell is going on.

275
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,000
Qi Mushan and Li Xiangyi's father

276
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,600
were good friends.

277
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,920
The Li family

278
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,080
was originally from a hidden family.

279
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,600
They didn't think of it for a day.

280
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,800
In order to save someone,

281
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,600
they offended the bandits nearby.

282
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,400
The bandits attacked the Li family at night

283
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,200
and killed the whole family.

284
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,000
Only the two young masters survived

285
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,400
and wandered the streets.

286
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,200
After Qi Mushan and I

287
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,800
got the bad news,

288
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,800
we looked for the two young masters everywhere.

289
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,000
It's just a pity that

290
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,200
the two young masters

291
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,800
were killed by the Li family.

292
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,200
This jade pendant is my only dowry.

293
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,200
It's for you.

294
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,800
My brother Xiangyi,

295
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,200
please take care of it.

296
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,800
Li Xiangyi.

297
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,600
Keke.

298
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,600
I'm sorry.

299
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,800
I'm sorry.

300
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,800
I'm sorry.

301
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
I'm sorry.

302
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,800
I'm sorry.

303
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,200
Two words.

304
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,400
There are two words.

305
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,800
We had to take back

306
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,000
the four-year-old Li Xiangyi

307
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,800
from the beggar's team.

308
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,000
There's another one

309
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
who has been protecting him.

310
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,600
He's the same age as Li Xiangxian,

311
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,000
a little beggar.

312
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,600
Is this Xiangxian?

313
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,200
Who are you?

314
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,600
Who am I?

315
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,400
You're Shan Guodong.

316
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm Li Xiangyi.

317
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,200
Li Xiangyi.

318
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,400
You said you were my brother.

319
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,000
That jade pendant is yours.

320
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,200
This beggar is you.

321
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,200
Nonsense.

322
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,200
It's all nonsense.

323
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,200
Why don't I know these things?

324
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,400
Madam,

325
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,200
are you talking nonsense?

326
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,400
Okay, let me ask you.

327
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,600
We took you back

328
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,000
before the Cloud Shadow Mountain.

329
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,800
How much do you remember?

330
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,800
You can't remember, can you?

331
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,800
When your master and I

332
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,000
were saving you,

333
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
your hand was injured.

334
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,200
It's because of the wound on your wrist.

335
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,600
You were in a high fever and unconscious.

336
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,200
When you woke up,

337
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,400
you almost didn't remember

338
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,400
what happened before.

339
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,800
As for Xiangyi,

340
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,400
he was still a child

341
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,800
and under the age of a beggar.

342
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,600
So some things

343
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,400
are natural to not remember.

344
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,600
I, Feng Shi Yi,

345
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,800
have been looking for

346
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,400
Princess Xuan's blood

347
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,800
for over a hundred years.

348
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,400
Until 20 years ago,

349
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,400
we found out

350
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,200
Princess Xuan's grandson.

351
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
There was a ten-year-old son

352
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,400
who was buried under the door of the Cloud Mountain.

353
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,800
With this clue,

354
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,200
and the jade pendant of the South Yin Imperial Family,

355
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,800
and the mark on his body,

356
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,600
I won back my master.

357
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,600
I'm so happy.

358
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,400
I'm so happy.

359
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
You ruined my master.

360
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,400
It's all wrong.

361
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
Li Lian Hua,

362
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,400
you're my master.

363
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,200
So the blood of the Shankudao

364
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,400
is useless to the Night Oath.

365
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,400
The blood of Li Lian Hua

366
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,400
can only destroy this thing.

367
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
I don't believe it.

368
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,800
I don't believe what you said.

369
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,800
I don't believe a word you said.

370
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,400
Shiniang,

371
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
for ten years,

372
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
you know how much effort I've put in.

373
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
I don't believe it.

374
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,400
I don't believe it.

375
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,400
For ten years,

376
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,400
you know how much effort I've put in.

377
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,400
But you,

378
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,400
you said it was a misunderstanding,

379
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,400
a joke.

380
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
I think you're the joke.

381
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,400
And you, Li Xiangyi,

382
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,400
how can you have all the good things?

383
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,400
No one has ever fought with you.

384
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,400
It's all your own obsession.

385
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,400
I want to tell everyone

386
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,400
that the martial arts circle is mine.

387
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
The world is mine.

388
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,400
It's all mine.

389
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
I can't get the Shankudao.

390
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
No one wants to get it.

391
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,400
Now you're fully armed.

392
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,400
Your whole body is broken.

393
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
I hope you can do it well.

394
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
No.

395
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,400
Mine.

396
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,400
Everything is mine.

397
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,400
Mine.

398
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,400
Everything.

399
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,400
Everything.

400
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,400
Everything.

401
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,400
Is mine.

402
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,400
Mine.

403
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,400
Thank you for your help.

404
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
I didn't know it would be a big trouble.

405
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,400
I'm very grateful.

406
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,400
Mr. Fang,

407
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,400
you don't have to be so polite.

408
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,400
You're a nerd.

409
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,400
You don't have to be polite.

410
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,400
It's our duty

411
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,400
to punish the evil.

412
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,400
Fang Dubiao,

413
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
thanks to you,

414
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,400
I didn't expect you to be a hero.

415
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,400
I'm not a hero.

416
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,400
I'm a hero.

417
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,400
You're quite a hero.

418
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,400
I'll report everything to my father

419
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,400
and let him reward you.

420
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
Everyone,

421
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,400
the imperial guards reported that

422
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,400
the situation in the palace

423
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,400
has been settled by the secret

424
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,400
of His Majesty.

425
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,400
We'll go to the palace to meet His Majesty

426
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,400
and thank you in the future.

427
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,400
Mother,

428
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,400
you go back first.

429
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,400
I want to be alone.

430
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,400
I'll go see her.

431
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,400
So many things happened.

432
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,400
Let her be alone.

433
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,400
So many things happened.

434
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,400
She doesn't want to be alone.

435
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,400
She doesn't want any dust.

436
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,400
She doesn't want to live in the palace.

437
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,400
Human can't be alone.

438
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,400
What?

439
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,480
Are you feeling better?

440
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,160
Here.

441
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,240
Have some soup.

442
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,400
He's my biological father.

443
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,680
Seeing him in such a miserable state,

444
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,120
I feel bad about it.

445
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,120
If...

446
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,160
There's no if.

447
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,640
Don't look back.

448
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,040
Oh, my, my...

449
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,320
I'm sorry, want to say sorry for that?

450
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,000
I can forgive you,

451
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,440
if you want.

452
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,320
Pot最贴心

453
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,080
By not feeling regretful towards you.

454
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:26,960
You should have it 초多

455
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,040
to love yourself as if to sing guide you.

456
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,080
Now,

457
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,720
this song

458
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,480
has always made me !"

459
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,240
Xiao Bao.

460
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,400
You're a woodpecker.

461
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,080
You've built a broken building.

462
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,960
What will happen after you finish it?

463
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,560
Chief Di.

464
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,240
Chief Di.

465
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,680
You're eavesdropping on this.

466
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,920
You need to change it.

467
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,640
You've done what you wanted to do.

468
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,920
What's your next plan?

469
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,080
In the future,

470
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,760
I'll find a place to sunbathe and fish.

471
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,200
I'll be free.

472
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,680
I won't let you live so carelessly.

473
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:05,960
Oh, no.

474
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,200
I'm glad that he's back for me.

475
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,520
Did you finish your ice-lholder?

476
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,480
We're almost finished.

477
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,400
When you finish,

478
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,280
we're in trouble again.

479
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,200
Don't worry, everything's set.

480
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,440
You can always wait for the right moment.

481
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,640
Why are you so ungraceful?

482
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,200
I don't think I can do it well.

483
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,880
Because I've been bad,

484
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,400
I won't be as good as I once was.

485
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,400
I don't believe you.

486
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,880
Then, Chief Di,

487
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,760
this is what you've been asking for.

488
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,480
Are you willing to give it to me?

489
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,880
See you in the East Sea in half a month.

490
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,640
The East Sea War in half a month?

491
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,040
I was right.

492
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,360
This Di Feisheng

493
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,880
gave up his own wish

494
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,960
to let you live.

495
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,280
It's his conscience.

496
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,360
Li Lianhua,

497
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,800
after so much effort,

498
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:07,560
you finally have the

499
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,280
Wangchuan Flower.

500
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,400
Your poison can finally be cured.

501
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,080
The Wangchuan Flower

502
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,520
does have its own effect,

503
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,440
but my Bi Cha Poison

504
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,680
has been around for many years.

505
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,440
With the Wangchuan Flower,

506
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,600
at most,

507
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,560
only 30% of the chance can be cured.

508
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,160
Even 30% is a chance?

509
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,280
Now we're going to find Guan Hemo.

510
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:25,960
He must know

511
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,960
how to use the Wangchuan Flower.

512
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,200
Why are you looking for him?

513
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,840
I'm just a God Doctor.

514
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,240
My internal strength is not very stable.

515
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,960
I need to adjust it

516
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,440
to be able to use the Wangchuan Flower.

517
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,040
Don't worry.

518
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,440
Alright.

519
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,240
It's not a big deal to make a big deal of it.

520
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,560
Then I'll keep the Wangchuan Flower

521
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,240
and let you rest in peace.

522
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,080
No.

523
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,080
I have to find a exorcist first.

524
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,040
Then no one will think of

525
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,120
using the Wangchuan Flower.

526
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,560
Don't worry.

527
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,520
With you here,

528
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,840
no one can take it away.

529
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,080
Of course, I have to make sure

530
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,080
that everything is fine.

531
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,640
I've thought about it.

532
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,160
Once you've solved this problem,

533
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,480
we'll work together

534
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,680
to solve the world's problems

535
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,960
and get out of the world together.

536
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,560
Here.

537
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,200
I encourage you to get a reward.

538
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,640
I wish you a long life and a good health.

539
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,480
Thank you. I'll do it myself.

540
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,600
Mom.

541
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,960
You brat.

542
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,880
You're finally back.

543
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,520
Brother Yang is here too.

544
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,720
Brother Fang.

545
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:30,680
Brother Fei.

546
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,640
Your father didn't come back

547
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,080
from the palace market.

548
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,960
It's about to change.

549
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,960
I wonder if he has enough clothes.

550
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,080
Well,

551
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,480
you've been away for half a day.

552
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,840
I'll trouble you

553
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,720
to bring some common clothes for your father.

554
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,680
Market?

555
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,920
My father has been in the palace market for so long.

556
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,440
Mr. Yang,

557
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,160
how is His Majesty's health?

558
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,760
The Imperial Hospital has prescribed many medicines.

559
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,960
His Majesty is getting better.

560
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,480
But he hasn't been in a good mood.

561
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,760
He still needs to rest in bed.

562
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,080
These days,

563
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,160
fortunately, some lords

564
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,200
are helping His Majesty.

565
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,480
However,

566
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,920
Mr. Fang can't leave the palace for now.

567
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,120
I still have work to do.

568
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,240
I'll leave now.

569
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,840
Take care.

570
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,240
Brother Yang.

571
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,240
Brother Li.

572
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,840
I wonder if you have any idea

573
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,680
to bring someone to the palace to kill the emperor?

574
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,360
This is

575
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,560
a twenty- derrière him.

576
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,800
Ouyang Xi,

577
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,120
sounds like you are thinking of others.

578
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,080
It just makes me get drawn to you.

579
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,400
Your majesty.

580
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,400
Even if I thank your majesty,

581
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,920
I still can't accept my progress.

582
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,000
Don't say that.

583
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,880
I wouldn't understand you then.

584
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,960
Just by creams,

585
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,080
you just find something to pass down?

586
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,960
30 out of 30.

587
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,440
Is it right, my majesty?

588
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,120
GPS with a learning tag

589
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,800
is giving me an 81% chance.

590
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,680
Anything to pass me down

591
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,720
is so easily assignable.

592
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,760
When the son was born, the minister was not at home.

593
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,680
My wife said that he was weak and afraid of being unable to support himself.

594
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,640
So she named him Duobing.

595
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,720
Afterwards, she just didn't name him.

596
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,080
Fang Aiqing is loyal to the country.

597
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,640
But she looks down on her own daughter-in-law.

598
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,160
That's not good.

599
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,280
How dare you!

600
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,000
Do you still dare to hide it from me?

601
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,480
This Duobing is clearly a bandit

602
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,280
and a son of a good knife.

603
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,440
Did I say anything wrong?

604
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,800
Your Majesty,

605
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,480
Quan Zi knows very little about her background.

606
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,000
She has nothing to do with the incident of the bandit.

607
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Your Majesty,

608
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,800
I know that my father committed a grave crime.

609
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,600
As his son, I can't escape the punishment.

610
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,760
But this has nothing to do with the Fang family.

611
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,120
Please understand.

612
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,680
If you want to punish me,

613
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,440
then punish me, Fang Duobing.

614
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,240
I am willing to do it.

615
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,040
I have no complaints.

616
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,680
Father,

617
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,760
you didn't say that before.

618
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,880
If it wasn't for Fang Duobing,

619
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,960
they would have been able to save the family.

620
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,280
If I can't take the blame,

621
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,800
you can't punish the Fang family.

622
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,720
Shut up.

623
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,720
Guards.

624
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,200
Take the princess and Minister Fang away.

625
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,800
Father.

626
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,720
Get up.

627
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,120
Thank you, Your Majesty.

628
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,440
Fang Duobing,

629
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,160
you said that you wanted me to punish you alone.

630
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,800
But this crime

631
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,720
can't be cleared by others

632
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,120
just by your words.

633
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,960
Please explain, Your Majesty.

634
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,920
I heard that the Fang family's son

635
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,200
has made great progress in martial arts and literature.

636
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,320
He has also solved many cases in the martial arts world.

637
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,880
And some of them

638
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,520
are related to Nan Yin.

639
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,120
Tell me all about it.

640
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,400
Tell me.

641
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,360
I have my own decision.

642
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,600
I will tell you

643
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,280
what I saw and heard.

644
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,280
A hundred years ago,

645
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,080
the whip was destroyed by Nan Yin.

646
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,720
But the royal family's people were still alive.

647
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,040
That's the story

648
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,840
I told you.

649
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,760
How did you know about it?

650
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,640
I found the first dragon demon, Tianming,

651
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,720
in Yuan Bao Villa.

652
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,040
I started to investigate it.

653
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,800
I found clues step by step.

654
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,920
But I only found out everything

655
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,160
when I saw all the murals in the Jile Tower.

656
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,640
Fang Duobing,

657
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,040
you said that you saw the murals in the ruins.

658
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,960
But I have sent people to investigate it.

659
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,240
The ruins

660
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,120
are already a flat ground.

661
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,880
And the ruins that disappeared

662
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,800
have never been rebuilt.

663
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,320
How can you prove

664
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,840
that you are telling the truth?

665
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,760
Your Majesty,

666
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,360
everyone knows

667
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,120
the murder in the palace.

668
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,120
Lu Fang, the fourth person, and Liu Kehe

669
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,800
died in the river.

670
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,320
Your Majesty,

671
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,760
the murder in the palace

672
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,440
that caused the people to know

673
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,760
that Lu Fang, the fourth person,

674
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,960
and Liu Kehe, the second person,

675
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,680
were killed in the palace,

676
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,360
if you don't know,

677
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,560
I have an answer for you.

678
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,680
The four of them

679
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,680
found a

680
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,400
hidden treasure in the palace.

681
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,440
They thought

682
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,160
it was the legendary Jile Tower.

683
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,920
After hearing about it,

684
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,960
they were greedy

685
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,400
and took the four of them.

686
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,800
They were so strong

687
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,080
that they were invincible.

688
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,960
Luckily, Liu Kehe and Qi Shui

689
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,160
found out about it

690
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,720
and killed the four of them.

691
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,520
They protected the order in the palace

692
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,120
but they died.

693
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,280
The four of them were defeated

694
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,960
and were finally punished.

695
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,080
The four of them were killed

696
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,760
and were finally punished.

697
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,440
This is the truth of the Jile Tower case.

698
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,160
It will also be the whole truth.

699
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,040
This is the whole truth of the Jile Tower case.

700
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,680
It's also the whole truth

701
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,160
that I know.

702
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,960
Good.

703
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,480
This case is well-designed.

704
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,080
I am very satisfied.

705
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,000
Whether it's the Jile Tower or the treasure,

706
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,400
this case ends here.

707
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,120
If you reveal any information,

708
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,560
I wish you a long life.

709
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,400
Yes.

710
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,400
All right.

711
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,600
Tell your friends outside to come in.

712
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,840
Although I am old,

713
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,160
I am not old-fashioned.

714
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,520
I will pardon myself

715
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,080
for trespassing into the palace.

716
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,480
Greetings, Your Majesty.

717
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,280
Fang Doubing, you may leave.

718
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,440
I want to talk to Li Lianhua alone.

719
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,440
Well...

720
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,840
Your Majesty has a decree.

721
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,040
The Fang family and Tianji Hall

722
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,080
have made great contributions to the rescue.

723
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,760
Minister of Revenue, Fang Zhe,

724
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,480
is loyal and righteous.

725
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,080
He is virtuous and virtuous.

726
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:42,280
He has given us a thousand acres of rice and gold.

727
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,600
He has made great contributions to the rescue.

728
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,200
He is allowed to leave the palace to cultivate his tomb.

729
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,040
I am happy to hear that.

730
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,040
I am happy to hear that.

731
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,040
I am happy to hear that.

732
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,040
I am happy to hear that.

733
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,760
Thank you, Your Majesty.

734
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,360
I knew it.

735
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,680
Father is a wise man.

736
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,960
Fang Zhe is a son of the family.

737
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,440
Fang Doubing is wise and brave.

738
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,320
He is a talented man.

739
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,640
He is wise in the martial arts world.

740
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,920
He is happy to be in the temple.

741
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,120
He is allowed to travel around

742
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,160
and travel around the world.

743
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,360
He will marry Princess Zhaolin

744
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,480
if there is any injustice in the world.

745
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,920
He will be married one day.

746
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,600
That's all.

747
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,600
I will take the order.

748
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,320
He will marry one day.

749
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,840
Father, why do you want to marry one day?

750
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,040
I will go to ask Father.

751
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,680
Your Highness.

752
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,680
Thank you for your words for me and the Fang family.

753
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,680
But I am not qualified

754
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,680
to have any relationship with you

755
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,680
or the court.

756
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,840
Just take it as

757
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,480
we are meant to be.

758
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,480
Fang Doubing, you...

759
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,600
Fang Doubing.

760
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,600
Do you really like the martial arts world?

761
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,920
Yes.

762
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:19,280
If I can convince Father,

763
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,400
won't you stay in the palace

764
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,400
and be a courtier?

765
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,800
Since you don't like it,

766
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,800
I won't ask for it.

767
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,800
You can go.

768
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,800
I will let you go.

769
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,400
Your Highness, take care.

770
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,400
Your Highness.

771
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,600
Who can tell me

772
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,600
what will happen in the future?

773
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,400
You said it.

774
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,600
Okay.

775
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,400
I will wait for you.

776
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,400
When you have done enough,

777
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,400
come back and be my consort.

778
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,400
I will wait for you.

779
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,400
What did His Majesty say to you?

780
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,400
Okay.

781
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,400
I asked him some small things

782
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,400
and he gave me the pulse.

783
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,400
You are talking nonsense again.

784
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,400
It is obvious.

785
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,400
His Majesty knows you are the blood of the King of Fangji.

786
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,400
Didn't he make it difficult for you?

787
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,400
In this world,

788
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,400
people love to be generous and be kind to the people.

789
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,400
He is a good emperor.

790
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,400
I am just a person who is about to die.

791
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,400
What does he think?

792
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,400
Even if he is a good emperor,

793
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,400
if there is any possibility

794
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,400
to change his status,

795
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,400
he will never be soft.

796
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,400
Okay, Fang Jiangbao.

797
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,400
You are right.

798
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,400
Actually, I will tell His Majesty.

799
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,400
I took something from the Gile Tower.

800
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,400
If something happens to us,

801
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,400
this friend will not

802
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,400
take it seriously.

803
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,400
Nonsense.

804
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,400
What did you take from the Gile Tower?

805
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,400
You have been trying to fool me so many times.

806
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,400
I thought I would believe you.

807
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,400
You even lied to His Majesty.

808
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,400
You are really

809
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,400
a good doctor who can cure the dead.

810
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,400
Not bad.

811
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,400
You have grown up.

812
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,400
Look.

813
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,400
In this world,

814
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,400
there is no difference.

815
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,400
Let me ask you.

816
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,400
Who is better

817
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,400
to be an emperor than this person?

818
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,400
Besides,

819
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,400
if I have time,

820
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,400
I need to repair my lotus tower

821
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,400
and plant various kinds of radishes.

822
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,400
That would be great.

823
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,400
You need it.

824
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,400
When are you going to use the net to detoxify?

825
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,400
This is the real thing.

826
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,400
I am really not in a hurry.

827
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,400
Tomorrow, I have to go to the Four Ancient Gates.

828
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,400
There is one more thing

829
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,400
that needs to be solved.

830
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,400
Let's go.

831
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,400
I will go.

832
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,400
I will go.

833
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,400
I will go.

834
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,400
I will go.

835
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,400
I will go.

836
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,400
I will go.

837
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,400
I will go.

838
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,400
I will go.

839
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,400
I will go.

840
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,400
I will go.

841
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,400
I will go.

842
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,400
I will go.

843
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,400
I will go.

844
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,400
I will go.

845
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,400
I will go.

846
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,400
I will go.

847
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,400
I will go.

848
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,400
I will go.

849
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,400
I will go.

850
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,400
I will go.

851
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,400
I will go.

852
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,400
I will go.

853
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,400
I will go.

854
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,400
I will go.

855
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,400
I will go.

856
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,400
I will go.

857
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,400
I will go.

858
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,400
I will go.

859
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,400
The rain falls.

860
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,400
The sound of the flute is like the sound of the flute.

861
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,400
I can't help but feel warm.

862
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,400
The rain has stopped.

863
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,400
The moon rises.

864
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,400
The dust is like dust.

865
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,400
If I can't turn back time,

866
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,400
I will wait for the clouds to stop.

867
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,400
The time we spent together is like a blink of an eye.

868
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,400
The love has not yet gone.

869
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,400
I don't want to be separated from you.

870
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,400
I just hope that we can meet again.

871
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,400
I don't want to see you again.

872
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,400
The world is too cruel.

873
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,400
I can't wait to see the old days.

874
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,400
The future is long.

875
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,400
I want to change my fate.

876
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,400
The world is too cruel.

877
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:52,400
I have experienced so many hardships.

878
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:59,400
Who doesn't want to part with the past?

879
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,400
The world is too cruel.

880
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,400
I can't wait to see the old days.

881
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,400
The future is long.

882
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,400
I want to change my fate.

883
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,400
The world is too cruel.

884
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:20,400
I have experienced so many hardships.

885
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:27,400
Who doesn't want to part with the past?
