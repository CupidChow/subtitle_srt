00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Ask

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
After four thousand times

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Thousands of times

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The most reluctant

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Is that moment

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
On the earth

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A thousand miles of wind and waves

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who doesn't wander

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
On the edge of the cliff

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
On the earth

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The youth is wild

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The youth is drunk like a wine

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
A journey through the world

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Like a dream

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
On the earth

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
A thousand miles of wind and waves

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Who doesn't wander

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
On the edge of the cliff

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
On the earth

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The youth is wild

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The youth is drunk like a wine

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
A journey through the world

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Like a dream

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
On the earth

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
A thousand miles of wind and waves

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
On the earth

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
A thousand miles of wind and waves

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Who doesn't wander

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
On the earth

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
On the earth

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
On the earth

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
On the earth

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
On the earth

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Don't you think your body is hot

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Chest stuffy?

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
No

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The key to this Suzhou fast

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Is a mirror

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The main thing is to speak less and be quiet

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If you talk, you will be breathless

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Like a cannonball

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You see what you do

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Qiu Mingyi

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yes

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
This is not just a disease

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
How to see

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I heard

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The owner of this Yuan Bao Mountain Village is full of gold

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Rich in wealth

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I can't even imagine

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You say

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Even this kind of person can't be cured

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Looking for a divine doctor all over the world

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
That must be a disease that even the gods have

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Forgot

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
quiet

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Don't talk

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You want to ask me what to do, right?

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's time to wash the city

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Although you have Suzhou fast

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But it's just temporarily suppressed the piano

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
To completely clear the internal force of the sound

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Need a cold plant to do

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Now I can only think of this Yuan Bao Mountain Village

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The blue head of the blue is usable

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Don't think too much

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Put on clothes

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Go go

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Go to Yuan Bao Mountain Village

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You are afraid that the owner of Yuan Bao Mountain Village

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Don't want to borrow

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It doesn't matter

77
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Full of gold, gold, gold, gold

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
My name as a divine doctor

79
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I can definitely get in

80
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Borrow this Bolan's head

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You are afraid that I will wear a gang in this art meeting

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Right

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Not Fang Xiaobao

84
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You don't know me too well

85
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
This is the power of the enemy

86
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Not to mention a full of gold

87
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What

88
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Annoying, Fang Xiaobao

89
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Where is the character that is so bold and so good?

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Why are you nagging for so long?

91
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Tianji Mountain

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You are afraid of this Yuan Bao Mountain Village

93
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Too close to this Tianji Hall

94
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
He was caught back, right?

95
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Think about it

96
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But your life is not important

97
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
As long as there is life

98
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Even if you are caught

99
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You can still escape

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This is not your usual work

101
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
go

102
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The Lord has begun to doubt me

103
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
He has let Wu Yan investigate the past

104
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The Lord said it

105
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
If you investigate the thing about the thunder and fire

106
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Saintess

107
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You have done so much for the Golden Thread Embroidery

108
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Even if the Lord knows the past

109
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He won't blame the Saintess

110
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I have done so much for the Golden Thread Embroidery

111
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
But just to make him happy

112
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
If he doesn't care about the Golden Thread Embroidery

113
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What do I care?

114
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Even if the time changes

115
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I don't regret

116
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The joint action with the Wan Sheng Dao

117
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That year

118
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
He set twelve women to protect the right and left

119
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
How can I tolerate other women by his side?

120
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
As long as the Lord has nothing

121
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
He will find

122
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I am the best person for him

123
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Saintess is right

124
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The Lord trusts the Saintess

125
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Trust

126
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Now he only has me by his side

127
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But his heart is not with me

128
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But it doesn't matter

129
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
When I give him the whole martial arts world

130
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
By then

131
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
His heart will be given to me

132
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Uncle Xue

133
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But

134
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yes, Saintess

135
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:15,900
We have obtained the Demon-dragging

136
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Song Xin

137
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I want to see his master

138
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yes

139
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's rare for the Saintess to be so anxious

140
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's rare for the master behind the wind to appear

141
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
We have been working together for ten years

142
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But you have been hiding your face and being so far away

143
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's really heart-wrenching

144
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Saintess is so anxious

145
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Is there any good news?

146
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Four Heavenly soldiers who opened the Tower of Luomao

147
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Were handed over to four men who were hiding in the Central Plains

148
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
They are now in the hands of their descendants

149
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I can only tell you one thing

150
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
My people will also go to get the Heavenly soldiers

151
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
If you have the ability

152
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Finally, it depends on what is in the hands of each person

153
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
How about it?

154
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Good

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Then I will tell you the first one

156
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Brother

157
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The master of Yuan Bao Mountain Village, Jin Mantou

158
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
He is very timid and cautious

159
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Do you want to take it or take it?

160
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
No matter what means I will get that Heavenly soldier

161
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I want to take it

162
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You said to build my building

163
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
This Tianji Hall is going to catch you

164
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's not going to hurt my building

165
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
No need to be so tight

166
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
What?

167
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
No

168
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What are you doing?

169
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Don't panic

170
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We are not bad people

171
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I went to pick up Qiu Yibang

172
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
To see your master

173
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Why are you dressed like this?

174
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Still sneaky

175
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Pick up the medicine in the way

176
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It can be a cultural pet with this

177
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Please help me inform the doctor

178
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Just say that Li Lianhua is asking for an audience

179
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Impudence

180
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Are you the god doctor of the living dead?

181
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Li Lianhua

182
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Really

183
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Nice to meet you

184
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
This is my helper

185
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Coincidence

186
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Okay

187
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
There are just a few god doctors in the village

188
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The god doctor can have tea with him

189
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Talk about medical skills

190
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
it is good

191
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Okay, thank you

192
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Please come in

193
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I often hear that there are countless treasures in the Jinmantang Jinyuan

194
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Ten thousand people live in the Jiangwu Fuhao Bangqian for a long time

195
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I met you today and I really have to pass on my name

196
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You are here again

197
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Don't run

198
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Guanyi doctor

199
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
His tongue is white and his upper jaw is down

200
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's clearly a cold and cold

201
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Take me to give you a drink

202
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Immediately

203
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Guanyi doctor

204
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
My disease is really good

205
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You have been drinking since yesterday

206
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm almost cooked by you

207
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Usually others ask me to see the doctor

208
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
No door yet

209
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Today I am here

210
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I am happy today

211
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Look at your face, white and weak

212
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
There must be a gas in this miscarriage

213
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So I took the initiative to help you think about it

214
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I didn't expect you to be so uneducated

215
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It turns out that there is no door

216
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Old senior

217
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Excuse me

218
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Excuse me

219
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I am Li Lianhua

220
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I was a little careless just now

221
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I hope the senior will forgive me

222
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Li Lianhua

223
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You are the one who is rumored to be the owner of the lotus building that can kill people

224
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
This looks ordinary

225
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I just know some rough medical skills

226
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
This is the so-called Ruyan Shenzhen's hero

227
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Guan He Meng

228
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
This was Brother Guan

229
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I haven't seen the medical skill of rising and falling

230
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Li Lianhua

231
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Let's see who is better at art

232
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Just

233
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's him

234
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Where did the little duck come from?

235
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So rude

236
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Little duck

237
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Are you following the doctor?

238
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
The doctor hasn't been injured yet

239
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What's your business?

240
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You are so dumb

241
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I don't understand you

242
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What are you talking about?

243
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Hey, police officer, Ya Zheng

244
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Brother Guan is a stranger

245
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
This is just my assistant

246
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I don't know the rules when I first entered the world

247
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Don't take it to heart

248
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'll definitely ask brother Guan to teach me when I come down one day

249
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's still the doctor Li who is gentle and reasonable

250
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's just that you have to teach me well

251
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Brother Guan is right

252
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Don't be so familiar with him

253
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
No problem

254
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
This is the ghost doctor of the ghost sword of King Yan, Jian Ling Xiao

255
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
There is nothing wrong with the throat

256
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's just that there is a piano that is temporarily suppressed

257
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's not a disease

258
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But I can help you lose some piano

259
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You are so rude

260
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Lose the piano

261
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Duck needle

262
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It turns out that it's not a mute

263
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
That's a pity

264
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'll find you later

265
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
All famous doctors and doctors gather together

266
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
My Yuan Bao Villa is really a grand place

267
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You are Jing Man Tang

268
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's me

269
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I heard that the gold moon is so dark and dark

270
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm so confused

271
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
But what I saw today

272
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
The gold moon is as deep as the red and the face is bright

273
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's not like you're sick

274
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
To be honest

275
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I invite you all here

276
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I do have another request

277
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
This is a letter I received for a month

278
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
This letter says

279
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
To hand over all the money from the Yuan Bao Villa

280
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Otherwise, you have to kill him

281
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Who sent this letter?

282
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's so wild

283
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I have no clue about the investigation

284
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
This money is an external thing

285
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
For me

286
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's not that important

287
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's just that the family business passed down by the ancestors

288
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
How can I give it to those thieves?

289
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Now I have strengthened the guards in the Yuan Bao Villa

290
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's not easy for thieves to break in

291
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But it's hard to prevent

292
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
A few days ago, a servant was poisoned

293
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm really worried

294
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So you want to invite us here

295
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
To give you some food

296
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
In case someone poisons you

297
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
If something really bad happens

298
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
There are so many doctors here

299
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You can be safe, right?

300
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
That's right

301
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I didn't expect that

302
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm a doctor

303
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But I was tricked here

304
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
To be a servant's wife

305
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
If you help us pass this

306
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I will treat you well

307
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I can treat you

308
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You are really good

309
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It seems that I came well

310
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Zongzheng Mingzhu

311
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
How are you?

312
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Aren't you locked in the prison?

313
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I have to thank you

314
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
If you didn't bother me in the prison

315
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm still sitting here

316
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I have no chance to sit on the position of the supervisor

317
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Everyone

318
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Don't worry

319
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Although I am in the martial arts world

320
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I have done some good for the court

321
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So I can invite the supervisor and Zongzheng

322
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
To help me

323
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Take me down

324
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'll see who dares

325
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Why did you arrest him?

326
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Li Lianhua

327
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
He is a fraud

328
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And all the places are in the murder case

329
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Very suspicious

330
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I think he is the one who is out of the capital

331
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Zongzheng

332
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You are a little bit of a public security

333
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I am here every time

334
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Because I am traveling with Fang Jing

335
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And I will find out the truth every time

336
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But

337
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You are so good at fighting

338
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You can wash yourself

339
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So interesting

340
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You

341
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
The supervisor can only ask about the related matters

342
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Li Lianhua is innocent

343
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Never say anything

344
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What does it have to do with your supervisor?

345
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You don't even care about the rules of the court and the world?

346
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Ok

347
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I can't control the Baichuan Courtyard

348
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
But this is the mountain villa outside the capital

349
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Why are these people who don't know the way here?

350
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Director Jin

351
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You have to think about it

352
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Forget it

353
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Fang Dongbin

354
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
The supervisor can't get me

355
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Then I can only go

356
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Although you are the organ of Tianqi Hall

357
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
The world is invincible

358
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But it's useless

359
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Everyone

360
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Goodbye

361
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Wait

362
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I think you must have some misunderstanding with Zongzheng

363
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Since they are all my guests

364
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
How can I be patient?

365
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Why don't you give me a face?

366
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Make a living

367
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Actually I have prepared a banquet

368
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I am waiting for you to sit

369
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Zongzheng

370
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
What do you think?

371
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You can go

372
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Just go

373
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Ok

374
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I am leaving

375
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
See you

376
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Goodbye

377
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Goodbye

378
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Goodbye

379
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Goodbye

380
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Goodbye

381
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Goodbye

382
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Goodbye

383
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Goodbye

384
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Goodbye

385
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Mr. Fang

386
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's my duty

387
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
But I have a request

388
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Director Jin

389
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I want to borrow the head of the Bolan people in the villa

390
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
What?

391
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You want my head of the Bolan people?

392
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
This

393
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Director Jin

394
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's like this

395
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
We want to borrow the head of the Bolan people

396
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It will be used to cure

397
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It will be returned immediately

398
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Director Jin

399
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Mr. Fang

400
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's really inconvenient

401
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
We are leaving

402
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Goodbye

403
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Wait

404
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
This

405
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
The head of the Bolan people is my treasure

406
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You two want to borrow

407
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You have to be sincere

408
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
If you can find out the person behind it

409
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
The person who killed me

410
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
The head of the Bolan people

411
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Of course it's not a problem

412
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I don't want to be a target

413
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You don't need to be a target

414
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I don't want to be a target

415
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You have to be a target

416
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I don't want to be a target

417
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
The mechanism is ready

418
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Please

419
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,440
This is the lock of the closed formation.

420
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,360
It's only in this room.

421
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,680
Now that the formation is open,

422
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,400
as long as someone gets close to this room,

423
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,480
they'll be trapped by this sealed lock.

424
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,480
It'll soon alert the whole manor.

425
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,560
This...

426
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,160
Someone broke into the formation so quickly?

427
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,480
You... You are...

428
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,400
You are...

429
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,200
You are...

430
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,120
You are...

431
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,960
You are...

432
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,840
You are...

433
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,680
You are...

434
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,880
This is my adopted daughter, Zhiyu.

435
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,600
Father, I...

436
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,240
I was just passing by.

437
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,480
I didn't expect you to have a guest.

438
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,400
My daughter is 29 years old.

439
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,080
She doesn't usually see outsiders.

440
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,640
She's afraid of strangers.

441
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,280
Sorry for the inconvenience.

442
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,960
You should go back now.

443
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,160
There's a formation here.

444
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,960
You'll have to allow me to enter.

445
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,800
You may leave.

446
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,080
Let me untie it for you.

447
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,960
Your body is weak.

448
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,920
It's too weak.

449
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,160
I'm just weak.

450
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,960
I've asked the doctor for treatment.

451
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,880
I won't bother the doctor anymore.

452
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,280
When you two catch the person who's going to harm me,

453
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,680
we'll talk about the head of Bolan.

454
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,600
Officer Jin.

455
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,640
He just helped to set up the formation.

456
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,640
He's going to help us to go outside.

457
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,040
It seems that the situation is too real.

458
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,280
There are so many people guarding Yanbao Villa.

459
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,960
And he even killed a bell-like pearl.

460
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,080
I think he must help Jin Mantang

461
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,400
to get the head of Bolan.

462
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,760
Brother Jian.

463
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,280
You two are brothers.

464
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,240
Brother Jian.

465
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,960
So you live in this house.

466
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,840
I didn't expect that

467
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,880
you are also a person who loves flowers.

468
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,200
I just like to use flowers as medicine.

469
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,040
You are also a person who is good at medicine.

470
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,040
You should know the medicinal value of these flowers.

471
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,280
Of course.

472
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,480
For example,

473
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,720
I often use this to treat patients' pain.

474
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,200
You mean the hook?

475
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,120
The hook is a long grass.

476
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,480
How can it be used?

477
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,000
I just accidentally brought it up

478
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,280
when I was pulling out the hole.

479
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,840
I was about to throw it away.

480
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,640
Well.

481
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,320
Everything in this world is different.

482
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,280
If I remember correctly,

483
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,080
there is a kind of grass in this world

484
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,520
called Guan Yin Hammer.

485
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,200
Yes, it's Guan Yin Hammer.

486
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,960
It can balance

487
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,080
the poison of the hook and can also keep the medicinal value.

488
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,960
It's very useful after being used.

489
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,280
I don't know if you remember it.

490
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,920
I suddenly remembered that

491
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,040
we have something to do.

492
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,520
Brother Jian, I won't bother you.

493
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,320
You go ahead.

494
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,480
Go.

495
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,720
Let me tell you.

496
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,960
You are quite bold.

497
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,440
You are not afraid of being caught

498
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,640
by the government officer.

499
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,360
I have a thick skin.

500
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,520
Of course I'm not afraid.

501
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,040
You are so talkative.

502
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,520
And you lied to me that I can't be born.

503
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,160
And I didn't ask you to settle the dumb things on the way.

504
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,120
Calm down.

505
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,480
What the hell?

506
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,080
Don't think I can forgive you

507
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,120
by looking for that Bolan guy.

508
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,000
I tell you.

509
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,040
I am going to...

510
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,600
What's going on?

511
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,640
What's going on?

512
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,480
What are you doing?

513
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,840
Don't talk so loudly.

514
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,680
Stop yelling.

515
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,520
The steel air in your body

516
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,720
has been sealed into your teeth.

517
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,440
Hurry up and sit down.

518
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,600
Use my teaching you.

519
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,400
Sit down.

520
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,500
Sometime later

521
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,100
Although Ireach for that moment,

522
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,220
the steel air in your body

523
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,260
will spontaneously

524
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,740
hurt your life.

525
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,820
Stop the Arin.

526
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,680
We've arrived at Bai Lao Xu.

527
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,880
It seems that we don't have much time left.

528
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,280
We must complete the task of the Golden Pond as soon as possible.

529
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,440
Life is like a journey.

530
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,440
I am a man.

531
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I'm ready.

532
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,080
It's better not to talk.

533
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,520
What do you mean?

534
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,120
I mean

535
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,800
you shouldn't be so excited.

536
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,720
If you're excited,

537
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,880
the piano will come up.

538
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,840
It's coming up.

539
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,120
It will become mute again.

540
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,600
Don't worry.

541
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,200
The enemy will be angry.

542
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,560
When I have the piano,

543
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,560
I will take it back to Baichuan Courtyard.

544
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,320
Master.

545
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,680
Let's go.

546
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
Master.

547
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,040
Master.

548
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,040
What's going on?

549
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,840
Master hasn't come out yet.

550
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,520
The visa is still open.

551
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,320
Jin Yuanwan should be inside.

552
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,320
Jin Yuanwan.

553
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,840
Please close the visa.

554
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,480
What's going on?

555
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,840
What's going on?

556
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,560
The door and window are closed.

557
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,800
We've been shouting for a long time.

558
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,360
But there's no response.

559
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,680
It's too late.

560
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,680
Fang Debing.

561
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,680
I'll go inside to see

562
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,680
Fei Le's resignation.

563
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,680
Okay.

564
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,680
The mechanism has been checked.

565
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,680
It's open.

566
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,680
That's great.

567
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,680
Jin Yuanwan.

568
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,680
Where's Jin Mantang?

569
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,680
Master.

570
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,680
Master.

571
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,680
The door and window are locked from the inside.

572
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,680
How did he get out?

573
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,680
Since the door and window are locked,

574
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,680
the visa is still open.

575
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,680
Jin Mantang

576
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,680
will never leave the room.

577
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,680
Manager Jin.

578
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,680
Where's the secret room in this room?

579
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,680
Secret room?

580
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,680
I...

581
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,680
I never know.

582
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,680
Jin Yuanwan.

583
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,680
You've been writing a letter of apology.

584
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,680
Why did you keep

585
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,680
a piece of paper with a broken tooth?

586
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,680
I think...

587
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,680
This is the key.

588
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,680
Let's go.

589
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,680
Master.

590
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,680
Master.

591
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,680
Master.

592
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,680
Call the doctor.

593
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,680
Save my master, quickly.

594
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,960
Save my master!

595
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:34,800
Master!

596
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,080
Master!

597
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,440
Master!

598
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,720
Master, what's wrong with you?

599
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,400
Master, wake up!

600
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,080
Look!

601
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,400
Are you all right, Master?

602
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,120
No problem.

603
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,720
Dangerous!

604
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,800
Doesn't matter!

605
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,360
It's Dong Ling.

606
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,840
Dong Ling of Qing Ling Sword?

607
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:17,920
Yes.

608
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,680
It was he.

609
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,200
Why is he here?

610
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,240
The person who was stabbed to death was not poisoned.

611
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,240
There were no other injuries.

612
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,960
There's poison on this.

613
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,720
I'll go to the bathroom.

614
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,680
It's Coulain.

615
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:08,440
Coulain's poison will make people feel nauseous and die of greed.

616
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,040
But Donglin actually had a brain injury.

617
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,680
How many times did he lose his blood?

618
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,440
Could it be that Donglin was poisoned?

619
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,840
He can't control his body.

620
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,280
He hit his brain to death.

621
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,880
It seems to be the case.

622
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,440
Could it be that he's the one who threatened to go to the Hall of Pure Love?

623
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,240
But I've seen Donglin in the martial arts world.

624
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,680
He always has a good taste.

625
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,960
I've never heard of any connection between him and the Hall of Pure Love.

626
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,960
He's not a coward.

627
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,560
That's strange.

628
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,640
Donglin usually wears such a thick coat.

629
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,560
He's wearing a summer jacket.

630
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,560
Li Lianhua, look.

631
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,720
It's a witness.

632
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,400
What is a witness?

633
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,720
A witness is a rare disease.

634
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,520
The patient's skin will gradually turn into a tree bark.

635
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,400
When the disease is severe,

636
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,680
it will grow out of the tree roots like a tree trunk.

637
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,120
It will look like a monster and be hard to cure.

638
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,000
It will be painful to death.

639
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,080
The head of Bolan...

640
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,080
The head of Bolan is missing!

641
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,680
It seems that Donglin has found the reason for coming to the Yuanbao Villa.

642
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,680
Stop pretending.

643
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,480
You're wearing a head of Bolan that can cure hundreds of diseases and help people live a long life.

644
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,000
But you're hiding in the Yuanbao Villa.

645
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,800
Who doesn't know that?

646
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,800
You're the one who's hiding in the Yuanbao Villa.

647
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,800
You're the one who's hiding in the Yuanbao Villa.

648
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,800
You're the one who's hiding in the Yuanbao Villa.

649
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,920
Don't tellançae.

650
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,920
police can't figure out it's you.

651
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,120
But you're the only one who doesn't know it's you.

652
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:07,480
I'm sure you covid,

653
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,760
and have no problem curious about this thing.

654
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,160
It seems, the head of Bolan is here

655
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,680
to cure the January.

656
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,840
Yes!

657
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,120
to recognize Dong Lin?

658
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,240
Yes.

659
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,200
I recognize him.

660
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,080
I even recognized him at the party!

661
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,320
Half a month ago,

662
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,760
Dong Lin came to see our master.

663
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,520
I listened to him from afar.

664
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,880
I heard him calling for the head of the Blue Man.

665
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,360
What is the head of the Blue Man?

666
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,120
The most precious thing in the world!

667
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,240
I've never seen it before!

668
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,280
Can I give it to him?

669
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,360
Look.

670
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,120
Why don't we discuss it again?

671
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,320
Stop it.

672
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,240
No, no, no.

673
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,080
Don't...

674
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,280
What happened later?

675
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,840
A few days later,

676
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,680
Dong Lin took his Golden Bell Sword

677
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,560
and fought with it.

678
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,800
My poor Dong Lin

679
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,760
was forced to do this.

680
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,880
So he was hurt by the sword

681
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,720
and was kicked out.

682
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,120
The sword?

683
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,960
The one just now?

684
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,320
Yes.

685
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,360
It's the master's defense.

686
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,160
Then this matter is clear.

687
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,600
Dong Lin asked for the head of the Blue Man.

688
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,800
So he was hinting at the way.

689
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,640
But Jing Mantang found out.

690
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,720
Dong Lin was good at martial arts

691
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,040
and killed Jing Mantang.

692
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,640
Jing Mantang used the sword

693
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,920
to shoot the poisonous embroidery.

694
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,360
The witness and evidence are all here.

695
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,120
Take action.

696
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,160
Come on.

697
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,600
Take the body out.

698
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,360
Yes.

699
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,120
Master.

700
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,400
if others need to look after you,

701
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,560
then come here.

702
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,760
From now on,

703
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,840
Yuan Bao Villa given by the Supervisory Department.

704
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,160
All人

705
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,560
leave.

706
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,960
It's not your house.

707
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,960
What's the use of listening to you?

708
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,280
That committee asked for the main court first.

709
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,160
It's just a matter of course

710
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,560
for the Supervisory Department to handle it.

711
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,520
Bring him back.

712
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,280
Hold it.

713
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,760
What should we do if he runs away?

714
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,560
Dong Ling is dead.

715
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,240
Where can we find the murderer?

716
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,720
It's the right time.

717
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,360
Since both of them are dead,

718
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,080
I want to ask you.

719
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,880
Where is the head of Bolan?

720
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,360
Don't forget.

721
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,840
The box just now

722
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,360
was empty.

723
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,800
Could it be that the thing in the box

724
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,960
had a foot and ran away?

725
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,400
Unless there is another explanation.

726
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,800
And the third person.

727
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,240
The third person is the murderer.

728
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,040
The doors and windows are locked from inside.

729
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:39,920
And there is Mr. Fang's

730
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,720
The murderer killed both of them.

731
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,400
So there is no way

732
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,680
that he could have been there.

733
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,640
Don't be angry.

734
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,040
Besides,

735
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,840
don't you think there is something

736
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,240
strange?

737
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,720
What is it?

738
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,840
The shoes.

739
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,120
The shoes?

740
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,880
Jin Mantang's shoes

741
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,640
are only one.

742
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,160
When they were fighting,

743
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,600
the king of flowers dropped a shoe.

744
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,120
What's so strange about it?

745
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,880
Jin Mantang

746
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,280
wears a horse shoe

747
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,360
instead of a shoe.

748
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,600
Everyone knows

749
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,720
that it's a bit troublesome to wear.

750
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,200
Why did it fall down?

751
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:22,920
Besides,

752
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,000
if Jin Mantang was caught by Donglin,

753
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,000
he tried his best to shoot the shoe,

754
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,040
Donglin died because of the escape.

755
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,120
That proves that

756
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,840
both of them died at the same time.

757
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,760
I want to ask you.

758
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,960
Who took

759
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,160
Jin Mantang's other shoe?

760
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,520
Well...

761
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,400
Let's marty for the person who took Jin Mantang's shoe.

762
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,840
I see.

763
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,200
There has to be a third person

764
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,280
who is self-한테ping everywhere in the secret room.

765
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,280
That's why Jin Mantang

766
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,520
committed suicide.

767
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,200
That's right.

768
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,000
Mr. Jin.

769
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,760
I'd like to ask,

770
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,840
last night,

771
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,680
when your mistress

772
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,280
returned from the office?

773
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,160
and killed him.

774
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,840
That's strange.

775
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,240
I set up the Qianling Town myself.

776
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,000
How did Dong Lin and the third person

777
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,640
get in and out?

778
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,560
Look.

779
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,920
There are many other clues.

780
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,080
I'm afraid

781
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,920
you have to investigate it again.

782
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,680
It seems that

783
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,840
we have to find out the source and the source

784
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,320
to get justice for the two dead.

785
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,400
Since there are still some doubts,

786
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,440
let's talk about it.

787
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,440
I do have a question.

788
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,080
I heard that the owner of Lotus Pavilion

789
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,880
has the best medical skills,

790
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,000
but he never takes the initiative to see the soldiers.

791
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,560
He has more than 50 taels of silver

792
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,200
and never goes out of the town.

793
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,640
But why did Yuanbao Villa

794
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,120
take the initiative to search for medical supplies

795
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,720
in the last episode?

796
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,240
Isn't it exactly less than 50 taels?

797
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,400
The young master Fang

798
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,240
who can speak and can't speak at the same time

799
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,920
is clearly made of the strong weapons of the fatal.

800
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,520
I'm afraid you are just like Dong Lin.

801
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,760
You came for the head of Bolan.

802
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:38,840
That's right.

803
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,760
We do have this intention.

804
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,440
But don't forget that

805
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,140
we are the ones who

806
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,120
refuted the stupid argument between the two of you.

807
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,600
We won't be fooled by the fire, right?

808
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,040
Who knows

809
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,520
if you two hid the head of Bolan

810
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,640
in the villa

811
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,160
after you two committed the crime last night?

812
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,600
Because I suddenly wanted to drive you away,

813
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,400
you two found a reason to stay

814
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,000
and took the treasure.

815
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,080
What you said makes sense.

816
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,000
I can't refute it.

817
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:08,920
Then tell me.

818
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,000
Last night, your whereabouts...

819
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,040
We were in the room last night.

820
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,240
You never went out.

821
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,840
We can prove it to each other.

822
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,040
You two are in the way.

823
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,760
You can't do anything.

824
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,320
Besides, those evil leaders outside the hall

825
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,520
are also set up by you, Fang Duo.

826
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,160
If you want to go out,

827
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,840
you won't have a life.

828
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,200
You two are the most suspicious.

829
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:31,840
You...

830
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,120
Calm down.

831
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,400
Where's the piano?

832
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,400
The piano...

833
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,320
I'm so angry.

834
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,280
Mr. Zongzheng,

835
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,040
if we're talking about suspicion,

836
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,400
why did you avoid everyone yesterday

837
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,560
and quietly went to see this man?

838
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,440
If I'm not mistaken,

839
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,040
you two seem to have had a lot of conflicts.

840
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,880
It's just some business.

841
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,320
What?

842
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,000
Do I have to explain it to you?

843
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,800
No need.

844
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,480
It's just that

845
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,480
you might be heartbroken

846
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,680
because of these business.

847
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,440
You...

848
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,040
Speaking of which, I remember that

849
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,720
last night,

850
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,880
I saw the officer

851
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,480
sneak out of the room with a bag.

852
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,520
I don't know what he was doing.

853
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,720
Me?

854
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,640
What's wrong with me going out?

855
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,320
If you say so,

856
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,760
I saw Mr. Gongyang

857
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,120
secretly following Miss Zhiyu last night.

858
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,080
Come on.

859
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,600
Hurry up.

860
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,640
I just saw

861
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,880
Miss Zhiyu coming out of the Seoul cry gi-gui's room

862
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,200
at midnight.

863
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,440
It's quite suspicious.

864
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,160
I'm just giving you

865
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,840
a meal to eat.

866
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,680
Mr. Qian,

867
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,440
you said you saw Brother Guan

868
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,280
leave at midnight.

869
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,760
How did you know?

870
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,160
Did you go to see the moon

871
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,280
by chance?

872
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,960
It's been a long time.

873
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,720
I get it now.

874
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,280
Everyone

875
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,120
has a little secret.

876
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,280
No matter where you are,

877
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,720
my mother Пquisite

878
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,400
'll serve you.

879
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,120
What are you doing here?

880
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,720
I'm searching for people.

881
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,720
Don't hide away.

882
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,360
If you have suspicion,

883
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,040
just look around

884
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,560
for the Head of labor

885
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,720
and see for yourself.

886
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,520
Go and have a look.

887
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,800
I think Zong Zheng Ming Zhu

888
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,120
is obviously trying to

889
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,280
close the case as soon as possible.

890
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,080
What does he want to do?

891
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:19,880
He insisted on

892
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,240
getting the case of Yuan Bao Villa.

893
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,200
It's not like he

894
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,440
came here to press it.

895
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,160
The Yuan Bao Villa

896
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,600
has been turned upside down by him.

897
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,560
Is it because he and Jin Man Tang

898
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,680
want to get rid of him?

899
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,800
In Yuchun,

900
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,720
we found that the Junyun Alliance

901
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,760
had something to do with him.

902
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,880
Could it be that the Junyun Alliance

903
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,240
wants this thing?

904
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,600
If he says so,

905
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,560
could it be him?

906
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,440
But with his brain,

907
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,480
he can't get into

908
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,520
my Qianling Town.

909
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:46,920
Hand over the bag.

910
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,560
Or I won't leave.

911
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,040
How dare you!

912
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,160
I said no search.

913
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,000
I said no search.

914
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,600
What's going on?

915
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,280
He doesn't let us search.

916
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,200
Brother Guan,

917
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,440
everyone in this villa

918
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,760
is being searched.

919
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,360
Why can't you see it?

920
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,840
If you're really innocent,

921
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,800
then show it to people in a big way.

922
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,440
Brother Guan,

923
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,000
can I see this bag?

924
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,120
Everyone,

925
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,560
there's nothing in this bag.

926
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,480
You can rest assured.

927
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,520
Let's go.

928
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,560
Let's go.

929
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,600
Li Lianhua,

930
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,120
thank you so much.

931
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:46,920
You're welcome.

932
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,480
What's going on?

933
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,920
You're always biased against him.

934
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,680
I'm helping you.

935
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,920
I don't want to embarrass you.

936
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:56,920
Lv Shengyi,

937
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,120
can I talk to you?

938
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,640
Li Lianhua,

939
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,400
can I talk to you?

940
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,600
I have something good to show you.

941
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,040
I'm sorry.

942
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,840
I'm sorry.

943
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,480
I'm sorry.

944
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,040
I'm sorry.

945
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:34,640
I'm sorry.

946
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,240
I'm sorry.

947
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:35,840
I'm sorry.

948
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,440
