Look.

There's a river pebble here.

126
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,460
It's just a pebble.

127

What's so special about it?

128
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,330
There is no underground river under the dry well.

129

Where did the river pebble come from?

130

Look.

135
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,180
This should be the entrance of a mining cave.

136
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,180
But it seems to be sealed on purpose.

137

00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,160
Wait.

139
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,350
When the stagnant air in the mine meets naked flames,

140
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,340
it might trigger an explosion.

141
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,140
I heard it exploded several times before.

142
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:20,980
Be careful.

143
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,730
Take cover for now.

144
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,060
So not all emeralds in Xiaoyuan City

There are still some hidden clusters.

147
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,500
The biggest cluster

148
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,430
is right under the Baishui Garden.

149
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,580
Look.

150
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,680
There is an emerald bed here

151
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,030
and a teapot.

152
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:21,920
Looks like

153
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,980
someone recently practiced martial arts here.

154
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,780
This should be the Hell Mansion.

155
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,280
In the past, when the King of Hell got married,

156
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,130
he only targeted unmarried women.

157
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,590
Now, he abducted my mother

158
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,020
just because we bought this mansion.

159
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,420
He sure went out of his way

160
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,430
to protect the emeralds here.

161
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,100
Something's not right.

162
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,000
Think about it.

163
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,050
If he wanted to keep this mansion,

164
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,420
why did he

165
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,830
pretend to die in the fire?

166
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,580
After he died,

167
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,610
the mansion would naturally belong to someone else.

168
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,100
He won't be able to hide himself like this.

169
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,200
There's no need to do this.

170
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,150
Was an enemy hunting him,

171
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,090
so he left in a hurry?

172
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,330
Even if he wanted to hide,

173
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,450
he wouldn't have

174
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:07,310
pretended to be the King of Hell looking for a bride.

175
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,890
He must have done it out of lust, then.

176
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:12,420
I don't think Lian Quan is that kind of person.

177
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,260
Don't think too much now.

178
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,580
Let's go search somewhere else.

179
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,370
Why is the body on the ground missing its lower half?

180
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,570
Where did his legs go?

181
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,940
Maybe he never had legs.

182
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,100
Look.

183
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,080
The bone frame on the wall is complete.

184
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,160
But this one on the ground

185
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,120
was cut off from its waist.

186
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,770
Could they be Niutou Mamian?

187
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,360
Look.

188
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,640
The ribs are black in colour.

189
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,420
It does look like the work of Bizhong Strike.

190
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,330
They must have suffered

191
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,370
a lot when they were alive.

192
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,700
Did the Lord of the Netherworld

193
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,300
fall out with Niutou Mamian,

194
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,430
so he tricked them here to kill them

195
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,460
and cruelly separate their bodies?

196
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,240
The Lord of the Netherworld

197
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,370
is really vicious.

198
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,020
It's strange.

199
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,530
What is?

200
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,410
I think

201
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,560
something is wrong with this body.

202
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,460
If he left Niutou Mamian here to rot,

203
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,640
then who is cooperating with Lian Quan outside?

204
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,780
Young Master.

205
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,980
I feel a little dizzy.

206
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:47,620
Oh no.

207
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,220
I think there's poison here.

208
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,420
Let's get out of here.

209
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,850
This is not emerald.

210
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,620
It's a kind of ore that commonly grows alongside emeralds,

211
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,580
called emerald jade.

212
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,200
The two ores you found

213
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,700
look almost identical.

214
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,940
But they have very different effects.

215
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,550
The emerald jade is not only worthless,

216
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,130
but also highly poisonous.

217
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,560
If people stay near the mine long enough,

218
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,430
they may start to cough up blood from the lungs.

219
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,510
This ore will also explode when ignited.

220
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,150
However,

221
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,920
emeralds love to form alongside these jades.

222
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,100
It's inevitable that accidents happen when mining.

223
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,990
Later, people thought of

224
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,510
marking the emerald jades when they stumbled upon them.

225
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,660
This way, if the locals see it,

226
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,100
they will avoid it.

227
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,130
It's really hard to tell them apart.

228
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,270
It's hard for ordinary people to tell.

229
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,090
If it weren't for people like us

230
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,970
who have been miners for decades,

231
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,880
who can tell the difference?

232
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:52,980
Thank you.

233
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,420
Goodbye.

234
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,150
I don't understand.

235
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,150
Why are you wasting your time here?

236
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,420
What does it have to do with us

237
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,350
if this is emerald or emerald jade?

238
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,400
I understand now.

239
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,400
What do you understand?

240
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,710
I know why Lian Quan

241
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,400
had to put up the whole

242
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,960
King of Hell's wedding act.

243
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,090
Actually, when Lian Quan first arrived here,

244
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,090
he couldn't tell the two ores apart.

245
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,700
If he practiced his martial arts

246
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,890
on emerald jades instead of emeralds,

247
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,030
what do you think will happen?

248
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,610
By right, the Bizhong Strike

249
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,910
needs to use the emerald

250
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:36,990
to detoxify.

251
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,710
Doing this will only make the poison seep deeper,

252
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,860
possibly into his bone marrows.

253
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,450
I heard that there's a cruel technique

254
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,110
called Yunuqiao.

255
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,920
It can use one's inner power to transfer

256
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,740
the poison to a girl's body without hurting one's inner breath.

257
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,620
Out of greed, Lian Quan

258
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,300
continued to maintain his power

259
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,690
by using emerald jades.

260
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,460
At the same time, he consistently

261
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,660
transferred the poison to innocent girls.

262
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,850
It's so vicious.

263
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,400
My mother is still in his hands.

We have to save her first.

We'll talk about the rest later.

269

Let's look for clues separately.

Suhua's body?

285
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:23,790
There is a deep cave at the foot of the mountain.

286
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,720
It rained heavily a few days ago

287
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,400
and several bodies were washed out.

288
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,640
They were all the bodies of the girls abducted by the King of Hell.

the poison palm left over by Yunuqiao.

314

but a criminal?

Their families practiced different trades.

As for common friends,

I'm not sure.

Did Suhua see a physician before she died?

That day, S-Suhua's mother had a headache.

eventually led a wealthy life

515
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,310
and didn't want to partake

516
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,750
in such a dangerous venture anymore.

517
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,900
I didn't expect that after all these years,

518
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,700
I escaped the Jinyuan Alliance,

519
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,960
but couldn't escape Baichuan Court.

520
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,820
Many years ago,

521
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,670
I met the Lord of the Netherworld

522
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:40,880
once.

523
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,870
Why do you look so different from him?

524
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,530
I accidentally used the emerald jade to practice

525
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:51,770
and was badly poisoned.

526
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,410
My appearance had long changed.

527
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:55,750
If I hadn't used the Sanskrit technique to change my skin,

528
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,410
I wouldn't even appear human.

529
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,070
A Sanskrit technique for changing your skin?

530
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,470
It's a secret technique.

531
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,310
Only a few enlightened monks

532
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,090
can acquire the method from the Sanskrit scripts.

533
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:06,390
It can transform a person anew

534
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,190
and completely change one's appearance.

535
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,320
Completely change one's appearance?

536
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:14,780
All right, I've told you everything I know.

537
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,170
You also got the Rama Heavenly Ice.

538
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,370
Please let me go.

539
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,410
Let you go?

540
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:20,860
Have you ever let those girls

541
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,390
who were murdered by you go?

542
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,110
I'll make you pay

543
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,350
for all your crimes.

544
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,660
This is an important matter.

545
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,620
I'm going to ask the All-Knowing Mr. Su

546
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,820
to verify whether the Ice is real or not.

547
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,270
I'll leave you to escort Lian Quan.

548
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:39,630
Let’s split up.

549
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:43,230
Since the Rama Heavenly Ice is so important,

550
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,430
I can’t let you go off on your own with it.

551
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,760
I should go with you.

552
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,920
You still don't trust me,

553
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,260
right?

554
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,170
It's only right that I don't trust you.

555
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,470
If we go together,

556
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,650
what will happen to Lian Quan?

557
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:00,380
Should we leave him at the post?

558
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,940
Fang Duobing is here.

559
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,720
It's safer to lock Lian Quan

560
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,420
in the Baishui Garden bought by the Fang family

561
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,790
than in the post.

562
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,000
You need not worry.

563
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:12,460
Okay.

564
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,290
Come with me then.

565
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:18,780
Sister Shi.

566
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,880
What are you going to do with Lian Quan?

567
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:23,270
Three days.

568
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,960
I'll be back in three days.

569
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,890
I'll leave Lian Quan with you in the meanwhile.

570
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,740
Alright, I'll interrogate him then.

571
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,070
Interrogate Lian Quan?

572
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,180
Is he hiding something?

573
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:34,910
I think he is.

574
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,180
I'll find a way to make him talk in the next three days.

575
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,070
Bashi.

576
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,940
You're so skilled.

577
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:55,580
You can knead the dough in one hand and cut the dough in the other.

578
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,790
My mother said

579
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,370
if the neighbors saw it,

580
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:01,620
they would think that the dough wasn't kneaded enough.

581
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,140
But I'm strong.

582
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,160
I'm used to it.

583
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,560
I can't change my habit.

584
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,430
Can't change your habit.

585
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,200
The one who intercepted

586
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,380
and the one who used Yunuqiao were both the physician.

587
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,840
He struck with both palms.

588
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,750
But the one who snuck into Baishui Garden

589
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,070
had the habit of using one palm.

590
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,470
There's another person.

591
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,820
Who is this person?

592
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:25,190
Two fried dough sticks.

593
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:25,710
Okay.

594
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,180
I'll put the money here.

595
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:31,730
Bashi.

596
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,870
Why did you put the money

597
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,040
in a bowl of water?

598
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:38,060
M-my hands are greasy.

599
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,410
I dirty the money when I touch them.

600
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:42,710
I see.

601
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,440
Incense ashes.

602
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:21,090
Tianji Hall's products are all the best.

603
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,220
This Liushui octagonal cage

604
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,580
was specially built overnight for you.

605
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,710
The flowing water will help you detoxify and keep you alive.

606
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,250
Very considerate, isn't it?

607
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:49,890
But...

608
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:58,970
If you don't tell us who your accomplice is,

609
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,750
you won't be able to enjoy the life-saving water.

610
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,110
What accomplice?

611
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,440
Stop pretending.

612
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,170
When I chased you that day,

613
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,570
someone covered for you.

614
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,500
Did the poison enter your brain

615
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,630
and make you forget?

616
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,580
That was just a thief I hired.

617
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,880
Every time I abduct someone,

618
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,610
I hire a thief from the underworld to act as a decoy

619
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,070
so I can strike easily.

620
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:23,330
I pay them when the deed is done

621
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,840
and we never associate with each other again.

622
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,450
Never associate with each other again?

623
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,580
That can't be right.

624
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,340
I remember my mother's Bone-breaking Pearl

625
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,460
landed a solid hit on the intruder.

626
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,300
The Bone-breaking Pearl strikes deep into the bones.

627
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,210
But just now,

628
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,330
I saw no trace of such injury on you.

629
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:40,920
The only explanation is,

630
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,220
you were not the one struck by the Bone-breaking Pearl.

631
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:43,980
It's possible that you hired a thief

632
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,610
to abduct someone for you.

633
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,400
But to bear the Bone-breaking Pearl for you,

634
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,930
that's not worth the price.

635
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,160
Tell me.

636
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,370
Where is your accomplice?

637
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,260
You're quite stubborn.

638
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,320
Ms. He, please.

639
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,890
It's been a long time since I made a mechanism overnight.

640
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:08,820
Because of you,

641
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,090
I stayed up all night.

642
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:14,070
These mechanical hands

643
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:17,190
specialize in poking the most itchy and painful acupoints.

644
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,420
It can change its target seven times in two hours.

645
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,310
Sometimes, it'll make you cry out of pain.

646
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:24,120
Other times, it'll make you laugh till you're breathless.

647
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:24,920
Be sensible.

648
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,290
Just answer

649
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,770
whatever Xiaobao asks.

650
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,870
Otherwise, prepare to suffer.

651
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:44,219
Tell me.

652
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:46,100
Where is the accomplice?

653
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:51,389
Looks like you're prepared to die.

654
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,590
Let me tell you.

655
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:55,639
I haven't settled the scores with you for abducting me.

656
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,570
Let's see how long you can hold out.

657
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:01,210
By the way,

658
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,550
I haven't named the mechanism yet.

659
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:08,260
Let's call it the Lotus Acupoint Fingers.

660
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:09,820
Fang Xiaobao.

661
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:10,900
What do you think?

662
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,970
Call me when he confesses.

663
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,070
You brat.

664
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,170
You're good at avoiding work.

665
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,490
[Hanshui Temple]

666
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,510
Master, you're so composed.

667
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:40,190
The Bone-breaking Pearl must have hurt a lot.

668
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,530
Oh, wait.

669
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,910
I shouldn't call you Master.

670
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:47,790
Should I call you Niutou,

671
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:49,530
or Mamian?

672
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,170
Didn't you see

673
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,690
Niutou Manian's bodies in the mine?

674
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,920
You're right.

675
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:57,990
Yes.

676
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,690
When I first saw

677
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:01,630
the two bodies in the mine,

678
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,420
I did suspect that they were Niutou Mamian.

679
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,670
But out of the two corpses,

680
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,310
one was heavier than the other.

681
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,420
The legless body had

682
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,160
a much wider pelvis bone.

683
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,740
It belonged to a woman.

684
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:18,110
So the people who died in the mine

685
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,620
were not Niutou Mamian,

686
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,940
but Lian Quan and his wife.

687
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,200
Am I right?

688
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,350
Smart people are indeed hard to deal with.

689
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:29,170
But you're only half right.

690
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,360
You killed Lian Quan and his wife,

691
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,060
stole Lian Quan's secret book,

692
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:37,310
and mastered the Bizhong Strike. But you feared being hunted by his enemies,

693
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,940
so you disguised Lian Quan and his wife's bodies

694
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,780
into their current state.

695
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:41,910
Right?

696
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:45,240
We didn't kill Lian Quan for his martial arts.

697
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,830
We did it to protect ourselves.

698
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,330
Many years ago,

699
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:07,970
we were discriminated against by others for our appearance.

700
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,960
But Lian Quan thought highly of us.

701
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,690
We were very grateful.

702
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:15,130
So, when the Jinyuan Alliance surrounded Lian Quan's mansion

703
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:16,810
for the Rama Heavenly Ice,

704
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,160
we risked our lives to help him escape

705

[Niutou, Li Xiao]

706

[Mamian, Li Xiong]

707
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,070
and fled to Xiaoyuan City to live in hiding.

708
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,970
But he married

709
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:26,000
a frivolous woman here,

710
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:27,690
and started to suspect us.

711
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,030
He thought we were preying on that woman.

712
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,040
Lian Quan lured us into the mine

713
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:36,050
with the excuse of teaching us Bizhong Strike.

714
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:37,580
Then, he made us practice on

715
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,890
the poisonous emerald jade instead of emerald.

716
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,690
By the time we found out, we were already poisoned.

717
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,640
He thought we would die down there from the poison.

718
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:49,610
But my younger brother, Li Xiong, reversed the skill

719
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:52,010
and transferred all the toxins to himself.

720
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,890
Then, he separated our bodies.

721
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,940
Although I lost my lower limbs,

722
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,000
I was not poisoned.

723
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,490
I was able to move with the help of mechanisms.

724
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:02,570
But my brother was poisoned and in critical condition.

725
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,150
Brother.

726
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,400
Brother!

727
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:05,150
Don't!

728
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:05,820
Brother!

729
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,210
I was in a hurry to save my brother's life

730
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:10,500
and tried many ways.

731
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,300
Then, I finally found out that the abbot of Hanshui Temple

732
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,260
owned the Yunuqiao mental codes that could detoxicate and save lives.

[Hanshui Temple]

734
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:20,230
I killed the abbot, stole the book, and kept my brother alive.

735
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,100
After that,

736
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:23,250
I used the identity of the abbot of Hanshui Temple

737

[Hanshui Temple]

738

-and take revenge on Lian Quan.
-Brother.

[Yunuqiao Mental Codes]

743
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:34,760
Madam.

744
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:36,020
At last, one day,

745
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:39,110
I managed to lure Lian Quan into the mine

746
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,250
and killed him and that woman.

747
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,570
Then, I disguised the bodies

748
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,130
to look like us.

749
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,790
This way, even if the Jinyuan Alliance finds out,

750
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,630
they won't suspect us.

751
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,460
Everything was perfect.

752
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,970
But while we avoided the Jinyuan Alliance,

753
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:03,500
we couldn't avoid you guys.

754
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,790
My brother, Lee Xiong,

755
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,250
has been captured, right?

He's in the hands of the Baichuan Court.

757
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,830
Fortunately, I'm not that unlucky.

758
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,320
God gave me

759
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,580
a chance to survive.

760
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,760
Your identity has been exposed.

761
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:18,430
You still want to survive?

762
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,890
With Li Xiangyi, the leader of the Sigu Sect here,

763
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:21,920
of course I can.

764
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,520
That day, you used Whirling Steps when you were chasing me.

765
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,380
Sect Leader Li,

766
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:27,820
you can't fool me.

If it were Lee Xiangyi,

768
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:33,110
do you think you could have escaped?

769
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,520
Sect Leader Li,

770
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,910
you came all the way to Xiaoyan City.

771
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,190
Surely, your goal is the Rama Heavenly Ice,

772
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,990
just like the Jinyuan Alliance.

773
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,480
Promise me one condition,

774
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,460
and I'll happily give you the Rama Heavenly Ice.

775
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,860
The Baichuan Court has already acquired it

776
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,920
from your brother.

777
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,430
That one is naturally a fake.

778
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,840
We have no one to depend on.

779
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,220
The Rama Heavenly Ice is our lifesaver.

780

I have to keep it until the end.

781
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,070
But now I have you, Li Xiangyi.

782
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,770
I can give the Ice away.

783

784
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:07,070
Promise me,

785
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,880
and the Rama Heavenly Ice is yours.

786
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,260
Otherwise, I'll hand it over to the Jinyuan Alliance.

787
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,180
Although they are not as trustworthy as you,

788
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,580
they're still capable of keeping us alive.

789
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,020
Tell me.

790
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,110
What do you want me to do?

791
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:21,960
Save my brother Li Xiong

792
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:24,210
and cure his Bizhong Strike poison.

793
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,120
I know.

794
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:28,760
The Yangzhouman is the best inner power in the world.

795

You're too optimistic.

798
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,810
I'm no longer a member of the Baichuan Court.

799
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,290
I'm wanted on the Blade List.

800
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:41,430
I can't save your brother.

801
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,540
That's your problem now.

802
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,350
It has nothing to do with me.

803
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:48,390
I know you're close to Fang Duobing,

804
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,280
the detective of Baichuan Court.

805
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,720
You might be able to use him for this.

806
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:53,890
Finally,

807
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:55,670
Sect Leader Li, let me remind you.

808
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:56,930
You only have two days.

809
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:57,860
Once the time is up,

810
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,060
I'll ask the Jinyuan Alliance for help.

811
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,730
You better hurry up.

812
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,620
Looks like I'll have to offend Fang Xiaobao again.

813
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,480
It's not a big deal to promise you.

814
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,750
But I'm worried.

815
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,170
Sect Leader Li.

816
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,160
What are you worried about?

817
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,710
Your brother's Ice is fake.

818
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,700
I have to check if your Ice

819
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:19,850
is real.

820
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:28,950
Li Xiangyi is a man of his word.

821
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,560
I believe you won’t take the treasure by force.

822
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,160
You don't have to threaten me with my past reputation.

823
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,420
I'm only confirming its authenticity.

824
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,880
I won't snatch it from you.

825
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:54,850
Deal.

826
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,160
Fang Xiaobao.

827
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,270
Why did you lock the prison?

828
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,890
The physician hasn't confessed yet.

829
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:04,740
Your mechanism poked him

830
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,790
till he was frothing in the mouth, yet he was silent.

831
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,850
It means he won't tell on his partner.

832
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,440
It's useless to force him.

833
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:14,290
Even the mechanism made by me, the Tianji Hall Sect Master,

834
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:15,490
can't get him to fess up?

835
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:16,860
I refuse to admit defeat.

836
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,300
Go.

837
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:18,480
Open the door.

838
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,760
Let me improve

839
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:21,260
the Lotus Acupoint Fingers.

840
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:21,900
No need.

841
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,580
Let's try another way.

842
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,980
He's willing to protect his partner's identity with his life.

843
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,180
It means they are very close.

844
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,620
He will definitely come to save him.

845
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,460
I've set up traps

846
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,480
all around Bashui Garden.

847
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,540
If he dares to come,

848
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,850
I won't let him escape.

849
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,520
What are you doing here again?

850
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,340
I thought about it.

851
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,630
Since I'm on the Blade List,

852
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,540
there's no point in hiding.

853
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:03,420
So,

854
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,940
you're here to turn yourself in?

855
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,620
I have no other choice.

856
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:10,660
Why don't we work together again?
