[Episode 9]

4
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,720
After all these years,

5
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,530
we finally found the Shaoshi Sword that Xiangyi always carried with him.

6
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,880
We feel so relieved.

7
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:55,740
I hope everyone in the martial world

8
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:00,660
can keep in mind the noble cause of righting wrongs and maintaining peace.

9
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,800
That's also Xiangyi's wish.

10
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,560
Xiao Zijin is so bold now.

11
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,660
Shi Shui.

12
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,110
It's been ten years.

13
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:26,930
I thought

14
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,400
Qiao Wanmian was your woman.

15
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,590
Ms. Qiao only belongs to herself.

16
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,800
It's my honor

17
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,120
to witness the return of the Shaoshi Sword with you.

18
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,190
Look.

19
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,350
It's really the Shaoshi Sword.

20
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,220
Li Xiangyi cut a stunning figure in the martial world

21
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,550
with the Xiangyi Swordplay he invented.

22
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,480
I heard that to entertain Ms. Qiao,

23
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,700
he tied a long red ribbon around the hilt of that sword

24
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,530
and played the 36 Drunken Moves

25
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,400
on the roof of House of Delights in Yangzhou.

26
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,000
Everyone came out to see him.

44
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,460
It's said that countless people flooded the streets

45
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,530
just to see that sword with the red ribbon.

46
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,760
This must be eye-opening for you two.

47
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:49,390
He was too young

48
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,070
and too ostentatious.

49
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:52,740
Yes.

50
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,490
Too ostentatious.

51
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,710
What's that attitude?

52
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,100
You can never achieve what he achieved.

53
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,560
You two are just jealous.

54
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,600
To make it more thrilling,

55
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,710
you can come on stage for a spar.

56
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,170
When the incense burns out,

57
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,550
the one on the stage

58
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,680
with the ribbon flower

59
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,210
can try the Shaoshi Sword.

60
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,240
Try the Shaoshi Sword?

61
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,190
I'll surely win!

62
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,070
It's quite lively.

63
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,860
The Sect Leader likes activities like this.

64
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,780
I bet he's very happy now.

65
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,540
I've known you for so long

66
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,250
but never asked the name of your sword.

67
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:41,850
Sword.

68
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:43,330
Sword?

69
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,100
It doesn't have a name?

70
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:45,700
A sword is a sword.

71
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,960
It doesn't need a name.

72
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,920
That one has a fancy name

73
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,190
but ended up in someone else's hands.

74
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,940
Whatever you say.

75
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,830
Aren't you going to take back your sword?

76
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,650
It's not mine.

77
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,930
Li Xiangyi died a decade ago.

78
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,250
Are you still upset about being defeated by me?

79
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:23,970
Li Lianhua?

80
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,370
What are you doing up there?

81
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,120
That mask…

82
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,659
Time's up.

83
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,230
The one holding the ribbon flower won.

84
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:50,830
Li Lianhua,

85
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,220
you lucky dog!

86
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,270
Shut up.

87
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:58,170
You're not an old friend of the Sigu Sect.

88
00:06:58,610 --> 00:06:59,820
I've never seen you before.

89
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,380
May I know your name?

90
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,790
My surname is Li.

91
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,020
Li?

92
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,890
What's your full name?

93
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,610
Li Lianhua.

94
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:32,770
You're Physician Li.

95
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,640
I've heard a lot about you.

96
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,590
You got the chance

97
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,110
to try the Shaoshi Sword.

98
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,450
But I… I don't know how to use swords.

99
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:44,890
You cheated!

100
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,250
It's unfair!

101
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,780
Come down! Come down!

102
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,550
Guys.

103
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,140
Mr. Xiao said

104
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,659
that whoever got the ribbon flower won.

105
00:07:58,659 --> 00:07:59,590
He is the winner.

106
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,970
You're all big shots in the martial world.

107
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:02,830
Don't be sore losers.

108
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,340
Right?

109
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,340
Young Master Fang is right.

110
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,330
Physician Li has Xiangyi's surname.

111
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,970
Maybe he's destined to win.

112
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,290
Physician Li,

113
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,670
try the sword.

114
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,460
Go.

115
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,380
Go!

116
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,180
What a good sword!

117
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,580
It's so beautiful!

118
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,950
It…

119
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,830
How dare you destroy the Shaoshi Sword?

120
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:37,720
Guys,

121
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,910
calm down.

122
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,110
There must be a misunderstanding.

123
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,670
What did you do to that sword?

124
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,090
This sword is a counterfeit.

125
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,770
Counterfeit?

126
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,480
Impossible.

127
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,750
Why did you say that?

128
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,350
It's a good counterfeit.

129
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,700
Even the carving on the hilt is exactly the same.

130
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,860
But I heard that Li Xiangyi got this sword at the age of 15

131
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,660
and kept using it for five years.

132
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,960
But this hilt

133
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,890
looks brand new.

134
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,150
It doesn't make sense.

135
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,420
No abrasion at all.

136
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,130
Here, take a look.

137
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,340
When Xiangyi fought with Master Wuyou,

138
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,240
to save Wuyou's life,

139
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,220
he used the hilt of his sword to parry Wuyou's fatal blow.

140
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,700
This hilt is intact.

141
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,940
It's really a counterfeit.

142
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,230
This is not the sword I brought back.

143
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,830
Master Ji,

144
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,320
the sword was swapped.

145
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,590
As I said.

146
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:02,730
[Sword Room]

147
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,580
Look.

148
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,500
Three days ago,

149
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,680
Ms. Qiao and Mr. Xiao

150
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,110
brought back the Shaoshi Sword and locked it here.

151
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,580
The Sword Room is strictly guarded.

152
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,450
No one has entered here in the past few days.

153
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,910
Before the Sword-Appreciation Ceremony,

154
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,400
Shi Shui and I took the sword out.

155
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,040
I don't think anyone had the chance

156
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,590
to swap the sword.

157
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,240
Look.

158
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,470
Something seems wrong here.

159
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,520
Gosh.

160
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,090
Why is there a tunnel here?

161
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:40,840
Who did it?

162
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,900
When was it dug?

163
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,840
I wonder where the tunnel leads.

164
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,260
Should we go down and check it out?

165
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,120
Mian.

166
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,730
It's stuffy down there.

167
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,180
You may get an asthma attack.

168
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,500
Why don't you wait here?

169
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:52,900
No.

170
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,960
I went through a lot to finally find the Shaoshi Sword.

171
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,760
I can't wait here and do nothing.

172
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,550
Let's go.

173
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,520
This tunnel was dug at least half a month ago.

174
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,090
But the Shaoshi Sword was only sent to the Sword Room

175
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,150
in the Baichuan Court three days ago.

176
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,230
Did someone anticipate its coming?

177
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,750
Half a month ago?

178
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,710
By that time, I'd written a letter

179
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,950
to Master Ji and we'd decided

180
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,350
to keep the Shaoshi Sword in the Sword Room.

181
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,790
Few people have access

182
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,320
to our letters.

183
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,560
Seems that it's an inside job.

184
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:44,970
The tunnel is so long.

185
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,160
There's a clear dividing line here.

186
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,060
The section we walked through is recently dug.

187
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,380
The rest of the tunnel is quite old.

188
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,770
It was dug at least ten years ago.

189
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,640
So someone extended an old tunnel

190
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,390
to the Sword Room?

191
00:12:59,070 --> 00:12:59,910
Ten years ago,

192
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,220
the Baichuan Court was a branch of the Sigu Sect.

193
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,450
We lived here at that time.

194
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,850
Has any one of you heard of

195
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:05,970
this long tunnel?

196
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,100
This tunnel…

197
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:12,980
Mian.

198
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,160
Are you feeling uncontrollable?

199
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,240
Li Lianhua.

200
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,350
Come here.

201
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,930
Coming through.

202
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,680
She's dead.

203
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,740
A stab in the chest killed her.

204
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,480
It's been four hours.

205
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,060
Rou?

206
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:51,700
Rou.

207
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,480
She's my maid Rou.

208
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,500
I couldn't find her anywhere this morning.

209
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,590
Did she know that the Shaoshi Sword was kept in the Sword Room?

210
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,190
She's been my maid for years.

211
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,220
All the letters I exchanged with Master Ji

212
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,740
were sent and received by her.

213
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,980
The cut is thin and clean.

214
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,180
Judging from its length, it was left by the Shaoshi Sword.

215
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,830
There are two types of footprints here.

216
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:14,920
They're not messy.

217
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,740
So there was no fight.

218
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,580
They were standing face to face

219
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,670
and Rou didn't expect the attack.

220
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,190
It seems that Rou conspired with someone

221
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,160
to steal the Shaoshi Sword

222
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,220
but her accomplice killed her.

223
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,450
These footprints are big.

224
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,850
They must belong to a man.

225
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,980
You're right.

226
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,480
That guy

227
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,350
should be hiding in the Pudu Temple.

228
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,590
I'm so sure

229
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,800
because the monks in that temple

230
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,980
all wear homemade straw shoes like these.

231
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,180
They're not for sale.

232
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,770
Half a month ago,

233
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,900
a new cook arrived there.

234
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,130
Half a month ago?

235
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,760
That fits the timeline.

236
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,870
Yes, it does.

237
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,360
There's a crack in the wall.

238
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,980
It seems to be connected to the outside.

239
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,990
[Pudu Temple]

240
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,900
When I sent someone to look for Jingren,

241
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,230
he was already nowhere to be found.

242
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,150
Who'd have known he was so malicious?

243
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,030
If the Baichuan Court and the Pudu Temple work together,

244
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,610
we can definitely find that murderer.

245
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,750
I hope so.

246
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,700
Namaste.

247
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,400
Ms. Qiao.

248
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,080
Do you recognize this handwriting?

249
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,520
It's Rou's handwriting.

250
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,750
You're obsessed with that sword.

251
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,620
I feel guilty about Ms. Qiao

252
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,090
but don't want you to have regrets.

253
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,220
So I'll take it out to let you have a look at it

254
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,980
and then put it back

255
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,040
before anyone notices it's missing.

256
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,900
Looks like Miss Rou was betrayed by her lover.

257
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,280
She swapped the Shaoshi Sword

258
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,480
so that her lover could have a look at it,

259
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,170
but that man had another plan

260
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,340
and killed her for the sword.

261
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:32,880
Yeah.

262
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,090
Rou was so foolish

263
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,960
and died for nothing.

264
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,090
Mr. Xiao, Mr. Fang,

265
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,180
can you lead my disciples back into the tunnel

266
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,340
to bring that girl's body up?

267
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:49,940
No problem.

268
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,340
Ms. Qiao, why don't you come with me to my room

269
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,930
and have some tea while waiting for them?

270
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,490
Mr. Li, come and join us.

271
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,069
Please.

272
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,390
So you've known each other for a long time.

273
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,310
Yes.

274
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:23,859
It doesn't matter when people meet.

275
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,810
Fate will bring them together eventually.

276
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,310
But it's a pity that when old friends meet,

277
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,839
they can't recognize each other.

278
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,990
What does that mean?

279
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,650
Have we met before, Mr. Li?

280
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,060
No.

281
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,530
Bhante Wuliao

282
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,140
is used to preaching

283
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,350
and loves to give lectures on life.

284
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,040
But personally,

285
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:55,000
I don't believe in any constant laws.

286
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,420
They're all just personal choices.

287
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,290
Everything is written in the stars

288
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:01,220
and we just need to go with the flow.

289
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,250
We reap what we sow,

290
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,900
so what's the point of escaping the inescapable?

291
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,620
Mr. Li, I bet you have a lot to say

292
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,230
to Ms. Qiao.

293
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,650
So stop wasting your time on me.

294
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,140
I'll mind my own business

295
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,890
and go explain sutras in the sutra hall.

296
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,060
You guys talk.

297
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,800
What do you want to say to me, Mr. Li?

298
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,770
Here's the thing.

299
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,260
When I was young,

300
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:40,110
I stayed in this temple for a while

301
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,070
and met a young monk

302
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,050
named Huiyuan.

303
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:46,710
Later I learned that he joined the Jinyuan Alliance

304
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,050
and changed his name to Shi Hun.

305
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,040
Shi Hun?

306
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,230
I've heard of that name.

307
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,630
I'll look into it for you.

308
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,080
Thank you, Ms. Qiao.

309
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,710
I'll refill the teapot.

310
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,420
No way.

311
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:44,950
Ms. Qiao.

312
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,590
Ms. Qiao?

313
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,520
Ms. Qiao, are you okay?

314
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,310
They may have come out.

315
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,960
I'll go ask about the person you mentioned.

316
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,350
I'll tell you if I find anything.

317
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,850
Since when have you become so withdrawn?

318
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,370
Why didn't you tell her who you are?

319
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,650
Do you think

320
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,600
you're not as good as your old self?

321
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:32,990
Director Di,

322
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,300
since when have you

323
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,820
become so nosy?

324
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:37,730
It's just interesting

325
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,120
to see you pining over a woman.

326
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,790
Don't let your love affair

327
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,840
hinder our plan.

328
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,000
Director Di,

329
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,680
I'm not interested in other people's affairs.

330
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,540
We'll leave once we know the whereabouts of Shi Hun.

331
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,510
[Pudu Temple]

332
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,550
Li Lianhua.

333
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,750
How's it going?

334
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,010
Have Mr. Xiao and Ms. Qiao gone back to the Baichuan Court?

335
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:58,900
Everything is done.

336
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,690
But Ms. Qiao said she saw someone outside the window

337
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:01,750
and went after him.

338
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,940
When we came out,

339
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,130
both she and that guy were gone.

340
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,510
We're looking for her now.

341
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:05,860
OK.

342
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,740
Let's split up.

343
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:10,230
Li Lianhua.

344
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,220
Li Lianhua

345
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,160
cares so much about Ms. Qiao.

346
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,070
I'm afraid his feelings will never be reciprocated.

347

[Wei Manor's Yipin Tomb]

348
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,500
[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

349
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:48,980
Miss Shi Shui.

350
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,340
Yang Yunchun,

351
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,010
what are you doing here?

352
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:54,940
You're sneaky.

353
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,880
Miss Shi Shui, don't get me wrong.

354
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,410
I came to attend the Sword-Appreciation Ceremony

355
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,870
but got delayed on the way.

356
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,290
When I got here, I heard that the Shaoshi Sword was stolen.

357
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:06,220
Are you here to poke fun at us on behalf of the Supervision Bureau?

358
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:06,780
No.

359
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,200
Don't get me wrong.

360
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,340
We're not looking for the sword now.

361
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,910
We're looking for a person.

362
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,910
Miss Shi Shui.

363
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:14,960
Miss Shi Shui.

364
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,090
Are you looking for someone?

365
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,680
You know where she is.

366
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,610
I saw her going after a monk

367
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,220
and getting dragged away.

368
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,460
He seemed to be the fake monk

369
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,660
who stole the sword and killed the maid.

370
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,550
You stood by and watched.

371
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,500
Where was she taken?

372
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,170
I can see the murderous intent in your eyes.

373
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,360
I'm so glad.

374
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,500
Li Xiangyi is still alive.

375
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,300
You'd better not joke with me.

376
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,240
Where is Qiao Wanmian?

377
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,080
Rou told you that incense powder

378
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,360
can trigger my asthma.

379
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,660
You used it against me.

380
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,490
She always tells you everything.

381
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,780
She forced me.

382
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,530
I told you.

383
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,790
It's not that I don't want to return the Shaoshi Sword.

384
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,150
I just want to keep it for a few more days.

385
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,420
Who in the martial arts world

386
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,750
wouldn't want the best sword in the world?

387
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,420
You killed Rou

388
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,120
and you're still defending yourself like a coward.

389
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:20,680
Enough!

390
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,480
You sealed the mountain pass

391
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,570
and trapped me here.

392
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,470
I could only kidnap you.

393
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,340
I'll chop off one of your hands and give it to them.

394
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,340
Ms. Qiao, are you okay?

395
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,700
Why are you here, Mr. Li?

396
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,840
Everyone split up to search for you.

397
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,300
It's just a coincidence.

398
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,860
I'm not good at martial arts,

399
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,540
so I had to launch a sneak attack.

400
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,470
Let me untie you.

401
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,960
You're risking your life to save me.

402
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:11,970
I will remember

403
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,510
your kindness.

404
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,010
You're welcome.

405
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,330
This person is really shameless.

406
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,620
What treasure is this?

407
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,490
I'm not allowed to look at it?

408
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:37,090
A bangle.

409
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:41,210
This Green Phoenix Bangle is the Xiao family's heirloom.

410
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,620
It forms a pair with the Jade Flower Carvings

411
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,620
on my Pojun Sword.

412
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,770
So it's for your future wife.

413
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:48,290
What?

414
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:49,580
You have a crush?

415
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,470
I hit it on something just now.

416
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,840
I was afraid it might be damaged.

417
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,990
Luckily, it's fine.

418
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,230
Ms. Qiao.

419
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:02,630
It seems that you value this jade bangle very much.

420
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,930
Let's get out of here.

421
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,780
Be careful.

422
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:16,820
Xiangyi is gone.

423
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,880
The Sigu Sect has suffered great losses.

424
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,210
Why don't we dissolve the Sigu Sect today?

425
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,970
You want to dissolve Sigu Sect?

426
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,550
The two leaders are gone.

427
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,810
Our morale is gone too.

428
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,470
Why should we force ourselves to carry on?

429
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,860
Hang in there.

430
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,540
What's wrong?

431
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:50,900
I feel like Xiangyi came back.

432
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:54,540
I regret it.

433
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:00,170
I shouldn't have written that letter to him.

434
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,500
You wrote to him a month ago?

435
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,480
He's a proud person.

436
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,430
But I said I would leave him.

437
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,110
But I was too tired.

438
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,780
I was so tired of chasing him.

439
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:23,110
[To Minister Yi]

440
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:38,180
I have enjoyed your love, protection,

441
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,230
and company for the past few years.

442
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,470
I will remember this forever.

443
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,900
I know you are generous.

444
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,020
It causes me admiration, pride,

445
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,320
but also fear.

446
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,260
You love the hubbub of the martial arts world.

447
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,430
You strive towards the pinnacle of the martial world.

448
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,780
I can only follow closely behind you,

449
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,450
exhausted.

450
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,620
You are as bright as the sun,

451
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,650
and as dazzling.

452
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,040
However,

453
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,860
who can look into the sun forever?

454
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,780
I'm tired.

455
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,540
I respect you,

456
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,140
but am unable to accompany you any further.

457
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,800
I can't love you like I used to.

458
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,780
I'll say goodbye to you with this letter.

459
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,020
May you

460
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,700
live healthy,

461
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,350
and carefree,

462
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,340
and fulfill your life's wishes.

463
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,000
Yours, Wan.

464
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,970
Li Xiangyi.

465
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:50,020
You only think that everyone relies on you and respects you.

466
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,550
But you don't know

467
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,300
you've become a burden to others.

468
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,380
I'm sorry, Wan.

469
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:16,890
Ms. Qiao.

470
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,490
I think the intersection between Pudu Temple and Baichuan Court

471
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:20,460
is too far away.

472
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,860
Let's hurry up.

473
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:22,380
Okay.

474
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,470
Watch the steps.

475
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,740
Ms. Qiao,

476
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,200
I heard from Mr. Xiao that you have asthma.

477
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,280
Why don't you sit down and rest?

478
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:38,850
Okay.

479
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:40,740
Slowly.

480
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:49,430
Wan.

481
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,420
How are you?

482
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,760
Xiangyi.

483
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,160
Xiangyi, you're here.

484
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:27,080
Are you willing to talk to me today?

485
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,370
You're still unwilling?

486
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,780
I know

487
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:42,880
you hate me.

488
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,300
Ms. Qiao,

489
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,700
don't think too much.

490
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,920
Let me send you home first.

491
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,460
No, I don't want to go.

492
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,660
I don't want to go back.

493
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:03,220
Xiangyi.

494
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,310
Don't go!

495
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,740
Xiangyi.

496
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,070
Do you remember this place?

497
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,220
At that time,

498
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,310
you didn’t say anything

499
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,730
and went to duel with that master.

500
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,030
I was worried and angry.

501
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,970
I told you not to show up in front of me again.

502
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:32,180
So I dug this tunnel to see you.

503
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:36,030
At that time, I wanted to make you happy.

504
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:40,810
But you always resented me for not understanding you.

505
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,010
And I

506
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,700
only had Sigu Sect on my mind.

507
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,750
I neglected your feelings.

508
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,090
You...

509
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,740
Why did you realize this so late?

510
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,240
It's too late, Xiangyi.

511
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,560
I can't find you.

512
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,840
I can't find you.

513
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,920
I can't wait for you either.

514
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,370
What should I do?

515
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,740
What should I do?

516
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,410
Wan.

517
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:37,680
Forget it.

518
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,260
Live the happy life you deserve.

519
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:48,470
Zijin always tells me the same thing.

520
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,220
But if I wait for you,

521
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:55,340
there'll be one more person in this world that believes you're still alive.

522
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,060
Maybe...

523
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,900
Maybe then you can come back alive.

524
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,530
I've let you down.

525
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:13,250
I... I've also let down Zijin's genuine feelings.

526
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,530
I've let him down.

527
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,220
Did you find anything?

528
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:40,980
I've searched everywhere.

529
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,980
There's nothing.

530
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,310
Mian must have been caught by that scoundrel.

531
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,510
He might have gone down the mountain.

532
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,820
I'll go down the mountain now.

533
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,930
Inform the people of Baichuan Court

534
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:48,750
to go after them too.

535
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,150
OK.

536
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,150
Fei?

537
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:54,960
Why are you here?

538
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:56,570
Let me ask you.

539
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,830
Did you see Ms. Qiao?

540
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,740
What does it have to do with me?

541
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,220
Wait.

542
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,080
Ms. Qiao has nothing to do with you.

543
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,340
Did you see Li Lianhua?

544
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,190
He said he was looking for someone, but he's gone too.

545
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,450
Did something happen?

546
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,810
You two are old friends.

547
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,460
You should care about where he went.

548
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,120
He told you we're old friends?

549
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,960
Interesting.

550
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:17,970
Make yourself clear!

551
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,270
Weird.

552
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,860
Xiangyi.

553
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,030
Xiangyi.

554
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:50,670
Xiangyi.

555
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:57,470
Ms. Qiao.

556
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,120
Ms. Qiao.

557
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,010
Are you okay?

558
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:16,130
You were crying and talking in your sleep

559
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:18,090
when you had an attack.

560
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:20,080
I have

561
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,340
some medicine on me.

562
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:24,100
It can relieve your pain.

563
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,679
This sachet...

564
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:39,070
Why do you have it?

565
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:40,780
You...

566
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:46,530
I accidentally found this sachet on the beach

567
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,060
when I was practising medicine at the East Sea.

568
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,320
Do you recognize this?

569
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:58,100
Is this the only sachet you found?

570
00:35:01,659 --> 00:35:04,920
Many people were dead in the sea.

571
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:06,820
This sachet

572
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:09,020
was found

573
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,220
on one of the corpses.

574
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,190
What's wrong, Ms. Qiao?

575
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,450
What did he look like?

576
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:22,560
What did the person you saw look like?

577
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,530
I remember it very clearly.

578
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,540
But I remember

579
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,260
he was around 20 years old.

580
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,520
I couldn't see his face clearly.

581
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:43,770
There seemed to be a string of Buddha beads on his left wrist.

582
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,490
I got those for him.

583
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,140
It turns out he's your friend.

584
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:06,700
At that time,

585
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:09,190
I had to turn back and ask for help.

586
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,820
To my surprise,

587
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,100
when I came back,

588
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,550
he had already been carried away by the waves.

589
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,980
Now that I think about it,

590
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,060
I'm regretful.

591
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,180
Stop it.

592
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,130
When did you

593
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,340
find him?

594
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,140
Come to think of it,

595
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,060
it's been about ten years.

596
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,730
I'm sorry, Mian.

597
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,820
I always hurt you.

598
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,270
I can't make it up to you.

599
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,060
Zijin loves you wholeheartedly.

600
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,860
I can see that you also love him.

601
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:23,850
Don't make it hard for yourself.

602
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:27,120
You must be happy in the future.

603
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:29,520
Ms. Qiao.

604
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,090
Let me send you back first.

605
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,190
Stop!

606
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:37,940
Don't touch her!

607
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,930
What does Mr. Xiao want?

608
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,700
He's trying to harm Mian.

609
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,560
He deserves it.

610
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,380
If anything happens to Mian,

611
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,390
I'll kill him.

612
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:50,130
You're hurting people without getting the facts straight.

613
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:51,440
You're from Sigu Sect?

614
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,900
Sigu Sect was dissolved ten years ago.

615
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,430
What are you talking about?

616
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:57,150
I want to take this scoundrel with me.

617
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,080
Mr. Xiao, you're too domineering.

618
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:00,820
Baichuan Court gives Tianji Hall

619
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,570
leeway.

620
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:04,030
If you dare to bully my friend,

621
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,420
don't blame me for turning nasty.

622
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,300
Mr. Xiao, don't get me wrong.

623
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,350
I just ran into Ms. Qiao

624
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,330
when she was kidnapped in the tunnel,

625
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:15,460
so I followed her in.

626
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,860
How dare you make up stories about saving a damsel in distress?

627
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,620
How dare you!

628
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,140
Zijin, stop!

629
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,080
I won't argue with you.

630
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,680
I'll take her back.

631
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,260
Come here.

632
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,770
What's wrong with Xiao Zijin?

633
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:44,110
The young master of Tianji Hall is really powerful.

634
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,270
But now that you've gotten on a master's bad side,

635
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,860
how can you enter Baichuan Court?

636
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,980
I just can't stand him relying on his position

637
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,100
to bully others.

638
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,290
I don't care.

639
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,170
How are you?

640
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,970
I'm fine.

641
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:07,790
Brother.

642
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:09,990
How is Ms. Qiao?

643
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,820
She had an asthma attack.

644
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,780
Luckily, she took Physician Li's medicine.

645
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,640
She's fine now.

646
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,100
Didn't Ms. Qiao say anything else?

647
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,580
Why did Physician Li rush to save her?

648
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,620
Didn't she think

649
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,420
Physician Li seemed familiar?

650
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:25,920
Biqiu.

651
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,010
What do you want to ask?

652
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,450
Don't you think

653
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:36,090
Li Lianhua looks a little like

654
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:37,840
Sect Leader?

655
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,360
To heal someone from Bicha Poison,

656
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,820
besides taking the unique antidote in time,

657
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,110
the other way is Wuliao's Brahman golden needles.

658
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,240
Over the years,

659
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,770
there have been many swindlers pretending to be Sect Leader.

660
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:52,980
If Wuliao healed him

661
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:53,990
through the Brahman arts,

662
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,490
why didn't he tell us?

663
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,680
Yes, Biqiu.

664
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:58,680
I think

665
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,130
his age, physique, and martial arts skills

666
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:03,050
don't match Sect Leader's.

667
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:05,050
They only have similar eyes and eyebrows.

668
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,380
But on closer look, they don't look alike.

669
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,790
Brother, I think

670
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,500
I should sound him out again.

671
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,720
It's all because of me

672
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,240
that Sect Leader...

673
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,020
Yun Biqiu, how dare you bring it up?

674
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:22,630
Bicha poison is so vicious.

675
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,400
It not only disperses people's martial power,

676
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,980
but also cause brain problems and drive them to death by madness.

677
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:27,870
You know that,

678
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,450
but you still poisoned Sect Leader.

679
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,510
You deserve to die hundreds of times for what you did.

680
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,360
All right.

681
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,000
Let bygones be bygones.

682
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,150
Only the four of us know about

683
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:38,890
Sect Leader being poisoned by Bicha Poison.

684
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:39,820
Don't spread it.

685
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,160
He didn't mean to hurt Sect Leader.

686
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,920
He was just bewitched by that demoness.

687
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,850
Every time he has seen someone who looks like Sect Leader

688
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:00,560
over the past few years,

689
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:02,350
he would check him out.

690
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:03,900
I will never forgive

691
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,100
what he did back then.

692
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:08,550
This...

693
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:12,730
[General Temple]

694
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,100
Physician Li.

695
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,780
It's the Masters.

696
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,320
Don't get up, you're infirm.

697
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,030
I'm embarrassed.

698
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,990
Thanks to Physician Li,

699
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,060
we were able to find Shaoshi yesterday.

700
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,770
I brought it here today

701
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,620
so you can take a look for yourself.

702
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,230
Please go ahead.

703
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:50,950
You are really good at joking.

704
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,170
I don't deserve this sword.

705
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,640
You're exaggerating.

706
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,580
Try it.

707
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,580
It's okay.

708
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,950
I'll give it a try.

709
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,940
I'm embarrassed.

710
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:47,630
I can't pull out this sword.

711
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:50,490
I think it's a great honor

712
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:52,990
just to be able to touch the sword.

713
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,340
Please keep it safely.

714
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,770
It's very heavy.

715
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:03,100
We were inconsiderate.

716
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:05,050
Physician Li is infirm.

717
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,330
You can't wield this sword.

718
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:09,010
Good sword.

719
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:12,470
Physician Li,

720
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,900
I have a small question.

721
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:20,560
Why don't you show your face?
