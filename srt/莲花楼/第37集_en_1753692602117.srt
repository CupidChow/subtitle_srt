00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Kissing

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
After four thousand times

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Thousands of times

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The most reluctant moment

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Is that moment

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Live in the world

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A thousand miles of madness

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who doesn't wander

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Who doesn't know

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The faraway sky is separated from the earth

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
On the moon

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Live in the world

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Youthful love

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
A thousand times

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The most reluctant moment

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Is that moment

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Live in the world

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
A thousand miles of madness

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Who doesn't wander

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Who doesn't know

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The faraway sky is separated from the earth

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
On the moon

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Live in the world

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Youthful love

00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The most reluctant moment

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Is that moment

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Is that moment

Live in the world

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
A thousand miles of madness

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Who doesn't wander

The faraway sky is separated from the earth

00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
On the moon

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Live in the world

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
A thousand times

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The most reluctant moment

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Is that moment

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Live in the world

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
A thousand miles of madness

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Who doesn't wander

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Who doesn't know

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The faraway sky is separated from the earth

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
On the moon

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Live in the world

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I can't take this breath

58
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The answer to the question

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Must be in this Jile Tower

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Gu, Gu, Gu Shi

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Why do you have to go into the palace at midnight

62
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The murder case that happened the other day

63
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's not safe at night

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I chose to go to the night

65
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
To choose the night

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Because when Yue Hua was the most famous

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The direction of the wind and water is also most obvious

68
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Why did you change a new person today

69
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
This public ministry is not good at killing people

70
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We lack people

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So I found a man of the ten thousand saints

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
To help

73
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
This matter has been delayed for too long

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It should be speeded up

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'll let them check this place right away

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Come on, everyone

77
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Empress Dowager's oral edict

78
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Please Wang Gonggong

79
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Take the state teacher and all the generals

80
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Immediately go to Minglan Garden

81
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Everyone

82
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yes

83
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
This fake Empress Dowager's oral edict

84
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Fang Xiaobao, you owe the princess a favor

85
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This matter is important

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I hope I can talk to them for a while

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Let's find it quickly

88
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Go over there

89
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
This way

90
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Strange

91
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I've been looking for it so many times

92
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It doesn't look like it's a tower

93
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Did we find the wrong direction

94
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Or

95
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What kind of cover-up is this

96
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We didn't find

97
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm sorry

98
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Li Lianhua

99
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What are you waiting for

100
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
If you can't find it, Mohsen will come back

101
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This should be around here

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
This Jile Tower is a tower

103
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Why is the entrance a prison

104
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Maybe this tower is gone

105
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But the treasure is still there

106
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So they went in

107
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Is the secret room in the well

108
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Think about it

109
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Li Fei

110
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
They went into this Jile Tower before

111
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That means

112
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
If you go through this well

113
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You can find this tower

114
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Zhao Chi

115
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The action before death

116
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Is it

117
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What kind of clue is hinting

118
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You mean

119
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's a Jile Tower as soon as you enter

120
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
How is that possible

121
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Is this Jile Tower

122
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Becoming a prison

123
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I thought

124
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Jile Tower

125
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Is a well

126
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Look

127
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Please

128
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Tower

129
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Zhao Chi

130
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
When he died

131
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Actually hinting

132
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The tower is a well

133
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Such a design is really too mysterious

134
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I know

135
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Tieshan Gang

136
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You know

137
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
There is a blood mountain

138
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Tieshan Gang

139
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The Jile tower is high

140
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The Jile tower suddenly turned

141
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The Jile tower fell

142
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
In the middle of the Qingdao

143
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
A small hole

144
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Can be made

145
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
There are heavy jails

146
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The tower is connected

147
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The night it disappeared

148
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Someone turned the Jile tower

149
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The Jile tower fell

150
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The Jiluan ground was covered

151
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The tower fell

152
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The night it disappeared

153
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The well must be well hidden

154
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Liu Ke'e didn't have to

155
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Fill the well more than ten years ago

156
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It must be a blood mountain

157
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
After the drunk

158
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
He found the entrance

159
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
This is to see a drunk

160
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Where will the pass be

161
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
To find the entrance

162
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Drunk

163
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Guihua

164
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
If you are enjoying the moon or taking a break

165
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Shouldn't there be a pavilion

166
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Wait

167
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
This is what Eunuch Wu wrote

168
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
He was at

169
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
By the mountain of Guangqing

170
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Such a busy person

171
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
There is still time and effort

172
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Enjoy the moon and write poetry

173
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Don't you think it's suspicious

174
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Unless his poem has a purpose

175
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The snow falls on the corner of the cold cloud

176
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Three minutes of the flower bed

177
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
There is no place in this palace

178
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Where there is no cold cloud

179
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Maybe it's the name of the pavilion

180
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And this one

181
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Flying snow draws the rain

182
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Snow in the palace

183
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The temperature of the bookmark should be very high

184
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Is it

185
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
A hot spring pool

186
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The iron mountain

187
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Need to be softened

188
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Naturally, it is more suitable to have water

189
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Liu Kehe's poem

190
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
July 8

191
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The cold cloud stops

192
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The sky flows late

193
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The mountain is closed

194
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
This is it

195
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The base of the two days is still there

196
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This mess is worth hundreds of jin

197
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Fang Xiaobao, can you

198
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You are good

199
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Look at me

200
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You are good

201
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Look at me

202
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You are good

203
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You are good

204
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You are good

205
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You are good

206
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You are good

207
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You are good

208
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You are good

209
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You are good

210
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You are good

211
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You are good

212
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You are good

213
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You are good

214
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You are good

215
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You are good

216
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You are good

217
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You are good

218
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You are good

219
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You are good

220
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You are good

221
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You are good

222
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You are good

223
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You are good

224
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You are good

225
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You are good

226
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You are good

227
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So many treasures.

228
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,560
This must be the main hall of the Jile Tower.

229
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,240
It was hard for Xue Kuan and the others to find this place.

230
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
Those who insulted us back then

231
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,180
have seen these

232
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,720
in the Jile Tower.

233
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,240
Maybe someone took these

234
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,120
and ran away with the gold and silver treasure.

235
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,120
Liu Ke He, who has been guarding the area,

236
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,120
found them humiliated.

237
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,120
He sent a group of bandits to kill Xue Kuan.

238
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,120
They were scared to death.

239
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,120
Then Liu Ke He

240
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,120
hung a fake Qin Zhong

241
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,120
on the Bai Yu Tree.

242
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,120
He scared them to death.

243
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,120
Liu Ke He tried so hard

244
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,120
to guard the treasure here.

245
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,120
If this tower was that simple,

246
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,120
the people who sealed this tower

247
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,120
should have taken

248
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,120
these gold and silver treasures.

249
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,120
Forget it.

250
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,120
Let's find Ye Huo Teng.

251
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,120
It's important.

252
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,120
Liu Ke He,

253
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,120
you're here.

254
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,120
I'm here.

255
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,120
I'm here.

256
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,120
Go to the back.

257
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,120
Okay.

258
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,120
Okay.

259
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,120
Go!

260
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,120
Go!

261
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,120
Go!

262
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,120
Go!

263
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,120
Go!

264
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,120
Go!

265
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,120
Go!

266
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,120
Go!

267
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,120
Go!

268
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,120
Go!

269
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,120
Go!

270
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,120
It's not the same one.

271
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,120
The shape is exactly the same.

272
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,120
This tomb

273
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,120
should be sealed here

274
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,120
with the Qi Le Pagoda a hundred years ago.

275
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,120
Look.

276
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,120
This place is broken.

277
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,120
But is Mu De in there?

278
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,120
Look at this male corpse.

279
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,120
Is there a hole in the heart?

280
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,120
It's true.

281
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,120
Why is that?

282
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
The night fire is painful.

283
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,120
The blood is thin and soft.

284
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,120
Especially the human's head.

285
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
Think about it.

286
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,120
This tomb is full of blood.

287
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,120
So after the mother-of-pearl wakes up,

288
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,120
the flesh will be blood.

289
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,120
So the mother-of-pearl

290
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,120
is in the human's head.

291
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,120
The sword is broken.

292
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,120
Thank you for your help.

293
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,120
I took the mother-of-pearl.

294
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,120
You can live in the Qi Le Pagoda

295
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,120
and have a good life.

296
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,120
Oh, no.

297
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,120
The mother-of-pearl was robbed.

298
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,120
Wait.

299
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,120
It's in the tomb.

300
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,120
I was wrong to

301
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,120
take a look outside the door.

302
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,120
So I kept saying half of it.

303
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,120
The mother-of-pearl came out.

304
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,120
It's been decades since the male corpse was taken.

305
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,120
After there is no more evidence,

306
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,120
the mother-of-pearl will be burned to death.

307
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,120
The mother-of-pearl is his enemy.

308
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,120
Open it.

309
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,120
Open it.

310
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,120
It's still in there.

311
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,120
We can't hide it for long.

312
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,120
The mountain valley knife should be back to Zhang Muteng soon.

313
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
Li Xie Lian Hua.

314
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,120
It should be a hard battle later.

315
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,120
You'd better hide.

316
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,120
Hard battle is so stupid.

317
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,120
Now the thing is in our hands.

318
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,120
The most important thing now is to find a chance to escape.

319
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,120
There are so many mechanisms in the tomb that are useless.

320
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,120
It's more suitable to use them.

321
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,120
You're so stupid.

322
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,120
I found it.

323
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,120
You found it?

324
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,120
Why is there nothing?

325
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,120
Li Lian Hua is playing tricks on us.

326
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,120
Li Xiang Yi.

327
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,120
Even if you swallow the mother-of-pearl this time,

328
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,120
I'll cut your belly and fight with you.

329
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,120
Li Lian Hua.

330
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,120
When I was setting up the mechanism,

331
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,120
I found a secret passage to the top.

332
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,120
We can go now.

333
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,120
What are you looking at?

334
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,120
Did you hear me?

335
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,120
I know why the stone tower disappeared overnight.

336
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,120
Why?

337
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,120
The words and murals carved on the wall

338
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,120
are to cover a huge secret.

339
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,120
The biggest secret in the tower is not these treasures.

340
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,120
It's the man in the bed.

341
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,120
These bodies are the men and women who have been dead for a long time.

342
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,120
Feng A'luo.

343
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,120
Feng A'luo who knows how to make the night fire?

344
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,120
How did the night fire come about?

345
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,120
A hundred years ago, the light was clear and the west was empty.

346
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,120
To see the great cloud, he changed the water to seek the sun.

347
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,120
Feng A'luo took the new soil and wood

348
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,120
and moved the palace to the palace.

349
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,120
He wanted to use the pebbles on the top of the tower

350
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,120
to cover the sky and clear the sky.

351
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,120
But he was supposed to go to the palace to assassinate her.

352
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,120
But he met the Yin Fei at that time

353
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,120
and made a clear decision for her great appearance.

354
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,120
He thought he was the god's son-in-law.

355
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,120
For the sake of Yin Fei,

356
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,120
he forgot his mission

357
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,120
and was afraid to be a hidden man.

358
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,120
What he expected every day was to see the Yin Fei.

359
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,120
The tree was hidden in the chicken coop

360
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,120
and often died with the Yin Fei.

361
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,120
Not long after, the Yin Fei finally had a child.

362
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,120
The tree thought that after Yin Fei gave birth

363
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,120
he would take the child away with him.

364
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,120
Yin Fei had a baby in October.

365
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,120
The tree followed the October plan.

366
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,120
But when Yin Fei gave birth to the child,

367
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,120
the tree fell on the top of the tower

368
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,120
and disappeared.

369
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,120
The whole tower was the tomb of Yin Fei.

370
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,120
The Emperor Guangxin couldn't give birth to a child.

371
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,120
Yin Fei wanted to have a child

372
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,120
and planned the whole thing.

373
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,120
The only thing he had to do was to wait for him to be the emperor

374
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,120
and take control of the stone circle.

375
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,120
He then deleted all the records of the Jile Tower.

376
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,120
The Feng'an Long Book Master was buried under the ground

377
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,120
with the Jile Tower.

378
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,120
So he was full of anger and drew these.

379
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,120
He waited here for the last time.

380
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,120
But if the son of Emperor Guangxin

381
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,120
was the son of the Nanying Book Master,

382
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,120
then...

383
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,120
After the Great Xi took over the Emperor,

384
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,120
the royal family had lost all their blood.

385
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,120
The Emperor is here.

386
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,120
If this news comes out,

387
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,120
the world will be in chaos.

388
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,120
So this Jile Tower

389
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,120
must be a secret forever.

390
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,120
No wonder Liu Kehe

391
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,120
would rather kill himself

392
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,120
than let anyone know about the secret.

393
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,120
Yin Fei and Liu Jiajie were born and died

394
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,120
and kept the Liu family as their officials.

395
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,120
So they made this Jile Tower.

396
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,120
There are not only iron walls and a secret room.

397
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,120
The design was designed

398
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,120
to keep this secret forever.

399
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,120
The secret room you just mentioned

400
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,120
is the secret room of Feng'alu and Yin Fei's private meeting,

401
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,120
right?

402
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,120
No.

403
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,120
They are coming.

404
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,120
Follow me.

405
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,120
Go.

406
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,120
Don't let them get away.

407
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,120
Lin Xiangyi.

408
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,120
It's okay.

409
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,120
They can't get away.

410
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,120
This secret passage

411
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,120
should lead to

412
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,120
the inner palace.

413
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,120
Searching in the palace yard

414
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,120
is a big task.

415
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,120
I can't do it yet.

416
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,120
I can only rely on you.

417
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,120
What's going on?

418
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,120
I'm afraid that we have reported to the Imperial Court

419
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,120
and they are coming to poison us.

420
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,120
That's right.

421
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,120
You are right.

422
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,120
His Majesty is here.

423
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,120
Greetings, Your Majesty.

424
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,120
Your Majesty, be careful.

425
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,120
Your Majesty, please be careful.

426
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,120
Your Majesty, please be careful.

427
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,120
Your Majesty, please be careful.

428
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,120
Your Majesty, please be careful.

429
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,120
Your Majesty, please be careful.

430
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,120
Your Majesty, be careful.

431
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,120
The top in his hand

432
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,120
is used to poison.

433
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,120
I will take it down.

434
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,120
You don't have to bother.

435
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,120
The political affairs

436
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,120
should be kept by the Imperial City.

437
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,120
Your Majesty.

438
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,120
Li Lianhua, Fang Duobian.

439
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,120
The State Preceptor said that

440
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,120
you were digging a secret passage in the inner palace

441
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,120
and wanted to rebel.

442
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,120
I still don't believe it.

443
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,120
It turned out to be true.

444
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,120
Your Majesty,

445
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,120
we didn't dig this secret passage.

446
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,120
We didn't want to rebel.

447
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,120
Then tell me.

448
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,120
Instead of investigating the previous murder case,

449
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,120
you are digging a secret passage in the inner palace.

450
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,120
What do you want?

451
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,120
Your Majesty,

452
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,120
I saw the entrance of this secret passage.

453
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,120
It must have been a long time.

454
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,120
I don't think they dug it.

455
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,120
Maybe there is some misunderstanding in it.

456
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,120
There has been a long time

457
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,120
since the passage was dug.

458
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,120
Where is the passage?

459
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,120
You are so clumsy.

460
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,120
Can't you say it?

461
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,120
It's a long way.

462
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,120
We are going to the Jile Tower.

463
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,120
There is really a Jile Tower?

464
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,120
Fang Duobian,

465
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,120
you are the son of Fang Zhe.

466
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,120
You have been walking in the palace since you were a child.

467
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,120
Do you know what kind of crime it is to cheat the Emperor?

468
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,120
Tell me.

469
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,120
Is there really a Jile Tower?

470
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,120
Yes.

471
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,120
What is in the Jile Tower?

472
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,120
There are many treasures.

473
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,120
You don't take them?

474
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,120
We are not thieves.

475
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,120
Then you take the strange top.

476
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,120
Tell me.

477
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,120
What is the origin of this strange top?

478
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,120
Let's put them here for now.

479
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,120
Xu Yanxiao,

480
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,120
you and I go in and have a look.

481
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,120
If there is really a Jile Tower,

482
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,120
I can believe what they say.

483
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,120
If not,

484
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,120
don't blame me for being ruthless.

485
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,120
Your Majesty,

486
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,120
we can't enter the Jile Tower.

487
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,120
Move aside.

488
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,120
Your Majesty.

489
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,120
At this time,

490
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,120
why don't you tell His Majesty about the Night Fire?

491
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,120
If I tell him about the Night Fire,

492
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,120
I have to tell him about the Jile Tower a hundred years ago.

493
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,120
I can't tell him.

494
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,120
Even if you don't tell him,

495
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,120
His Majesty will see it himself.

496
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,120
Go.

497
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,120
Your Majesty,

498
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,120
bad news.

499
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,120
Empress Dowager went out of the palace to burn incense and pay her debt.

500
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,120
She was kidnapped.

501
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,120
Chen Shizhi,

502
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,120
go to fetch Empress Dowager.

503
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,120
Go.

504
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,120
Is it you?

505
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,120
At this time,

506
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,120
we can't just run away.

507
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,120
The secret passage and the Jile Tower

508
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,120
are all fake.

509
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,120
It's all your trick.

510
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,120
Take them down.

511
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,120
Get ready.

512
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,120
Stop.

513
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,120
Chase.

514
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,120
Go.

515
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,120
We three brothers came to the Central Plains

516
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,120
and we have no opponent.

517
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,120
Today,

518
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,120
we will fight with the best in the country

519
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,120
to get the old man.

520
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,120
Go.

521
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,120
I'm late to save the emperor.

522
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,120
Please forgive me.

523
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,120
You really have a plan to rebel.

524
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,120
It's not too late to know now.

525
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,120
Lord Xuan Yuan,

526
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,120
this move is a little heavy.

527
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,120
It's rude.

528
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,120
Wipe your eyes and take a good look.

529
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,120
Not everyone has such a fortune

530
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,120
to see such a holy thing.

531
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,120
This is the best.

532
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,120
It's just a few lives.

533
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,120
I almost lost my mind.

534
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,120
This world

535
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,120
is full of evil.

536
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,120
I'm afraid that

537
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,120
the evil will come to me.

538
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,120
I'm afraid that

539
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,120
the evil will come to me.

540
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,120
I'm afraid that

541
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,120
the evil will come to me.

542
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,120
I'm afraid that

543
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,120
the evil will come to me.

544
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,120
In the end, it belongs to me.

545
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,120
In the end, it belongs to me.

546
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,120
Fang Debing.

547
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,120
Princess.

548
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,120
I have a way to take you out.

549
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,120
Go.

550
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
Go.

551
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,120
What's wrong with father?

552
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
Why are you so angry?

553
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,120
His Majesty has his own reason.

554
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,120
Don't ask more.

555
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,120
Are those thieves

556
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,120
stealing things to make you

557
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,120
misunderstand?

558
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,120
No.

559
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,120
I'll catch them when I get back.

560
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,120
I'll clear your name.

561
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,120
Princess, you can't.

562
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,120
Those people will

563
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,120
be a magic trick.

564
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,120
Don't see anyone after you go back to the palace.

565
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,120
It's best to pretend to be sick.

566
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,120
We'll get rid of them when we get back.

567
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,120
It's tiring to pretend to be sick.

568
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,120
Okay.

569
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,120
Since you've said yes,

570
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,120
you have to come back soon.

571
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,120
Princess, please take care of yourself.

572
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,120
You too.

573
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,120
After you wash and brush your face,

574
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,120
will you come back to me?

575
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,120
You said it yourself.

576
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,120
Don't disappear like last time.

577
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,120
Okay.

578
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,120
I'm leaving.

579
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,120
It's not going well.

580
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,120
The ancient knife was used to kill people.

581
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,120
I guess the Night Fire Tent

582
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,120
is in his hands.

583
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,120
Now,

584
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,120
he can't stop.

585
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,120
What should we do now?

586
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,120
We'll split up.

587
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,120
Your father is in the capital's

588
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,120
house of defense.

589
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,120
He might be in danger.

590
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,120
You should go back to the capital

591
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,120
and save Zhe Qiu.

592
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,120
If you're late,

593
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,120
you can't act rashly.

594
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,120
I'll go with you.

595
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,120
I'll go with you.

596
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,120
Otherwise,

597
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,120
you'll be in more trouble.

598
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,120
Will I be caught

599
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,120
by my father?

600
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,120
If so,

601
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,120
you should go to Tianqi Villa

602
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,120
and ask your mother for help.

603
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,120
You have many friends

604
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,120
in the court.

605
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,120
You can keep him safe.

606
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,120
Anyway,

607
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,120
you should go.

608
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,120
What about you?

609
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,120
Now, the ancient knife

610
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,120
is used to kill people.

611
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,120
So I need to find

612
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,120
a way to stop the Night Fire Tent.

613
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,120
By the way,

614
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,120
I just thought

615
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,120
I have an old friend

616
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,120
whom I haven't seen for years.

617
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,120
I need to meet him.

618
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,120
Okay.

619
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,120
We'll meet

620
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,120
in Lotus Road after the night.

621
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,120
Okay.

622
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,120
I should meet

623
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,120
the one I should meet.

624
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,120
Young Master,

625
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,120
don't go near the temple.

626
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,120
The people in the court are nearby.

627
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,120
Where's my mother?

628
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,120
Mother.

629
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,120
I made a mistake.

630
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,120
I hurt my father.

631
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,120
Bao, get up.

632
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,120
Come on.

633
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,120
Bao,

634
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,120
do you remember

635
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,120
the words on your room?

636
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,120
Heaven and Earth are righteous.

637
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,120
When you were three years old,

638
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,120
your father

639
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,120
gave you these words

640
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,120
because he was afraid

641
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,120
you would become

642
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,120
a man who could rule the world.

643
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,120
Now,

644
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,120
you're doing

645
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,120
the right thing.

646
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,120
What's wrong with that?

647
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,120
Father won't blame you.

648
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,120
But the Imperial Court

649
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,120
took away my father.

650
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,120
I don't know

651
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,120
what I should do to him.

652
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,120
Mother,

653
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,120
contact the officials

654
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,120
and the princes

655
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,120
to speak for my father.

656
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,120
I'll send some people

657
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,120
to guard outside the city.

658
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,120
If anything happens,

659
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,120
we can only

660
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,120
go to the prison.

661
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,120
If this happens,

662
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,120
your father

663
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,120
will have to

664
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,120
live a life

665
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,120
with the evil people

666
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,120
for the rest of his life.

667
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,120
You know

668
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,120
your father's personality.

669
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,120
Why don't you

670
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,120
kill him?

671
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,120
If I had to,

672
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,120
I wouldn't be

673
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,120
so reckless.

674
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,120
I can't let my brother

675
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,120
get into any trouble.

676
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:41,460
Does anything happen at Yangshuo field these days?

677
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:46,760
Since you are alone,

678
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,960
you can try on the ballet class.

679
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:52,840
Su Lian'nv,

680
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,520
Two Habit greets you.

681
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,560
Which Street will you watch?

682
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,000
I have lost my memory.

683
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,040
I think you should go there.

684
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:05,980
Go?

685
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,980
I'm sorry.

686
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,980
My hands are not stable recently.

687
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,980
I can't pour you tea.

688
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,980
I should be the one to apologize.

689
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,980
Don't mention the past.

690
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,980
I'm not talking about the past.

691
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:21,980
I'm apologizing now.

692
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,980
I'm sorry.

693
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,980
Li Linghua.

694
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,980
Sect Leader Xiao.

695
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,980
Sect Leader Xiao, please order immediately

696
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,980
to ask the four sects to work together

697
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,980
to find Li Linghua.

698
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,980
What's wrong with Li Linghua?

699
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,980
There's only a pool of blood in the lotus building.

700
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,980
Li Linghua is missing.

701
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,980
Young Hero Fang,

702
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,980
there are a few people who disappear every day in the martial arts world.

703
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,980
Why would a Li Linghua disappear

704
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,980
and the four sects have to search for her?

705
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:26,980
The four sects are doing great things,

706
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,980
not looking for Zhang San and Li Si.

707
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,980
Looking for Li Linghua is the most important thing.

708
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:31,980
I'm not looking for her.

709
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,980
I'm looking for her.

710
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,980
It's different from looking for Zhang San and Li Si.

711
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,980
Looking for Li Linghua is the most important thing.

712
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,980
The wolf son of the God-given Tao is also a good thing.

713
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,980
Only Li Linghua can stop him,

714
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,980
otherwise, the consequences will be unimaginable.

715
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,980
Don't be so eavesdropping.

716
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,980
God-given Tao's death

717
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,980
and the task of looking for the Heaven's Chicken Hall

718
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,980
is indeed well-known.

719
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,980
But this is your personal grudge.

720
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,980
Why would you do this to our country?

721
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,980
Sect Leader Xiao.

722
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,980
I don't know if you're really lonely or pretending to be.

723
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,980
God-given Tao has been in charge of the Heaven's Chicken Hall these ten years.

724
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,980
He has joined forces with the Martial Arts Sect

725
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,980
and has gathered some strong men from the fish and dragon clans

726
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,980
He's a brave and brave man.

727
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,620
He even recruited a bunch of evil masters.

728
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,740
His power has already surpassed the righteous path.

729
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,020
What's more terrifying is that

730
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,500
he has already obtained the Peony of Night Fire.

731
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,260
As long as the time is right,

732
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,700
he can control anyone

733
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,900
and become his puppet.

734
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:14,660
Do you still think

735
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,140
you can be on your own?

736
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,860
What I'm saying is true.

737
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,820
Heaven and earth are the evidence.

738
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:25,820
Everyone,

739
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,140
only by finding Li Lian Hua

740
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,060
can we stop the Shaggy Sword.

741
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,780
Why is it that

742
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,140
Li Lian Hua can stop the Shaggy Sword?

743
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,900
Then, does Li Lian Hua

744
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,820
know the Shaggy Sword?

745
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,820
Because Li Lian Hua

746
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,020
is the master of the four sects

747
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,340
of the Shaggy Sword's junior brother,

748
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,500
Li Xiang Yi.

749
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,060
What you're saying is true?

750
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,500
Li Lian Hua

751
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,780
really is the master of the four sects?

752
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,820
Li Xiang Yi.

753
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,820
Li Xiang Yi.

754
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,820
Li Xiang Yi.

755
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,540
He really is the master?

756
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,580
Nonsense.

757
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,420
What kind of talent is Li Xiang Yi?

758
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,060
What is Li Lian Hua?

759
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,500
He's just a village man

760
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,340
who grows vegetables in the fields.

761
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,420
Master,

762
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,780
in the world,

763
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,220
except for this Fang Duo,

764
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,780
who else can prove

765
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,300
that Li Lian Hua is Li Xiang Yi?

766
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,140
I'll prove it for him.

767
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,300
Zhan Yunfei, Zai Daxia.

768
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,740
I have a way to get to the city.

769
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,980
If you can,

770
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,900
send me the official false information tomorrow.

771
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,780
And then,

772
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,640
send the official news of

773
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,920
Yan Xiyun,

774
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,100
this Yan Xiyun will be

775
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,260
sent to Yunuma.

776
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:50,820
How's

777
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:55,380
my gratitude

778
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,700
for good news?

779
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,460
Your broad G harness

780
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,700
can't keep up with me.

781
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:02,500
Mr. Fang, the inner power you used just now was Yang Zhou Man?

782
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,780
I was seriously injured and my life was in danger.

783
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:11,020
Li Lian Hua passed it to me through Yang Zhou Man.

784
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,340
He's still alive?

785
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,100
Then, the sect leader is in danger.

786
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,220
We should immediately find the sect leader.

787
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:21,020
Even if it's really Li Xiang Yi, what's the point?

788
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,380
The Four Gu Sects were established for the sake of justice.

789
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,300
It's the great cause of the Jianghu.

790
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,700
If one person is missing,

791
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,940
we'll start searching the whole Four Gu Sect.

792
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,420
If this gets out,

793
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:33,540
wouldn't it be a joke to the martial arts world?

794
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,220
It will indeed be a joke to the martial arts world.

795
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:40,820
It's a joke that we're the wronged gentlemen who can't be saved.

796
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,260
Han Ming.

797
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,540
I really didn't expect

798
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,980
you to become like this today.

799
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:52,220
You're full of big people and evil intentions.

800
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,420
What small and big things?

801
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,780
What great things?

802
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,140
Isn't the great cause of the world

803
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:01,220
just a pile of small things?

804
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,140
Today, the one who disappeared

805
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,940
is a bandit who's gone.

806
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,620
Is it because it's not important and not worth it

807
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,420
that you're just going to let him die?

808
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,580
What difference does it make if the Four Gu Sects exist or not?

809
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:18,900
Moreover, I already knew

810
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,780
that all of this is just an excuse for you.

811
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,600
It's a good thing that those Who Paid tribute

812
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:28,700
are still alive!

813
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,660
If you're crying for this,

814
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:46,200
Particularly,

815
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,160
I'm still small as a peel.

816
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,500
About when we finished,

817
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,500
I shouldn't have sent you to be the sect leader of the Four Gu Sect.

818
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,100
I took the sect leader's order away first.

819
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,300
He's hanging on your waist.

820
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,100
It's the punishment of the Four Gu Sect.

821
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,100
Let's part ways.

822
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,500
Go.

823
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,500
Did he die?

824
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,900
He's been here for 4 or 5 days.

825
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,100
He hasn't woken up.

826
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,900
The Lord used the best medicine for him.

827
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,300
He used thousands of gold gold pills.

828
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,500
He's still alive.

829
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,300
He's not badly hurt.

830
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,900
He's still not woken up.

831
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,900
After all, he got hurt in the rib and got a lung injury.

832
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,900
Who would lose half of his life?

833
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,900
Why would the sect leader save him?

834
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,500
I've been with the sect leader for 3 years.

835
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,900
I've only seen the sect leader kill people,

836
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,100
but I've never seen the sect leader save people.

837
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,700
Could it be...

838
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,700
What is it?

839
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,500
It's the sect leader's loyal fan.

840
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,300
The sect leader's loyal fan lives over there.

841
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,700
That's the sect leader's loyal fan.

842
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,900
People have been locked up there for a long time.

843
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,500
There's no sound at all.

844
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,900
And who's locked up there?

845
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,900
Don't be annoying.

846
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,700
Why are you talking so much?

847
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,900
The sect leader killed you.

848
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,500
Let's go.

849
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,700
Let's go.

850
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,900
This is the place of the Jiao Li Bridge.

851
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,300
If you fall into such a deep place,

852
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,700
I'm afraid I'll be blinded by my own sense.

853
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:14,300
And I won't let Jiao Li Bridge have such a beautiful view.

854
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,300
If you

855
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,100
are forced to seek for a thousand thorns,

856
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,700
I'll kill you.

857
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,900
If it weren't for you...

858
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,500
He's awake. Don't hit him.

859
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,300
I'll tell you today.

860
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,100
You've been sleeping for a long time.

861
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,300
If you sleep another day,

862
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,700
we'll bury you as a corpse.

863
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,500
If you are so lazy,

864
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,700
I'll ask for your permission to sleep here.

865
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,900
I'll let you sleep here.

866
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,700
Are you blind?

867
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,300
My eyes

868
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,100
aren't good.

869
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,900
So the one that showed us was a blind person.

870
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,500
Don't say that.

871
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,900
The blind person looks good.

872
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,100
The blind person we saw before

873
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,700
were all blindfolded by the owner.

874
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,100
So ugly.

875
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:15,900
Blind person.

876
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,100
If you can't see, then you can't see.

877
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,900
If you want to eat and pee, don't bother us.

878
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,100
I'm a good boy.

879
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,500
So, where is this place?

880
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,100
I'm not telling you.

881
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,100
You're not telling me?

882
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,900
Then let me guess.

883
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,100
This must be the dungeon.

884
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,100
You're wearing chains and chains.

885
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,700
Isn't this the dungeon?

886
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,700
Then your master

887
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,700
must be the Jiao Li Qiao.

888
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,900
I'm not sure.

889
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,100
I'm not sure.

890
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,100
I'm not sure.

891
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,100
I'm not sure.

892
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,100
You're quite good at guessing.

893
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,100
Your voice is very nice.

894
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,100
If I guess correctly,

895
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,100
you must be

896
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,100
the descendants of the Nanyi

897
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,100
and your master.

898
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,100
Am I right?

899
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,500
You're so sweet.

900
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,500
We're busy.

901
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,100
If you die, call us.

902
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,100
If you don't die, sleep by yourself.

903
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,500
Give me a cup of tea.

904
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,100
Drink tea?

905
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,300
Don't bother us.

906
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,700
I don't want to bother you either.

907
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,300
But I'm really thirsty.

908
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,100
I'm so thirsty.

909
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,700
Then you'll be more troublesome.

910
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,100
You're thirsty and want some water.

911
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,300
You can kneel down and beg me.

912
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,500
I'll let you drink some water.

913
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,700
You've already got the Night Fire Teng.

914
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,700
You're not busy with the Night.

915
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,700
Why did you come here?

916
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,900
I've been working hard for over ten years.

917
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,700
Of course I want to take a good look at you.

918
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,900
I'm sure you'll be able to

919
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,900
see the result of your defeat.

920
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,900
The best

921
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,700
and the most important Li Xiangyi

922
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,300
finally lost to me.

923
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,900
I'm so happy.

924
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,900
If I knew you wanted to win,

925
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,300
I would have been more lazy

926
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,900
and let you win.

927
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:40,300
I wouldn't have let you

928
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,500
waste your time.

929
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,900
Li Xiangyi,

930
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,900
don't think you're right.

931
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,300
No matter how good you are at martial arts,

932
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,300
no matter how good you are at martial arts,

933
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,300
you're just the leader

934
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,300
of the Four Gu Sects.

935
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,100
But I'm

936
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,500
more than ten times better than you.

937
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,500
Now,

938
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,500
I have the Night Fire Teng.

939
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,900
Everything is under my control.

940
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,900
I'll be successful in a few days.

941
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,500
In the martial arts world,

942
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:14,100
I'm the first sect to be successful.

943
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:17,100
I'm the only one in the world.

944
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,700
And you,

945
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,300
I want to hang you

946
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,300
on the wall of the city.

947
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,500
The wind blows, the sun shines, and the rain falls.

948
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,700
You're tortured every day.

949
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,700
No one remembers who you are.

950
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,300
When you remember,

951
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:37,700
you only remember the wild dog at the gate of the city.

952
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,100
Just like you want to drink this cup of water,

953
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,100
you have to kneel down

954
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,100
and shake your head to drink it.

955
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,100
Shan Gu Dao, Shan Gu Dao.

956
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,300
What does it matter if I don't drink this water?

957
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,500
But so many years have passed.

958
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,900
You're still so easy to get angry.

959
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,500
You won't be satisfied for a few days.

960
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:15,300
Take your time to suffer.

961
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,100
Take care.

962
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,500
You two, watch him.

963
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,500
Torture him every day.

964
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,500
Don't let him die.

965
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,500
Keep your life.

966
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,900
Wait for the day I succeed in the great cause.

967
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,100
How dare you order us?

968
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,700
I think you won't be satisfied for a few days.

969
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,100
The flowers bloom again.

970
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,300
The person is young again.

971
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,300
You don't need to be rich and rich.

972
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,900
You can enjoy the luxury of being a god.

973
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,700
Young Master Fang,

974
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,700
I've read these letters in the day.

975
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,700
There's no news from the doctor.

976
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,300
Do you have any news?

977
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,700
Otakuın Kaskiza

978
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,700
Otakuin Kaskiza

979
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,700
Stop!

980
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,700
Who are you?

981
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:40,900
I don't remember the old days, but they will come back

982
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:46,900
I have a new life, but I'm too haggard

983
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:52,100
I'm in love with the green hills and the green fields

984
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:59,900
Who doesn't want to live a life of loneliness

985
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:12,600
Like the rain, the wind is getting wild

986
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:18,300
It will pour down the pure light

987
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:23,900
The rain falls, the sound is loud and the sound is soft

988
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:28,300
I can't help but feel warm

989
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:31,500
The wine and the rain, the moon at the top

990
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,300
The dust is like dust in the mortal world

991
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:39,900
If I turn around and accidentally wait for the clouds to fall

992
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,700
The scattered things are like a blink of an eye

993
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:47,900
The flowers and the tears are all in one

994
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:52,400
I only hope that we can meet and not part

995
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,300
Is the world too cruel?

996
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,700
I can't wait for the old days to come

997
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:00,500
The past is still there

998
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:06,300
I don't remember the old days, but they will come back

999
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:11,500
I'm in love with the green hills and the green fields

1000
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:18,500
Who doesn't want to live a life of loneliness

1001
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:28,300
I don't remember the old days, but they will come back

1002
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:34,300
I only hope that we can meet and not part

1003
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:39,500
Is the world too cruel?

1004
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:46,300
I only hope that we can meet and not part
