[Episode 7]

4
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,300
The head is a very strange thing.

5
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,509
It leaks a lot of secrets,

6
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,979
whether one is dead or alive.

7
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:56,729
What do you mean?

8
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,620
At this point,

9
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,820
we need to find out the truth

10
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,520
about Zhang Qingshi's death first.

11
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,220
The murderer made a hole on the wall

12
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,430
to frame someone else after the murder.

13
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,430
It means he must have entered through the front door.

14
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,330
But Zhang Qinghu was staying in the same room

15
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,010
and didn't see anything.

16
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,700
What if

17
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,170
they weren't staying in the same room?

18
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:23,210
Room 4 and Room 5 are adjacent to each other.

19
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,870
Which one do you think is Room 4?

20
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,040
Isn't it obvious?

21
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:26,820
One is 4.

22
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,290
The other is 5.

23
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:28,320
This one, of course.

24
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,320
This is strange.

25
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,180
How come this one is 4 as well?

26
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,340
You put the mud on it?

27
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,010
As it was dark,

28
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,560
the murderer only needed to cover the white dot
in the middle on Room 5's door sign

29
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,880
and add a dot

30
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,860
with this white powder to Room 4's door sign

31
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,630
to switch the numbers.

32
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,340
As long as the Zhang Brothers came back separately,

33
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,510
the murderer could perform this trick

34
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,030
in the interval between their returns

35
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,280
and make the one who came back later

36
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,350
mistake Room 5 for Room 4.

37
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,170
But I saw the Zhang Brothers

38
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,260
leave Canglu Garden together

39
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,530
last night.

40
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,070
They should have come back together.

41
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,340
Why did they separate on the way?

42
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,380
So how come you lost them?

43
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,060
I'll show you.

44
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,530
I followed them here last night

45
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,690
and lost them.

46
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,010
I see.

47
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:37,820
Let's re-enact it.

48
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,020
Li Lianhua?

49
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,440
You're going the wrong way.

50
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:09,610
That's the secret of last night?

51
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,950
It's very foggy here,

52
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,140
which makes this place suitable for employing
the Qi Men Dun Jia technique.

53
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,280
A master doesn't have to do much.

54
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,940
It only takes a few simple steps to get people astray.

55
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,560
Li Lianhua?

56
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,410
Zhang Qinghu and his elder brother

57
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:33,870
were separated in this manner.

58
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,200
I see.

59
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,810
That's pretty much what happened last night.

60
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,230
I see.

61
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,870
I thought my brother just went ahead

62
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,150
because I was drunk and too slow.

63
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,760
Unlike a sober person, your steps are unsteady

64
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,080
when you are drunk.

65
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,060
The two of you were intentionally separated,

66
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,300
and when you were back,

67
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,920
you went into different rooms.

68
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,310
The two of us stayed in the same room.

69
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,220
Did you hear your brother's voice?

70
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,810
No.

71
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,100
I was drunk and sleepy,

72
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,310
and fell asleep as soon as I was back.

73
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,560
So your brother was in Room 4,

74
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,110
and you were in Room 5.

75
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,320
On their way back from the banquet last night,

76
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,690
the Zhang Brothers were separated by the flagstone path.

77
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,130
Zhang Qingshi was ahead of Zhang Qinghu.

78
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,650
After a long wait for Zhang Qinghu, Zhang Qingshi went ahead

79
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,610
and returned to Room 4 first.

80
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,520
At this moment, the murderer

81
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,159
switched the signs through putting mud

82
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:45,940
and white powder on them,

83
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,620
and then entered Room 4

84
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,290
and killed Zhang Qingshi while he was alone.

85
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,960
When Zhang Qinghu was back,

86
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,210
as it was dark and he was drunk,

87
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,140
he saw the door signs that had been tampered with

88
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,670
and naturally went into Room 5.

89
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,400
After killing him,

90
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,020
the murderer broke the air vent on the back wall

91
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,450
to make people suspect the kid,

92
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:04,680
and then cleaned the signs.

93
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:07,770
When Zhang Qinghu

94
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,530
got up to use the bathroom, the signs
had been switched back.

95
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,120
He was transferred to Room 4,

96
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,790
and finally saw that his brother had been killed.

97
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,860
Please tell me

98
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,220
who killed my brother.

99
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,420
That person could think of adjusting the gaps
between the flagstones,

100
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,580
as well as

101
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,810
this method of leading people away
from a fork in the road.

102
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,240
In my opinion,

103
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,240
this person knows the Qi Men Dun Jia technique.

104
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:40,880
Gu Fengxin,

105
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,850
isn't that what you learned before you entered the sect?

106
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,690
I've heard a lot about you, Scholar Sushou.

107
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,340
Now I see you're indeed quite extraordinary.

108
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,120
That's right.

109
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,700
It was me who killed Zhang Qingshi.

110
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:00,900
Gu,

111
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,020
we have done nothing to you,

112
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,610
why did you kill my brother?

113
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,280
Done nothing to me?

114
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,990
Do you remember the name Yu Wanwan?

115
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,620
"The Dusty Butterfly," Yu Wanwan?

116
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,910
I heard that she entered this trade quite late
following her cousin.

117
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,730
Her cousin... is you?

118
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,350
Dun Jia Qi Men is hard to learn and master.

119
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,090
You put in a lot of hard work, but rarely get to use it.

120
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,740
That's why most of the disciples of that sect are poor.

121
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,540
By chance,

122
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,280
I started stealing treasure from tombs

123
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,560
and found that I could apply what I had learned

124
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,540
and even make a fortune through that.

125
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,100
I got carried away

126
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,700
and had my cousin join me and become a tomb robber as well.

127
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,380
But five years ago,

128
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,460
while she was collaborating with the Zhang Brothers,

129
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,700
my cousin was raped and killed by a drunken Zhang Qingshi.

130
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,020
I kept looking for opportunities for revenge,

131
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,020
but the Zhang Brothers were too powerful together

132
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:52,890
and I couldn't do anything.

133
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,150
I finally got this chance today

134
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,630
and avenged my cousin.

135
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,900
Zhang Qingshi was stabbed at the throat
with my cousin's jade hairpin.

136
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,700
I had a great time killing him.

137
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,560
And he very much deserved it.

138
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,160
But I didn't chop off his head.

139
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,800
I'll kill you and avenge my brother!

140
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:19,290
Duan Hai, help me!

141
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,700
Stop!

142
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,350
We've found the murderer of my brother.

143
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,850
What are you trying to do, Master Wei?

144
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,410
I asked you to come for the purpose
of entering Yipin Tomb.

145
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,789
Put aside your personal grudges for now.

146
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:45,340
When we're done,

147
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,580
you can do whatever you want.

148
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,570
Wei,

149
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,179
what's wrong with you today?

150
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,890
What I said just now

151
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:53,929
is for everyone here.

152
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:56,960
Do as I say and enter Yipin Tomb,

153
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,780
or you might not make it out of Mount Puchu alive.

154
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:02,420
Master Wei,

155
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,120
we came here for the banquet.

156
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,050
You think these servants of yours

157
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,970
will get us to work for you like slaves?

158
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,500
The servants, no.

159
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,890
But Ghost Wail Potion will.

160
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,890
Everyone,

161
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,200
you enjoyed the wine last night, didn't you?

162
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,530
Now feel your Shenque and Guanyuan acupoints.

163
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,690
Very sore, aren't they?

164
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,470
That means the Ghost Wail Potion is taking effect.

165
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,900
You poisoned the wine?

166
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,260
Ghost Wail Potion is colorless and tasteless.

167
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,140
It's not hard to cure at the beginning,

168
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,190
but six hours later, the poison enters the bone marrow

169
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,280
and can only

170
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,680
be cured by the poisoner.

171
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,460
To wait for the poison to take effect,

172
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,960
I had to put up with your noise all night.

173
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,470
It was so annoying.

174
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,240
Master Wei,

175
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,300
why did you do that?

176
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,690
You guys haven't stopped arguing

177
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,220
since you entered my manor yesterday.

178
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,530
How will you unite?

179
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,010
Now it's easy.

180
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,700
If you want to live, do as I say

181
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,500
and help me enter Yipin Tomb.

182
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,340
Give me the antidote!

183
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,290
Thread of Netherworld?

184
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,340
The weapon of the Fourteen Thieves of the Netherworld?

185
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,670
How did you get it?

186
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,590
The weapon of the Fourteen Thieves of the Netherworld

187
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:16,860
was taken

188
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,460
from the bodies of the Fourteen Thieves, of course.

189
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,000
You and your brother are descendants

190
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,290
of Fourteen Thieves' member Zhang Qianhuang.

191
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,990
I've known it for a long time.

192
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,300
The seven headless bodies on Mount Puchu

193
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,300
-The Fourteen Thieves of the Netherworld?
-are seven of the Fourteen Thieves.

194
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,830
I beheaded them

195
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,300
because I didn't want you to find out

196
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,910
that even the Fourteen Thieves died here,

197
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,600
and then get too scared to come.

198
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,400
How did you kill the Fourteen Thieves?

199
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,180
Don't get the wrong idea.

200
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,960
I didn't lie at the banquet.

201
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,100
It's been ten years since the seven of them

202
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,090
died in Yipin Tomb.

203
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,690
I only cut off their heads

204
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,850
to hide their identity.

205
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,340
The head is a very strange thing.

206
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,580
It leaks a lot of secrets,

207
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,070
whether one is dead or alive.

208
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:05,180
The Fourteen Thieves have been dead for ten years?

209
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,180
Did you think that the Fourteen Thieves disappeared

210
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,220
because they got rich and ran away?

211
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,580
You and your brother

212
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,820
showed your devotion looking for them with the badge.

213
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:14,980
But it's easy now.

214
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,100
As long as you do as I say

215
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,290
and help me enter Yipin Tomb,

216
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,390
you might actually see the remains of your late father.

217
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,690
Wei is sinister and ruthless.

218
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,440
Everyone,

219
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,640
let's fight him together.

220
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,930
We still have a chance to win.

221
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,050
Hurry up!

222
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,260
The poison has reached the internal organs

223
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,390
and your stomach is churning.

224
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,100
It hurts a lot.

225
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,100
Master,

226
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,250
please show mercy.

227
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:52,380
I'll enter the tomb.

228
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,610
I will do everything I can to help you.

229
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,000
Please spare my life.

230
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,940
We're all in the same trade.

231
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,750
I don't want to hurt you.

232
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,220
As long as you do as I say,

233
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,400
I'll give you half of the antidote,

234
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,580
which can put off the poison's taking effect
for three days.

235
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,020
When we're done,

236
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,400
I'll give you the other half of the antidote

237
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,480
and distribute the treasure in Yipin Tomb
according to the work you've done.

238
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:14,890
We'll all be happy.

239
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:15,740
I promise I'll do as you say.

240
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,220
Please give me the antidote.

241
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,460
You're very sensible.

242
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,340
Please... give me... the antidote.

243
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:27,030
Please... please give me the antidote.

244
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,400
Please give me the antidote.

245
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,700
Please give us the antidote.

246
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,060
Please give us the antidote.

247
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,230
Good.

248
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,940
When you have taken the antidote,

249
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,620
go to the storehouse and pick some handy tools,

250
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,580
and get ready to set out.

251
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,560
Li Lianhua,

252
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,550
there're fewer guards in the northeast corner,

253
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,070
so it'll be easier for you to leave from there.

254
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:05,700
Leave?

255
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,580
Master Wei has spent his life on Mount Puchu.

256
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,170
If he were really capable of entering the tomb

257
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,180
and getting the Fourteen Thieves' bodies out,

258
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,420
why would he have waited until now?

259
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,930
There must be someone powerful
behind the seven thieves' corpses case,

260
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,790
who's trying to lure people into the tomb
through Master Wei.

261
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,390
This trip into Yipin Tomb is going to be dangerous.

262
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,340
You don't know martial arts yet.

263
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,170
You should leave now.

264
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,610
If I leave,

265
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,220
won't you be found out?

266
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,300
No need to worry about me.

267
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,300
It'll be too late if you don't leave now.

268
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:26,940
Hurry up.

269
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,340
Come on.

270
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,980
Don't fret. Listen to me.

271
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,740
To be honest,

272
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,690
actually,

273
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,200
I'm just like them.

274
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,720
I'm here for Yipin Tomb too.

275
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,060
You want the Weeping Guanyin too?

276
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,350
How do you know that?

277
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,220
You may be stingy,

278
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,530
but you've never been greedy.

279
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,340
So you're definitely not after the treasure

280
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,170
in Yipin Tomb.

281
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,020
I'm standing right in front of you,

282
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,780
but I've never heard you seek advice on martial arts.

283
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,800
So you're not after the books on martial arts either.

284
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:00,530
Also,

285
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,560
you don't even care about Yinzhu Armor,

286
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,980
which means you're not interested

287
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,240
in sophisticated weapons.

288
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,580
So it can only be the Weeping Guanyin.

289
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,980
What exactly

290
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,060
is the Weeping Guanyin?

291
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,430
How come everyone wants it?

292
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,340
Even you want it.

293
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,250
The Weeping Guanyin is a rare elixir.

294
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,540
The Zhang Brothers wanted it

295
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,940
because they wanted to become more powerful.

296
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,600
I...

297
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,740
need it as a cure.

298
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,480
A cure?

299
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,650
Are you injured? Are you ill?

300
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,960
It's just that when I was little,

301
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,700
I had heart disease.

302
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,990
I couldn't sleep or eat well in the evening,

303
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,860
and had severe chest pain.

304
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,910
Only the Weeping Guanyin

305
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,180
can cure this disease.

306
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,090
The Weeping Guanyin is just a medicine
that's been hidden for a century.

307
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,970
What's the point if it can't save people?

308
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,020
Besides,

309
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,500
I'm not an ungrateful person.

310
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,030
Don't worry.

311
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,580
I'll find a way

312
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,460
to get the Weeping Guanyin for you.

313
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,940
Actually, I don't really have to get it.

314
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,220
Then let's make it fair.

315
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,690
I'll get the medicine for you,

316
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,060
and you'll help me investigate the case.

317
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:02,640
What do you think?

318
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,460
It's a deal.

319
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,630
Who do you think that kid is?

320
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,040
Master Wei used poison to control everyone,

321
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,530
but is very nice to him.

322
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,700
The kid is being carried up the mountain.

323
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,190
Maybe Master Wei is afraid that he'll be difficult
to deal with when he grows up.

324
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,860
I don't believe that.

325
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:36,130
Now,

326
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,790
I need to find a chance to try him out.

327
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,020
Don't do that.

328
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,620
Why?

329
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,430
Don't you think Zhang Qinghu is weird?

330
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,020
Why don't you pay more attention to him?

331
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:53,040
[Wei Manor's Yipin Tomb]

332
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,020
Something's going on here.

333
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,910
The Qi Men technique is being used over there.

334
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:11,700
Look.

335
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,980
That pearl is big

336
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,450
and pierced.

337
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,410
It must have fallen from a piece of jewelry.

338
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,460
Judging from that,

339
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,220
this should be the place.

340
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,100
The seven thieves' corpses are here.

341
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,940
Yipin Tomb is also here.

342
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,240
The person behind this is probably nearby,

343
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,670
waiting for us to enter the tomb.

344
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:32,980
Everyone,

345
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,190
as you can see,

346
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,230
this is Yipin Tomb.

347
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,340
Unfortunately,

348
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,480
it's blocked by the Qi Men technique.

349
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,340
Mr. Gu,

350
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,580
please.

351
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,650
This Qi Men formation is really something.

352
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,490
It drew all the fog around here to hide the mountain.

353
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:38,109
But the core of the formation seems
to have been cracked recently.

354
00:17:39,069 --> 00:17:40,480
Otherwise, even my mentor wouldn't have been able

355
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,960
to find this place.

356
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,900
That precipice over there is not natural.

357
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,370
It's probably a secret mechanical gate,

358
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,400
which must be the entrance to Yipin Tomb.

359
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,980
The craftsmen of Nanyin must have worked really hard

360
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,770
to make a tomb gate out of a mountain.

361
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,800
Unless we cut into the mountain,

362
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,700
we'll hardly be able to open it.

363
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,140
There's a breach over there.

364
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,140
If someone can get in,

365
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,500
we might be able to open the gate from inside.

366
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,570
The breach is dozens of meters above the ground.

367
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,300
No one can get up there.

368
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:36,730
Everyone,

369
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,170
you see?

370
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,230
Now you know why we can't enter Yipin Tomb

371
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,940
without my little master.

372
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,060
Did you see that?

373
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,570
Don't be so amazed.

374
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,030
His flying skill

375
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,090
is not bad.

376
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,490
It's far more than that.

377
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,890
With that flying skill,

378
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,450
his name will appear in the who's who of martial arts.

379
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,930
Why are you not at all impressed?

380
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,680
I just can't tell if it's real

381
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,100
or if it's good.

382
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:10,740
Keep learning then.

383
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:38,770
Watch out!

384
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,700
Duan Hai was unlucky.

385
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,280
Being in this trade,

386
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,640
surely you've all seen dead people before.

387
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,020
Now the tomb gate is open,

388
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,280
don't waste time.

389
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:12,560
Iron Slave,

390
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:13,920
you stay here and keep guard.

391
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,770
Give us a signal if any stranger comes.

392
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:16,430
Let's go.

393
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:31,270
What are you laughing about?

394
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,750
About luck and human relationships.

395
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,920
Looks like someone turned the boulder around

396
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,180
with palm power.

397
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,860
Could it be Zhang Qinghu?

398
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,940
If nobody touched it,

399
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,380
it would have hit between the two
and caused only minor injuries.

400
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,650
Zhang Qinghu killed his friend Duan Hai.

401
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,460
Zhang Qinghu's palm power is very strong.

402
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,230
All right now, let's go.

There is gold leaf on the ever-burning lamps.

406
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,830
Yipin Tomb is so ornate.

407
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,410
Everyone,

408
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,420
you won't be disappointed.

409
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,060
When we're done, you won't have to

410
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,780
do this kind of underground work anymore.

411
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,420
Th-This is going up?

412
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,660
A sky-facing tomb?

413
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:46,920
It's indeed a sky-facing tomb.

414
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,230
All other tombs go down,

415
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,830
while sky-facing tombs are built on mountains.

416
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,560
Their burial chambers are built on mountaintops,

417
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,250
so that the buried are exposed to sunlight.

418
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,620
In this way,

419
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,020
the buried are punished for their disloyalty,

420
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,770
and the mausoleums on the mountains

421
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,370
can highlight the majesty of the imperial family.

422
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,900
The craftsmen of Nanyin really put a lot of thought into it.

423
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,740
Strange.

424
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,470

They're the other members of the Fourteen Thieves
of the Netherworld.

434
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,940
I told you it's been ten years

435
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,020
since the Fourteen Thieves

436
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,060
died in this tomb.

437
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:49,500
Zhang Qinghu,

438
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,120
I didn't lie to you.

439
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,590
The bodies haven't really decomposed.

440
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,020
I suppose this is a special tomb.

441
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,270
That's why the seven corpses at the foot of the mountain

442
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,660
look like new deaths.

443
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,700
Apparently the Fourteen Thieves of the Netherworld

444
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,620
came here ten years ago.

445
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,460
If they were trapped and died here,

446
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,460
why is it that half of them are in the tomb,

447
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,560
and half are at the foot of the mountain?

448
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:14,130
How should I know?

449
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,540
But the Fourteen Thieves

450
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,130
managed to inform us

451
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,420
about the existence of Yipin Tomb.

452
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,590
We must not let them down.

453
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,500
Everyone,

454
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,560
let's take a look.

455
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,450
Come on, open it.

456
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,950
Everyone.

457
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,790
Hold on.

458
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,420
By the look of it,

459
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,310
there's probably no corpse inside this coffin,

460
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,540
which means this is a fake burial chamber.

461
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,640
There's so much treasure

462
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,420
even in a fake burial chamber.

463
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,850
How much treasure will there be

464
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,210
in the real burial chamber where Prince Fangji is buried?

465
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,280
Everyone,

466
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,700
aren't you curious?

467
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:10,510
About what?

468
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,230
Get the treasure first!

469
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:15,700
Too small.

470
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:16,860
Too small-minded.

471
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,780
Why bother with this second-class stuff?

472
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,420
When we find the real burial chamber,

473
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,080
you'll need more pockets than you have.

474
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,540
We're at the end of the tomb passage.

475
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,620
The real entrance must be somewhere around here.

476
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,740
Whoever finds the entrance first

477
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,780
gets to pick their treasure first.

478
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,940
Do your best if you want to make a fortune.

479
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,840
Most of the tomb gates here are intact.

480
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,220
So how did the person behind all this

481
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,460
throw the seven bodies out of the tomb?

482
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,800
The easiest way

483
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,910
is to just toss them out.

484
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,420
Toss them out?

485
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,620
Yipin Tomb is not on the ground,

486
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,320
but on the top of a mountain, remember?

487
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:12,980
Hold out your hand.

488
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,650
What do you feel?

489
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,940
Why is there wind?

490
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,700
There's indeed a breach here.

491
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,380
Now I see.

492
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,980
The seven bodies were tossed out from here.

493
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,980
The local folks who were getting married
on a full moon night

494
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:50,220
stumbled across them and saw their decayed

495
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,780
and twisted look under the moon,

496
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,020
and thought they were still alive.

497
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,180
It's exactly the same.

498
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,500
I mean

499
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,620
the breach here

500
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,320
is exactly the same as the one
on the gate of the fake tomb.

501
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,220
Both were made with a smack.

502
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:07,900
So the person behind this

503
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,460
is extremely powerful.

504
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:11,450
He came here

505
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,010
but didn't find the real burial chamber,

506
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,380
so he threw the bodies out,

507
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,700
and then broke the tomb gate,

508
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,180
to lure other people in

509
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,350
to help him find the real burial chamber.

510
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:24,180
You have a point there.

511
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,210
So we came,

512
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:27,010
just as he expected.

513
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:29,520
Interesting.

514
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:44,210
Ge Pan,

515
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,320
what do you want?

516
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,890
Everyone, we were poisoned and threatened,

517
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,470
have you forgotten?

518
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,380
Wei poisoned us,

519
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,860
why would he give us the antidote when we're done?

520
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,460
It'll be much safer for him

521
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:02,550
to kill us and take all the treasure alone.

522
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,370
I don't want to be your enemy.

523
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,190
I just want to live.

524
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,020
If we catch and torture him,

525
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,060
he will have to give us the antidote.

526
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,860
Won't it be better to divide the treasure equally

527
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,020
among yourselves?

528
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,740
Keeping me waiting for so long.

529
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,260
So you rebelled!

530
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,080
Be good.

531
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,780
Don't court death.

532
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:44,900
This kid.

533
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,850
Tomb robbers are very discreet.

534
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,700
It's normal for them to know a trick or two,

535
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:52,340
right?

536
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,420
Besides,

537
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,380
you should take a closer look.

538
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,620
The skin between his thumb and forefinger is not calloused,

539
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,460
but his fingers are.

540
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,420
Maybe he's a master of hidden weapons too.

541
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:03,700
Mr. Ge,

542
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:04,300
are you OK?

543
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:05,940
Let me help you up.

544
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:06,560
Come on.

545
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,140
Mr. Ge,

546
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,030
are you alright?

547
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,140
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

548
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,730
We were all poisoned by Master Wei.

549
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,820
We're in the same boat.

550
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,720
If we can't get the antidote this time,

551
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,130
please take us back to Baichuan Court

552
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:25,930
and ask Master Bai to save us.

553
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:26,860
Of course.

554
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,460
Of course.

555
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:27,960
Thank you.

556
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,300
I hope you've all realized now

557
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,480
that whoever vexes my little master will die.

558
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,660
Hurry up and look for it!

559
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:48,860
No need.

560
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,260
The machines here

561
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,640
correspond to six of the eight directions.

562
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,420
Only Heaven and Earth are missing.

563
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,400
This is a sky-facing tomb.

564
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,060
Heaven and Earth are reversed.

565
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,940
So we only need to find a Heaven direction

566
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,220
to connect the other machines.

567
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,460
This is a Flying Ape Claw.

568
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,940
When you're in danger,

569
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:03,240
use it to climb up high and escape.

570
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,050
I'll find a way to get the Weeping Guanyin for you.

571
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:06,990
OK.

572
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,140
I'm counting on you.

573
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:10,980
Let's go.

574
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,350
Guanyin Gate.

575
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,540
We've found Yipin Tomb.

576
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,460
Finally!

577
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,920
Trying to kill us all?

578
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,300
Quite some tactics indeed.

579
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,120
The Plum Blossom Darts came from the side
where you three are standing.

580
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:43,980
Tell me,

581
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,900
who did it?

582
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,060
I was almost killed by a hidden weapon just now.

583
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,900
My inner breath got impaired.

584
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,410
I can't use my martial arts skills anymore.

585
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,300
Zhang Qinghu,

586
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:00,170
between you and your brother, I remember you were the one
who used hidden weapons.

587
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:04,740
All the lights went out at the same time

588
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,660
just now.

589
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:06,730
Exactly.

590
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,540
I used Tiger Tooth Darts,

591
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,460
and have never used Plum Blossom Darts.

592
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:15,360
But the Zhang Brothers are actually quite good at acting.

593
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:16,750
Still not tired?

594
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,330
What do you mean?

595
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,540
I mean

596
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:21,850
it must be tiring to play your younger brother.

597
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,220
Do you ever forget who you are,

598
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,260
Zhang Qingshi?

599
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:32,940
Zhang Qingshi?

600
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:38,900
But I have killed him.

601
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,480
You did kill someone,

602
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,960
but it doesn't mean

603
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,580
that you killed Zhang Qingshi.

604
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,020
I followed Zhang Qingshi back to the room last night.

605
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,290
I couldn't have gotten it wrong.

606
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,300
The Zhang Brothers,

607
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,390
as we all know,

608
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,860
are identical twins.

609
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,620
So how did you distinguish between the two of them?

610
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,650
Zhang Qingshi had two hammers in his hands

611
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,820
and was in black.

612
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,460
Zhang Qinghu used a dart pouch

613
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,340
and was in white.

614
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,620
A glance was enough.

615
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,140
Let me ask you,

616
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,060
what if they exchanged their clothes and weapons?

617
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,920
Why would they do that?

618
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:10,800
It was a coincidence.

619
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,660
Master Wei said at the banquet

620
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,300
that between the Zhang Brothers,

621
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,620
Zhang Qingshi

622
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,300
loved hard liquor,

623
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,730
and the drink being served that night
was Xifeng Liquor.

624
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,060
That's right.

625
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:22,650
Yes.

626
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,469
How much did they drink respectively yesterday?

627
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,500
Zhang Qingshi drank half a jar

628
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,260
and got drunk.

629
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,719
Zhang Qinghu drank less than half a cup,

630
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:36,590
and then changed to tea instead.

631
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,420
Now you've probably realized that you got it wrong.

632
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:44,139
The Zhang Qingshi you followed last night

633
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,260
was very sober.

634
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,830
On the contrary, Zhang Qinghu, who was following behind,

635
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,060
was terribly drunk.

636
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,739
Besides, you told us

637
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:54,510
you killed him by stabbing a jade hairpin
into his throat.

638
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,120
I'd like to ask you,

639
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,389
after you killed him,

640
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:58,940
where did his head go?

641
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,980
I found that strange too.

642
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,620
Why was he beheaded?

643
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:07,750
It's simple.

644
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,460
With his head gone,

645
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:12,010
people can't tell who that person is.

646
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,340
What happened last night

647
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,490
was an accident from the beginning.

648
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:23,980
It's hot.

649
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,940
Here, brother, put it on.

650
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,130
Last night at the banquet,

651
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:37,140
Zhang Qingshi got drunk on Xifeng Liquor

652
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,770
and felt hot.

653
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:41,030
So he took off his black gown

654
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,190
and put it on his younger brother, Zhang Qinghu.

655
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,260
His white gown underneath was shown.

656
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,460
His hammers were carried by his brother as well.

657
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,860
Gu Fengxin, who kept himself hidden in the dark,

658
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:11,250
mistook Zhang Qinghu, who was in black
and had the hammers in his hands,

659
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,570
for Zhang Qingshi,

660
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:15,570
went into Room 4 and killed him.

661
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,290
The real Zhang Qingshi

662
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,660
went into Room 5 and survived.

663
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,670
What was originally an accident

664
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,620
soon became a scheme.

665
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,500
When Zhang Qingshi in Room 5

666
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,530
got up to use the bathroom, the door signs
were back to normal.

667
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,090
He turned around

668
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,590
and went back to Room 4 following the correct door sign,

669
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,040
and finally saw that his brother had been stabbed at the throat
with a hairpin and died.

670
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,570
His black gown and hammers on the floor

671
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,420
made him realize

672
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,020
that it was a disaster caused by his alcoholism and lust,

673
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:10,080
and that his brother had been made a scapegoat.

674
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:21,310
Thinking that the murderer wouldn't stop there
if he found out

675
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,300
that he'd got the wrong person,

676
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,100
while he himself was on his own now

677
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,340
and no match for his enemy,

678
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,740
he cut off and hid away his brother's head,

679
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,420
and pretended to be Zhang Qinghu,

680
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,420
both to protect himself

681
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,140
and find out the murderer.

682
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,260
The corpse being headless,

683
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,570
no one would know who it was that died.

684
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:39,920
Brother!

685
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,220
Zhang Qingshi,

686
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,950
am I right?

687
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,000
If you like,

688
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,140
I'll analyze it for you a bit further.

689
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,100
You've probably read too many novels, Mr. Sushou.

690
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,030
All this empty talk,

691
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,200
with absolutely no evidence.

692
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,180
Look, he's still in denial.

693
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,460
I'll go on then.

694
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,420
Outside the gate,

695
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,630
the boulder suddenly turned around and killed Duan Hai.

696
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,140
It required a lot of arm strength.

697
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,820
Zhang Qinghu wouldn't have been able to do it,

698
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,460
but only Zhang Qingshi could.

699
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:21,800
Look,

700
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,980
this fake freckle that you drew on your face

701
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,860
to impersonate Zhang Qinghu

702
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,350
is coming off.

703
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,260
Why are you so nervous?

704
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,910
I was just kidding.

705
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:37,900
Zhang Qingshi,

706
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,980
is Zhang Qinghu's head in your room?

707
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:44,090
So you're still alive!

708
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,540
Zhang Qingshi doesn't know how to use hidden weapons.

709
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,930
So these Plum Blossom Darts...

710
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,350
Mr. Ge, let's stop acting now.

711
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,380
Although you have internal injuries,

712
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:22,540
the crossbow at your cuff can still kill, can't it?

713
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,980
You found out that he was pretending to be his brother

714
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:31,140
and blackmailed him into cooperating with you.

715
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,180
So this weapon that you have now

716
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,130
is from Zhang Qingshi, isn't it?

717
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,540
I coerced Zhang Qingshi under the order of Baichuan Court

718
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,740
to eliminate you thieves.

719
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:44,380
The other detectives will soon surround this place.

720
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,060
If you want to live,

721
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,950
you'll have to rely on me to put in a good word for you.

722
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,120
I'd advise you to be good and let me go.

723
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,180
Under the order of Baichuan Court?

724
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:56,630
Your gown is lined with gray moire.

725
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,660
Only trainees who haven't passed the preliminary exam

726
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,420
dress like that.

727
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,140
I asked you to beg Master Bai for the antidote

728
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,300
and you agreed,

729
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,740
not knowing that Master Bai

730
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,900
is not at all good with poisons.

731
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:07,100
You are clearly a new trainee.

732
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:08,210
Also,

733
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,890
while these thieves are criminals,

734
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:10,820
their crimes are not capital.

735
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,900
But you killed them all.

736
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,420
You're so despicable and greedy.

737
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,940
Come back to Baichuan Court with me

738
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,630
and we'll let Fo, Bi, Bai, Shi interrogate you!

739
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,200
You hit him so hard.

740
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:29,710
Who are you exactly?

741
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:33,790
Detective at Baichuan Court,

742
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,400
Fang Duobing.

743
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,740
I'd advise you to forget it.

744
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,140
You don't get to decide

745
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,730
how the treasure here will be used.

746
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:22,810
Master,

747
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,420
I gathered people for you

748
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:25,900
and forced my friends to take poison,

749
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:28,270
it was all to help you enter this Yipin Tomb.

750
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:28,980
Master,

751
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,420
perhaps you could do me a small favor today

752
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:33,670
and kill these two people for me?

753
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:54,780
How dare you make a request?

754
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,720
So you're the one who's behind this?
