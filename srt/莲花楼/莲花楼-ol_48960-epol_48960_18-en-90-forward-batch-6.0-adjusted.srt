[Episode 18]

4
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:50,259
Yes.

5
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:53,390
Who are you?

6
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,920
You're such a hindrance.

7
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,400
I'll scratch you more.

8
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,200
Who are you?

9
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:19,870
Sister Qiao.

10
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,930
When people in the martial arts world talk about beauties,

11
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,250
we're tied.

12
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,910
Tell me.

13
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,570
Between us, who is prettier?

14
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:52,870
But I'm not here to compete with you.

15
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,790
I'm here to tell you

16
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Li Xiangyi

17
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,170
is still alive.

18
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,060
Where is he?

19
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,730
I also want to know where he is.

20
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,430
After going through the pear trees,

21
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,090
you'll see the Heaven Prison.

22
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,700
Miss Pear Tree Formation?

23
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:58,930
I've heard of it before.

24
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,130
What's the solution?

25
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,260
The Miss Pear Tree Formation

26
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,880
was based on the Later Heaven Bagua.

27
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,680
Yin and Yang were reversed here.

28
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,140
The Death Gate is in Qian.

29
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,400
The Life Gate is in Kun.

30
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,070
The Open Gate is in Gen.

31
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:05,900
Li Xiangyi.

32
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,820
Are you playing tricks on me?

33
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,680
Director Di.

34
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,980
If you hadn't explored the way,

35
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,800
you would have gone through the trees safely.

36
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,250
But that copper coin

37
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,850
made the Life Gate the Death Gate.

38
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,730
Do you think it can trap me?

39
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,280
Of course not.

40
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:24,920
But today,

41
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,360
all sects are here.

42
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,780
You can't make trouble easily.

43
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,120
He's in the direction of the Heaven Prison.

44
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,690
I'm leaving.

45
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,090
Di Feisheng is trapped in the Miss Pear Tree Formation.

46
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,240
The final boss voluntarily gave us a chance

47
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,080
to catch him.

48
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,400
The formation has been destroyed.

49
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,090
Be careful.

50
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,490
You're all old faces.

51
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:30,170
Unfortunately, all of you were defeated by me before.

52
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,790
We haven't seen each other for ten years.

53
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,930
I wonder why

54
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,030
you came here today?

55
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,570
I haven't seen you for ten years.

56
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,430
You're still bad at martial arts.

57
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,760
You have no right to ask me.

58
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,240
I'm not the number one in the martial arts world.

59
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,840
But if you want to disrupt

60
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,600
my wedding,

61
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,030
don't blame me for being rude.

62
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,590
Zijin.

63
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,810
Your martial art skills improved a lot.

64
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,580
I heard Weeping Guanyin

65
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,600
greatly helped you to cure your internal injuries.

66
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,130
But it's still hard for you to defeat all of us.

67
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,320
Let's fight him together.

68
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,650
Don't pull any punches.

69
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,720
I'll come again.

70
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:26,880
Bad news!

71
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,550
Bad news!

72
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,820
Something happened in the bridal chamber.

73
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,750
Ms. Qiao was poisoned and fainted.

74
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:41,690
Wanmian.

75
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,030
Wanmian.

76
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,230
Her hands are so cold.

77
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,980
[Iced Cicada. Cold Frost. Detoxify the poison. Use Yangzhouman.]

78
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,600
Iced Cicada.

79
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,300
Cold Frost.

80
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,050
Detoxify the poison.

81
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,380
Use Yangzhouman.

82
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,480
It's Jiao Liqiao.

83
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,290
She poisoned Sister Qiao.

84
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,370
Mr. Guan.

85
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,060
You're good at detoxifying poisons with golden needles.

86
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,270
You can definitely detoxify this poison.

87
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,170
Please save Wanmian.

88
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,840
I just examined Ms. Qiao.

89
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,660
Iced Cicada and Cold Frost

90
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,150
are two types of deadly poisons.

91
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,740
When the poison enters the viscera

92
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,660
through the mouth,

93
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,940
it can freeze the viscera in an hour.

94
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,730
There's no way to detoxify the poison.

95
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,340
You can only use the purest internal power of a man

96
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,420
to protect her viscera

97
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,250
and battle with the deadly poison.

98
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,910
After Iced Cicada is removed,

99
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,830
the patient will be safe.

100
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,860
The purest internal power of a man?

101
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,990
If the internal power which is used to resist cold

102
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,210
is strong,

103
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,310
it will hurt the extremely fragile viscera

104
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,970
which was caused by frostbite

105
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,690
and make the patient die soon.

106
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,410
The only purest internal power in this world which can do this

107
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,340
is Yangzhouman.

108
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,000
That's why it writes

109
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,590
that we should use Yangzhouman to detoxify the poison.

110
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,110
Otherwise, six hours later,

111
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,000
the attack of Iced Cicada will be unavoidable.

112
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,270
Ms. Qiao will freeze to death.

113
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,730
Yangzhouman?

114
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,460
That's Li Xiangyi's unique internal power.

115
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,700
If he could really save Wanmian,

116
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,100
I would kneel and beg him.

117
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,160
But Li Xiangyi is already dead.

118
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,960
What does Jiao Liqiao want?

119
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:30,690
You don't have to use internal power to save her.

120
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,490
May I examine Ms. Qiao?

121
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,970
It's none of your business.

122
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:36,800
Don't touch Wanmian.

123
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,730
Do you have another way to save her?

124
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,980
Actually, I've discussed a method of using poisons to detoxify poisons

125
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,180
with Mr. Guan before.

126
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,900
I only saw Bhante Wuliao, who's from Pudu Temple,

127
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,360
use this method to detoxify poisons before.

128
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,490
Bhante Wuliao

129
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,860
has verified this method before?

130
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,430
Of course the process is not simple.

131
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,430
The poison must be neutralized by another posion.

132
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,460
The cold caused by Iced Cicada can be resisted by Arsenic.

133
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,520
Use special medicinal soups to stop the toxicity of Arsenic.

134
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,920
And then use acupuncture

135
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,650
to send it directly into the viscera

136
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,580
and make it work.

137
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:20,650
But

138
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,430
it takes six hours

139
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,160
to take Bhante Wuliao here.

140
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,600
It's too late to invite him.

141
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,580
When Abbot was detoxifying poisons,

142
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,580
I was beside him.

143
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,830
I learnt a little from him.

144
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,410
If you trust me,

145
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,170
could you let me have a try?

146
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,410
Can it really be detoxified?

147
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,460
Do you know the consequences

148
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,060
if you talk through your hat?

149
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,560
It's a matter of life and death.

150
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,520
I'm serious.

151
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,340
But I need Cold Winter Plum Blossom,

152
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,580
Early Spring Prunus Salicina,

153
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,240
Late Summer Lotus,

154
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,180
and Early Autumn Chrysanthemum, 60 each.

155
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,950
Make Arsenic Medicinal Soup on a big fire

156
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,430
to help me detoxify the poison.

157
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,740
How can we find the things you mentioned

158
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,980
in a short time?

159
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,740
Don't fool us.

160
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,670
They can be collected from the pharmacies,

161
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,250
the fruit shops,

162
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,850
and the tea shops in the town.

163
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:04,980
Let's look for them together.

164
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,440
We can definitely find them.

165
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,450
I trust Mr. Li.

166
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,340
There's no need for you to go.

167
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,000
We can help.

168
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,210
I'll go and look for them.

169
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,170
Cure Ms. Qiao without worries.

170
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,300
Leave the rest to us.

171
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,160
Please prepare three buckets of hot water.

172
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,170
Ms. Qiao will use them when the poison is being detoxified.

173
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:33,690
Yes.

174
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,540
She was here for me.

175
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,880
You were involved in it because of me.

176
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:30,610
Mr. Li.

177
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,930
I've boiled the water.

178
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,140
How is Miss?

179
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,550
Can I open the door?

180
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,590
Mr. Li.

181
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,300
My Lord.

182
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,450
Situations of Mumian Villa have changed.

183
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,810
Xiangyi.

184
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,560
Xiangyi.

185
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,490
For her, you abused your true force

186
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,820
and was seriously injured.

187
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,770
Is it worth

188
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,570
risking your life?

189
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,090
How is she?

190
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,610
How's the situation inside?

191
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,680
Mr. Li keeps the door closed.

192
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,880
He hasn't responded.

193
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,180
Li Lianhua.

194
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,420
We've prepared what you need.

195
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,920
Mr. Guan and the others are making the medicinal soup.

196
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,520
How's the situation inside?

197
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,720
Li Lianhua.

198
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,690
What's going on?

199
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:21,710
Tell me.

200
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,070
If you don't want them to know,

201
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,020
I can help you.

202
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,310
What do you want to do?

203
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,120
What are you doing?

204
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:41,960
Don't come.

205
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,180
Di Feisheng, you…

206
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,220
If you want her to live,

207
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,240
come to the gazebo on the back hill after two hours

208
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,040
and bring King Xunming of Yama in exchange for her.

209
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,310
Wanmian.

210
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,180
Are you hurt?

211
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,740
Was it Di Feisheng who hurt you?

212
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,340
I'm fine.

213
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,170
It's just an attack of my illness.

214
00:16:59,170 --> 00:16:59,900
Go after him.

215
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,460
Why do you have an attack at this time?

216
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,690
Sit down.

217
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,370
How are you?

218
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,130
Where is your medicine?

219
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,130
It's in the Lotus Tower.

220
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,880
Go and get it for me now.

221
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,190
Go.

222
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,220
Go.

223
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,420
Okay. Hold on.

224
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,800
I'll be right back.

225
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,670
When you have an attack of Bicha Poison,

226
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,410
it feels as if there are insects eating your bones.

227
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,770
The poison will eventually pierce your internal organs and the marrow of your head.

228
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,300
At first, you'll temporarily become deaf and blind.

229
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,760
Then you'll gradually lose all five senses,

230
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,330
become crazy, and die.

231
00:17:58,850 --> 00:17:59,310
My Lord.

232
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,440
The toxins in her body have already been removed.

233
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,940
She's still not awake because her acupuncture point for sleep was hit before.

234
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,000
I didn't expect you

235
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,870
to cover for Li Xiangyi.

236
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,660
Li Xiangyi still owes me a competition.

237
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,580
I can't let him die easily.

238
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,700
Besides, our competition

239
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,870
doesn't need such dirty tricks.

240
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,980
Jiao Liqiao did this behind your back

241
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,670
because she found Li Xiangyi is still alive

242
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,960
and wanted to smoke him out.

243
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,210
Why does Jiao Liqiao

244
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,710
care whether or not Li Xiangyi is dead?

245
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,970
She and I are not on the same side anymore.

246
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,410
Go back and keep an eye on her.

247
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,410
Check how many people in the Jinyuan Alliance

248
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,110
can still be used.

249
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,300
Yes.

250
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,510
Di Feisheng.

251
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,900
I've brought the person you want.

252
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,460
I just want Wanmian to be safe.

253
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,000
The poison has been detoxified.

254
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,890
She's fine now.

255
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:01,820
Wanmian.

256
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:02,790
Wanmian.

257
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:07,990
Wanmian.

258
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,350
Xiangyi.

259
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:12,870
Xiangyi.

260
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,030
Come.

261
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,780
This way, please.

262
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,600
He said he has heart disease before.

263
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,140
I didn't expect the disease to be so scary.

264
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,620
He's still unconscious after taking the medicine.

265
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,260
The doctor didn't find anything wrong after examining him,

266
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,650
so he couldn't prescribe medicine.

267
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:25,090
Guan.

268
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,770
Please examine him.

269
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,860
I thought it's because you have grudges against him

270
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,030
that you always target him.

271
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,830
Why are you so worried about him?

272
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,820
I'm just angry with him.

273
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,290
His life matters.

274
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,220
Mr. Guan,

275
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,160
please examine Mr. Li.

276
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,010
Didn't I tell you to rest well?

277
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,640
But I'm worried about Mr. Li.

278
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,370
His pulse is hard to feel.

279
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,880
Why is it so strange?

280
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,690
His pulse is thin and soft.

281
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:19,900
He's quite weak.

282
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,220
His Qi and blood have dissipated.

283
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,550
They can't be regained.

284
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:24,580
The pulse

285
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,730
is insufficient.

286
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,960
What do you mean?

287
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,600
Is it serious, Mr. Guan?

288
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,210
His Qi and blood are insufficient.

289
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,050
It's caused by his congenital heart disease.

290
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,750
Although his life is not in danger,

291
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,130
he should stop worrying

292
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,710
and rest well.

293
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,480
Only in this way can he be fine.

294
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,180
It's good to hear he's fine.

295
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,130
I was poisoned with Iced Cicada.

296
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:10,730
Jiao Liqiao said only Yangzhouman can save me.

297
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,100
Then...

298
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,660
The Jinyuan Alliance was just creating panic

299
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,040
because they wanted to put pressure on us.

300
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,130
Di Feisheng threatened me with your life.

301
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,730
He asked me to let King Xunming of Yama go.

302
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:20,550
King Xunming of Yama

303
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,860
is much less important than you.

304
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,790
I did as he asked.

305
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,140
Di Feisheng detoxified the poison?

306
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:27,410
Of course.

307
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:31,110
Li Lianhua claimed that he could detoxify the poison.

308
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,020
I believed him

309
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,350
and let him mess around.

310
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:36,730
Fortunately,

311
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,850
the Jinyuan Alliance wanted something.

312
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,020
Except Di Feisheng,

313
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,000
no one has this ability.

314
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:51,800
But

315
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,260
today is our wedding day.

316
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,110
I failed to protect you.

317
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,040
I'm fine now.

318
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,210
We expected that the Jinyuan Alliance would come to provoke us.

319
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,220
But

320
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:09,730
they did this

321
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,420
only for King Xunming of Yama?

322
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:17,940
Wanmian.

323
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,720
Just now...

324
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,790
I mean

325
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,440
no matter it's the Jinyuan Alliance or anyone else,

326
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,480
I won't let them have chances

327
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,960
to hurt you again.

328
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,770
I have something to discuss

329
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,370
with Ji Hanfo and the others.

330
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:41,430
You're still weak.

331
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,700
Get more rest.

332
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,850
I'm here to tell you

333
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,110
Li Xiangyi

334
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,290
is still alive.

335
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,540
Xiangyi.

336
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:06,650
Yangzhouman.

337
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,720
I have the internal power, Yangzhouman, in my body.

338
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,120
I've seen Xiangyi.

339
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:24,860
It's not a dream.

340
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,690
How is that possible?

341
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,580
Your favorite osmanthus cakes.

342
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,190
I queued up for a long time.

343

You tied the knot yourself,

right?

345
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,690
It's different from the knots tied by others.

346
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,890
I can't even untie it.

347
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,360
Why are they

348
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:57,330
the same?

349

It's you.

I'm so stupid.

351
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,140
You're alive.

How are you now?

356
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,460
I'm fine.

357
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,830
I just feel a little dizzy.

358
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,270
I feel much better.

359
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,820
Mr. Guan gave you a prescription.

360
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,680
Fang Duobing went to get the medicine.

Mr. Guan said

372
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,210
he has a method.

373
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,250
He'll cure me.

Don't worry.

375
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,760
By the way, Mr. Li,

376
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,620
I received a letter from my grandfather today.

377
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,690
He wrote that he didn't find the information about the ice and the script.

378
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:54,280
But the incense you got

379
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,950
is Nanyin Incense for sure.

380
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,480
Is the effect of Nanyin Incense

381
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,620
the same as what Miss Zhiyu said?

382
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,840
This is the second magical technique of Nanyin.

383
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,300
The knockout incense was made by Wuxin Huai.

384
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,060
Burning it

385
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:10,360
can make people fall into a pleasant illusion,

386
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,390
lose the feeling of pain,

387
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,520
and be manipulated.

388
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,740
They don't struggle even if they're being peeled.

389
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,460
If a large amount of Nanyin Incense are used

390
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,460
to deal with people who practice martial artists,

391
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,980
they will ruin the martial artist skills

392
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,230
which those people practice.

393
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,760
Who on earth used Wuxin Huai

394
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,030
to deal with my senior?

395
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:27,120
If King Xunming of Yama of the Jinyuan Alliance had intended to kill my senior,

396
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,880
he wouldn't have used it.

397
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:32,370
But

398
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:34,480
Nanyin is no longer in existence.

399
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,340
There is less and less Wuxin Huai.

400
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,600
The incense is quite rare and precious.

401
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,380
Not everyone

402
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,020

403
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,150
Nanyin Incense.

404
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,370
By the way, Mr. Li,

405
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:46,740
speaking of Nanyin,

406
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,460
when I met Jiao Liqiao today,

407
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,590
she was speaking Nanyin dialect.

408
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,690
Although I don't know the meaning,

409
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,510
I'm sure that was Nangyin dialect.

410
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,820
My grandfather learnt it before.

411
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,590
She doesn't know I heard it clearly.

412
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,410
Otherwise, she'll kill me.

also to urge me to go home.

But Mr. Li,

In three days,

423
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,620
your grandfather will know

424
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,870
what happened today.

if you want to recover soon,

428

you have to go home and recuperate.

00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,080
You're not like

515
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,700
who you used to be anymore.

516
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:47,970
What has happened

517
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,310
in the past ten years?

518
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,950
When I fell into the sea that year,

519
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:02,240
I was hung on the ship of Di Feisheng.

520
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:06,190
I didn't sink to the bottom of the sea.

521
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,390
I went back to the Sigu Sect before.

522
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,030
I also saw the letter you wrote to me before.

523
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:12,860
Later,

524
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,670
I just wanted to live a different life.

525
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,139
No.

526
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,570
That's not what I meant.

527
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,139
Is it because you hated me for breaking up with you

528
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:25,600
that you left?

529
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:33,639
That's not true.

530
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,090
Mian.

531
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,420
I suddenly figured it out.

532
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,530
The bossy and arrogant

533
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,870
Li Xiangyi

534
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,190
is indeed dead.

535
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:47,980
No.

536
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,500
That's not what I meant

537
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,100
when I wrote you that letter.

538
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,770
He's the light that people pursue.

539
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,460
His brilliance will also hurt people's hearts.

540
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,130
He's also the one who I can never catch up with.

541
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,830
But how could it be his fault?

542
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,770
Do you know how much I regret it?

543
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,340
During these ten years,

544
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,800
I've been dreaming of you.

545
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,740
I dreamt that the moment you stepped out of the door,

546
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,230
I tried my best to pull you and stop you.

547
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,990
But when I woke up,

548
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,270
I realized there's nothing reversible.

549
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:22,850
Since you came back,

550
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,400
why didn't you tell us?

551
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,870
It's been so long.

552
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:32,760
I'm tired.

553
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,740
I just want to be free.

554
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,250
Then why did you

555
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,570
appear at my wedding?

556
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,240
I've promised you before

557
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,120
that I would give you the sweetest

558
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,260
wedding candies.

559
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,680
In the past,

560
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,920
I've broken my promise to you many times.

561
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,890
At least

562
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,580
I must keep this promise.

563
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,200
In Pudu Temple,

564
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,210
if you hadn't told me he is dead,

565
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,210
I wouldn't have married Zijin.

566
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,320
It's not beaucse you married Zijin that you're sad.

567
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,000
It's because you don't regret marrying Zijin.

568
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:33,830
Xiangyi.

569
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,910
You're still...

570
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,520
You're still the same.

571
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:45,030
You can kill someone with one sentence.

572
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,340
Mian.

573
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,640
You like Zijin

574
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:52,650
and rely on Zijin.

575
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:53,930
It's not wrong.

576
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,860
You don't love someone anymore.

577
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:00,770
You don't have to blame yourself for it.

578
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:02,540
Then...

579
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,340
Don't you hate me?

580
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,060
Yes.

581
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,710
I hated you before.

582
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,050
In the early years, I hated everyone.

583
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,940
Then I figured it out.

584
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,330
It was my fault.

585
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,680
I was too conceited.

586
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,700
I acted willfully.

587
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,970
Why should Li Xiangyi be invincible

588
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,240
and do everything successfully?

589
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,500
Mian.

590
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,790
When we met and knew each other,

591
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,930
I was young and ignorant.

592
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,800
I also didn't know

593
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,460
what our relationship was.

594
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,220
What do you mean?

595
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,440
What do you mean?

596
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:05,940
You mean

597
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,400
you never loved me?

598
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:15,340
We were both young at that time.

599
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,290
Don't take what we said seriously.

600
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,440
Mian.

601
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,630
Time flies.

602
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:25,970
You and I are no longer young.

603
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:27,810
Forget

604
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:31,950
what should be forgotten.

605
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:37,760
I saved you

606
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,000
because of our friendship.

607
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,660
Don't get me wrong.

608
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,000
You know me well.

609
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,180
I hate

610
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,960
being involved in many things.

611
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,220
The world is vast.

612
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,830
Living a life of freedom

613
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:56,660
is what I want.

614
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,590
Please

615
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,550
don't let others know I'm still alive.

616
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,030
I really hope

617
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:11,560
you and Zijin

618
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,940
can grow old together

619
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:17,490
and love each other forever.

620
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:22,210
We haven't seen each other for ten years.

621
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,940
Don't you have anything else to say to me?

622
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:31,790
What else should I say?

623
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:34,210
Ten years is a very long time.

624
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:35,330
Mian.

625
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:37,030
Today,

626
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,900
we should say goodbye.

627
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,370
Live the life you want.

628
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:47,940
Okay.

629
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:53,350
Okay.

630
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:08,000
Let me ask you again.

631
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:12,470
Is Li Xiangyi really not coming back?

632
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,610
No.

633
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:40,510
You like candies so much.

634
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,890
They're not what masters like.

635
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:43,720
Who says masters can't eat candies?

636
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,530
At our wedding,

637
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:48,250
I'll let everyone eat this kind of candy.

638
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,510
Is it delicious?

639
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,270
Not bad.

640
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:55,570
Eat one more.

641
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,490
You're busy with those big things every day.

642
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:14,780
You always let me look at your back.

643
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,840
I'm really tired.

644
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,580
Something really happened to the Feiying Gang.

645
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,110
Mian.

646
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,680
I need to go out now.

647
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:30,200
By the way, Mian,

648
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,740
what did you say just now?

649
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,420
Forget it.

650
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:35,190
Let's talk when I'm back.

651
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:40,060
The world is vast.

652
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,980
I can't keep you.

653
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,840
I'm tired.

654
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:51,130
I respect you, but I can't accompany you anymore.

655
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,090
I can't love you anymore.

656
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,040
I wrote this letter to say goodbye to you.

657
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,100
I wish you good health

658
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,070
and a happy life.

659
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,350
I hope you can fulfill your dreams.

660
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:06,540
Mian.

661
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,970
You want to die without letting everyone know.

662
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:28,970
I don't understand why you're pathetic and stubborn.

663
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:30,310
You scared me.

664
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,390
Why didn't you walk through

665
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:33,340
the front door?

666
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,990
Since we have chosen our own paths,

667
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:37,890
why should I bother them?

668
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,070
I don't understand.

669
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:40,890
But I respect your persistence.

670
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,220
No need, Director Di.

671
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,290
Just don't make trouble for me.

672
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,460
I didn't let Jiao Liqiao poison you.

673
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,190
I know.

674
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:13,810
You

675
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:16,580
killed a large amount of people.

676
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:17,510
But you do things

677
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,710
above board.

678
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:21,130
You don't like to argue.

679
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:21,940
I

680
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,880
just wanted to confirm it.

681
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:25,880
Compared to who you used to be,

682
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,540
you're much more cunning now.

683
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:30,770
You tried to cover for me this time.

684
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,420
I owe you a favor.

685
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:38,390
Why did you bring him here?

686
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,820
Don't you always blame the Jinyuan Alliance

687
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,220
for killing your senior?

688
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,410
My Lord asked me to explain to you.

689
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:46,590
Ten years ago,

690
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,700
I, King Bai of Fire, and Four-faced Qingzun

691
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:50,430
[King Xunming of Yama]

692
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,650
received a challenge letter from Shan Gudao.

693
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:55,120
Of course we didn't think he could defeat us.

694
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,920
But when we arrived at the place,

695
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:59,700
we found that Shan Gudao had already died.

696
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,450
It was my senior who challenged you?
