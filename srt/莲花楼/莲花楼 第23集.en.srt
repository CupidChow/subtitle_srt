4
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,720
Come out or we'll set the cave on fire!

5
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,490
Set the fire.

6
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:57,840
Hold on.

7
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:58,910
Hold on.

8
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,650
Miss Qing'er?

9
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,220
Where is Master?

10
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,480
Yu Louchun?

11
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,120
How would I know?

12
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,370
You're his guard.

13
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,440
You stole treasures from Master Yu's room.

14
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,380
Where did you hide them?

15
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,560
What do you mean?

16
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,480
You're confusing me.

17
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,070
You sneaked out to hide in a cave.

18
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,870
So stop playing dumb.

19
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:42,260
I came out for a walk and got lost.

20
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,650
I didn't steal anything.

21
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,500
A walk?

22
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,110
You're dressed as a man.

23
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,290
You didn't need to disguise yourself for a walk.

24
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,360
That's right.

25
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,730
Mr. Fang asked me to dress like this.

26
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,480
Mr. Fang?

27
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,590
She left with you last night

28
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,250
and you asked her to dress like a man today?

29
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:08,840
Miss Qing'er.

30
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,640
Yu Louchun is perhaps dead.

31
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,140
No one can threaten you now.

32
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,140
You can be honest with us.

33
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,140
Yu Louchun got finished off?

34
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,610
That's great!

35
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:20,860
Then I'll be frank.

36
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,270
I dressed like a man to escape from the Girls' Mansion at night.

37
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,180
There were too many guards at the gate

38
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,950
so I decided to hide here for now.

39
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,260
I didn't steal anything.

40
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,520
You did away with Yu Louchun?

41
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:34,910
I…

42
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,290
You're quite something.

43
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,190
This is no time for jokes.

44
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,210
You two seem familiar.

45
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,350
Didn't you just meet yesterday?

46
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,320
We hit it off. So what?

47
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,100
Aren't you looking for the suspect?

48
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:53,970
Well,

49
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,780
Yu Louchun's arm and leg

50
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,329
were cut off by an edged weapon.

51
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,170
After we entered the Girls' Mansion,

52
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,050
all our edged weapons were taken away.

53
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,860
So the prime suspect

54
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,520
is no one else but you, Guard Xin.

55
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,830
My sword has the shape of a pine needle.

56
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,850
It's very narrow

57
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,630
and can only be used for piercing.

58
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,600
It would've been broken if I had used it to chop up the body.

59
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,000
How could it be me?

60
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,420
Look.

61
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:28,660
There are body parts.

62
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:33,659
He…

63
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,540
He…

64
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,400
Isn't he the head guard who brought us here yesterday?

65
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,600
He got chopped into so many pieces.

66
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,220
It's brutal.

67
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,409
Brutal!

68
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,800
Things are complicated now.

69
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,390
His machete is not in its sheath

70
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,500
and his body is near your hiding spot.

71
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,260
You must've snatched his machete and killed him!

72
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,680
I just happened to be hiding here.

73
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,890
I didn't kill him.

74
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,740
It's fine that you wouldn't confess.

75
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,570
After I pull your fingernails out one by one,

76
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,020
you'll tell us everything.

77
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,340
How dare you!

78
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:06,960
Do you know who I am?

79
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,440
I'm the princess.

80
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,240
If you trifle with me,

81
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,460
I'll wipe out your whole family!

82
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,750
Princess?

83
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,120
I don't care even if you're the dowager empress.

84
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,300
Guard Xin, are you going to

85
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,520
torture her into confessing in front of a detective of the Baichuan Court?

86
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,180
Help me.

87
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,350
I'll reward you generously.

88
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,659
You don't need to come up with such a ridiculous lie

89
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:33,380
to get my help.

90
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:33,900
I…

91
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,510
You keep covering for her.

92
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,510
Are you afraid I'll get something out of her?

93
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:38,900
I'm not covering for her.

94
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,610
She doesn't know martial arts.

95
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,150
Even if you gave her a sword,

96
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,320
how could she kill Yu Louchun?

97
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,720
She couldn't but you could.

98
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,180
You two slept in the same room last night

99
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,330
and you're so protective of her now.

100
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,100
Maybe you're her accomplice!

101
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:50,730
Wait.

102
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,300
I'm curious about something.

103
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,210
If they conspired together,

104
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,400
how did they get up the Kanyun Peak?

105
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,350
-Exactly.
-Exactly.

106
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,350
This wheel is so heavy.

107
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,050
Did they fly up there with the flying skill?

108
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,340
Is there anyone in this world

109
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,220
with such excellent flying skill?

110
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,100
Fei?

111
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,060
There you are.

112
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,550
Su Xiaoyong is too noisy.

113
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,910
I'm afraid I can't help killing her.

114
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,210
I prefer to stay with you.

115
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,710
How did you get up here?

116
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,480
Flying skill.

117
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:24,780
I searched peak after peak.

118
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:25,960
It took me some effort

119
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,070
but the singing arrow just now helped a lot.

120
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,290
Perfect timing.

121
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,080
Li Lianhua.

122
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,460
You just said

123
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,270
that no one has such excellent flying skill in the world.

124
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,770
This place is thousands of feet high.

125
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,590
He can get to the Girls' Mansion

126
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,300
and can definitely go up the Kanyun Peak.

127
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,230
You guys killed them!

128
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,920
It's just a misunderstanding.

129
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,000
Let me introduce him.

130
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,720
He's Fei from the Nanhai Sect.

131
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,980
He's my servant.

132
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,940
He's got great flying skill,

133
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,190
but he's a weird guy

134
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,650
and never picks up fights.

135
00:06:59,030 --> 00:06:59,630
Yeah.

136
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,510
This guy called Fei can fly wherever he wants.

137
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,070
He didn't need to snatch the head guard's machete to kill him.

138
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,100
He could bring one up here.

139
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,570
Miss Qing'er.

140
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,000
You're not helping.

141
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,840
What's on Fei's back?

142
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,250
My machete.

143
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,300
A big machete it is.

144
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,490
His machete is a bit special.

145
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,970
It's made of special material.

146
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,210
The cut it leaves is very different from those on the severed limbs.

147
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:28,980
Fei.

148
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,730
Wield your machete.

149
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:31,990
No.

150
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,810
Just wield it once.

151
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,600
I'll make dinner for you tonight.

152
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,750
Your cooking sucks.

153
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,820
What makes you think you can bribe me with that?

154
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,730
Forget it, Li Lianhua.

155
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,530
Your servant won't do it.

156
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,190
You don't know that.

157
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:48,880
Come closer.

158
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:56,940
Sure.

159
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:58,890
He agreed?

160
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,900
What did you say?

161
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,350
One secret for three favors.

162
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:04,830
I…

163
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,830
Young Master Shi.

164
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,520
You're an expert from the Weapon Valley.

165
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,130
Why don't you check the cut on the trunk?

166
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,200
Fei's machete is double-edged.

167
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,980
The cut is indeed different

168
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,059
from those on Yu Louchun.

169
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,940
He's so powerful.

170
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,080
Who did he train under?

171
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,480
I've never seen such swordsmanship.

172
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:42,940
That doesn't matter.

173
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,180
What matters is that Fei is not a suspect.

174
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:45,620
Right?

175
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,360
Then who is it?

176
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,930
Do we have no clues at all?

177
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,900
The clue has been there all the time.

178
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,740
The body was put back together.

179
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:01,810
Look.

180
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,590
That seems to be a hash mark.

181
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,290
Why are you shaking?

182
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,220
I think of a rumor.

183
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:28,290
Rumor?

184
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,920
A swordsman once died violently in the Fragrant Mountain

185
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,690
and turned into a vengeful ghost,

186
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,700
killing people in the Fragrant Mountain all day long.

187
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,680
He was called the Machete Ghost.

188
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,480
This is his Hash Slash.

189
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,360
The Machete Ghost was a real person.

190
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,170
He was good with a machete

191
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,520
but went missing seven years ago.

192
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,240
Look at the cuts on the head guard.

193
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,720
They're rough but were indeed left

194
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,950
by the Hash Slash which made the Machete Ghost

195
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,060
famous.

196
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,700
Were Yu Louchun's limbs

197
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,260
cut off by the Hash Slash too?

198
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,560
Then I'm afraid he's already dead.

199
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,170
He just lost one arm and one leg.

200
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,150
Master still stands a chance of living.

201
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:05,870
He's dead.

202
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,710
What did you say?

203
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:08,970
Follow me.

204
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,440
It's Yu Louchun's torso.

205
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,720
He really died.

206
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,080
Putting these body parts together,

207
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,270
we don't need to find the rest of his body

208
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,850
to recognize the Hash Slash.

209
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,360
[Kill the evil and send them back to hell.]

210
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,300
The Machete Ghost! It's the Machete Ghost!

211
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,190
Kill the evil

212
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,360
and send them back to hell.

213
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,960
Do ghosts really exist?

214
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,280
The guy was killed,

215
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,700
but not necessarily by a ghost.

216
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,320
What do you mean?

217
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,640
Don't they sell weapons in the underworld?

218
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,240
Fei means

219
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,530
if the murderer were a ghost,

220
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,840
why did he snatch a sword before the killings?

221
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,680
So the Machete Ghost can only be a human.

222
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,260
Mr. Fang and Physician Li solved many tricky cases.

223
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,220
In your opinion,

224
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,000
what should we do now?

225
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,480
The drawbridge of the Girls' Mansion hasn't been set down.

226
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,180
Few people's flying skill

227
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,460
is as great as Fei's.

228
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,420
So the suspect must be among us.

229
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,460
First,

230
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,070
let's narrow it down.

231
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,800
The girls in the Girls' Mansion seem the least suspicious.

232
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,990
Why?

233
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,890
Yu Louchun's arm

234
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,720
was found in the Guanri Pavilion.

235
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,350
The Guanri Pavilion is outside the Girls' Mansion.

236
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,750
The girls are banned from going out

237
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,620
so they couldn't put the arm there.

238
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,030
That's why they're the least suspicious.

239
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,690
Next, let's turn our focus

240
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,630
to Guard Xin and the other guards.

241
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,280
Before you came here,

242
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,480
everything was fine.

243
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,280
The murderer must be among the guests.

244
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:52,750
May I say something?

245
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,020
The head guard was not allowed in the Girls' Mansion

246
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,360
but died in the Girls' Mansion.

247
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,240
Guard Xin.

248
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,900
Don't you find that worth investigating?

249
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,980
The head guard was a peeper.

250
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,980
He sneaked in every year during Mountains Red

251
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,330
to spy on the guests and girls at night.

252
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,800
He never hurt anybody

253
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,600
so I just let him be.

254
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,160
Are you satisfied with my answer?

255
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,930
Yes, yes.

256
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,220
That means

257
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,390
as long as Guard Xin turns a blind eye,

258
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:27,900
those guards

259
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,900
can enter the Girls' Mansion freely, right?

260
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,210
Yes.

261
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,570
Here is my second question.

262
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,670
The wheel at the foot of the Kanyun Peak

263
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,230
is so heavy that Guard Xin

264
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,610
is the only one in the Girls' Mansion who can spin it

265
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,500
without anyone's help, right?

266
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,540
Yes.

267
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,010
Good.

268
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,860
The murderer needed to spin the wheel

269
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,250
and got up the peak in the cane basket for the killings.

270
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,320
It's almost impossible

271
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,980
to do those two things at the same time.

272
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,240
So the murderer had an accomplice.

273
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,550
Other than you two,

274
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,050
are there other guests who are acquaintances?

275
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,620
We don't know that.

276
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,120
What I want to say

277
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,500
is that we can't know

278
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,810
who may know whom personally.

279
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,050
Maybe

280
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:13,820
one of the guards

281
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,240
knows one of the guests.

282
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,400
The guards would in no way kill Master.

283
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,120
Why?

284
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,680
Guard Xin.

285
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,530
You've been acting weird.

286
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,830
So have the other guards.

287
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,780
You seem to care more about the treasures

288
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,110
than Yu Louchun.

289
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,420
If you can't prove yourself innocent,

290
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,610
you'll be in a dangerous situation.

291
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,240
I and all the other guards in the Girls' Mansion

292
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,770
would never kill Yu Louchun

293
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,910
because he poisoned us all

294
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,850
with the Loyal Potion.

295
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,740
We must take the antidote every month

296
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,810
or our entrails will melt into blood

297
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,580
and we'll die in excruciating pain.

298
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,610
The antidote is hidden in the secret room.

299
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,700
The day we should take the antidote this month

300
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,180
is tomorrow.

301
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,880
So if you can't get the antidote by tomorrow,

302
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:20,610
you'll die?

303
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,600
Yes.

304
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,980
I beg you to save us.

305
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:24,830
Otherwise,

306
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,110
the guards may be driven mad

307
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,000
by the unbearable pain before they die

308
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,090
and hurt you guys.

309
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,790
Are you begging them or threatening them?

310
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:34,440
Guard Xin.

311
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,510
Get up.

312
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,940
I'm a detective of the Baichuan Court.

313
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,500
We'll find out

314
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,010
whether you're innocent or not.

315
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,750
I'll find it out with you.

316
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,190
Fang Duobing.

317
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,920
We can use

318
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:46,930
Miss Qing'er's help.

319
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,780
She's familiar with this place.

320
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,640
From now on,

321
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,480
except for Physician Li and Mr. Fang,

322
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,010
no one is allowed to leave the Girls' Mansion

323
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,790
until the murderer is found.

324
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,850
Don't blame me for being rude if you violate it.

325
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,910
How did the murderer get up the Kanyun Peak?

326
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,490
Fei can fly.

327
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,930
Maybe the murderer flew up there.

328
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,770
Few people can be as good at the flying skill

329
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,560
as Fei.

330
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,490
By the way, where is Fei?

331
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,400
Fei doesn't care about all this

332
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:34,840
and is probably sleeping.

333
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,330
Maybe the murderer climbed up the rope.

334
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,830
This rope has oil on it

335
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,490
and is very slippery.

336
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,060
Climbing it

337
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,420
is even harder than flying.

338
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:52,810
I got it.

339
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,280
This is how the murderer went up the peak.

340
00:15:58,730 --> 00:15:59,370
Vine?

341
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,430
It's burnt.

342
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,050
Tie a slipknot with the vine

343
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,580
and hang it under the cane basket.

344
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,130
When the cane basket reached the peak,

345
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,080
the knot was untied by the hook at the foot of the mountain

346
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,890
and the vine was put down.

347
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,940
The murderer went up and down through the vine

348
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,410
and then burned it

349
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,400
to wipe all the traces.

350
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,620
With the vine,

351
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,690
he wouldn't need anyone's help

352
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,840
to go up and down the Kanyun Peak.

353
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,210
But it's conspicuous

354
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,480
to hang a vine under the basket.

355
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,160
Why didn't Xin Jue notice it?

356
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,880
Unless he's the one who did it.

357
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,370
He's the Machete Ghost.

358
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,060
But Xin Jue uses a sword.

359
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,650
Who says the Machete Ghost can't use a sword?

360
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,260
I have another question.

361
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,140
Why did he dump the body parts in plain sight?

362
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,860
To become a hero and set an example.

363
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,570
The Machete Ghost is rumored

364
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,850
to be a ghost hero.

365
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,020
That guard said

366
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,300
the Machete Ghost killed innocent people.

367
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,540
Why is he a hero?

368
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,530
Those guards are afraid of him,

369
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,120
but the girls in the Girls' Mansion

370
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,580
all look forward to his coming.

371
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,060
Why?

372
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,560
It's said that many years ago,

373
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,099
the Machete Ghost's wife was abducted here.

374
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,290
He came to find her but got killed.

375
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:09,890
Then

376
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,680
something very unusual happened.

377
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,060
Tell us.

378
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,890
The mountain god appeared.

379
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,220
He pitied the Machete Ghost

380
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:23,589
and used his magic

381
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:25,400
to turn the Machete Ghost into a real ghost

382
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,300
who has been upholding justice since then.

383
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,520
I see.

384
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,800
Miss Qing'er.

385
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,800
Save your bedtime story for another day.

386
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,150
What we're looking for now

387
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,350
is the Machete Ghost in the real world.

388
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,090
The Machete Ghost is in the real world.

389
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:40,660
His wife Luo Hongyan

390
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,260
was once cooped up in the Girls' Mansion.

391
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:44,960
Miss Qing'er.

392
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,760
Did you know her?

393
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,170
No.

394
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,310
I arrived here too late.

395
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,740
She died a few years ago.

396
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,250
Then how did you know about her?

397
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,430
The ledger.

398
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,220
Yu Louchun recorded all his incomes

399
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,930
and expenses these years on his ledger.

400
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,430
Luo Hongyan's name is on it.

401
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,810
So, Miss Qing'er,

402
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,210
do you have the ledger?

403
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:02,980
Of course.

404
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:04,500
I have it.

405
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,060
I planned to use it to kill Yu Louchun,

406
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,930
but someone did it before I could.

407
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,660
Then show it to us.

408
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,760
Now you think I'm useful?

409
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:19,960
Yes, yes, yes.

410
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,730
Miss Qing'er, you're so smart.

411
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,500
It was a brilliant idea to steal the ledger.

412
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,750
I'm so impressed.

413
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,040
Come with me.

414
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:34,650
[Qunfang House]

415
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,190
What is this place?

416
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,480
This is where the girls live.

417
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,160
I've forgotten that it's the laundry day.

418
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:46,970
Wait for me here.

419
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:47,750
I'll be right back.

420
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,090
Here is the ledger.

421
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,270
Why does it stink?

422
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,030
Yu Louchun hit the ceiling after his ledger was lost.

423
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,130
I had to hide it.

424
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,940
Where did you hide it?

425
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:07,970
Under the chamber pot.

426
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,260
Don't be so picky.

427
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:10,600
Take it.

428
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,460
Luo Hongyan's name

429
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,580
is mentioned in an entry eight years ago.

430
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:25,780
Here it is.

431
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,000
Luo Hongyan, female,

432
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,280
23 years old,

433
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,740
bought with 20 bags of opium.

434
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,660
Luo Hongyan was sold here

435
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,070
just for 20 bags of opium.

436
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:37,370
Dongfang Hao?

437
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,700
Dongfang Hao sold Luo Hongyan here.

438
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,290
Who else would trade girls for opium?

439
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,650
He sold me here too.

440
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,840
I can never forget

441
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,040
the stink of opium on him.

442
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,420
If the Machete Ghost aims at revenging his wife,

443
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:52,840
his next target

444
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,250
will be Dongfang Hao.

445
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,050
Let's go.

446
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,060
Dongfang Hao

447
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,380
is already dead.

448
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,050
The Hash Slash.

449
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,730
We're too late.

450
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,650
He killed Dongfang Hao in this room.

451
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,460
That's a very useful clue.

452
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,030
How could this happen?

453
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,070
He's dead.

454
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,510
Dongfang Hao is dead too?

455
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,230
What happened?

456
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,610
Does the Machete Ghost want to kill us all

457
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,800
instead of just Yu Louchun?

458
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:42,950
That question

459
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,030
can only be answered by the Machete Ghost.

460
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,490
Have you found him, Physician Li?

461
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,250
Everyone,

462
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,100
can I have a smell of you?

463
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,660
You can smell out the murderer?

464
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,540
You're a great physician.

465
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,830
Do you also have an incredible sense of smell?

466
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,250
Dongfang Hao's room stinks of opium.

467
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,680
Killing him in the room

468
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,220
would make the murderer smell of it too.

469
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,000
So we just need to have a smell of you.

470
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,840
Please hold out your hands.

471

What do you mean, Physician Li?

474
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,810
I don't smell like opium.

475
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,490
That's what gave you away.

476
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,270
We've been running around the whole morning for the case.

477

Guard Xin, it's amazing

478
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,880
that you don't have a sweaty smell

479
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,320
and even smell like soap.

480
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,050
I just took a shower and changed.

481
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,160
What's wrong with that?

482
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,410
There's nothing wrong with that.

483
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:26,990
But your master just died

484
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,790
and the antidote was stolen.

485
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,790
You shouldn't be in the mood for showering and changing.

486

If I'm right,

you're the Machete Ghost, aren't you?

You saw my sword yesterday.

It's in the shape of a pine needle.

490

Why are you still suspecting me?

491

512
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,310
and wanted to kill Yu Louchun.

513
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,680
But I didn't kill him.

514
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,750
Seven years ago, my wife was sold to the Girls' Mansion.

515
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,170
I came to find her and was told that she killed herself.

516
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,780
Yu Louchun was skilled in martial arts

517
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,790
and took me down.

518
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:33,770
To stay alive,

519
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:36,260
I took the Loyal Potion and became his guard.

520
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:38,410
I'm…

521
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,150
I'm a coward who couldn't protect my wife

522
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,160
and became my enemy's lackey to stay alive.

523
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,050
How could I have the courage to kill Yu Louchun?

524
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,470
What a touching story.

525
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,740
But you changed your clothes

526
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,840
because you killed Dongfang Hao, didn't you?

527
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,120
When I saw the words written in blood on the tree this morning,

528
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:55,780
I was worried that someone might frame me.

529
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:56,940
When I came back,

530
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,320
I saw those treasures and the machete.

531
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,100
The machete was stained with opium powder

532
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,990
so I thought it must have something to do with Dongfang Hao.

533
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:06,550
When I got to his room, he was already dead.

534
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,740
Only then did I realize that I was set up.

535
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,850
I hurried back to shower and change.

536
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,320
Before I could put these things away,

537
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,520
I was called out.

538
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,200
I…

539
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,000
Xin Jue, come out!

540
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,090
What's this?

541
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,580
I saw you hiding something

542
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,100
outside the door just now.

543
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,500
I dug it out and it's actually the antidote.

544
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,110
You killed Yu Louchun

545
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,360
and hid the treasures.

546
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,500
Now you're keeping the antidote for yourself?

547
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,590
Are you going to use it alone

548
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,040
and watch us die?

549
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,740
-You're dead!
-Wait.

550
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,520
Now that the murderer has been found,

551
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,610
the Baichuan Court will decide his punishment tomorrow.

552
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,190
Please calm down.

553
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,340
The antidote is two months' worth.

554
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,330
You scumbag don't deserve to take it.

555
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,310
Lock him up in the woodshed.

556
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,960
I shouldn't have hidden the antidote,

557
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,980
but it was put on my table

558
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,890
with the treasures.

559
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,140
I just want to stay alive. What's wrong with that?

560
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,050
Mr. Fang. Physician Li.

561
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,310
I didn't do it. I didn't do it!

562
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:00,800
I'm being framed. I'm being framed!

563
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,210
Move.

564
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,460
The Baichuan Court

565
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,860
lives up to its reputation.

566
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,510
You said you could solve the case tomorrow,

567
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:13,500
but you solved it today.

568
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,390
You're so amazing.

569
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,660
I admire you.

570
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,390
I finally got a new topic for my poetry and paintings.

571
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,370
I haven't been in the Central Plains for long

572
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,970
and thought people here only cared about profits and pleasure.

573
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,000
You two are wise men.

574
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,960
I respect you.

575
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,380
It's getting late.

576
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,810
Go back and have a good sleep.

577
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,710
After my colleagues from the Baichuan Court arrive tomorrow,

578
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:49,420
we'll go down the mountain.

579
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:52,910
I'm so disappointed.

580
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,290
Who'd have known the Machete Ghost was a coward?

581
00:26:59,290 --> 00:26:59,880
Don't worry.

582
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,210
Li Lianhua.

583
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:12,180
[Girls' Mansion]

584
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:17,070
[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

585
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,490
Li Lianhua.

586
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,220
What's wrong?

587
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,090
Xin Jue doesn't have the ice shard.

588
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,900
Did Yu Louchun hide it somewhere else?

589
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,180
Xin Jue doesn't know

590
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,100
where the missing parts of Yu Louchun's body are either.

591
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,350
Did Xin Jue hide it somewhere else?

592
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,960
Mr. Fang, Physician Li.

593
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:01,200
When these guards saw that Yu Louchun was killed

594
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:01,930
and Xin Jue was locked,

595
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,390
they barged in

596
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,190
and tried to…

597
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,180
You're all poisoned

598
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,640
and deserve sympathy

599
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,670
but are here assaulting those poor girls.

600
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,470
So pathetic.

601
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,600
They're kept to entertain guests.

602
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,320
Who is entertained doesn't matter.

603
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,380
You'll die eventually.

604
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,360
So when you die doesn't matter, does it?

605
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,040
The antidote can only last you

606
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,270
for two months.

607
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,350
If you do this again,

608
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:27,400
I'll forget about giving you its formula.

609
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,730
Sorry. We won't do it again.

610
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,590
Go, go, go.

611
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,220
Hurry.

612
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:36,980
Girls,

613
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,320
Yu Louchun is dead.

614
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:40,080
Let's leave here together tomorrow.

615
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:41,180
Qing'er.

616
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,000
Master treated us well.

617
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,410
How can you be so ungrateful?

618
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:45,680
He treated us well?

619
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,930
Xifei, are you crazy?

620
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:51,050
We were locked here day after day,

621
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,430
worrying about not having food and clothes

622
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,050
if we lost money,

623
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,500
living in fear of being sent to the guards outside.

624
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,470
How was that treating us well?

625
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,970
The outside world is more dangerous than the Girls' Mansion.

626
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:01,110
Just look at what those guards

627
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:01,780
did today.

628
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,210
All these years,

629
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,370
it was Master who protected us.

630
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:07,680
That was imprisonment, not protection.

631
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,020
He locked us here

632
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,420
as if we were animals.

633
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,260
He never treated us like humans!

634
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,420
Binrong. Yuyan.

635
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,650
Say something.

636
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:23,920
You're all crazy.

637
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,810
Being locked here has made all of you crazy.

638
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,870
Do whatever you want, you cowards.

639
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,280
Since you like being cooped up,

640
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,770
lock yourselves here forever

641
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,200
and say prayers for him every day.

642
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,760
Thank you for finding out the truth

643
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,220
and avenging Master.

644
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,050
Do you not hate Yu Louchun at all?

645
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,300
The outside world

646
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,990
is too dangerous for women.

647
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,180
We got no worries when we stayed here serving Master.

648
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,570
Entertaining one person

649
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,990
is easier than entertaining lots of people.

650
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,610
But…

651
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,090
Not everyone wants the same thing.

652
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:59,560
I wish you all the best.

653
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,820
They've been cooped up here for too long

654
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:19,910
and gotten used to it.

655
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,260
Don't force them.

656
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,180
They're cowards.

657
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,450
So is Xin Jue.

658
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,850
Is everyone in the martial world so cowardly?

659
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,520
That's so boring.

660
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,950
Some people are fearless,

661
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,030
some just want to stay alive.

662
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:33,780
That's the real martial world.

663
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:37,060
Li Lianhua.

664
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:39,930
You've been quiet tonight.

665
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,210
What are you thinking?

666
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:43,910
I'm thinking

667
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:47,470
why there was mud on the flower.

668
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,050
I didn't see any mud.

669
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,470
I mean the night of Mountains Red.

670
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,420
Flowers grow in the soil.

671
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,620
What's weird about that?

672
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,800
The hibiscus tree is more than three meters high.

673
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,270
The flowers blooming high were stained with mud.

674
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,880
That's very weird.

675
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,690
Maybe the girls dropped them on the ground when picking them.

676
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:13,660
It was mud splash

677
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:14,840
so the flowers weren't stained

678
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,230
by being dropped to the ground.

679
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,550
How did the girls splash mud

680
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,660
over the flowers three meters high?

681
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:28,950
Also,

682
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,690
half of the body was in plain sight.

683
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,330
Why is the other half hidden?

684
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,380
Xin Jue admitted that he was the Machete Ghost.

685
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,390
But why wouldn't he confess to murder?

686
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,070
It's obvious.

687
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,110
What?

688
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,950
The answer is obvious.

689
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:49,430
Obvious?

690
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,680
Fine. Tell us what you think.

691
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,800
You tell me a secret

692
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,820
and I help you three times in the Fragrant Mountain.

693
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,360
Is this the third favor?

694
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,040
Don't push your luck.

695
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,230
Why don't you tell me the secret first?

696
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:03,500
Who knows if you'll go back on your word?

697
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,520
How could you say that, Fei?

698
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,230
Have I ever gone back on my word openly?

699
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:12,140
Don't look so sulky.

700
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:14,870
Fine. I'll tell you.

701
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,040
You said

702
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:20,540
you know you don't want me to die

703
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,560
but don't know why.

704
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,240
The reason

705
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,340
is that you want me

706
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,800
to save an important person for you.

707
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:26,880
Save someone?

708
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:30,440
Who's it?

709
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,350
That's another question.

710
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,310
Fei, tell us.

711
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,300
What have you found?

712
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,710
The cuts on those three bodies are different.

713
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,260
The cuts on the three of them

714
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,760
look the same,

715
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,500
but when examining more carefully,

716
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:54,000
we can notice differences in the murderers' states of mind.

717
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:58,400
The cuts on Dongfang Hao are quite calm.

718
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,630
Those on Yu Louchun

719
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:02,570
are determined.

720
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:05,770
Those on the head guard are hesitant.

721
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,430
So there are three murderers?

722
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,670
It's imitation.

723
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,000
Imitation?

724
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,970
Don't get distracted by the Hash Slash.

725
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,930
Yu Louchun died first.

726
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:17,280
The head guard is the second.

727
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,940
To imitate the Hash Slash

728
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,400
on Yu Louchun's body,

729
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,650
the murderer left slashes on the head guard that looked like hash marks.

730
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,220
Same goes for Dongfang Hao.

731
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,170
But the cuts on the head guard show a different state of mind

732
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,030
from those on Dongfang Hao.

733
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,320
That's because the murderer was inexperienced

734
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,180
when killing the head guard.

735
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,750
When he killed Dongfang Hao,

736
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,710
he was much more skilled.

737
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,250
Li Lianhua.

738
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,420
That's not right.

739
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,300
Yu Louchun died first

740
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,250
but the cuts on him are the most skilled.

741
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,700
Why did the murderer become less skilled

742
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,860
when killing the head guard?

743
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,510
Also,

744
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,590
if Yu Louchun died first,

745
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,230
where is the machete that ended him?

746
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,980
He couldn't be dismembered without a machete.

747
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,700
You remind me.

748
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,960
We haven't found that machete yet.

749
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:53,800
No.

750
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,210
No one can do the Hash Slash without a machete.

751
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,060
We don't know how the murderer

752
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,990
dismembered Yu Louchun without a machete,

753
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,370
but since he was capable of that,

754
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,370
we can be sure that Xin Jue is not the murderer.

755
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,420
Because in that case, he wouldn't have to hide his machete

756
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,520
to arouse suspicion.

757
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,739
The missing part of Yu Louchun's body

758
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,730
can definitely tell us who killed him.

759
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,590
That's all we need to know

760
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,909
that Xin Jue is not the murderer?

761
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:16,840
And this.

762
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:19,500
Take it, Fei.

763
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,610
We thought

764
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,630
that Xin Jue is the most likely one

765
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:24,350
who hung the vine under the cane basket.

766
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,040
Yes.

767
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,350
He burned the vine after he came down the peak.

768
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,239
That's not right.

769
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,340
Think about it.

770
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,699
If the vine were put down from above

771
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:33,730
and lit from below,

772
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,239
only one end would be burnt.

773
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,940
But both ends of the vine are burnt.

774
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,270
Didn't you notice that?

775
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,620
Do you mean someone is trying to make us believe

776
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,409
that Xin Jue is the murderer?

777
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,679
Xin Jue is not the murderer?

778
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,360
Then who is the murderer?

779
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,340
The murderers are a few smart people.

780
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:51,610
A few?

781
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:53,480
Xin Jue isn't the murderer,

782
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,110
so the killings required collective cooperation to be done.

783
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,210
Let's go meet Xin Jue.

784
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,190
Those guards beat you like this?

785
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:14,500
They beat me the same way

786
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,920
I used to beat them.

787
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,800
Now all the evidence points to you.

788
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:28,180
Tell me whatever you want to say.

789
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:31,960
Tomorrow morning,

790
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,530
I'll die from the Loyal Potion.

791
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,930
No one can save me now.

792
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,650
You…

793
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,520
Why did you save me?

794
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,380
I gave you the antidote

795
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,750
because I don't want anyone to be wrongfully convicted.

796
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,150
I didn't kill Yu Louchun.

797
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,020
Neither did I kill Dongfang Hao.

798
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,650
But I've sinned.

799
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,820
From the moment I worked for Yu Louchun,

800
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
I was beyond redemption.

801
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:22,350
Sirs,

802
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,110
ask me whatever you want.

803
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:25,760
I'll tell you everything I know.

804
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,010
Did you notice anything or anyone

805
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,520
unusual yesterday?

806
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:35,820
Yesterday?

807
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:39,010
We were preparing for Mountains Red,

808
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,940
so the whole Girls' Mansion was unusual.

809
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,740
Was there anything too strange?

810
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,530
No.

811
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:47,540
What about you?

812
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:50,550
Me?

813
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,740
You claim that someone knows you're the Machete Ghost

814
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:55,660
and framed you.

815
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,820
Maybe you can recall something unusual

816
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,790
about yourself.

817
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,890
About myself?

818
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,170
Except that I woke up very early,

819
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:10,960
nothing was unusual.

820
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,820
Did you wake up very early yesterday?

821
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:16,360
Yes.

822
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,440
As Yu Louchun's guard, I went to bed at midnight

823
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,500
and had to get up at four.

824
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,300
Usually, when the bell chimes four,

825
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,360
I'm still very sleepy.

826
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,380
But yesterday, I waited for a long time after waking up

827
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,880
before the bell chimed four.

828
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:32,710
The moon.

829
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,910
Yes. Something's wrong with the moon.

830
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,150
Calm down.

831
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:40,840
What's wrong?

832
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,260
The moon is wrong so the time is wrong.

833
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:44,330
It's the eighth today.

834
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,080
Yesterday was the seventh.

835
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,300
The moon at midnight

836
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:48,980
should hang low in the western sky.

837
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,350
After I met Yu Louchun here last night,

838
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,810
the bell chimed midnight.

839
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:54,770
Bihuang was dancing at that moment.

840
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,120
But the moon was in the west above her head,

841
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:58,720
hanging high in the sky.

842
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,990
So the chimes of midnight

843
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,260
were early last night.

844
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,340
Xin Jue went to bed at twelve and got up at four.

845
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,920
Since he isn't the murderer,

846
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:07,880
the real murderer had only four hours

847
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,720
to go up the peak and commit murder.

848
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,800
But if the bell chimed early,

849
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:15,040
the murderer would have more time.

850
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,700
If Yu Louchun was killed

851
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,500
before four o'clock,

852
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:22,090
why was his severed arm still bleeding

853
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,480
when it was found in the morning?

854
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:29,060
Let's find out why the bell chimed early first.

855
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,180
The bell is in a faraway temple.

856
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,710
We can definitely find clues there.

857
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:35,060
But those from the Baichuan Court won't arrive until tomorrow

858
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,030
and only then will the drawbridge be put down.

859
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:37,260
Fang Xiaobao,

860
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,210
how can we go to that temple now?

861
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:41,370
Fei!

862
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:43,870
You…

863
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,110
Don't point at me.

864
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,830
Go to the temple with the bell

865
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,430
and find out why the bell chimed midnight early last night!

866
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:50,970
It's fine that he orders me.

867
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:52,320
Who are you to order me around?

868
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,310
You helped Li Lianhua three times in exchange for one secret.

869
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:56,480
I'll tell you a secret too.

870
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,600
You just need to help me once.

871
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,250
What do you think?

872
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,260
Isn't it a bargain?

873
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,730
Can I believe you?

874
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,140
I'll tell you the secret first.

875
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,250
You used to be a super villain

876
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,380
who was great at martial arts

877
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,940
and killed lots of people.

878
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,020
Many people wanted you dead but no one dare to mess with you.

879
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,320
What do you think?

880
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,370
It is a bargain, isn't it?

881
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,410
You can go to the temple now.

882
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:26,320
OK.

883
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:35,640
Fang Xiaobao.

884
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,750
You shouldn't tell him that

885
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,350
so early.

886
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,350
You're so glib.

887
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,130
You can make it up later.

888
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:46,430
By the way,

889
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,020
what should we do next?

890
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,030
You tell me!

891
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,090
Detective Fang.

892
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,400
She danced on the Zhaixing Stage the whole night.

893
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:58,250
We should meet her.

894
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,120
[Qunfang House]

895
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,400
Where are you going?

896
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:10,830
I'm moving out.

897
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,770
I'll leave here tomorrow morning.

898
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,610
I don't want to stay

899
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,360
with those cowards.

900
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,560
Aren't you supposed to be with Xin Jue?

901
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,440
What are you doing here?

902
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,740
Bihuang danced all night last night.

903
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,120
How is she?

904
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,150
You're very caring.

905
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:26,720
I…

906
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,700
Come tomorrow.

907
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,350
Bihuang caught a cold last night

908
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:30,900
and has gone to bed.

909
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:31,850
Qing'er.

910
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:34,640
What kind of person is Bihuang?

911
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,500
She's the housekeeper of the Girls' Mansion.

912
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,350
She seems strict

913
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:38,180
but is actually soft-hearted.

914
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:39,170
She's a good person.

915
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,030
Did she like Yu Louchun?

916
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:44,670
She was meticulous with everything he asked her to do.

917
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,560
Of course she liked him.

918
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,280
Yu Louchun must have put a spell on her.

919
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,450
Was there anything

920
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,820
in her charge yesterday

921
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,070
during Mountains Red?

922
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:54,920
The rouge.

923
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,310
She made the girls'

924
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,770
rosy rouge herself.

925
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,180
I have some here.

926
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:00,960
Here.

927
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:11,490
There are opium poppies in it.

928
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:15,580
Are there opium poppies in the Girls' Mansion?

929
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,020
There is an opium poppy field behind the mountain.

930
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,520
Opium poppies are used to make opium.

931
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,820
So Yu Louchun

932
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,250
did illegal business to make money.

933
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,300
No wonder that junkie Dongfang Hao

934
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:29,220
sold him girls to cozy up to him.

935
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,090
Bihuang has opium poppies

936
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,320
so she could make anesthetics here.

937
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:34,400
Do you remember

938
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,780
the fish soup during Mountains Red?

939
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,760
Late Spring Nowhere to be Found.

940
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,760
There was Baizhi and Danggui in it.

941
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,880
Opium poppy, Baizhi, and Danggui

942
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:48,980
make up an anesthetic.

943
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,620
That's why those who had the fish soup

944
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:53,320
and kissed the girls fell into heavy slumber yesterday.

945
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:56,170
No wonder they all slept in.

946
00:41:58,430 --> 00:41:59,110
Li Lianhua.

947
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:01,460
I fell asleep because I used her glass

948
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:02,170
by accident.

949
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,680
What happened to you?

950
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,050
Don't ask so many questions.

951
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,260
-I…
-Miss Qing'er.

952
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:13,860
Last night,

953
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:15,680
the girls gave the guests

954
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,140
hibiscuses as gifts.

955
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,300
Where did they pick them?

956
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,020
The best hibiscuses here

957
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,700
grow on Yu Louchun's Kanyuan Peak.

958
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,210
So we have to go the Kanyun Peak

959
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,430
to find other evidence against Bihuang.

960
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:31,930
Are you suspecting Bihuang?

961
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:33,480
It can't be her.

962
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,380
She's very nice

963
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:35,720
and liked Yu Louchun very much.

964
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,290
How could it be her?

965
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:38,290
Miss Qing'er.

966
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,290
If Bihuang really liked Yu Louchun,

967
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:43,850
why would she put her silk handkerchief

968
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,280
among the items?

969
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,950
She knew that if her item got picked, she'd have to sleep with the guest

970
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:49,880
but she did it nonetheless

971
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:54,200
because she wanted to be punished in front of everyone.

972
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:56,410
Why did she want that?

973
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,300
The answer is at the Kanyun Peak.

974
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:09,900
I see.

975
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:12,530
Li Lianhua.

976
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:13,620
Have you figured out

977
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:15,690
the reason why Bihuang wanted to be punished on the Zhaixing Stage?

978
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:18,430
She needed to know the situation at the Kanyun Peak

979
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:20,320
and keep an eye on the guards.

980
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:21,710
In the Girls' Mansion,

981
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:23,390
the only place where she could do that

982
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,680
is the Zhaixing Stage.

983
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,360
Do you mean that Bihuang was keeping watch

984
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,120
on the Zhaixing Stage for the real murderer?

985
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,280
Who on earth is the murderer?

986
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,560
Yu Louchun's missing body parts can tell us the answer.
