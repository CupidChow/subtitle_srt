00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Kissing

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
After four thousand times

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Thousands of times

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The most reluctant moment is that moment

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
On the earth

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A thousand miles of madness

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who never wanders

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Who doesn't know the distance between the stars and the moon

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
On the edge of the world

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
On the earth

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The youth is crazy

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
A thousand times

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Unconquered

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
In sorrow

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I dare to take a trip to the dream first

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
On the edge of the world

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
A thousand miles of madness

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Who never wanders

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Who doesn't know the distance between the stars and the moon

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
On the edge of the world

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
On the edge of the world

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
A thousand times

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Unconquered

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,200
A thousand times, I won't fall into sorrow

26
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,920
A moment of happiness in the mortal world

27
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,640
is like a dream

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,640
The King of Blaze

29
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,640
Episode 16

30
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,200
If I had known you were fine,

31
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,400
who would have saved you?

32
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,400
You.

33
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,200
Be careful.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Qian Kunzhu, be careful.

35
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,200
Brother Qin, is that you?

36
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,400
Brother Qin, is that really you?

37
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:50,400
You really won't believe it.

38
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,360
Keep dreaming.

39
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,440
Jin Xiong.

40
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,680
You remember this Owl Lake.

41
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,600
That Dist mereka tewcourse i my house,

42
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,640
right?

43
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,720
I've been searching here for three years.

44
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,280
Finally I find you.

45
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,680
I am very glad

46
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,320
that you kept your promise.

47
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,040
It shall not be broken.

48
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,220
I come to fetch a jade

49
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,640
This year Baihua醉

50
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,840
This year Baihua醉

51
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,960
I got it.

52
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,120
Jacqullut Vai,

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,720
you threw the old admitted compose

54
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,680
put it into his hand.

55
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,400
I have a strong belief in Xiao Mai.

56
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,760
You fucking bitch.

57
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,400
In order to colour me red,

58
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,000
Huh?

59
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,960
I didn't expect it would work out like this.

60
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,360
What a brilliant plan!

61
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,040
It's all because of the Imperial Broozer

62
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,600
who fooled me.

63
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,400
I...

64
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,760
Luckily,

65
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,520
Brother Lu gave me this wine bottle.

66
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,520
Later, I found out that these weirdos were afraid of fire.

67
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,600
So I surrounded them in this fire circle.

68
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,120
It's good that they're fine.

69
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,080
Where are the other weirdos?

70
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,800
They're still weathering.

71
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,000
Then they're afraid of me.

72
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,000
It's good that we caught them in here.

73
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,520
When the daylight was coming down,

74
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,420
I found that they were slow

75
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,180
so I locked them in this dungeon.

76
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,480
It was close.

77
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,240
Yes.

78
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,160
I've been tired for the whole night.

79
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,600
I'm so sleepy.

80
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,720
I wanted to find a place to rest.

81
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,480
But I met someone.

82
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,960
Thank you, Bai Qing.

83
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,840
You're welcome.

84
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,440
It's not painful for a man.

85
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,320
But why is Jin Xiong not afraid of the sunlight?

86
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,760
Maybe Jin Xiong's killings

87
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,960
are different from what happened ten years ago.

88
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,160
Killings?

89
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,400
I found some clues here.

90
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,560
This sky pit

91
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,360
is where the men used to train their pets.

92
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,040
These martial artists

93
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,960
were also tricked into being test subjects.

94
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,360
But these pets

95
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,800
didn't seem to be trained.

96
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,320
These men are so evil.

97
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,920
Is the Hualong Fuzhu

98
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,520
in these rocks?

99
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,360
This is the Hualong Fuzhu Sword.

100
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,440
That's right.

101
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,040
The Hualong Fuzhu's weapon?

102
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,120
Then it's...

103
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,320
It's not here.

104
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,160
I found it near here.

105
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,960
It proves that it did come here.

106
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,200
The Hualong Fuzhu has a sword

107
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,800
that can be used to break the wall.

108
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,880
It's a magic weapon.

109
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,080
I think

110
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,880
it's already left here.

111
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,520
This is another clue.

112
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,960
You're still alive?

113
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:19,960
Tell me.

114
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,600
Where's the antidote for the Human-head Fiend?

115
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,960
Antidote?

116
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,960
How can there be an antidote for the Human-head Fiend?

117
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,880
The one who gave his soul to the Human-head God

118
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,720
will always be the slave of the Human-head God.

119
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,440
Nonsense.

120
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,320
Whether it's poison or ancient trees,

121
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
since it can be cured,

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,920
it must be an antidote.

123
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,920
Tell me.

124
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,400
The Human-head Fiend doesn't have an antidote.

125
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,720
It's a poison.

126
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,760
It's a poison.

127
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,000
There's no antidote in the Human-head Fiend.

128
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,440
This is your punishment.

129
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,640
Shut up.

130
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,520
The world is so big.

131
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,640
There are so many people who are the most powerful.

132
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,800
I believe

133
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,880
as long as we travel around the world,

134
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,680
we can find a way to make Jinxiu recover.

135
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,480
Three Guards.

136
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,720
Thanks to your help,

137
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,120
I can find Jinxiu this time.

138
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,520
I thank you all again.

139
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,000
Brother Lu, don't say that.

140
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,880
It's not a big help.

141
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,880
We've met for years since we parted today.

142
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,560
Take care.

143
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,120
Take care, Brother Lu.

144
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:31,960
Take care.

145
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:44,880
By the way,

146
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,200
I found something important

147
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,800
in the Celestial Hive.

148
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,240
I'm afraid the purpose of the man is not that simple.

149
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,960
Let's lock them up first.

150
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,600
I'll take you there.

151
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,000
Okay.

152
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,960
The Celestial Hive

153
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,240
This is the place where they study Human-head Fiends.

154
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,560
I escaped before.

155
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,640
I entered here by accident.

156
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,400
I saw their hands.

157
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,280
Look.

158
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,720
The ancient murals from the wall.

159
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,240
They used human skulls to raise them.

160
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,960
This is clearly the way

161
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,480
the man used to make the Fire-fire-tongue.

162
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,560
In the skull,

163
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,480
the Fire-fire-tongue is made of

164
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,480
the mother-tongue and the child-tongue.

165
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,160
If you master the mother-tongue,

166
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,760
you can control the child-tongue

167
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,240
and enter the physical body.

168
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,600
So the Fire-fire-tongue

169
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,280
is used to control people?

170
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,680
The Human-head Fiends might have used this method.

171
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,960
What does it have to do with the Fire-fire-tongue?

172
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,240
Because the Fire-fire-tongue

173
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,520
is the writing method of Gu Nan Ying.

174
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,600
The method of making it has long been lost.

175
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Think about it.

176
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,360
In the past,

177
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,680
there was only a Fire-fire-tongue in the royal family.

178
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,320
But now that the Fire-fire-tongue has been destroyed,

179
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,280
the Fire-fire-tongue is also missing.

180
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,760
You mean

181
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,560
the Man of the South has already found these murals.

182
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,640
But the process of making the bronze cotton is incomplete.

183
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,040
So the descendants of the South

184
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,920
don't fully master the method of making it.

185
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,960
So they experimented again and again

186
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,760
and led those martial artists

187
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,600
to become uncontrollable monsters.

188
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,320
That's exactly why.

189
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,200
That's also why

190
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,720
for more than a decade,

191
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,320
the Human-head Fiend has long been a failure.

192
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,320
That's why the South wanted to give up

193
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,480
and decided to find the Fire-fire-tongue

194
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,320
that the South lost.

195
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,280
The South wanted to use the Fire-fire-tongue

196
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,920
to control the Central Plains martial arts.

197
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,160
That's why they need to

198
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,720
take control of the Heavenly Army.

199
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,760
Mr. Shi.

200
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,480
I guess what I did wrong.

201
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,840
It seems like I guessed correctly.

202
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,520
So what if you guessed correctly?

203
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,960
You won't get out anyway.

204
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,120
I've already managed to inform my master

205
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,480
that he drove the people from the essence degree Playing Iran

206
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,400
here.

207
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,000
You knew our village's secret

208
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,760
and ruined our Human-head Fiend.

209
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,240
He can't live for today.

210
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,840
I also made을 kinda pack of traps

211
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,760
You...

212
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,640
The Golden Abyss Alliance?

213
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,200
It's you again!

214
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,080
Forget it.

215
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,520
You've been keeping it in the cellar for ten years.

216
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,080
I'm sure you didn't do it.

217
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,760
The Golden Abyss Alliance.

218
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,360
The South Wing.

219
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,280
The South Wing

220
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,240
bought the Thunder Fire

221
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,400
and destroyed everything you did in the East Sea.

222
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,480
Do you know

223
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,040
that Jiao Li Qiao

224
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,040
is a South Wing member?

225
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,200
What do you mean by the secret letter?

226
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,560
Your master asked me to take the Golden Abyss Alliance's power?

227
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,000
Di Fei Sheng will know

228
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,040
what you did.

229
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,280
By then, the Golden Abyss Alliance

230
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,160
will benefit both you and me.

231
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,240
Fei, what's wrong with you?

232
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,160
I didn't blame you.

233
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,120
Don't pretend.

234
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,560
His non-believing ring is working again.

235
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,480
Fei.

236
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,440
I remember the way

237
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,160
to understand the non-believing ring.

238
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,080
Open it.

239
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,240
Okay.

240
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,480
I found it.

241
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,200
What it means is

242
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,440
that the water quality raised by the non-believing ring

243
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,360
can be removed from the body

244
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,320
by sucking out the poison from the solar plexus.

245
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,000
The water quality raised by the non-believing ring?

246
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,920
Since you use the non-believing ring,

247
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,760
you must have this water quality around you.

248
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,320
Even if you kill me,

249
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,160
I won't tell you about the water quality.

250
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:09,920
You...

251
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,560
I won't bother you.

252
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,760
You've done evil for so many years.

253
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,360
Don't even think about escaping.

254
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,480
Wait until you're taken back to the 188th prison of the Hundred-Port Garden.

255
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,800
Fei.

256
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,920
I'll borrow your blood to use.

257
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,520
So there's water here.

258
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,840
I removed the non-believing ring for him.

259
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,400
He regained his memory

260
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,680
and became the original Di Feisheng.

261
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
Have you made up your mind?

262
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:10,960
Yes.

263
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,200
Forget it.

264
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,280
Just treat it as the kindness of the bodyguard

265
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,000
who helped me to open the mechanism.

266
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,240
Only you can save the danger and protect the Soulattform.

267
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,480
Li Xiangye has already died.

268
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,800
From now on,

269
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,880
I can't help you.

270
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,000
Now,

271
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,920
you're the best in the world.

272
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,440
Fei.

273
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,000
It's okay.

274
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,160
Wu Xinhua's piano

275
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,240
is just a small part of his body.

276
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,080
He's just fainted temporarily.

277
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,400
Lirespect me

278
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,520
until someone contacts us.

279
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,160
Are you willing to be a top pal in this place?

280
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,200
I'll be nothing but dust

281
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,040
Sal model

282
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,960
sick storm

283
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,040
oid

284
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,160
now

285
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,000
The demon who took away my house

286
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,440
accidentally

287
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,760
knows

288
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,240
that

289
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:00,840
The demon who took away my house

290
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,760
is book

291

00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,160
the

295
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,800
Demon.

296
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,720
Go.

297

ử花...

298
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,600
There's a origin of the phenomenon

299
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,440
that Your Ladyship taught me.

300
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,300
In those days,降鄣,

301
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,320
when you saw a beautiful flower

302
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,900
planted at the East Hof,

303
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,680
charming but with no cup.

304
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,620
to pick seventeen bad basic flowers

305
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,860
and gave them to seventeen girls of SP liked him.

306
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,860

00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,280
and you lost and pills them.

309
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,560
I was right.

310
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,520
You're Li Xiangyi.

311
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,880
I'm not perfect.

312
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,560
I'm just like a flower.

313
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
Master Li,

314
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,160
how have you been?

315
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,600
It's been ten years.

316
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,080
You're still young and handsome.

317
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,800
You're so kind,

318
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,120
pretty lady.

319
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,400
It's been ten years.

320
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,720
You look so old.

321
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,600
Are you really Li Xiangyi?

322
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,440
You're so mean.

323
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,760
You're even more annoying than ten years ago.

324
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,680
You're so good at martial arts

325
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,800
that you're so good at tea-drinking.

326
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,960
I'm just a tea-drinker.

327
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,520
How can I be so good at Xiangyi Taijian?

328
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,960
Yeah.

329
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,280
I've been practicing martial arts for ten years

330
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,120
just to break your Xiangyi Taijian.

331
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,680
I'm going to kill you today.

332
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,800
I'm not going to fight with you today.

333
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,640
It's more important that you respect me.

334
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,720
I'll settle the score with you in the future.

335
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,120
You're awake, Li Lianhua.

336
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,840
No.

337
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,760
I should call you Li Xiangyi, right?

338
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,160
Yes.

339
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,440
You're related to Yang Zhongman.

340
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,480
You're related to Di Feisheng.

341
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,240
You've always had a relationship with Di Feisheng.

342
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,720
You know my father so well.

343
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,400
You always wanted to get rid of me

344
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,280
because you were afraid I would know your identity.

345
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,320
So you're also the Hero of White Cloak, right?

346
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,680
You've been hiding it from me for so long.

347
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,360
I didn't know anything.

348
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,840
I'm still worried about your safety.

349
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,720
Feng Xiaobao,

350
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,400
there are some things

351
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,320
I didn't mean to hide.

352
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,440
You didn't mean to?

353
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:53,400
How do you explain the

354
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,240
Wenjing Sword?

355
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,200
It's the Wenjing Sword in your hand.

356
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,520
The blood of Yun Tian will be released.

357
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,680
Do you still want to argue?

358
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,360
You mean

359
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,920
the reason why Wenjing Sword will be released

360
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,640
is because it's made by Yun Tian?

361
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,720
You're strong.

362
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,280
This Wenjing Sword might be suitable for you.

363
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,200
In a few days,

364
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,680
it'll be your 18th birthday.

365
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,160
I'll give you this Wenjing Sword as a gift.

366
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,400
This sword is soft and sturdy.

367
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It can fight any enemy.

368
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,040
It's a good sword indeed.

369
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,080
Sturdy is like Wenjing.

370
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,200
It's given by my senior.

371
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
Wenjing's friends

372
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,400
live and die together.

373
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,400
So I'll call this sword Wenjing.

374
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,000
Whenever feelings come to my mind

375
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,160
and days have passed now,

376
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,360
I would love to

377
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,760
move it to the bottom.

378
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,440
Will you

379
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,000
put me

380
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,120
in trouble

381
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,280
to have my Wenjing Sword

382
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,320
released?

383
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,000
Will

384
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,120
the third chill

385
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,200
There's something inside.

386
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,680
It's not what you think.

387
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,440
Tell me.

388
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,800
Will the truth be revealed?

389
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
I don't know

390
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,680
the source of the text either.

391
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,320
Originally,

392
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,640
what's the purpose of the text?

393
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,720
What?

394
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,840
I've found out the truth.

395
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,080
I don't know how to explain it.

396
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,840
Or you

397
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,920
don't want to lie to me now?

398
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,720
I don't know.

399
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,000
Bao.

400
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,400
I haven't figured out many things yet.

401
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,520
I don't want you to feel wronged

402
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,520
because of what I said.

403
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,480
Please give me some more time.

404
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,360
Li Lianhua.

405
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,400
No.

406
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,080
I should call you Li Xiangyi.

407
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,120
I'm so sorry for you.

408
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,960
But what about you?

409
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,800
You promised me many times that you wouldn't lie.

410
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,440
But you lied to me.

411
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,400
Even if you're kind,

412
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,600
you're no match for the famous Li Menchu.

413
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,240
I was wrong about you.

414
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,920
You won't give me a reasonable explanation today.

415
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,520
Believe it or not, I'll avenge my father right now.

416
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,200
Forget it.

417
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,480
It's hard to change one's mind.

418
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,320
I knew that

419
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,100
you and I

420
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,440
would never screams

421
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,980
in your eyes

422
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,120
today.

423
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,600
Today, we are like children.

424
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,360
From now on,

425
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,880
we are just strangers.

426
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,000
If one day,

427
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,640
I find out that my father's death is really related to you,

428
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:54,400
I will definitely come to fight with you.

429
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,240
I will definitely come to fight with you.

430
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,800
New friend?

431
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,400
Best friend.

432
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,480
Censhao, you are awake.

433
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,760
Why keep sleeping?

434
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,600
Where is this?

435
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,700
Censhao.

436
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,680
All those I did was for you.

437
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,360
You have to forgive me.

438
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,800
Forgive you?

439
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,240
You've been protecting me for ten years.

440
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,640
How can I forgive you?

441
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,720
Is it because I went out of the capital

442
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,720
and almost became a demon

443
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,720
when I was out of the capital yesterday?

444
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,880
Yu Hongzhu can't even

445
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,400
protect you.

446
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,160
Your Majesty,

447
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,920
you mean

448
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,160
you just left the capital

449
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,680
and went out of the capital?

450
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,960
Isn't it?

451
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,080
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

452
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,000
I wasn't there.

453
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,080
I wonder

454
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,160
what happened.

455
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,200
I only remember the noise.

456
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,760
It seemed that there were people from the Baichuan Courtyard.

457
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,760
I forced myself to stop practicing

458
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,360
and caused the power to counteract.

459
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,520
I was relieved to see you guys here.

460
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,160
Get in!

461
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,840
Come in.

462
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,920
Greetings, Your Majesty.

463
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,920
I've been secluded for ten years.

464
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,440
I haven't seen so many people in a long time.

465
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,160
Why are you hiding out there?

466
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,760
Your Majesty,

467
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,360
we were entrusted by the Saintess

468
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,320
to protect you from outside.

469
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,680
You just left the capital.

470
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,600
Are you feeling unwell?

471
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,520
My head hurts.

472
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,760
Let me serve you.

473
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,280
Okay.

474
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,360
You may leave.

475
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,320
Yes.

476
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,600
Let's go.

477
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,960
It's been ten years.

478
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,720
Your face

479
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,120
is still so beautiful.

480
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,520
You've worked hard

481
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,200
for the past ten years.

482
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,200
You all must be overall.

483
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,480
I have to receive

484
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,880
the blessings

485
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,880
you prepared for me,

486
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,520
and give a blessing.

487
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,520
Congratulations!

488
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,480
Yes.

489
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,440
My Lord,

490
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,080
I'm happy that you are back.

491
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,720
to make you

492
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,720
smile at the world.

493
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,760
But I haven't done it yet.

494
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,360
After I finish drinking,

495
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,720
I'll give you a surprise.

496
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:36,880
Okay.

497
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,280
I'll wait for you.

498
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,440
I heard that when Zeng Shao

499
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,840
was with Lü Lian Hua and the others,

500
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,120
he seemed to forget everything.

501
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,320
It seems that Wu Xing Huai's smile

502
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,400
is really strong.

503
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,280
Brother Li, you fainted for three days.

504
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,600
What happened?

505
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,480
I'm here to find you.

506
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,960
You fainted outside Lian Hua House.

507
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,440
Don't worry.

508
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,920
Look.

509
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,760
I'm not dying.

510
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,680
I'm fine now.

511
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,400
You're really fine?

512
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,800
The monk said that the poison in his lung

513
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,080
started to develop once every three days.

514
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,720
At the end of the month,

515
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,280
the time to wake up will be less and less.

516
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,160
You have to be faster.

517
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,280
That's strange.

518
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,920
Lü Lian Hua,

519
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,200
didn't you always

520
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,760
be with Fang Duo Bin?

521
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,560
Why didn't you see him

522
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,280
when you were sick?

523
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,600
Slow down.

524
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,560
Fang Xiao Bao has gone home.

525
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,120
These things

526
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,080
have nothing to do with him.

527
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,920
He shouldn't be involved.

528
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,400
What are you talking about?

529
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,440
Okay.

530
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,880
Nothing.

531
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,520
Why are you here?

532
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,680
Lü Lian Hua,

533
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,560
my grandfather found out about the Luomu Peak.

534
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,280
Isn't the Luomu Peak

535
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,520
full of night fire and purple sugar?

536
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,480
Yes.

537
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,400
But night fire and purple sugar

538
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,200
are different from the mother sugar.

539
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,400
There is only purple sugar in the Luomu Peak.

540
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,800
The mother sugar has long been lost.

541
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,240
I have a strange thing.

542
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,560
If Jiao Lei Qiao is also a man,

543
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,680
why is it so difficult

544
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,000
to gather four heavenly soldiers?

545
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,400
I think

546
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,400
they were brought here

547
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,120
to the Central Plains

548
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,880
to be the father of the four men.

549
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,160
Their descendants

550
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,160
gradually got used to

551
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,680
these mysterious lives.

552
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,120
So gradually,

553
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,280
they don't have to

554
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,800
care about their own business.

555
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,480
They also miss their identity.

556
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,600
So these four heavenly soldiers

557
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,840
are hard to gather.

558
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,680
Anyway,

559
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,120
my grandfather also found out

560
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,440
that if the mother sugar has a body,

561
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,680
it can live for hundreds of years.

562
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,160
Purple sugar can also be detected

563
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,640
and find the mother sugar's location.

564
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,960
You mean

565
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,080
the purpose of taking Luomu Peak

566
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,400
is not only to get purple sugar,

567
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,440
but also to detect

568
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,760
the mother sugar's location?

569
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,680
Yes.

570
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,240
If they get the mother sugar,

571
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,680
they can detect

572
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,320
thousands of purple sugar.

573
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,520
That would be very scary.

574
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,320
This thing

575
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,280
is much more serious than I thought.

576
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,520
I have to go now.

577
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,280
No matter how urgent the situation is,

578
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,880
you have to get well first.

579
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,080
Otherwise, you will

580
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,560
fall down on your own.

581
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,840
Let's fill our stomachs first.

582
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,960
You are so generous.

583
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,360
Miss Su, thank you.

584
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,840
It's not a problem.

585
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,280
I'm just trying to

586
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,080
get it from the village.

587
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,280
You can eat it.

588
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,600
But it's strange.

589
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,560
The village is so hidden.

590
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,840
Why would Wan Sheng Dao know its location?

591
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:24,880
He also gave them

592
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,360
a lot of rice and food.

593
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,560
Wan Sheng Dao?

594
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,400
How do you know

595
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,280
it was sent by Wan Sheng Dao?

596
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,360
It's written on the food list.

597
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,160
I got it from the village.

598
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,760
This mark

599
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,400
seems familiar.

600
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,160
This mark

601
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,000
is the special symbol

602
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
of Wan Sheng Dao's internal contact.

603
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,200
Wan Sheng Dao.

604
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,960
Yun Tiejia.

605
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,400
Wu Xinghuai.

606
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,880
No wonder the four ancient demons

607
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,200
forced me

608
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,720
to fight with all the gods of the Seven Devils Field.

609
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,040
These most 선택ie years

610
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,480
were Wan Sheng Dao.

611
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,720
Ten years after

612
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,320
what's behind

613
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:26,200
the rotting

614
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,920
you have fooled me so I engrossed.

615
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,560
These years,

616
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,480
whatd you

617
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,360
lay a greathm in the mouth?

618
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,960
I didn't expect that Honorable Superior only remembered what happened after Yucheng left the Pass.

619
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,560
He forgot everything we did before.

620
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,960
This Wu Xinghuai is really a good thing.

621
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,960
He didn't waste his martial arts skills but his memory.

622
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,560
This is a blessing from heaven.

623
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,960
Come, give me some hot blood.

624
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:58,960
If Honorable Superior calls me, I must keep my best condition at all times.

625
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:04,960
Saintess, I think that the Chief's action is a bit abnormal.

626
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,560
We all know that he has never been in the mood for beauty.

627
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,160
Why did he suddenly become so fond of you?

628
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,360
No one knows if he really doesn't remember or if he is pretending to not remember.

629
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:20,560
I'm afraid that he is trying to fool you.

630
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,560
I think that he is just pretending to be a good person.

631
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,560
I think that you should be more careful of him.

632
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,160
Impossible. I know Honorable Superior's personality the best.

633
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:37,560
He is the most arrogant person.

634
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:43,360
If he can act, then Di Feshen is not Di Feshen.

635
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,960
He and Li Lianhua are in a private relationship.

636
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,360
Maybe he will learn from Li Lianhua's crisis.

637
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,160
Xuegong is right.

638
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,560
This is strange.

639
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,760
Don't let him ruin our big plan again.

640
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,560
If he really is lying to me,

641
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:05,360
I will cut off his limbs and lock him in the room

642
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,560
so that he can never leave me.

643
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,560
But I don't think that he is the one.

644
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,560
I think that he is the one.

645
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,560
He is far away from me.

646
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,760
But Honorable Superior is my person.

647
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,960
I can only take action.

648
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:30,160
Don't even think about touching his finger.

649
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,360
I have no interest in Di Feshen.

650
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,960
I have read the secret letter you sent.

651
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,760
Are you sure that Li Lianhua is Li Xiangyi?

652
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,160
Yes.

653
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,560
He is so annoying.

654
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,960
Ten years ago, Honorable Superior was thinking about competing with him.

655
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,960
He couldn't stand anything else.

656
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,360
Ten years later, he showed up again.

657
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,760
Isn't the poison of tea called the world's best poison?

658
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,960
Why didn't he poison him to death and let him live until now?

659
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,360
Li Xiangyi.

660
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,560
He is Li Xiangyi.

661
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:16,360
It seems that Yang Zhongman saved his life.

662
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,160
Although he only has one percent of the power left,

663
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,160
he is a troublesome person.

664
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,560
Should we...

665
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,360
No need.

666
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,160
Since he is already a useless person,

667
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,760
he can't threaten us.

668
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,560
I feel that going to the night market is always lacking in fun.

669
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,760
Now it's good.

670
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:45,360
It seems that it was the will of the heavens to let him stay

671
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:49,760
so that he can personally witness my success.

672
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,960
But I'm afraid that keeping him will bring more trouble.

673
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,160
Moreover, he still has a Yulou Spring's Luo Mo Heavenly Army.

674
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,560
Four Heavenly Army opened the Luo Mo Tower.

675
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,760
It's indispensable.

676
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,760
No need for us to deal with him.

677
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,760
Didn't you arrange a lot of secret guards at the Four Valley Gate?

678
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,160
Xuegong, write a letter to the Four Valley Gate immediately.

679
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,760
Xiao Zijin is short-tempered and narrow-minded.

680
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,760
He can't be of much help.

681
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,160
You just need to give him a little bit of information.

682
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,760
Then he will risk his life to seize this opportunity.

683
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,960
I...

684
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,360
Honorable Superior.

685
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,360
Honorable Superior, I never thought that that woman, Jiao Liqiao,

686
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,560
would actually work with an outsider to kill you.

687
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,360
Thank goodness you're fine.

688
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,560
Jiao Liqiao.

689
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,360
What can she do to me?

690
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,960
It's just that I haven't been out for ten years.

691
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,160
Everyone in the Golden Thread Embroidery is her.

692
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,960
I underestimated her.

693
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,360
Honorable Superior, don't worry.

694
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,560
There's still a loyal companion in the alliance.

695
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,760
Once we're out,

696
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,960
we will take back the Golden Thread Embroidery from the alliance.

697
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,360
Don't panic.

698
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:19,960
I will double the debt she owes me.

699
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,360
It's just that I'm very interested in the things in her hands.

700
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,960
They are like a pair of sticks.

701
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,760
I'm just a fish in the water.

702
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,960
It's fine.

703
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,360
Let me just serve you for a minute.

704
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,960
He was seasick for a day.

705
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,760
Let's go inside and survey him.

706
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,760
Are you going to stay here and watch the cicada

707
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,360
or avoid seeing it?

708
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,000
Fine.

709
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,360
Since you can't watch the cicada today,

710
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,200
I'll stay here

711
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,760
and wait for you.

712
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,480
Go to bed and n sleep

713
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,560
and you'll be Tonight.

714
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,240
Yes.

715
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,520
It's lonely here with all the clouds as quite a Pepper stick in the breeze.

716
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,480
See?

717
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,640
We've come here for fishing and fish again.

718
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,400
There was caught a spy a few nights ago.

719
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,600
I heard from the Saintess that

720
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,560
she got news from Lotus Pavilion.

721
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,800
I don't know anything else.

722
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,440
I have no more words.

723
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Li Lian Hua?

724
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,760
The Four Gu Men just received a secret letter.

725
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,400
They are the ones who reported Li Lian Hua.

726
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,360
Li Lian Hua

727
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,480
It's six o'clock.

728
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,560
I can't wait any longer.

729
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,760
Who will fight with me?

730
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,160
I only hope that we can meet but not meet.

731
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,440
Life is too hasty.

732
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,280
I can't wait to see the old days.

733
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,800
The coming of the rain is long.

734
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,840
I have a deep wish.

735
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,640
Life is too hasty.

736
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:27,880
I have experienced it in the green hills and waves.

737
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:34,680
Who doesn't want to live a life?

738
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,280
Life is too hasty.

739
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:42,400
I can't wait to see the old days.

740
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,600
The coming of the rain is long.

741
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,600
I have a deep wish.

742
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,360
Life is too hasty.

743
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:56,000
I have experienced it in the green hills and waves.

744
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:02,600
Who doesn't want to live a life?
