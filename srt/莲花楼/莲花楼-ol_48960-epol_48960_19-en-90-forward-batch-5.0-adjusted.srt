[Episode 19]

4
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,710
Director Di, you covered up for me.

5
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,360
I owe you one.

6
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,380
Why did you bring him here?

7
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,360
You believe the Jinyuan Alliance

8
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,820
is to blame for your senior's death, don't you?

9
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,220
Director Di brought me here to tell you

10
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,979
that ten years ago,

11
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,820
Shan Gudao issued a challenge to me,

12
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,750
Four-faced Qingzun, and the King Bai of Fire.

13
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,790
We didn't take it seriously.

14
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,180
When we arrived at the place he told us,

15
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,530
we found Shan Gudao already dead.

16
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,000
It's my senior who issued the challenge.

17
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,950
This is the letter he sent them.

18
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:35,350
[The Jinyuan Alliance and the Sigu Sect have been at odds for years. A showdown is needed to put an end to the dispute.][I, Shan Gudao from the Sigu Sect, hereby issue a challenge to the Three Great Fighters from the Jinyuan Alliance. We'll fight to the death in the Yangsha Valley with heaven and earth as witnesses.]

00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,200
This is not my senior's handwriting.

21
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:43,880
My Lord.

22
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,940
How's that possible?

23
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,130
At this point,

24
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,920
there's no need for him to lie.

25
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,980
Shan Gudao's death was very strange.

26
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,790
That's why I took his body away

27
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,250
and let Shi Hun examine it.

28
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,770
Maybe someone deliberately sowed discord

29
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,250
between the Jinyuan Alliance and the Sigu Sect.

30
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,620
And the aftermath

31
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,810
didn't stop with the demises

32
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,810
of the Jinyuan Alliance and the Sigu Sect.

33
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,370
Who is behind it?

34
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,070
The death of my senior

35
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,820
may be the key to answering that question.

36
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,280
So you don't want to die now?

37
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,660
I won't prove you wrong.

38
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,440
Director Di,

39
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,720
don't you want to know what happened

40
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,010
ten years ago?

41
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,550
Of course I do.

42
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,170
The truth will eventually come to light.

43
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,420
But our competition

44
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,660
concerns my dignity.

45
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:26,910
After I find the Styx Flower

46
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,100
and you eat the Yin Grass,

47
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,180
you can regain your strength and fight me again.

48
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,380
I can help you find out the truth

49
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:33,710
after that.

50
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,060
First of all, I need to know

51
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,480
the relationship between the Jinyuan Alliance and Nanyin.

52
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,940
What on earth has the Jinyuan Alliance done?

53
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,130
Nanyin?

54
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,530
Doesn't ring a bell?

55
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,730
You forgot it so soon?

56
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,930
In the Yipin Tomb,

57
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,740
the wooden box you took away

58
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,260
was Princess Nanyin's dowry.

59
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,100
Don't you know that?

60
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,900
I was there for Weeping Guanyin.

61
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,590
Why would I take a wooden box?

62
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,520
I just learned that ten years ago,

63
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,380
it was Nanyin people who bought large quantities of gunpowder

64
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,310
from the Thunder Hall in Jiangnan.

65
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,660
I want to know

66
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,540
what makes you think the Jinyuan Alliance

67
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,940
is involved with Nanyin.

68
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,380
What else do you know?

69
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,420
Why don't you be honest with me?

70
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,550
Someone from Nanyin

71
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,720
bought gunpowder

72
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,250
and blew up everything you had in the East Sea.

73
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,320
Do you know

74
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,660
that Jiao Liqiao is from Nanyin?

75
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,570
Are you sure of that?

76
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,930
Director Di,

77
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,269
you got some family issues to attend to.

78
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,230
I'll come to you

79
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,240
after getting to the bottom of it.

80
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,820
I've been looking for you

81
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,180
yet you're hiding here drinking alone.

82
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,720
So you weren't the one who spat up blood

83
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,120
on the ground a while ago?

84
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,890
I'm much better now.

85
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,560
But you're not well enough to drink.

86
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:13,930
Here.

87
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,570
Take the medicine.

88
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,580
You're so clumsy.

89
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,580
I can do it myself.

90
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,110
You saved me despite our dispute.

91
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,680
Your attitude has changed a lot.

92
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,120
Thank you.

93
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,460
Don't thank me.

94
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,840
Maybe I should call you Mr. Glib.

95
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,920
You say lots of pretty things

96
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,380
and have a silver tongue.

97
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,470
But you barely mean

98
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,230
what you say.

99
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,740
You thanked me for saving your life,

100
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,670
but I don't think

101
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,260
you've ever

102
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,820
taken your life seriously.

103
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,760
I'm just afraid of death.

104
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,590
Thank you.

105
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,200
I mean it.

106
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,220
That can't change the fact

107
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,720
that you ratted me out.

108
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,770
Let me tell you something.

109
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,110
When I was in the villa these days,

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,330
I read lots of books and did some research.

111
00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:06,260
Research?

112
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,800
About what?

113
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:09,940
About you.

Don't you have something better to do?

116
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,190
I think

117
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,780
you used to be quite arrogant

118
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,200
and very talented.

119
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,030
Apart from being arrogant,

120
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,240
we're very alike.

121
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,970
You made a lot of friends,

122
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,280
but few of them were true friends.

123
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,260
Later, something big happened

124
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,310
and you ended up all alone.

125
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,460
Maybe you were betrayed by your best friend,

126
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,890
which made you mistrustful

127
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,580
and believe that you're better off being alone.

128
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,470
What do you say?

129
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,430
I guessed it right, didn't I?

130
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,110
No.

131

Alright.

bidding me farewell

and swearing never to talk to me again.

142

Shut up and take the medicine.

You have no appetite?

Thank you for your concern.

I've fully recovered.

160

I was about to tell Zijin

161

that there was no need to send for a physician.

162

Zijin cares for you very much.

163

Is that woman more skilled in martial arts now?

She flicked the Iced Cicada into my mouth.

What's worse

173
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,960
is that the Jinyuan Alliance

174
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,809
is coming for the 188 prisons.

175
00:08:49,909 --> 00:08:52,880
I heard that the Baichuan Court has 188 prisons

176
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,650
and the Jinyuan Alliance has broken into many of them recently.

177
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,490
The prison at the old address of the Sigu Sect

178
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,950
has been found by Di Feisheng.

179
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,280
It's not a coincidence.

180
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,160
The locations of the 188 prisons

181
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,310
are only known by me, Biqui, Bai, Shi,

182
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,550
and my most trusted disciples.

183
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,090
Someone must have spilled the beans,

184
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,600
or there wouldn't have been so many breaches.

185
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,240
Do you suspect anyone?

186
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,070
Without evidence,

187
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,120
I don't suspect anyone arbitrarily.

188
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,850
We just need to be more vigilant

189
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,380
and wait for the mole to give themselves away.

190
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:24,960
Mr. Ji.

191
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,560
The Sigu Sect fell into pieces ten years ago.

192
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,080
Only the Baichuan Court

193
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,370
still has its essence.

194
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,880
The last thing I want to hear

195
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,130
is that there's a traitor in the Baichuan Court.

196
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:35,550
If…

197
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,430
If Xiangyi were still alive,

198
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,840
he wouldn't want to see

199
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,670
this branch of the Sigu Sect fall apart.

200
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,200
Wanmian.

201
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,230
Li Xiangyi is gone.

202
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,350
The Sigu Sect is long gone as well.

203
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,620
Just leave this matter to Mr. Ji.

204
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,420
The Sigu Sect is gone.

205
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,450
But

206
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,340
as long as we're still dedicated to maintaining peace in the martial world,

207
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,600
and as long as we can join hands together,

208
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,650
how come the Sigu Sect won't be back?

209
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,380
You want to revive the Sigu Sect?

210
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,160
Is that what the Baichuan Court wants?

211
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,560
No.

212
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,860
That's what many people want.

213
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,660
For many years, Jiao Liqiao

214
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,310
has been causing disturbances everywhere with the remnants of the Jinyuan Alliance.

215
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:23,140
Di Feisheng has returned

216
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,640
and openly challenged us yesterday.

217
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,270
Everyone present was indignant.

218
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:29,840
They all hope

219
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,310
that the Sigu Sect can get back on its feet

220
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,840
to unite the martial world,

221
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,390
suppress Di Feisheng,

222
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,180
and wipe out the Jinyuan Alliance.

223
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:37,640
It seems

224
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,380
that you support this idea too.

225
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,470
For the Sigu Sect to come back,

226
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,750
a new Sect Leader is needed.

227
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,050
So I came to discuss it with you.

228
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,080
I've thought about it.

229
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,840
Zijin was the Left Guardian of the Sigu Sect.

230
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,740
You're the best suited for this position.

231
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,510
No, he's not.

232
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:04,280
I…

233
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,180
Reviving the Sigu Sect

234
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,290
can't be achieved overnight.

235
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,930
Mr. Ji, let me think about it.

236
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:18,560
OK.

237
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,110
I'll leave now.

238
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,360
Zijin, don't be angry.

239
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,460
You said

240
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,630
you're not interested in the affairs in the martial world.

241
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,300
That's why I…

242
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:46,830
Wanmian.

243
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:50,550
You seldom lie.

244
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,970
So when you do,

245
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,030
you make small gestures.

246
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,710
I know you very well.

247
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,490
Zijin.

248
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,860
-I don't mean…
-Of course you think

249
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,590
that I can't be the Sect Leader.

250
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,880
Because in your eyes,

251
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,850
only Li Xiangyi can be in that position.

252
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,690
You have never

253
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,050
gotten over him.

254
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,360
When I saved you from Di Feisheng,

255
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,900
you were groggy

256
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,260
but kept

257
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,300
calling Xiangyi.

258
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,730
For so many years,

259
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,020
you've been thinking about him

260
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,380
day and night,

261
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,450
haven't you?

262
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,920
It's not like that, Zijin.

263
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,350
Okay.

264
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,070
Let me ask you.

265
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,620
Why did you go to find Li Lianhua

266
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,220
right after you felt better?

267
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,750
Do you find him

268
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,690
familiar too?

269
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,230
You're not the only one.

270
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,290
Sometimes when I looked into his eyes,

271
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,350
I couldn't help but think of Xiangyi.

272
00:12:58,530 --> 00:12:59,030
So,

273
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,280
you tried to see Li Xiangyi

274
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,440
in Li Lianhua,

275
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,140
didn't you?

276
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:03,870
Zijin.

277
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:08,030
I never saw Xingyi in anyone.

278
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,710
My feelings for Xiangyi have changed.

279
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,330
He was a friend from the past.

280
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:15,830
A memory.

281
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:18,570
He

282
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,740
will never be the obstacle between us.

283
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,950
Trust me.

284
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,100
Okay.

285
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,520
I trust you.

286
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,530
I believe everything you say.

287
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:35,660
But

288
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,070
I have to change too.

289
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,630
Change?

290
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,850
I wasn't interested in reviving the Sigu Sect.

291
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:45,910
But now,

292
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,510
I've decided

293
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,120
to lead the Sigu Sect.

294
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,430
I'll prove to you

295
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,450
that I can do whatever Li Xiangyi could

296
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,140
and I can do better than him!

297
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,440
Share your wisdom,

298
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,230
contribute to the society,

299
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,220
and uphold justice.

300
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:07,970
Yes.

301
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:08,990
Well said.

302
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:09,950
Yes, well said.

303
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:10,710
Good.

304
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,140
Mr. Jiang,

305
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,830
are you going to Qingfeng Peak

306
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,570
to attend the reviving ceremony of the Sigu Sect too?

307
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,610
Yes, Fu.

308
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,100
I knew

309
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,730
you'd come for fun as well.

310
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,390
Not for fun.

311
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,590
We're going to shed blood and sweat for the Sigu Sect.

312
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,840
Nothing is more honorable

313
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,030
than dying for justice!

314
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,640
Great.

315
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,850
You young people are the future of the martial world.

316
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:30,490
Back then,

317
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,330
when Li Xiangyi became successful,

318
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,700
he was around your age.

319
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,260
The ceremony will start soon.

320
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:35,790
Let's go.

321
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:36,630
Let's go.

322
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:44,770
[Announcement: The martial world is afflicted by nuisances like the Jinyuan Alliance. The revival of the Sigu Sect is imperative.][At this critical moment, we earnestly appeal to all our esteemed friends, both old and new, to share your wisdom, contribute to the society, and uphold justice alongside the Sigu Sect.]

323
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:44,770
[The Sigu Sect, August 25th]

324
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,300
I was waiting in line to buy pork wontons.

325
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,700
Why did you bring me here?

326
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,980
Forget about wontons.

327
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,460
The revival of the Sigu Sect

328
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,670
is a once-in-a-lifetime event.

329
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,600
Without me, you can't even come in.

330
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,050
Hero Zhang, please.

331
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:05,330
Everyone,

332
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,900
during the decade when the Sigu Sect was defunct,

333
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,700
the martial world changed a lot.

334
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,750
The remnants of the Jinyuan Alliance

335
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,520
have bounced back

336
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,390
and become a nuisance again.

337
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,260
It's our duty to eliminate them and restore order.

338
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,810
By reviving the Sigu Sect,

339
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,950
we want to unify our friends, new and old,

340
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,540
to get rid of the evil forces together.

341
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,630
I won't flatter myself by thinking

342
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,790
that I deserve to be the Sect Leader.

343
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,920
I'm grateful to those who recommend me

344
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,290
and don't want to let them down.

345
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,490
So I'll lead the Sigu Sect for the time being.

346
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,290
I hereby announce this decision

347
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,310
and expect support from all of you.

348
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,610
Congratulations.

349
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,460
We'll do our best to help.

350
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,250
We want to join the Sigu Sect

351
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,660
to continue our predecessors' legacy.

352
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,790
It's a noble cause that's worth dying for!

353
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,460
Count me in.

354
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,760
-I'm in!
-Count me in.

355
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,820
Count me in.

356
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,710
Me too.

357
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,570
Count me in.

358
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,380
I'm in!

359
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,550
Me too.

360
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,540
-Great. I'll join…
-Here comes the Wanshen Clan.

361
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:09,240
Director Feng.

362
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,760
Welcome, Director Feng.

363
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,760
You tided us over

364
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,890
at a difficult time.

365
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,870
As the leader of the Nanshan Sect, I'm very grateful to you.

366
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:26,690
Everyone,

367
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,060
after Sect Leader Li passed away,

368
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,850
the Sigu Sect fell apart.

369
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,540
It was a great pity.

370
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,270
The news that Sect Leader Xiao and his friends

371
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,140
will pick up the pieces and revive the Sigu Sect

372
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,950
has spread throughout the martial world.

373
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,480
You have the full support of the Wanshen Clan.

374
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,190
We have allies all over the martial world.

375
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,570
Sect Leader Xiao,

376
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,870
if you need any help,

377
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,100
just say it.

378
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,470
Director Feng is right.

379
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,620
Yes.

380
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,460
He's not here to say congratulations.

381
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,590
He just wants to establish dominance.

382
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,370
Thank you, Director Feng.

383
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:14,960
In the past few years, I've stayed out of the martial world.

384
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,790
When I heard about the rising of the Wanshen Sect,

385
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,920
I was very relieved.

386
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,579
The martial world

387
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:21,430
needs new forces

388
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:22,950
to uphold justice.

389
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,160
The Wanshen Clan was established at a perilous time

390
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,420
and has since then been doing whatever we can

391
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,349
to keep order in the martial world.

392
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,750
We didn't expect

393
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,220
to get so many people's support

394
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,310
and become stronger and stronger

395
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,099
over the past decade.

396
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,080
More power means more responsibility.

397
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,130
I came here,

398
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,770
first, to congratulate the Sigu Sect.

399
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,360
Second, I want to tell the martial world

400
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,190
that if anyone meets any difficulties,

401
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,590
turn to the Wanshen Clan.

402
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,430
We'll do everything we can

403
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:53,720
to help you.

404
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,720
Director Feng is so nice.

405
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,620
The Wanshen Clan is a righteous organization

406
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,700
just like the Sigu Sect.

407
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,220
I believe that if we join forces,

408
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,350
we can definitely defeat the strong enemies

409
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,100
and eliminate the Jinyuan Alliance and Di Feisheng.

410
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,700
Of course,

411
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,570
you won't be helping us for nothing.

412
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,630
The Sigu Sect's secret books on martial arts

413
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,890
and exclusive elixirs

414
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,540
will be shared with you guys.

415
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:27,900
That's great.

416
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,380
Great.

417
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,630
That's great.

418
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,620
If Li Xiangyi were still alive,

419
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,360
would he be happy to hear that?

420
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,000
What's wrong?

421
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,030
They're not gathered here for justice.

422
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,880
They just want a share of the profits.

423
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,120
If the revival of the Sigu Sect

424
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,550
can't bring everyone together

425
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,490
for the cause of justice

426
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,250
and makes the martial world even more divided,

427
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,490
what's the point of reviving it?

428
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,490
That's nonsense!

429
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,240
Mind your own business.

430
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,570
You…

431
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:57,940
Am I wrong?

432
00:18:58,970 --> 00:18:59,770
Fang Xiaobao.

433
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,640
In my opinion,

434
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:07,560
we now don't know what the Jinyuan Alliance want.

435
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,090
So in the current situation,

436
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,890
if we pit ourselves against them,

437
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:14,290
many sects will get involved in conflicts.

438
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,980
Therefore, I suggest

439
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,460
staying our hand for now.

440
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,570
Evil forces

441
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,260
must be wiped out.

442
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,170
If we don't do it now,

443
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,350
should we wait until they rule the martial world?

444
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,780
The late Sect Leader Yi Xiangyi

445
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,240
established the Sigu Sect

446
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,060
to keep order in the martial world.

447
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,800
Do you have objections to that?

448
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,000
No.

449
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:49,900
I dare not.

[Yuanbao Villa]

451
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:15,440
[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

452
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:21,980
Are you leaving?

453
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:26,730
Mian.

454
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,910
It's time for me to leave.

455
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,690
The ceremony has just begun

456
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,720
yet you're leaving.

457
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,360
Have you really given up on the Sigu Sect?

458
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,700
I no longer belong in the martial world.

459
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,630
Besides,

460
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,260
the Sigu Sect

461
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,010
has its new leader now.

462
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,430
So,

463
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,650
you have no objection to Zijin being the Sect Leader?

464
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,240
I don't and never did.

465
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:56,620
Mian.

466
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,640
All this time,

467
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,070
I've meant what I said to you

468
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,470
and never lied to you.

469
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,260
Then

470
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,390
where will you go?

471
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,910
No need to worry about me.

472
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,150
Have you forgotten

473
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,610
that I have a mobile house?

474
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,310
I can go wherever I want.

475
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,730
There's such a big world

476
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:21,590
out there.

477
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,040
I can sail out into the sea

478
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,300
or climb up a mountain.

479
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,290
I have savings and a dog.

480
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:29,020
So don't worry about me.

481
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:31,910
That sounds good,

482
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,460
but you're all alone.

483
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,060
You know what?

484
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:42,990
In a blink of an eye,

485
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,880
ten years have passed.

486
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:47,690
Perhaps

487
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,070
it's not so bad an idea

488
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,060
to live like that.

489
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,640
Moreover,

490
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,050
it's a little cold on the mountain.

491
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:00,910
You feel cold?

492
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:01,940
Mian.

493
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,300
I'm a human, not a ghost.

494
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,590
Of course I feel cold.

495
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,950
You never talked about things like this before,

496
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,210
so I was…

497
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,590
I was surprised.

498
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,120
You're so different from Xiangyi.

499
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,080
He never appeared tired.

500
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,100
He was always busy

501
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,300
and barely slept.

502
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,940
Although he was a spendthrift

503
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,280
and liked

504
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,620
to order people around,

505
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,440
he could always make great achievements.

506
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,090
And Xiangyi never forgave anyone.

507
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,780
Unlike him,

508
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,190
I'm very poor

509
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,830
and just have enough to get by.

510
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,230
I love sleeping somewhere quiet.

511
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:59,750
It's relaxing.

512
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,250
I don't have any enemies.

513
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,830
I forgot to tell you this.

514
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,550
In the past decade,

515
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,010
I've learned to cook,

516
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,120
plant flowers,

517
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,500
and even sew.

518
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,190
I really like my life now.

519
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,390
I…

520
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,410
I need to go help Zijin.

521
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:24,990
Hope I can

522
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,150
get a chance to see your flowers.

523
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,130
I'll be waiting for you.

524
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,060
Yangzhouman.

525
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,360
It's really him.

526
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,370
[Here lies the late Sect Leader of the Sigu Sect, Li Xiangyi]

527
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:41,690
I wrote you a letter in Wanmian's handwriting to invite you here.

528
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:42,620
You really came.

529
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,410
Li Xiangyi.

530
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,580
Li Xiangyi is dead.

531
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,600
His grave is here.

532
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:50,940
Since you're dead,

533
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,140
why did you come back?

534
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,950
Can't you just leave Wanmian alone?

535
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,900
She mourned over you for ten years.

536
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,630
That's ten years of youth.

537
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:00,990
Do you know

538
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,190
how hard it was for her to move on?

539
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,490
Do you know how long I waited for her to come around?

540
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:08,710
Once you came back,

541
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,340
you ruined everything.

542
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:15,810
Zijin.

543
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,440
I'm just here to say congratulations.

544
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,450
I was about to leave.

545
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,880
So don't get me wrong.

546
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:25,930
I know

547
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:28,920
you and Mian are very close now.

548
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,670
I want to give you two my best wishes.

549
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:33,770
Close?

550
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:35,760
You're alive

551
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,560
and have come back.

552
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,960
How can we still be close?

553
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,020
The moment you let her recognize you,

554
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,120
you took her away from me.

555
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,180
Best wishes?

556
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:50,300
You actually came back to laugh at me, didn't you?

557
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,740
You think too much.

558
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,250
Li Xiangyi.

559
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,840
You're so famous.

560
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:00,620
People are still telling your story now.

561
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,470
Now that Jiao Liqiao and Di Feisheng have reappeared,

562
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,470
of course you want

563
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,710
to reclaim your reputation too.

564
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,490
That's why you contradicted me

565
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:12,340
during the reviving ceremony.

566
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,620
I just gave you a piece of sincere advice.

567
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,950
As for what the Sigu Sect

568
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,920
and other martial sects will do,

569
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,420
I won't interfere.

570
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,780
You and Mian love each other.

571
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,560
Even if I'm back,

572
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,560
your relationship won't be affected.

573
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,160
I'm worried

574
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,440
that Mian will abandon me for you.

575
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:32,920
Zijin.

576
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,650
Don't you trust Mian?

577
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,010
As long as you're alive,

578
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,360
I can't trust her.

579
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,500
You said you don't care about anything here.

580
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:42,850
Then promise me

581
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,060
that you'll never come back

582
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,460
and never see Mian again.

583
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,190
If I promise that,

584
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,150
will you believe me?

585
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,120
No.

586
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,800
Li Xiangyi is so willful.

587
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,640
He does whatever he wants.

588
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,770
If you want to steal Mian from me

589
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,110
and take the Sigu Sect back,

590
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,510
how can I stop you?

591
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:05,620
So?

592
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:10,520
Jump off.

593
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,560
I don't want to kill you.

594
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,780
The cliff is dozens of meters high.

595
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:19,710
If I jump off it,

596
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,690
I'll die for sure.

597
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,490
Bring it on.

598
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,410
Do we have to do this?

599
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:31,970
You know me.

600
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,660
I mean what I say.

601
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,740
Fast and clean.

602
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,860
You're still as arrogant as you used to be.

603
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,370
Zijin.

604
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,340
I don't want to fight you.

605
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,200
What if I insist

606
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,290
on fighting to the death?

607
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,120
Wait!

608
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,440
What are you doing?

609
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,410
What are you doing?

610
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,210
Mian.

611
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,040
Zijin recognized me.

612
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,280
It's been so long since I last sparred with him.

613
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,790
So we just had a match.

614
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:20,380
He has improved a lot.

615
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:22,220
Okay.

616
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,110
I see.

617
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:29,320
Zijin.

618
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,440
I wanted to tell you that he's Xiangyi,

619
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,840
but he wouldn't stay

620
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,860
and doesn't want to bother us.

621
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,380
Yes. It's time for me to leave.

622
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,680
Take care.

623
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:58,830
Zijin.

624
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:01,890
Even if he's back,

625
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:04,770
things have changed.

626
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:06,760
He left,

627
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,360
but I'm still by your side.

628
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:13,490
Can you be relieved now?

629
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,340
From now on,

630
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,260
let's forget about the past.

631
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,310
Stop seeing him as an enemy,

632
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:24,870
will you?

633
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:51,670
Welcome back.

634
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,800
Have you taken this place as your home?

635
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,690
I feel hungry

636
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,150
and saw the Lotus Tower when I went down the mountain.

637
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,390
I seldom cook.

638
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:00,850
You're lucky today.

639
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:01,730
Come, sit down.

640
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,180
Eat while they're hot.

641
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,130
What are you waiting for?

642
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,190
Eat before they get cold.

643
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,050
Come. Sit down.

644
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,120
Help yourself.

645
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,150
Come on.

646
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,110
Why did you go down the mountain?

647
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:13,570
The Sigu Sect needs all the help they can get.

648
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,140
I thought you'd stay there,

649
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,340
do your job,

650
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,930
and make some great achievements.

651
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,450
Isn't that your dream?

652
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:23,310
That's not the Sigu Sect I want to revive.

653
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,820
They should give it a new name.

654
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,150
Maybe the Revenge Sect.

655
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:30,710
You can't expect everyone to meet your standards.

656
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:32,690
I know.

657
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,050
But the Sigu Sect now

658
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,890
is encouraging big sects to merge and expand

659
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:38,680
in the name of annihilating the Jinyuan Alliance.

660
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,500
No one gives a fig

661
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,880
about those small sects.

662
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,790
It's so unfair.

663
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,590
The Sigu Sect back then would never do this.

664
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,380
In my opinion,

665
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,780
Li Xiangyi and the Sigu Sect

666
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,450
have become empty words they use to justify their wrongdoing.

667
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,970
Li Xiangyi wasn't always right.

668
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,650
I'm older than you.

669
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,730
I've heard a lot about him.

670
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,230
When he was young,

671
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,800
he was very petulant.

672
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,030
The downfall of the Sigu Sect

673
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,120
was partly his fault.

674
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,620
Someone said that

675
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,280
to me before.

676
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:22,990
But I've studied him,

677
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,210
he should be proud of himself!

678
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,650
There's a fine line

679
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,540
between proud and arrogant.

680
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,400
"Arrogant" is not a good word.

681
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,940
He was proud

682
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,910
because he had faith.

683
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,890
Faith is a great word.

684
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,620
No one is perfect.

685
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:42,590
Neither was he.

686
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,170
There are shadows

687
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,590
wherever there is light.

688
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:46,640
Yes.

689
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,640
Maybe Li Xiangyi was too proud.

690
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,380
But he established the Sigu Sect

691
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,040
to make the martial world a better place

692
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,820
where the strong didn't prey on the weak.

693
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,880
Look at those guys.

694
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,740
They're just a bunch of selfish posers!

695
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,630
If Li Xiangyi knew that someone could understand him

696
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:07,960
so well ten years later,

697
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:09,860
he'd be very glad.

698
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,660
Fang Duobing.

699
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:25,190
It's a pity that you're not a cook.

700
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,790
This is just one of my knacks.

701
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,300
Don't underestimate me.

702
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,300
Cherish me.

703
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,910
I didn't underestimate you.

704
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:42,950
To be honest,

705
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:45,930
I'm determined to make my own way in the martial world.

706
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,890
It's fine that you don't see me as your friend,

707
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:49,750
but don't see me like a kid either.

708
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,310
I only have one request.

709
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,910
Don't play tricks

710
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,360
to send me back to the Tianji Hall again, will you?

711
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,890
It was hard for me to escape.

712
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,530
Give it to me.

713
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,330
Let's put an end to the past.

714
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,350
Here.

715
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:20,380
To my new friend.

716
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:21,870
What?

717
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,750
Your new friend?

718
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,130
My best friend.

719
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:30,090
Wait.

720
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:31,920
Did you put something in the wine?

721
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,719
I've drunk it.

722
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,750
You've played me so many times.

723
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,420
I can handle it one more time.

724
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:43,900
You drink like a fish.

725
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,150
Since we're best friends now,

726
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:49,239
I won't keep anything from you.

727
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,699
I have to tell you something.

728
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:55,139
I just learned that Shan Gudao was not my uncle.

729
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,550
He was my father.

730
00:35:00,909 --> 00:35:02,510
You've found out about that?

731
00:35:03,449 --> 00:35:05,560
Y-You knew it?

732
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,909
What else are you hiding from me?

733
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,440
I just found it out.

734
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:14,130
When I was investigating the real cause of your father's death,

735
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,680
I learned that by accident.

736
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,350
The real cause?

737
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,300
Shan Gudao

738
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,450
was not killed by the Jinyuan Alliance.

739
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:31,910
But his death

740
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,790
started the dispute

741
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,450
between the Sigu Sect and the Jinyuan Alliance.

742
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,740
I think someone is pulling the strings

743
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,330
for a bigger goal.

744
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,220
It involves the Yu City,

745
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,420
the Yipin Tomb,

746
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,640
the Yuanbao Villa,

747
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,690
and the ice shard.

748
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,110
Nanyin played an important role in it.

749
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,560
But that's not all.

750
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,040
My biological mother

751
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,770
gave me a painting

752
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,730
of the ice shard.

753
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:11,880
Look.

754
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,200
How did your mother

755
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:21,760
get the ice shard?

756
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,930
Maybe it had something to do with Shan Gudao.

757
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,280
I've studied it carefully.

758
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,680
It's a key to some device.

759
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,390
There's probably more than one of them.

760
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,860
Perhaps someone wants to gather them

761
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,280
to open something.

762
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,080
My Lord.

763
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,960
Since you came back from Qingfeng Peak,

764
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,510
you've been so busy

765
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,240
that you haven't gotten time

766
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,440
to have a proper meal.

767
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,910
I prepared those dishes for you.

768
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:17,150
I've been thinking

769
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,650
if you're so busy

770
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,660
because I didn't

771
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,280
do my job well.

772
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,300
You've been doing great.

773
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,340
You helped me a lot by poisoning Qiao Wanmian

774
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,520
at Qingfeng Peak.

775
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,540
Sorry that I took action

776
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,110
without your permission.

777
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,280
I said you helped me a lot.

778
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,540
Why are you so nervous?

779
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,590
You're a better tactician

780
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,290
than me.

781
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,460
With you looking out for me,

782
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,220
I feel at ease.

783
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,380
I'm so happy

784
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,740
to get your recognition.

785
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,970
I'd like to drink to you

786
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,480
to thank you for your appreciation.

787
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,760
Gongyang Wumen said

788
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,970
only Yangzhouman can detoxify

789
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:39,600
the Iced Cicada he made.

790
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:44,260
I didn't expect that your inner power could detoxify it too.

791
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:49,360
Are you saying that Li Xiangyi's inner power is stronger than mine?

792
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,240
That came out wrong.

793
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,440
I'll drink as a punishment.

794
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:57,650
How many years have you been with me?

795
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,150
13 years.

796
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:03,900
All these years,

797
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,550
I've never asked you what you want.

798
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:09,280
I don't want anything.

799
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,270
I love you wholeheartedly.

800
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:13,990
But

801
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,920
the time has come for you to get married.

802
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,350
All I want

803
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,160
is to become your last

804
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,780
and only woman.

805
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,510
I'll get married,

806
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:30,250
but not to a woman whose background is a mystery.

807
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,710
You're a descendant of the royal family of Nanyin

808
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,240
but you never mentioned it.

809
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:41,790
How did you…

810
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:42,770
How did I know?

811
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,560
You're smart,

812
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:50,990
but you should know better than to get smart with me.

813
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,750
You misunderstood me, My Lord.

814
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,620
Since I started working for you,

815
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,780
I've believed that I belong with you.

816
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,790
That's why I never mentioned my motherland.

817
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:02,270
Fine.

818
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:03,910
Let me ask you.

819
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,880
Is there anyone else from Nanyin in the Central Plains?

820
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:08,850
My Lord.

821
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,140
I'm loyal to you

822
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,810
and have given you all my attention.

823
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,510
I don't know any other people from Nanyin.

824
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:18,070
Jiao Liqiao.

825
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,250
You never learn.

826
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,880
You never understand

827
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,610
what I really want.

828
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:26,900
From now on,

829
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,290
you can't interfere with anything in the Alliance.

830
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:30,810
My Lord.

831
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,570
Listen.

832
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,110
You don't belong with me,

833
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,180
but you may belong

834
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,680
with the traitors I killed with my sword.

835
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,070
He has found out

836
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,760
that I'm a descendant of the royal family of Nanyin.

837
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,780
What else does he know

838
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,600
besides that?

839
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,880
Don't let me find out who tipped him off

840
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,620
and made him suspicious.

841
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:54,830
Or I'll make them wish they were dead.

842
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,270
Don't panic, Saintess.

843
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:57,230
Go tell Feng Qing

844
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,940
to clean up the Thunder Hall.

845
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,000
Director Di can't know anything

846
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,800
about the gunpowder purchase.

847
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:09,850
Saintess,

848
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:10,700
I think

849
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:13,360
you should look out for yourself now.

850
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,520
Saintess, why don't you

851
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:18,150
rally your supporters in the martial world

852
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,320
and use them as your backup?

853
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,500
You'll have no worries then.

854
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,070
In my eyes,

855
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,410
those people are just a bunch of nobodies.

856
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:27,880
They're useful,

857
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:29,760
but all of them combined

858
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,050
are not comparable to Director Di.

859
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,660
Director Di is very powerful,

860
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,450
but you need to harden your heart

861
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:37,150
to get him under your control.

862
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,220
Just doing whatever he says

863
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,880
may have the opposite effect.

864
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:43,250
Do you know how they tame an eagle

865
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,800
on the prairie?

866
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,900
They crush its pride

867
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:47,990
and shatter its ego

868
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,570
to reinvent it.

869
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,940
The eagle will still be aggressive

870
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:52,960
and very fierce

871
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:53,840
when released,

872
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,250
but it'll only take orders from one person.

873
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,710
Snow Master.

874
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,380
Bring me that incense.

875
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:04,450
Yes.

876
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,480
What are you eating, Fox Spirit?

877
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:22,920
Li Lianhua.

878
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,580
You said my father's death

879
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,430
may be related to something he did.

880
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:27,110
I found

881
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,290
that he used to have four capable assistants

882
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:30,790
called Four Tigers with Silver Spears.

883
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:32,090
Two of them died on the battlefield.

884
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,080
One is missing.

885
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:34,960
The last one Liu Rujing

886
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,640
is a guard at the Ma Fortress in Fengzhou now.

887
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,900
It's not far from here.

888
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,470
If it's not far,

889
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,860
why didn't he come to Xiao Zijin's wedding?

890
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,270
Since the Sigu Sect disbanded,

891
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:45,430
he's been holding a grudge against Xiao Zijin.

892
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:47,360
Sounds like we need to go visit him.

893
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:48,850
Now?

894
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:50,260
Can you handle that?

895
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,070
I'm fine.

896
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:52,510
Well,

897
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,210
Ms. Qiao hasn't finished her wedding.

898
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:58,120
Won't you stay for her wedding?

899
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,090
No need.

900
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:04,670
Why are you looking at me?

901
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:06,330
Is there something on my face?

902
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:07,940
Look at you.

903
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,680
You look weak

904
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:12,350
and are just ordinary-looking.

905
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:13,580
What does

906
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:16,270
the most beautiful woman in the world see in you?

907
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,520
Shut up. You know nothing.

908
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,340
I know a lot!

909
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,220
The way Ms. Qiao looks at you

910
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,310
is very different.

911
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:25,650
Fang Xiaobao, how old are you?

912
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:27,690
You can already read women's minds?

913
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,640
She's just grateful to me for saving her life.

914
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,350
Understand?

915
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:31,790
Don't you miss Ms. Qiao?

916
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,110
If you want to take her away,

917
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:38,810
I can help you.

918
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,670
Let me repeat it.

919
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,540
We're not right for each other.

920
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,360
I mean it.

921
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,220
Many people oppose

922
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,170
their marriage.

923
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:50,100
They all say that Xiao Zijin

924
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:51,700
used to be Li Xiangyi's subordinate.

925
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:54,440
Everyone thinks the two of them are indebted to Li Xiangyi.

926
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,770
That's what Mian wants.

927
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,840
She deserves the best in the world.

928
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,760
Li Xiangyi

929
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,290
was not a good match for her.

930
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:03,430
Let's go.

931
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,720
Pack your things.

932
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:05,900
Are you a detective or not?

933
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,150
What have you been thinking all day?

934
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:08,600
Mock yourself all you want,

935
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,020
but you can't speak ill of my Master!
