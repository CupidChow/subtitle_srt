00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,950
It doesn't seem like she has been beaten up.

00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,150
But Young Master Guo,

6
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,910
what happened

7
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,310
before the bride died?

8
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,500
Nothing special.

9
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,650
After dinner that night,

10
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,360
Su went back to her room alone to try on the wedding dress again.

11
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,280
After the bride went back to her room,

12
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,930
nobody knew what happened?

13
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,780
Didn't the bride have a maid?

14
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,820
The bride lost the wedding shoes her mom made.

15
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,820
Her maid

16
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,540
went to her parents' home to take the wedding shoes a few days ago.

17
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:33,340
Actually, our Guo family's ancestral wedding dress

18
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,720
is accompanied with wedding shoes.

19
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,170
But according to local customs,

20
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,370
if the bride doesn't wear the wedding shoes her mom made

21
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,810
when she gets married,

22
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,380
it will be inauspicious.

23
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,110
She was not used to being served.

24
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,440
So she didn't ask other maids to serve her.

25
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,170
Who knew

26
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,260
something like this would happen?

27
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,940
How was the body found?

28
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,670
It was found under the bridge in the manor

29
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,440
by a servant.

30
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,980
The bodies of two wives my father remarried

31
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,540
were found there too.

32
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,980
Maybe the pond there is deep.

33
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,070
The long grass makes the shore slippery.

34
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,790
That's why they accidentally lost their footing.

35
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:02,920
What a coincidence.

36
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,950
These bodies

37
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,579
were found at the same place.

38
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,420
But according to the file, the way the bride died

39
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,780
is the same as the one in this coffin.

40
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,820
However,

43
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,340
Didn't the daughter of the escort agency

44
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,420
know how to swim?

45
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,490
Since she knew how to swim,

46
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,180
why did she drown?

47
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:29,680
The maid said the bride drank some wine that night.

48
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,410
On the night before the wedding,

49
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,670
the bride was drunk in her wedding dress.

50
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,920
Don't you think it's strange?

51

Why didn't I think of it?

52
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,230
Could it be that she didn't die accidentally

53
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,160
but was killed by someone?

54

are the same.

what we can find in this room.

Look at this.

00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,700
What's wrong?

94
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,270
I'm good at calligraphy and painting

95
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,720
and have read many books.

96
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,070
Let me explain it to you.

97
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,870
Look at this painting.

98
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,760
Its stroke style and ink movement

99
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,830
are basically the same as that one.

100
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,810
So I can conclude

101
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,159
this painting was also drawn by Shi Hu

102
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,010
Besides, the paper used for this painting

103
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,690
is batik rice paper in a moire pattern

104
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,350
interspersed with gold dust.

105
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,780
If I'm not mistaken,

106
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,220
this should be the work of Hanyue Studio.

107
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,620
When I was young, it was popular for a while.

108
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,900
It was about ten years ago.

109
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,540
But the paper was not well dip-dyed by ink washes.

110
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,540
It hasn't been released since then.

111
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,040
So these two paintings

112
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,660
were indeed drawn by Shi Hun at the same time.

113
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,700
It should be in May or June ten years ago.

114
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,440
Because this paper has a name

115
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,970
called May Gold Rice Paper.

116
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,670
That means

117
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,300
when Miss Qiao received

118
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,900
Shi Hun's safe letter,

119
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,360
it was in May ten years ago.

120
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,340
In that case,

121
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,020
Shi Hun has been missing

122
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,980
since then.

127

What does it mean?

128

Look.

129
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:11,460
Why are these flowers and trees so messy?

130
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,780
The other painting

131
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,730
is very neat.

132
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,610
Have you found all?

133
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,980
In this room,

134
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,260
only these two paintings are drawn by Shi Hun?

135
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,880
These are the only ones we can find now.

136
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,780
Why are you so rude?

137
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,090
How dare you break into my backyard?

138
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,020
F... F... Father.

139
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,510
You're getting more and more bold.

140
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,980
This is the old residence of my late wife Xu.

141
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,020
I respect you as heroes of Baichuan Academy.

142
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,440
So I treat you well.

143
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,580
I didn't expect you to be so rude.

144
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,409
You're such a liar.

145
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,020
Is this your courtesy?

146
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,810
What do you mean?

147
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,620
Since you've never seen Shi Hun,

148
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,150
why do his calligraphy and paintings appear in this room?

149
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:06,810
I remember it now.

150
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,710
So the Shi Hun you're looking for

151
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,570
is that person.

152
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,020
Ten years ago,

153
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,580
before Madam Xu married me,

154
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,590
she saved a person.

155
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,780
But he stayed in Cailian Manor for two or three days

156
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,580
and then left.

157
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,980
It's been a long time.

158
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,270
I almost forgot it.

159
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,220
Master Guo.

160
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,410
He left.

161
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,610
Where did he go?

162
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,700
I don't know.

163
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,660
As for this painting,

164
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,530
he probably drew it

165
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,360
to thank Madam Xu for saving him.

166
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,220
It has been here for so many years.

167
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,289
In that case,

168
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,030
Shi Hun indeed

169
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:46,990
lived in Cailian Manor for a while.

170
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,520
The murders in the manor

171
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,309
have nothing to do with him.

172
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,280
We were wrong about it.

173
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:54,890
Of course.

174
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,620
I told you

175
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,930
these were accidents.

176
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,810
All of you have checked it today.

177
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,480
You should believe it.

178
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,290
We think too much.

179
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,430
I have a favor to ask.

180
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,020
Detective Fang

181
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,940
has never been used to the noise in inns.

182
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,930
May he stay here for a night?

183
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,880
We only serve poets and artists.

184
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,340
What a coincidence.

185
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,100
I love poetry.

186
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,180
I'll write a Lotus poem for Master Guo

187
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,150
for tonight's stay.

188
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,570
Will you say no?

189
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,910
Cailian Manor has always been upright.

190
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,740
We'll open the door to welcome poets.

191
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,460
You can stay here.

192
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,580
Thank you.

193
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,210
Thank you.

194
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,370
Back then, the Thousand Shadows Traceless sect was powerful.

195
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,830
But Shi Hun wasn't that good at martial arts.

196
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,180
He covered it up.

197
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,220
What Thousand Shadows Traceless?

198
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,220
What Shi Hun?

199
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,750
What are you talking about?

200
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,340
Ten years ago,

201
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:08,340
in the East Sea battle, after Jinyuan Alliance

202
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,370
was defeated,

203
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,820
the Central Plain martial arts world wiped out their force.

204
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,870
Thousand Shadows Traceless

205
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,630
was the most powerful organization.

206
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,820
But I heard from Miss Qiao

207
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,290
that Shi Hun

208
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,130
was targeted by them at that time.

209
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,260
When he was injured,

210
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,550
he just rested for two days and then left.

211
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,590
I think

212
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,200
there must be something wrong.

213
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,330
That means Shi Hun didn't leave at all.

214
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,290
Guo Qian lied.

215
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:34,650
Yes. Mr. Fang.

216
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,080
You've made progress.

217
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:36,940
Since you know it,

218
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,140
why did you stop me from asking him more?

219
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,870
How could someone who deliberately concealed it

220
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,110
tell you the truth?

221
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:43,880
Wait.

222
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,740
Can you make it clear?

223
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,270
Don't talk in riddles in front of me, okay?

224
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,460
Ignorant.

225
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,930
Who is ignorant?

226
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,500
Calm down. Calm down.

227
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,700
Well.

228
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,940
It was ten years ago.

229
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,100
Back then, you were still young.

230
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,580
It's my fault for not telling you clearly.

231
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,380
It's my fault.

232
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,270
Let's go.

233
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,160
Can't you talk properly?

234
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,790
This is where the three bodies were found.

235
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,620
Besides the long grass on the slippery shore

236
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,400
indeed making it easy for people to fall into the water,

237
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,200
there seems to be nothing wrong.

238
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,990
But after all this time,

239
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,410
if there are any clues,

240
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,020
I'm afraid they've already been gone.

241
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,020
Not necessarily.

242
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,130
For example, when you just arrived at Cailian Manor,

243
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,500
you knew at once people are easy to fall from here.

244
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,490
Then why did people living here

245
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,620
lose their footing one after another?

246
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,040
Let's look around.

247
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,990
[Xueyu Town]

248
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,180
We've searched for a long time,

249
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,840
but didn't find any new clues.

250
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,100
[Cuihua Restaurant]

251
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,990
This restaurant.

252
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,360
Don't think about anything.

253
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,420
Let's go eat first.

254
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,940
Why do you only care about eating?

255
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,420
Since we're here,

256
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,260
let's try the local food

257
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,240
and taste local customs.

258
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,420
Maybe we'll find something new.

259
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:13,950
Let's go.

260
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,590
There're the most gossips in teahouses and taverns.

261
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,200
Fei,

262
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,400
you're smarter.

263
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,040
It's just to ask for information.

264
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,900
Everyone can think of that.

265
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,220
Waiter.

266
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:33,780
Sir.

267
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,540
Give us the best private room.

268
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,180
No need.

269
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,160
We sit there.

270
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,300
One meat dish and one vegetable dish. Thank you.

271
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:39,820
OK. OK.

272
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:41,750
Mr. Fang,

273
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,820
it's the money you earned.

274
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,760
Save it.

275
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,080
I heard that a few more bodies in the suburban graveyard

276
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,400
went missing.

277
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,320
Don't make a fuss.

278
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,470
Newly buried bodies

279
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,700
might have been taken away by some beasts.

280
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,610
It has happened many times these years.

281
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,450
Exactly.

282
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,730
Speaking of strange things,

283
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:06,370
recently,

284
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,780
another bride died in Cailian Manor.

285
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:09,980
Do you know it?

286
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,150
It's very abnormal.

287
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:14,340
Brothers,

288
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,180
I heard you mention Cailian Manor.

289
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,220
Yes.

290
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,500
Are you here to see the lotus too?

291
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,060
Yes.

292
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,420
May I ask

293
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,080
if Cailian Manor is hospitable?

294
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,140
Every year,

295
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,820
people come to Cai Lian Manor to see the lotus

296
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,020
in an endless stream.

297
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,230
But sir,

298
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,450
I advise you not to go there recently.

299
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:34,490
There,

300
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,880
someone just died.

301
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,010
Quite abnormal.

302
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,620
No bride

303
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,580
of Cai Lian Manor

304
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,190
can live until the wedding day.

305
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,850
The evil spirit haunts there.

306
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,170
It's so scary.

307
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,960
What evil spirit?

308
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,340
Maybe the lord of Cailian Manor

309
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,220
is meanspirited.

310
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,420
God is punishing him.

311
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,120
The lord has such a bad temper.

312
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:59,130
All servants in the manor aren't treated as human beings.

313
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,700
If anyone makes the lord unhappy,

314
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,130
he will be beaten to death.

315
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,800
I heard that Master Guo's first wife

316
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,260
was forced to death by him.

317
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,440
He's really bad.

318
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,840
In that case,

319
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,820
why did Madam Xu

320
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,390
marry him ten years ago?

321
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,260
You don't know.

322
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,560
I heard that Madam Xu was a musician.

323
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,940
Someone bought back her freedom

324
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,210
and she can live a luxurious life.

325
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,300
Everyone wants it.

326
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,190
Since then,

327
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,020
the Guo family replaced all the servants.

328
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,290
They may want to hide

329
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,930
something.
I’m sorry.

330
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:26,980
Please spare my life.

331
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,740
Please spare my life.

332
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,750
Beat her up!

333
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,990
Remember this.

334
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:30,960
Yes.

335
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,830
Brothers,

336
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,690
don't talk of people behind their backs.

337
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,950
It's not appropriate.

338
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:36,740
What?

339
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,270
I can't talk about that?

340
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,300
Look at the mad man in their family.

341
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,940
I guess the Lord forced him to be mad.

342
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,340
Yes.

343
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,620
I guess his honest son will be so soon.

344
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,000
Master Guo.

345
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,370
You three are here too.

346
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,730
Young Master Guo, are you out for a drink?

347
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,480
My uncle is sick again.

348
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,950
He likes the Eight Treasure Duck here.

349
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,750
So my father asked me to buy some.

350
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,850
I didn't expect to meet you here.

351
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,990
It's better to meet by chance.

352
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,230
Let's eat together.

353
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:22,790
Young Master Guo.

354
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,530
I'm sorry.

355
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,910
The guests said something harsh just now.

356
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,970
Please don't mind.

357
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,100
These dishes are

358
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,760
to apologize on their behalf.

359
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,400
It doesn't matter.

360
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,140
We didn't treat you well today.

361
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:35,690
Don't mention it.

362
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,630
After such an accident,

363
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,980
Young Master Guo is the saddest.

364
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,020
The manor is in chaos.

365
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,500
I treat you to a meal here.

366
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,210
We're flattered.

367
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,540
It's just a simple meal.

368
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,420
A squirrel mandarin fish.

369
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,090
Pork joint stewed with rock sugar.

370
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:52,820
Beef served with cilantro.

371
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,460
Steamed pork ribs.

372
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,220
Crispy chicken wings.

373
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,100
Braised pork tendons.

374
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,300
Stewed lamb chops.

375
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,050
Okay, wait a moment.

376
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,110
I'm really sorry.

377
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,300
Our cilantro is sold out today.

378
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,220
I've changed a plate of beef with celery for you.

379
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:14,900
It's okay.

380
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,750
Come on. Eat it while it's hot.

381
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,460
Please enjoy.

382
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,740
[Cailian Manor]

383
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,260
Granny Jiang, it's you.

384
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:07,970
Granny Jiang.

385
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,790
What are you doing here?

386
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,000
Drive out evil spirits.

387
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:13,870
Avoid ghosts.

388
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,260
There's a vengeful spirit here.

389
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,180
There's a vengeful spirit!

390
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:19,410
A vengeful spirit!

391
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,839
It's not far from the place where the bride drowned.

392
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,589
This is really scary.

393
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,099
Wait. Granny.

394
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,660
Do you remember

395
00:17:32,069 --> 00:17:33,420
the situation when Six Fingers Monster

396
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,680
appeared in the manor for the first time?

397
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,300
Ten years ago,

398
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:42,700
he suddenly appeared under your window

399
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,500
like a ghost.

400
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:56,090
The servants of Cailian Manor were all replaced ten years ago.

401
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,260
What happened?

402
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,170
All servants had to be replaced.

403
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:18,760
It's so late.

404
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,820
He went to his room.

405
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,090
He must be hiding something from me.

406
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,920
You're busy?

407
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,380
I thought about it.

408
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,530
Although there are inner walls in Cailian Manor,

409
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,980
the pond in the manor is connected with the outer river,

410
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,720
Lion Spirit probably fell into the waterway in the river

411
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,260
to escape from being traced

412
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,150
and swam into the manor.

413
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,010
Fortunately, Madam Xu saved him.

414
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:52,950
Strangely,

415
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,180
he disappeared

416
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:55,810
three days later.

417
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,490
And no one in the manor saw him.

418
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,740
Maybe he went out along the waterway?

419
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,290
I don't think so.

420
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,060
A person has been missing for ten years without sake.

421
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,900
I have a bad feeling about this.

422
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,280
Shi Hun has a habit of keeping records

423
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,820
after dealing with bodies.

424
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,690
As long as we find his notebook,

425
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,820
we can also find the body of Shan Gudao.

426
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:16,890
Di,

427
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,670
if you want to get rid of the Asura Grass,

428
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,070
don't waste your energy.

429
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,360
Nothing can do that

430
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,980
except the Xijing Trick.

431
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,530
You just

432
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,980
help me find Shi Hun.

433
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:28,940
I'm not like you.

434
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,120
Even without the Xijing Trick,

435
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,460
I won't let myself

436
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,860
lose all internal power.

437
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,380
You don't need to provoke me.

438
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,620
I think I'm living well now.

439
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,540
You liked to be a hero,

440
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,590
but now you'd rather be a disabled person.

441
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,970
Haven't you said that before?

442
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,220
My biggest weakness

443
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,730
is to be fond of being a hero.

444
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,090
I've changed.

445
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,390
If it weren't for

446
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,060
Fang protecting you,

447
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,960
how could you have gotten away with all dangers?

448
00:19:59,070 --> 00:19:59,900
But haven't I been living well

449
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,120
in the past ten years?

450
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,430
Speaking of Fang Duobing,

451
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,330
Di,

452
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,830
I want to give you some advise.

453
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,530
At least your identity is

454
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,220
my old friend for many years.

455
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,060
Can you just pretend a little

456
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,060
and stop making him suspect?

457
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,870
Are you afraid that he'll find out who you are?

458
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,930
You don't know how troublesome he is.

459
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,680
Afraid of trouble?

460
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,210
I'll kill him when I regain my power.

461
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:25,870
Di,

462
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,960
he is just an unimportant junior.

463
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,240
It's not that serious.

464
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,020
What are they talking about?

465
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,340
Why can't I hear anything clearly?

466
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:46,770
Who?

467
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,150
Guo Kun.

468
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,200
You know martial arts?

469
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,310
You can't run away.

470
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,600
You can't run away.

471
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,820
Where is he?

472
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,060
I'm tired.

473
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,390
Let him go first.

474
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,880
But I know who he is.

475
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,380
It's that mad Guo Kun.

476
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,760
Li Lianhua.

477
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,420
Why didn't you give me any response?

478
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,180
Have you already known it?

479
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,180
Mr. Fang,

480
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,220
Guo Kun is mad,

481
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,500
but can't you see that?

482
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,420
He walks very steadily.

483
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:00,020
It's like the long-lost Arhat Qian Kun Step.

484
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,500
As for Guo Qian,

485
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,180
when I asked him about Shi Hun,

486
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,760
he looked clearly flustered in his eyes.

487
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,740
He wants to use his internal force

488
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,190
to stop such breath,

489
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,840
but exposed his inner power.

490
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,700
He's a member of the Southwest Bagua Sect.

491
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,900
Can't you tell it?

492
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,280
Then why didn't you tell me?

493
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,220
We didn't expect you wouldn't be able to tell it.

494
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,020
I did.

495
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,270
I just didn't say it.

496
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,220
But you two

497
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,680
are not good at martial arts.

498
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,940
You're quite good at judging character.

499
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,970
We're not skilled in martial arts.

500
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,770
So we need to observe carefully.

501
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:31,330
Everyone in Cailian Manor is skilled.

502
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,690
They pretend not to know martial arts

503
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,210
and have nothing to do with Baichuan Academy.

504
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,570
I think they're just making excuses to stop our investigation.

505
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,030
In the middle of the night,

506
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,220
someone sneaked around my room with skeletons.

507
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,620
Cailian Manor really likes to play tricks.

508
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,630
Why did you

509
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,050
stayed together stealthily

510
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,510
In the middle of the night?

511
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,780
We...

512
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,070
It just occurred to us that

513
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:57,140
since it's said this wedding dress is the murderer,

514
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,570
we don't know

515
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,110
what this wedding dress looks like.

516
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:00,590
Right.

517
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,460
Guo Kun can't be found

518
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,300
in a while.

519
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:06,750
Let's go.

520
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,060
I'll show you myself.

521
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,500
[Cailian Manor]

522
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:24,360
[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

523
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:32,750
Go away! Go away! Go away!

524
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,640
It's just a wedding dress.

525
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:56,220
But here a complicated eighth-way Pan Wen lock is used.

526
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,150
It's a pity that it can't defeat me.

527
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,520
The clothes and jewelry are so plain.

528
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,420
Shouldn't the bride

529
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,640
be gorgeously and colorfully dressed?

530
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,360
This is not a wedding dress.

531
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,820
This is a silver mountain.

532
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,560
No taboo, no taboo.

533
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,210
You look so ignorant.

534
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,500
This is called pomegranate dress.

535
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,030
The crown is made of silver.

536
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,860
Plus this dress,

537
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,440
I'm afraid they'll weigh dozens of kilograms.

538
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,200
So heavy.

539
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,010
They will tire the bride out.

540
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,850
Guo Huo told me before

541
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,740
that this dress

542
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,220
was left by his ancestors.

543
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,590
It's very precious.

544
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,550
However precious it is,

545
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,150
it carries several lives.

546
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,780
I don't think anyone else

547
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,440
will wear this wedding dress.

548
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,860
Especially the daughter of Weiyuan Escort Agency.

549
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,600
She comes from a wealthy family.

550
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,860
There's no reason for her to compromise.

551
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,950
So I think

552
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,180
the murderer is very strange.

553
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,250
Because every time he killed someone,

554
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,310
he especially targeted at women in this wedding dress.

555
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,450
So, Fei.

556
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,430
If... I said if.

557
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,180
If someone is the bait,

558
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,330
the murderer might appear.

559
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,010
Good idea.

560
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:00,780
Right?

561
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:01,620
Fei.

562
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,570
Not only have you grown up,

563
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,260
but also you've become more and more perceptive.

564
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:05,740
Okay.

565
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,120
Put it on.

566
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,840
I have nothing to do with the case.

567
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,300
Excuse me.

568
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,350
Fei.

569
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,510
Have you forgotten what you promised?

570
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:17,490
Fang Duobing.

571
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,880
Why don't you have a try?

572
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,990
I guess none of us

573
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,520
want to wear this pomegranate dress.

574
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,260
To be fair,

575
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,300
let's play rock-paper-scissors.

576
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,220
Admit defeat.

577
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,420
The clothes are too heavy.

578
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,270
Well.

579
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,740
Let me go to kill someone.

580
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,520
I'll go with you.

581
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,070
Stop laughing. What's so funny?

582
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,070
Let me take a look.

583
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,580
Why is there no mirror in this room?

584
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,350
This is the bride's wedding room.

585
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,370
Without a mirror,

586
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,160
how can the bride make up

587
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,780
and try on the wedding dress?

588
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,410
Did someone move away the mirror?

589
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,250
It's outside.

590
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,160
Is this a mirror stone?

591
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,220
Did the bride come here every time

592
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,680
to look into the mirror in the wedding dress?

593
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:01,970
Be careful.

594
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,800
It's okay.

595
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:13,870
I see.

596
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:16,870
You can't run away!

597
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,290
Go to hell!

598
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,010
Where are you going?
Don’t move.

599
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,510
You can't run away.

600
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,790
Your martial arts skills haven't improved these years.

601
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,520
You're quite good at swimming.

602
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,370
Stop talking to me.

603
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:11,820
Listen.

604
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,260
This outfit is too heavy,

605
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,450
especially in the water.

606
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:16,110
Ordinary people can't get up.

607
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:18,250
You can't even handle a lunatic.

608
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,360
Do you still care about the reputation of the Sigu Sect?

609
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,350
The Sigu Sect has long been disbanded.

610
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,940
Why should we care about its reputation?

611
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,470
Besides,

612
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,570
can reputation solve the case?

613
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,670
Clean the bruises on your neck yourself.

614
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:34,950
Thank you.

615
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,780
You can't run away.

616
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,350
You can’t run away.
Li Lianhua, are you okay?

617
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:39,850
I'm fine.

618
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:40,480
It's nothing.

619
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,340
What happened?

620
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,340
Uncle.
Brother.

621
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:46,740
You...

622
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,580
What's going on?

623
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,220
I should ask you that.

624
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:52,590
Why did Mr. Guo

625
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,410
carry skeletons and

626
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,940
act like a ghost near our room in the middle of the night?

627
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,140
He attacked us when we are not prepared.

628
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,600
Did you conspire

629
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,820
to harm us

630
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,400
and then cover up the truth

631
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,670
in Cai Lian Manor?

632
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:04,930
Mr. Fang.

633
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,160
Is there any misunderstanding?

634
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,610
My uncle does know a little martial arts,

635
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,130
but he won't harm anyone.

636
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,910
Our Cailian Manor also

637
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,620
won't intend to harm you.

638
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,200
Master Guo,

639
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,460
I heard the opposite room

640
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,820
is for the bride who's married far away.

641
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,250
Because it's a long journey,

642
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,120
the bride will live there in advance, right?

643
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,010
So what?

644
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,110
Our Zhao clan has always been like this.

645
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,190
Why is there no mirror in this room?

646
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,340
The geomantic master came to see it before.

647
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,680
He said the mirror is not suitable for this room.

648
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,280
There's a raised stone here.

649
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,260
There's a row of Shoushan Stones by the lake.

650
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:43,960
Could it also be

651
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,660
the cause of geomantic omen?

652
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,270
This is a downhill.

653
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,310
The fortune and good luck can flow away

654
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:52,330
alongside the downhill.

655
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,690
I use Shoushan Stones to block it

656
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:54,840
and change the pattern.

657
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,840
As for this stone,

658
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,060
it's more normal.

659
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:58,830
What are you trying to say?

660
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,990
I risked my life

661
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,070
to react the way three brides died.

662
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,550
You acted so well.

663
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,830
You talk too much.

664
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,810
Actually, I really don't understand

665
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,940
what's wrong with this wedding dress.

666
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,600
So,

667
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,310
I just tried it.

668
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:21,070
Because there is no mirror in the room,

669
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,330
I came here to look into the mirror stone.

670
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,680
I didn't expect Guo Kun to show up with skeletons.

671
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,470
This is downhill.

672
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:40,900
Li Lianhua's dress

673
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:41,900
is very heavy.

674
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,720
So when a person falls,

675
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,510
it'll be hard to get up

676
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,150
due to the weight on his body.

677
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,180
He will also roll down the slope

678
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,840
because the body is too heavy.

679
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,340
The dress is too narrow.

680
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,870
It's hard for people to get up quickly.

681
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,500
That's why

682
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,660
Li Lianhua rolled down all the way

683
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,260
and fell into the lotus pond.

684
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,590
No wonder the brides

685
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,750
have fractures and scars everywhere.

686
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,580
That is thanks to your Shoushan Stones.

687
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:07,330
Yes.

688
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,590
If you pass out and fall into the water,

689
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,680
you'll drown.

690
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:22,810
If you didn't pass out,

691
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,270
since the wedding dress is so heavy,

692
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:26,600
you also can't save yourself in the water.

693
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:28,450
Li,

694
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,070
you mean

695
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,770
the three brides who died in our manor

696
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,130
fell into the pond

697
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,150
and drowned

698
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,390
due to the pomegranate dress.

699
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:39,430
That's right.

700
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,850
But their bodies

701
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,250
were found there.

702
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,060
How did they die here?

703
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,040
The water in the Lotus Pond is not stagnant.

704
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:50,140
Because the water leads to the outside river,

705
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,220
there is a hidden stream.

706
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,080
So the bodies were pushed to the bridge by the water.

707
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,530
The blooming lotus

708
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,890
blocked the bodies.

709
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,120
Li Lianhua.

710
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,120
When you were looking for clues

711
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,390
near the bridge where the bodies were found,

712
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,990
you had known the water there

713
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,140
actually leads to the bride's room,

714
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,340
right?

715
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,480
That's why you said you wanted to see the wedding dress.

716
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,080
What else?

717
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,400
Even then,

718
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,170
when those brides

719
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,740
looked into the mirror stone,

720
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,920
why did they suddenly trip?

721
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,260
You should ask Guo Kun.

722
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,010
Didn't someone

723
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,170
fall down like this?

724
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,900
Uncle went mad and scared the brides.

725
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,560
That's why…

726
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,470
You can't run away.

727
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:31,150
You can't run away.

728
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:32,500
I see.

729
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,430
It's my junior brother.

730
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,380
Bastard.

731
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,220
To be honest,

732
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,110
my brother has been mad since he was young.

733
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,450
At the age of marriage,

734
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,780
he would rush towards the brides in a wedding dress.

735
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:49,030
So I had to find someone to keep an eye on him

736
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,430
to avoid scaring others.

737
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:52,110
But I never thought...

738
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,700
It's all my fault.

739
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,870
He killed three people in a row.

740
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,850
I'll kill him today!

741
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:58,870
Guards!

742
00:33:59,020 --> 00:33:59,500
Wait.

743
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:00,650
Mr. Fang.

744
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:01,690
Master Guo.

745
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,660
Even if he started it,

746
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,430
we can't punish him without permission.

747
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,420
I will take the criminal

748
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,220
back to Baichuan Academy first.

749
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,980
I wonder

750
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:14,340
if the chaos just now

751
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,910
harmed the Lotus Tomb in the pond.

752
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:16,670
Take a look.

753
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,780
I still think something is wrong.

754
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,280
Every time the brides

755
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,909
looked into the mirror stone,

756
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:36,969
why did Guo Kun happen to go mad there?

757
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:38,830
And Master Guo

758
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,060
is so harsh on the servants.

759
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,330
How could he allow such a stone

760
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:44,860
to be unmoved for ten years?

761
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,330
Besides, that road just now

762
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:47,730
is a twin-star oriented.

763
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,520
There's no need for Shoushan stones to change the fate.

764
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,719
It doesn't match the geomantic theory.

765
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:54,060
Something is wrong.

766
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,650
There are too many coincidences.

767
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,739
Are you listening to me?

768
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,630
How is that possible, Mr. Fang?

769
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,380
I just

770
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,980
said my guess.

771
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,990
Guo Qian immediately believed Guo Kun did it.

772
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,600
There's something wrong.

773
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:14,150
Not to mention that after Madam Xu died,

774
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,470
where did Shi Hun go?

775
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,250
Wasn't it all for nothing?

776
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,010
You knew it very early?

777
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,820
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

778
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,750
I was thinking of

779
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,900
the Lotus Tomb that Guo Qian mentioned.

780
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,870
I think

781
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,670
it's a secret technique.

782
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,870
I heard a little about it.

783
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:29,900
Right?

784
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,550
I remember many years ago,

785
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,950
Jinyuan Alliance also learned

786
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,400
many strange secret techniques from the Blood Realm.

787
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:39,850
Yes.

788
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:42,970
You two are so knowledgeable.

789
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,410
Only I know nothing.

790
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:45,930
Mr. Fang,

791
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,260
today,

792
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,730
you are the most tired.

793
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,340
I'll make you a midnight snack tonight.

794
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,620
No need.

795
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,760
You want to run?

796
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:55,510
Come back.

797
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,050
What is it?

798
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,310
What is this?

799
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,290
I added chili in the lotus seed soup.

800
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:05,790
This is specially prepared for you.

801
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,500
Spicy wolfberry lotus seed soup.

802
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,860
The lotus seed in the pond is big and round.

803
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,510
It's a pity not to taste it.

804
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:12,570
Come on, try it.

805
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,490
Fei.

806
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,360
You did well tonight.

807
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,740
This soup is for you.

808
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,490
No need.

809
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:20,120
Save it for yourself.

810
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:34,810
Strange.

811
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,460
The lotus nut has a strange fragrance.

812
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,610
What did you add?

813
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,840
There is something wrong.

814
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,290
The lotus nut is red.

815
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:46,770
They do like these strange things.

816
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,310
Do they use this?

817
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:58,560
It depends.

818
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,630
What are you talking about?

819
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,430
Who are they?

820
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:01,880
Also,

821
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:04,520
where did you find this finger bone?

822
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,530
It is at the bottom of the lotus pond.

823
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,220
I touched it in the mud.

824
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,490
There are bodies in the lotus pond?

825
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:12,090
Yes.

826
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:13,910
There were many people just now.

827
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,240
We shouldn't alert them.

828
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,450
They have left now.

829
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,970
Let's go and have a look.

830
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,980
Guo Qian treasures the lotus pond.

831
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,780
Let's be careful.

832
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,780
Don't get caught.

833
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:37,460
Let's go.

834
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:48,930
This.

835
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:50,790
Go into the water.

836
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,330
You've always been weak.

837
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,390
You can't go down.

838
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:54,400
Fei.

839
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,940
Go down and have a look.

840
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,060
What?

841
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,810
You aren't even willing to help us with this?

842
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,610
Then you'd better not follow us.

843
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,100
I don't need you

844
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:05,240
to order me around.

845
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,920
What's the matter?

846
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,700
Can you keep your voice down?

847
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,000
Fang Duobing.

848
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:30,820
Fang Duobing.

849
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,480
Why did you provoke him?

850
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,800
After the case in Cailian Manor,

851
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,330
you'd better stay as far away from Fei

852
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,340
as possible.

853
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,470
What do you mean?

854
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,300
Do you think I bullied him?

855
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,870
I'm helping you.

856
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:47,900
I can't explain it clearly to you.

857
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,660
Lower your voice.

858
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:48,970
I...

859
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,470
What is this?

860
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,400
I'll remember it once.

861
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,530
Corpse Fragrance Flower Tomb.

862
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,170
Bodies at the bottom of the pond are all like this.

863
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:28,010
This is indeed the style of Shi Hun.

864
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:30,600
So this is the Lotus-cultivating Magic of Cailian Manor.

865
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,450
If such roots were planted by the pond,

866
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:33,320
they would have been discovered long ago.

867
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,650
The lotus was cultivated by human bodies.

868
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:36,930
You...

869
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:39,470
Many people know Corpse Fragrance Flower Tomb.

870
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,430
But only Shi Hun

871
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:42,010
knows how to do it.

872
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,100
It's impossible for him

873
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,980
to stay in Cailian Manor only for a while.

874
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,780
That's right.

875
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:48,090
Guo Qian is lying.

876
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,100
Jinyuan Alliance likes

877
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,250
these abnormal tricks.

878
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,250
It's not strange.

879
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,420
On the other hand

880
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,460
why do you know so much

881
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,860
about Jinyuan Alliance?

882
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,320
Here's the thing.

883
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,620
You'll naturally know it

884
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,480
after having been in the wide world for long, right?

885
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,140
Is that true?

886
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,690
Don't treat me like a fool, okay?

887
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,840
Shi Hun is just a small potato in Jinyuan Alliance.

888
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,640
He only has a little records in the file.

889
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,970
But you two know so much about Jinyuan Alliance.

890
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:17,700
Why are you looking for Shi Hun?

891
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:20,330
Fine.

892
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,420
Since you have discussed all the way

893
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,410
and have a tacit understanding,

894
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:24,860
but you're only not honest with me.

895
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,370
You can investigate this case yourselves.

896
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:27,120
I

897
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:27,920
quit.

898
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,060
I'm the detective.

899
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,280
Why did I end up

900
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,560
becoming an outsider?

901
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:46,690
Forget it.

902
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,040
I said I don't care.

903
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:52,930
That's not right.

904
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,540
Why does Fei know so much

905
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,690
about strange secret techniques and Jinyuan Alliance?

906
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,860
Won't Li Lianhua be in danger?

907
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,330
[This is Li Lianhua, the owner of Lotus Tower. Find out who he is.]

908
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,330
[This is Fei from South Sea Sect. Find out who he is.]

909
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,330
[Fang Quality]

910
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,700
Tianji Hall has been

911
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,380
in the wide world for so many years.

912
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,650
It's not difficult

913
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,040
to investigate their background.

914
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,880
You can hide your secrets if you want.

915
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:42,970
One day,

916
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:45,500
I'll let you ask me in person

917
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,300
to trust you again.
