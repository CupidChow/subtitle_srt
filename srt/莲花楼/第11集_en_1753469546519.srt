00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Ask

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
After four thousand times

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Thousands of times

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The most reluctant

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Is that moment

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
On the earth

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A thousand miles of madness

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who doesn't wander

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Who doesn't stand by the scattered clouds

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
On the edge of the cliff

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
On the earth

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Young and crazy

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The youth is not drunk like a grudge

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The world is like a dream

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
On the earth

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
A thousand miles of madness

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Who doesn't wander

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Who doesn't stand by the scattered clouds

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
On the edge of the cliff

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
On the earth

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Young and crazy

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The youth is not drunk like a grudge

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The world is like a dream

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
On the earth

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
On the earth

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The End

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
In fact, the wedding dress of our Guo family

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Is a match for wedding shoes

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But according to local customs

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
If the bride marries

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The wedding shoes made by the mother

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Is not suitable

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
She doesn't like others to serve

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So I didn't let other maids serve her

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Who knows

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This will happen later

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
How did you find this body?

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It was under the bridge in the village

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Jia Ding found it

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The two wives of my father Xu Qian

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Their corpse was also found there

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Maybe it's the water and stone call

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Maybe it's the water and stone call

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The grass is long and slippery

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So they accidentally lost their feet

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That's a coincidence

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Then these bodies

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Were all found in the same place

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But the death of the bride recorded in the scroll

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's the same as in this coffin

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The micro-signature is set on the ice sea

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The sign is gold

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Isn't it water?

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Since you know the water

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Why did you die from drowning?

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The maid said

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The bride drank some wine that night

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The night before the wedding

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The bride was drunk in wedding dress

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Don't you think it's strange?

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Why didn't I think of it?

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Could it be that she was not accidentally killed

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But killed by someone

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
But she just arrived in the bride's house not long ago

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
She had no grudge with anyone

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Who would kill her?

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I heard from my father

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You are looking for a strange person

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Said she came to our Cailian Village

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But no trace

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Could it be that you suspect her?

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What is this?

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Ten years ago when we let her go

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
She wrote a letter of thanks

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's the soul's handwriting

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This person is really in Cailian Village

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The back yard found her, follow me

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This is the place where the soul's handwriting was found

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
This is my father's first wife Xu Xian

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Xu He Yue's room

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The first woman who died in Cailian Village ten years ago

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The six-fingered weirdo you are looking for

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Has a connection with this Xu Niangzi

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Could it be that she is the murderer

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
She killed Xu Niangzi

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Killed my fiancee

89
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
She has been in our Cailian Village

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
She is the murderer

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
She killed my fiancee

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
She has been in our Cailian Village

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Killed

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Master Guo, you can't be so indecisive

95
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
But the dead people's thoughts are the same

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Maybe this case will be related

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Let's check first

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What can be found in this room?

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Look at this one

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What's wrong?

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Let me explain to you

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The master of the book

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The master of the book

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Look at this painting

105
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The brush stroke, the ink

106
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's basically the same as the painting

107
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So I can tell

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
This painting is also made by the soul

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And look at the paper used in this painting

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's the paper of the dead people's relics

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And there are gold powder on it

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
If I didn't guess it right

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
This should be the work of Han Yuezhai

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I was also a good student when I was a student

115
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's about ten years ago

116
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But this paper

117
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Because the ink is not good

118
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I didn't go abroad again

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Then these two paintings

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's indeed the soul of the dead

121
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Made in the same period

122
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's probably five or six months ago

123
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Because there is also a mute

124
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Called May Jingxuan

125
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That means

126
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The heroine of the bridge

127
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The heroine of the bridge received in the end

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The peace letter of the soul is

129
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
In May ten years ago

130
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So in this way

131
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The soul has disappeared at that time

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Day by day, plus six words

133
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The import of the book

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
The small wood, the ancient west

135
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What does this mean?

136
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Look at this painting

137
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Why are the flowers and plants so messy?

138
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
That painting just now is clearly very fair

139
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Did you find it clearly?

140
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
In this house

141
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Only these two paintings

142
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Is the soul doing?

143
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So far, I can only find these two

144
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Why are you so rude?

145
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
How dare you break into my back yard

146
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Father

147
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You dare to make your own decisions more and more

148
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This is the old situation of the late Xu Xian

149
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I respect you

150
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Heroes of the Baichuan Courtyard

151
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Good voice

152
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I didn't expect you

153
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I don't know the etiquette

154
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The owner's lie came straight to me

155
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
This is also etiquette

156
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What does this painting mean?

157
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You haven't seen the painting

158
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Why is his painting

159
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Will appear in this room

160
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I remember

161
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The soul you were looking for

162
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Is that person

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Ten years ago

164
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Before Xu Niangzi married me

165
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I did save a injured person

166
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But this person

167
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I lived in my Zhailian Village for two or three days and left

168
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's been too long

169
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I almost forgot

170
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Master Guo

171
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Where did this go?

172
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I don't know

173
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
As for this painting

174
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Maybe it's her

175
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
For the sake of thanking Xu Niangzi for saving her

176
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So many years

177
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I haven't moved here

178
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So this body

179
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It was indeed in this Zhailian Village

180
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's been there for a short time

181
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
These secret cases in the village

182
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's really not related to her

183
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's also our fault

184
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Of course

185
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I said before

186
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Today you all came to check

187
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You should believe it too

188
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
This is indeed what we think too much

189
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I have a request

190
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Our Fang Xingtan

191
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Never used to the roughness of the inn

192
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I don't know if I can

193
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Do a night in Guizhuang

194
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I only entertain

195
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Literate and inkwell

196
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That's too coincidental

197
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I like to do the right thing

198
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Tonight, I will give you a poem

199
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
A poem for today

200
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You won't disagree, will you?

201
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I have always been bright

202
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Open the door and welcome guests

203
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You can just stay

204
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Thank you

205
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Thank you

206
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It was a family of Qianying Wu Zong

207
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But the martial arts of the soul

208
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's not that strong

209
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's a mystery

210
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What Qianying Wu Zong

211
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What soulless martial arts

212
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What are you talking about

213
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
We said ten years ago

214
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
This East Sea Fishing Station

215
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
After the defeat

216
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The power of the Golden Oasis Alliance

217
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
This Qianying Wu Zong is this

218
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
An organization that is the most iron-hearted

219
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
But I heard it from Miss Qiao

220
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
This soul

221
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
They were watching

222
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm so tired

223
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I think this is a strange thing

224
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I think this is a strange thing

225
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
That is to say, the soul was not left at all

226
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It was Guo Qian's lie

227
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That's right, Fang Chengxian

228
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You know

229
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Why did you stop me from asking?

230
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
How can someone with a hidden heart

231
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Tell you the truth

232
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Wait, can you make it clear

233
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Don't be a mute in front of me

234
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I do not know

235
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You say you don't know

236
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I know you

237
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Don't be excited

238
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
This is what happened

239
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
This is all the old things ten years ago

240
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
At that time, you were of a higher age

241
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I didn't tell you about the newbies

242
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm leaving

243
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Can't you talk properly

244
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
This is the third time

245
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The position of the corpse

246
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Here, in addition to the grass and sand

247
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's really easy to fall into the water

248
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's strange

249
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But it's been so long

250
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
If there is any trace of death

251
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm afraid it's gone now

252
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
That's not necessarily

253
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
For example, you just arrived at this Cai Ling Village

254
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I can see that it's easy to fall here

255
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Then why are the people living here

256
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Look around

257
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I've been looking for a long time

258
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I didn't find any new clues

259
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
This is the house

260
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Don't think about anything, go to eat first

261
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
How do you know to eat

262
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Come and taste the local food

263
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Try to compare the people

264
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Maybe there is a new discovery

265
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
go

266
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The tea house is the most popular place

267
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The most famous

268
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Fei, you are a little smarter

269
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Just ask for information

270
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I didn't expect it

271
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Xiaolui

272
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Hey

273
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Sir, give me the best room

274
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
No need, we can sit there

275
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
One marriage, one dormitory, thank you

276
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
OK

277
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Mr. Fang, at least you worked hard

278
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What are you saving

279
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I heard that there are some bodies

280
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
in the mountains

281
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
What's the big surprise

282
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The new white desert

283
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Maybe it was carved by some beast

284
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
How many times have these been

285
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Just

286
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
To talk about strange things

287
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Recently, Cai Lianzhuang

288
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Another bride died

289
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Do you know

290
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Very evil

291
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Brothers

292
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I just mentioned Cai Lianzhuang for you

293
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yes, you are also here to enjoy the lotus

294
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yes

295
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Cat sister ask

296
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
This Cai Lianzhuang is usually good

297
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
This Cai Lianzhuang

298
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Every year, people who come to enjoy the lotus are indecisive

299
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
But this gentleman

300
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I advise you not to go recently

301
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
There was a person who just died

302
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The bride of Cai Lianzhuang

303
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
No bride can live to the day of marriage

304
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
There are evil spirits

305
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
This is so scary

306
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So scary

307
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
What evil spirits

308
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I think maybe it's the owner of the house

309
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
God punished him

310
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The temper of the owner

311
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Is too bad

312
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The servants in the house are not seen

313
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
As long as someone is not in his heart

314
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'll be beaten to death

315
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I heard that this old man's wife was also forced to die by him

316
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's not a thing

317
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So

318
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
The bride ten years ago

319
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Wei Youhai wants to marry her

320
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
This young man has something

321
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I heard that the bride is a musical instrument

322
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Someone is familiar with her

323
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Who doesn't want to

324
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Since then, Guo Jia changed the family name

325
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I don't know what to hide

326
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You know wrong

327
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Please forgive me

328
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Hit me hard

329
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yes

330
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Brothers, don't be long-winded

331
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
This is not good

332
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
What, you don't let people say

333
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Look at the crazy in their family

334
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I think his son

335
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Also soon

336
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Mr. Guo

337
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The three of you are here

338
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Young Master Guo also came out to drink

339
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
My second uncle is sick again

340
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
He has always loved the eight treasures here

341
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So my father asked me to come and buy some

342
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I didn't expect to meet a few here

343
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Then it's better to meet by chance

344
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Together

345
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Young Master Guo, I'm sorry

346
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Just now the guests said some bad words

347
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Don't mind

348
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
These little dishes, even if I take them to apologize to you

349
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
No problem

350
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Today is our Cailan Village

351
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Can't take care of it

352
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
What are you talking about

353
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
In addition to this

354
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Young Master Guo is the saddest

355
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Now the field is in chaos

356
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I invite you to eat a change of rice here

357
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
How can I be embarrassed

358
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
What's so embarrassing about a meal

359
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Come one

360
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Sweet potato salmon, rock candy, bamboo shoots, coriander, beef, steamed ribs

361
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Roasted chicken

362
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And a light lamb steak

363
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Ok wait

364
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Dear guests, I'm so sorry

365
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Today the coriander in this shop is sold out

366
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I changed everyone a piece of celery beef

367
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It's okay, it's okay

368
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Come on, eat while it's hot

369
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Enjoy your meal

370
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Uncle Jiang, it's you

371
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Uncle Jiang, what are you doing here

372
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Hush

373
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Go to the ghost

374
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
There is a ghost

375
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
There is a ghost

376
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
There is a ghost

377
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
This place is not far from the bride

378
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
This is a bit scary

379
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Wait, uncle

380
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Do you remember the first time six weird people

381
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Appeared in the village

382
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Ten years ago

383
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
That person

384
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Appeared in your window

385
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Like a ghost

386
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
The servants of Cailian Village ten years ago

387
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
All changed

388
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
What happened in the middle

389
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
All changed

390
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Go

391
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Go to the room so late

392
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
There must be something to hide from me

393
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Hey, I'm busy

394
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm busy

395
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I thought about it

396
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Although the Cailian Village has an inner wall

397
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
The pond in the village and the outer river are connected

398
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
The servants should be trying to avoid the pursuit

399
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Unfortunately fell into the river

400
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Swim into the village

401
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Fortunately, the bride saved

402
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Strange

403
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Three days later

404
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
He disappeared

405
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And no one in the village can see

406
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I don't think so

407
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
One person disappeared for ten years without a reason

408
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I always feel a little bad

409
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Prejudice

410
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
The habit of recording the records of the soul-dead process

411
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
As long as you find his record

412
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's also difficult to find the body of the Shanku knife

413
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Old brother

414
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You want to break this pheromone

415
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Don't waste your energy

416
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Except for washing the gold, no way

417
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You

418
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You'd better help me find this soul-dead treasure

419
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm not like you

420
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Even if there is no washing the gold

421
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I won't let myself become a

422
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Waste of energy

423
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You don't have to push me

424
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I think I'm doing pretty well now

425
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I used to like to be a hero

426
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Now I'd rather be a waste

427
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You said it before

428
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm the biggest shortcoming

429
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I like to be a hero

430
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I've changed it too

431
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
If there is no one on this road

432
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
The guy named Fang is protecting you

433
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'm afraid I'll be in danger

434
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
But I've been doing pretty well these ten years

435
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
But talking about this phlegm

436
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Old brother, I want to advise you

437
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
At least your current identity

438
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's also my old friend for many years

439
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You can't pretend a little bit

440
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Don't be suspicious of this kid anymore

441
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Afraid he knows your identity

442
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You don't know how much trouble this kid has

443
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Afraid of trouble

444
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Wait for me to restore my power

445
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm not talking about my father

446
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
A small back with a lack of strength

447
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Not really not really

448
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
What are these two talking about

449
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Why can't I hear it clearly

450
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Who

451
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Get up

452
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Zou

453
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Stay away

454
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Zou

455
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,600
computer

456
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,000
computer

457
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,500
Document KEY

458
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,000
Nintendo

459
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
love

460
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,320
Back!

461
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,320
Just call the staff here at the first time.

462
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,760
Where are they now?

463
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm tired.

464
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,080
Let them go first.

465
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,840
But I already know who that is.

466
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,400
It's that crazy Guo Kun.

467
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,680
Li Lian Hua,

468
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,760
why do you not tell me any of your reactions?

469
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,160
he would have known it long ago.

470
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,200
Young Master Fang,

471
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,240
although Guo Kun is crazy,

472
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,400
didn't you see that

473
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,320
he was walking very steadily.

474
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,200
He was like

475
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,000
the former official of the Ruohan Army

476
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,200
who had been lost for a long time.

477
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,480
As for Guo Qian,

478
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,040
when I asked him about the soul of the dead,

479
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,680
he was clearly confused.

480
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,640
He wanted to use his inner power

481
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,200
to resist this smell.

482
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,880
Instead, he exposed his inner power.

483
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,600
It was the surprise of the eight-storied door in the southwest.

484
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,000
Didn't you see that?

485
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,160
You knew it and didn't tell me.

486
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,120
We didn't expect you to not see it.

487
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,040
I saw it.

488
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,280
I didn't say it.

489
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,560
But your martial arts are not good.

490
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,120
You are quite good at watching people.

491
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,840
We need to observe carefully

492
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,440
because our martial arts are not good.

493
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,000
Everyone in this Cailian Village

494
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,800
is hiding their skills.

495
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,600
They even pretend to be not from the Central Plains.

496
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,080
It has nothing to do with the Baichuan Courtyard.

497
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:35,840
I think

498
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,680
they are clearly looking for an excuse

499
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,440
to stop us from investigating.

500
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,120
They were carrying a?l in the middle of the night

501
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,120
and were sneaking around at our door.

502
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,880
This Cailian Village

503
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,680
really loves to pretend to be a ghost.

504
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,560
Then what were you two

505
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,040
doing in the middle of the night

506
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,240
in the middle of the night?

507
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:48,920
Oh.

508
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,920
We...

509
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,240
We just suddenly remembered

510
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,040
that since we have already said that this wedding dress killed someone,

511
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,480
we don't know

512
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,000
what this wedding dress looks like.

513
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,760
That's true.

514
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,000
Anyway, this Guo Kun

515
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,440
will disappear in a while.

516
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,840
Let's go.

517
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,240
I will take you to see it myself.

518
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,840
Go away.

519
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,680
Go away.

520
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,600
Go away.

521
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,920
Go away.

522
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,040
Go away.

523
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,800
Go away.

524
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,720
Go away.

525
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,720
The

526
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,440
sowind⁉

527
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:06,120
As an Data

528
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,760
That bed has

529
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,960
made youhun

530
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,300
a facility care for the rear

531
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,360
your

532
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,160
No

533
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,980
if I go see her

534
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,960
H mesh

535
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,660
Whatever

536
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,920
I won't let messed up

537
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,660
f

538
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,360
I'm only

539
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,320
such beautiful paintings, isn't it?

540
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,240
She's not Ji's love.

541
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,460
This is theation.

542
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,540
Penetrate and practice.

543
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,040
hacen scenes like

544
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,080
This is called the 16th dress.

545
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,080
The head is made of silver.

546
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,200
And this dress must be a few pounds heavier.

547
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,160
It's so heavy.

548
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,160
It's not like others when you wear it.

549
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,600
I've already told you before.

550
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,200
This dress is the treasure left by her ancestors.

551
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,920
It's very precious.

552
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,280
But no matter how precious it is,

553
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,200
it also carries several lives.

554
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,200
It's unlikely that someone will wear this dress again.

555
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,560
Especially the daughter of the Weiyan Escort.

556
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,440
She is rich.

557
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,440
It's even more unreasonable to compromise.

558
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,960
So I think

559
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,560
this murderer is very strange.

560
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,080
Because every time he kills someone,

561
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,560
he especially looks for a woman in this wedding dress.

562
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,160
So, Fei,

563
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,240
if...

564
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,320
I mean if...

565
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,160
If someone can't get out of the right ear,

566
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,640
maybe this murderer will appear.

567
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,960
It's a good idea, right?

568
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,640
Fei, you've grown up along the way.

569
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,200
And you're getting better at sensing.

570
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,760
Okay, wear it.

571
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,240
The investigation has nothing to do with me.

572
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,680
I'm sorry.

573
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,240
Fei, you forgot what you promised.

574
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,400
Huang Zeming, do you want to try it?

575
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,280
I think none of us three men

576
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,320
would wear this dress.

577
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,160
In the name of justice,

578
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,760
let's decide.

579
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,360
Focus on the people!

580
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,200
Give in to the people?

581
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,960
I'm going to kill someone.

582
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,960
I'll go with you.

583
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,960
Stop laughing.

584
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,960
What's so funny?

585
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,960
I'll take a look.

586
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,960
Why isn't there a mirror in this room?

587
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,960
This is the bride's dowry.

588
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,960
If there's no mirror,

589
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,960
what if it's a dress?

590
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,960
What if it's a wedding dress?

591
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,960
Did someone move the mirror here?

592
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,960
I don't think so.

593
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,960
Someone moved the mirror here.

594
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,960
There's someone outside.

595
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,960
Is this a sword?

596
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,960
Does the bride come here

597
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,960
to find the mirror?

598
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,960
Be careful.

599
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,960
It's okay.

600
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,960
So that's how it is.

601
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,960
You can't run away.

602
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,960
Go to hell.

603
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
Go.

604
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,960
Where are you going?

605
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,960
I can't run anymore.

606
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,560
Your martial arts skills haven't improved.

607
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,560
You're good at swimming.

608
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,760
Don't talk to me.

609
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,760
Let me tell you.

610
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,960
This outfit is too much.

611
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,160
Especially when you were sleeping.

612
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,160
Normally, people can't get in.

613
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,960
You can't even hold a lunatic.

614
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,560
Do you still want to be in the temple?

615
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,160
The temple has long been gone.

616
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,560
What's the point of talking about it?

617
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,560
Besides,

618
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,560
can this waist band break?

619
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,560
Wipe the bruises on your neck.

620
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,160
Thanks.

621
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,360
I can't run anymore.

622
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,160
Lin Lihua, are you okay?

623
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,160
I'm fine. It's nothing.

624
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,760
What's going on?

625
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:43,560
Uncle.

626
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,960
Second Brother.

627
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,160
You...

628
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,360
What's going on?

629
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,360
I should be the one asking you.

630
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,760
You two,

631
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,160
why are you playing tricks

632
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,760
in front of our room?

633
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,960
You're taking advantage of others and attacking us.

634
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,760
Are you trying to

635
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,960
use us

636
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,160
to cover up the truth

637
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,160
about the death of your village?

638
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
Mr. Fang,

639
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,360
is there any misunderstanding?

640
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,360
My uncle is good at boxing.

641
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,560
But he never treats people with kindness.

642
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,760
Our village

643
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,760
doesn't even have a heart for you.

644
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,960
Master Guo,

645
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,360
I heard that this room

646
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,360
is for the bride of Yuan's family.

647
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,960
Because the road is long,

648
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,760
the bride will live in it in advance, right?

649
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,360
So what?

650
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,760
I'm always like this.

651
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,160
Why isn't there a mirror in this room?

652
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,960
Master Feng Shui came here before.

653
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,960
He said that this room

654
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,360
shouldn't be decorated with mirrors.

655
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,760
There's a stone that's been pulled up.

656
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,160
There are

657
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,760
a row of stone and stone pillars by the lake.

658
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,960
Is this also the reason for Feng Shui?

659
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,360
This is a matter of the next wave.

660
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,960
If we pick up the luck,

661
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,160
we'll leave it in the next wave.

662
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,560
We'll use the stone to block it

663
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,760
and change the pattern.

664
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,760
As for this stone,

665
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,160
it's even more normal.

666
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,160
What do you want to say?

667
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,960
I just gave this life

668
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,760
and re-acted the death of three brides.

669
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,760
You acted like a real one.

670
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,760
You talk too much.

671
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,560
Actually, I really don't understand

672
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,760
what kind of strange things are in this wedding dress.

673
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,360
So I tried acting.

674
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,960
Because there's no mirror in the room,

675
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,160
I walked to this place and saw the mirror.

676
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,560
I didn't expect the pavilion with the light of the torch to suddenly appear.

677
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,560
This is the lower floor.

678
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,360
The dress on Li Lian Hua is very heavy.

679
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,760
So after a person falls,

680
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,760
he will be pressed down because of the weight on his body.

681
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,960
It's not only difficult to get up,

682
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,360
but also because his body is too heavy,

683
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,360
he will roll down along the lower floor.

684
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,760
And the mouth of the 16-dress dress is too narrow.

685
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,760
It's also difficult to get up quickly.

686
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,560
So Li Lian Hua will roll down all the way

687
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,160
and fall into the lotus pond.

688
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,960
No wonder those brides have bones and scars all over them.

689
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,760
It's because of your stone.

690
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,360
Exactly.

691
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,560
If you fall into the water when you pass out,

692
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,560
you will die.

693
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,760
If you don't fall into the water,

694
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:26,960
the dress is so heavy that you can't save yourself.

695
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,560
Li Xiong, you mean

696
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,760
the three brides who died in our manor

697
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,760
were all because of this 16-dress dress?

698
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,560
They fell into the water and died.

699
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,960
That's right.

700
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,760
But...but their bodies were found over there.

701
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,560
How could they die here?

702
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,960
This lotus pond is not a dead water.

703
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,960
Because the river flows into the river,

704
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,160
there is a current,

705
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,960
so the body was pushed into the bridge line by the river.

706
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,360
The blooming lotus blocked the body.

707
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,960
Li Lian Hua, when you were finding clues

708
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,960
by the bridge, you already knew that the water

709
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,960
was actually flowing near the bride's room, right?

710
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,360
That's why you said you wanted to see the wedding dress.

711
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,560
What else?

712
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,960
Even so,

713
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,360
those brides were looking in front of the mirror.

714
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,960
Why did they suddenly fall?

715
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,960
That's why you should ask Guo Kun.

716
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,960
Didn't someone just fall down like that?

717
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,760
It was Uncle Li who was scared by these brides.

718
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,360
They...

719
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,360
They couldn't run away.

720
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,560
They couldn't run away.

721
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:35,160
I understand now. It was my second brother.

722
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,360
A scoundrel.

723
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,960
To be honest,

724
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,160
my second brother had a stroke since he was little.

725
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,960
When he reached the age of the Cheng family,

726
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,960
he saw the brides who were wearing the wedding dress rush over.

727
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,960
So I had to find someone to watch him

728
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,560
in case I would scare someone else.

729
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,960
But I never thought that it was all my fault.

730
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,360
I caused him to hurt three people.

731
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,160
Today, I will kill him.

732
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:58,960
Guards!

733
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,960
Wait!

734
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,960
Lord Fang.

735
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,960
Chief Guo, even if it was him,

736
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,360
we can't just go on a wild trip.

737
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,160
I will bring the people of Fan's clan back to the Bai Chuan Courtyard

738
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,960
and make a decision.

739
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,360
I wonder if the chaos

740
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,760
that happened just now hurt the lotus seeds in the pond.

741
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,560
Go and have a look.

742
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,560
I still feel something is wrong.

743
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,760
Why does every time the bride looks at the mirror before the ceremony,

744
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,760
Guo Kun just went crazy before the ceremony?

745
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,360
And this Chief Guo

746
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,560
clearly pities the servants.

747
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,760
How could he allow such a stone to move for ten years?

748
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,160
Moreover, that road just now

749
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,560
was a double-edged arrow.

750
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,360
It didn't need to be moved when it was being moved.

751
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,760
It doesn't fit the saying of the wind and water.

752
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,560
There is something wrong.

753
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,560
There are too many questions.

754
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,760
Are you not listening to me?

755
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,360
How could that be, Lord Fang?

756
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,160
I was just talking about my own guess.

757
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,960
This Guo Qian immediately thought that you were done by Guo Kun.

758
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,760
There is something wrong with that.

759
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,160
Not to mention that the bride is dead.

760
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,760
Where did the dead soul go?

761
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,560
It was a waste of time.

762
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,360
Then you already knew it.

763
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,760
You didn't say it earlier.

764
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,960
I was just thinking.

765
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,760
The lotus seed that Guo Qian said,

766
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,360
I think it's a kind of secret trick.

767
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,360
I also have a little knowledge.

768
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,760
Is that so?

769
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,760
I remember that many years ago,

770
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,960
King of the Golden Abyss also learned from Xuan Yu

771
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,360
a lot of these strange secrets.

772
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,360
That's right.

773
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,960
You two have a lot of knowledge.

774
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,160
Only I don't know anything.

775
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,560
Hey, Fang Shaoqiao.

776
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,160
Today, you worked the hardest.

777
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,760
Tonight, I'll make you a midnight snack.

778
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,760
No need.

779
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,960
You want to run away?

780
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,960
Hey, hey, hey.

781
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,960
What is it again?

782
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,760
What is this?

783
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,160
Chili in lotus seed soup?

784
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,760
This is specially prepared for you.

785
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,360
Spicy dog chicken lotus seed soup.

786
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,960
The lotus seed in the lotus seed is big and round.

787
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,560
You can't eat it all at once.

788
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,960
Hurry and taste it.

789
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,360
Fei, you did well tonight.

790
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,760
This bowl of soup is for you.

791
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,760
No need.

792
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,560
Keep it for yourself.

793
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,160
That's weird.

794
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,360
This lotus seed has a strange scent.

795
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,160
What did you add?

796
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,160
There is indeed something wrong.

797
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,360
This lotus seed is actually red.

798
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,560
They indeed like to do these weird things.

799
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,960
Then they can use this thing.

800
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,960
Don't look at the situation.

801
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,360
What are you talking about?

802
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,160
Who are they?

803
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:05,160
Also, where did you find this finger bone?

804
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,560
It fell into the lotus seed just now.

805
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,760
I touched it in the clouds.

806
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,160
There is an accident here.

807
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,560
That's right.

808
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,960
There were a lot of people here just now.

809
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,360
Now that everyone has left,

810
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,960
let's go and take a look.

811
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,760
If this lotus seed is too precious,

812
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,960
we might get caught.

813
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,760
Let's go.

814
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,360
Let's go.

815
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,760
Huan'er, this...

816
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,960
this lower bridge...

817
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,360
Your body is always weak.

818
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,960
It's not good to go down.

819
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,360
Fei, go down and take a look.

820
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,560
What?

821
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,760
You don't even want to help with such a small matter?

822
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,760
Then you'd better not follow us.

823
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,160
I don't need you,

824
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,560
a little kid, to guide me

825
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,160
when I'm following someone.

826
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,560
What's wrong with you two?

827
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,160
Can you be quiet?

828
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,160
Fang Doubin!

829
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,560
Fang Doubin,

830
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,160
what are you doing with him?

831
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,360
After you finish picking that paper,

832
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,760
you'd better stay away from Fei.

833
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,760
The farther, the better.

834
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,960
Okay.

835
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,760
What do you mean?

836
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,360
You think I'm bullying him, right?

837
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,760
I'm helping you.

838
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,760
I know what you're saying.

839
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,560
Keep your voice down.

840
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,560
I...

841
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,360
What's this?

842
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,960
I'll give you a lesson.

843
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,960
It's a lotus seed.

844
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,360
The bodies in the pond are like this.

845
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,360
This is indeed the technique of the soul-losing spirit.

846
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,960
So this is the secret technique of the cultivation of lotus in the Lotus Manor.

847
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,760
This kind of root plant is planted by the pond.

848
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,760
It was discovered long ago.

849
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,360
This lotus is grown by human bodies.

850
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,760
You...

851
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,960
I know there are many people who know the lotus seed.

852
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,360
But I know how to do it.

853
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,560
As long as you know how to do it,

854
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,960
I'll help you.

855
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,360
I'll help you.

856
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,160
But the only thing I know how to do is to be a soul.

857
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,560
Then he can't be in the lotus seed

858
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,960
and plant it in the pond.

859
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,960
That's right.

860
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,560
Guo Qian is lying.

861
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,360
The people of the Golden Thread Embroidery

862
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,160
like to use these strange methods.

863
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,360
It's not strange.

864
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,760
Then let's get back to the point.

865
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,760
Why do you know so much about the people of the Golden Thread Embroidery?

866
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,360
Well,

867
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,560
you've been walking in the field for a long time.

868
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,360
You know it, right?

869
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,760
Is that so?

870
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,760
Don't take me for a fool, okay?

871
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,760
The soul is just a small figure in the Golden Thread Embroidery.

872
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,560
There are very few documents on the scroll.

873
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,960
But you two know so much about the Golden Thread Embroidery.

874
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,160
Why do you want to find this soul?

875
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,760
Okay.

876
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,360
Since you have been so close and so understanding,

877
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,760
but you're not honest with me,

878
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,360
then you can investigate this case yourself.

879
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,760
I'm not doing it.

880
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,760
I'm the one who's investigating the case.

881
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,360
How come I'm the one who's becoming an outsider in the end?

882
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,360
Forget it.

883
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,160
I said I don't care, but I don't care.

884
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,760
That's not right.

885
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,760
Why does Fei know so much about the Ghostly Spirit,

886
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,560
the Secret Service and the Golden Thread Embroidery?

887
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,560
Is Li Lian Hua in danger?

888
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,760
I'll investigate further more than usual.

889
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,760
Now I Zumie is estimated to be in danger.

890
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,560
combinations

891
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:30,760
The instigation of composed girl

892
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,160
Blinded concept

893
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,560
The C sewage system

894
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:34,960
Dep 코로나

895
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,160
Is к122

896
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:35,620
Forever

897
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,160
Strange

898
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:36,320
Severe

899
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:36,920
Twice

900
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,460
Once

901
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,660
I'll let you tell me in person one day.

902
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,820
I'll wake you up again.

903
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,500
Yuan Mingzhe!

904
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,700
Yuan Mingzhe!

905
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,700
Yuan Mingzhe!

906
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,700
Yuan Mingzhe!

907
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,700
Yuan Mingzhe!

908
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,940
I was too careless.

909
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:12,700
I couldn't wait for the old sky to turn yellow.

910
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,140
The next day, it will be a new beginning.

911
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:18,260
I want to change my life.

912
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:21,060
I was too careless.

913
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:26,300
I'm in love with the green hills and green fields.

914
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:33,500
Who doesn't want to live a life of loneliness?

915
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:41,540
I was born poor, yet still capable.

916
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:46,220
Faced with the cycles of life, and canonized by a flourishing love.

917
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,500
I want to live a life spans monkey and deer.

918
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:52,020
Karst, Styles and Following Stars

919
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,300
I just want to chase after this light.

920
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,280
Ooh oh.

921
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,500
The one that knows PAUL once,

922
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,700
and that he can control no one else.

923
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:04,220
I want to cable through and touch the memory of LUO.

924
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:37,220
I want to change my destiny.

925
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:40,220
People are too reckless.

926
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:45,220
In this endless journey, we have to go through a lot.

927
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:52,220
Who doesn't want to give up their story?

928
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:57,220
People are too reckless.

929
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:59,220
They can't wait to see the old days.

930
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:02,220
The long day will come again.

931
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:05,220
I want to change my destiny.

932
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:08,220
People are too reckless.

933
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:13,220
In this endless journey, we have to go through a lot.

934
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:20,220
Who doesn't want to give up their story?

935
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:35,220
The Long Day of Love
