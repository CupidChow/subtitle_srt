[Episode 5]

4
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,539
You know that if we examine Young Miss Qiushuang's body,

5
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:41,180
and ask the guards presented at the scene,

6
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,060
we would definitely spot the flaws.

7
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,860
So, you burned the body at night.

8
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:46,280
But you never expected

9
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,539
that Madam Yu would come back early

10
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:51,110
to retrieve the body that hadn’t been completely burned.

11
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,310
What a pity, Madam Yu.

12
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,900
You were burning with anger,

13
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,560
and you killed all the guards.

14
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,180
So that they will never have a chance to speak.

15
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,610
You didn't care about the guards' lives, and that's

16
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,320
what made you fell into the murderer's trap.

17
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,789
You're so shrewd and deep.

18
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:27,950
Miss Yun,

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,260
you're still infatuated with Master Yu.

20
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,900
But he was going to kill you tonight.

21
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,780
Such a person

22
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,990
doesn’t deserve your defence.

23
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,180
At Xiaomian Inn,

24
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,560
that Soul-snatching Needle

25
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,250
was also stopped by the jade gifted by

26
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,510
Young Miss Qiushuang.

27
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,550
She's been protecting you.

28
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,460
You should give her justice.

29
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,470
Yes.

30
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,880
I was wrong.

31
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,820
It’s my fault.

32
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,680
He wanted the Soul-snatching Needle

33
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,490
to find out the secret inside back then.

34
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,020
So I secretly gave it to him.

35
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,960
I never thought that...

36
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,220
Yu Mulan.

37
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,500
You should

38
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,820
admit all the things you did.

39
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,410
You're not good at martial arts. Be careful.

40
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,840
It's Air-slashing Smack.

41
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,470
I want to avenge Qiushuang.

42
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,440
Fang Duobing.

43
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:43,970
Stop her!

44
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,600
What are you doing?

45
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,950
If Madam Yu wants to avenge your sister,

46
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,460
I'm afraid you need to wait in line.

47
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,390
What do you mean?

48
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,720
Madam Yu, don't forget

49
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,170
that Young Miss Qiushuang was severely injured before she died.

50
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,700
We've been wondering how the wound is caused.

51
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,020
Our question is solved

52
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,550
when I saw Young Master Zongzheng's move just now.

53
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,900
Young Master Zongzheng.

54
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,920
This skill can shatter

55
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,340
one's internal organs without hurting the skin.

56
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,470
It must be Air-slashing Smack, right?

57
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,680
I've been curious about it too.

58
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,860
Yu Mulan has the Soul-snatching Needle

59
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,270
that can kill Yu Qiushuang on the spot.

60
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,640
So what's the need to give her a smack?

61
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,100
Now that I think about it,

62
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,730
all my doubts are cleared.

63
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,800
She was killed twice

64
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,850
because the two moves came from two different people.

65
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,100
Young Master Zongzheng,

66
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,850
you hit that Air-slashing Smack, right?

67
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,540
I can do that.

68
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,409
But why would I kill her?

69
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:01,530
Why?

70
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,370
Because you have an affair with Madam Yu,

71
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,240
and Young Miss Qiushuang ran into it.

72
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,420
You are scented with

73
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,780
the osmanthus fragrance in Madam Yu's bedroom.

74
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,020
Meanwhile, Master Yu who has been sleeping in the guest room for years

75
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,080
has no scent on him.

76
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,980
In the moment of heat,

77
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,070
Madam Yu has been very protective of you just now.

78
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,570
All these years,

79
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,670
you never slept with me

80
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,480
or looked at me.

81
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:39,790
It turns out...

82
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,040
I'm not pure,

83
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,950
but you're no better.

84
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,000
Shut up!

85
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,370
It's you.

86
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,330
Did you really kill Qiushuang?

87
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,140
I...

88
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,990
I hit her,

89
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,020
but I didn't mean it.

90
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,720
I met Hongzhu outside that day

91
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,060
because I wanted to cut ties with her.

92
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,280
But Hongzhu was so angry,

93
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,540
I couldn't just leave.

94
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,420
So I chased her to her bedroom to comfort her.

95
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,340
Hongzhu's temperament is fiery, like fire.

96
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,140
I had been persuading her for a long time

97
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,470
to calm down so that she could listen to me.

98
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,540
But then I suddenly heard a noise outside the window.

99
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,400
We can't let anyone know about us.

100
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,960
So I hit outside the window in a panic.

101
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,170
Later when I looked out the window,

102
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,300
I didn't see anyone.

103
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,020
I didn't know it was Qiushuang.

104
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,970
So it was you who killed your sister.

105
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:57,940
It's Karma.

106
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,780
We were all part of it.

107
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,400
She shouldn't have died.

108
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,130
It was us.

109
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,870
It was we who killed her.

110
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,670
I didn't dare to save her.

111
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,929
And I didnn't dare to admit it.

112
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,500
I've been

113
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,140
playing innocent with you and shirking

114
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,870
my responsibilities, saying that it was the ghost that killed her.

115
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,730
It's me!

116
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,720
It's me.

117
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,210
After Qiushuang was hit,

118
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,650
she had nowhere to go in Yucheng.

119
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,260
She could only come to me,

120
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,360
her best friend.

121
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,420
Qiushuang.

122
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,800
But she saw me meeting Yu Mulan in private.

123
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,860
Don't get me wrong.

124
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,100
It's not what you think.

125
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,300
She was badly injured.

126
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,780
How desperate must she have been at that time?

127
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,270
But Yu Mulan,

128
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,330
you're worried that it might be exposed.

129
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,710
So you killed her again.

130
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,390
In order to survive,

131
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,060
I could only play dumb even though I know

132
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,780
that you wanted to kill me.

133
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,400
Try it.

134
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,390
Thank you.

135
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,100
It'll keep you safe.

136
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,680
I didn't deserve to be her friend.

137
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,470
I didn't deserve to be her best friend.

138
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,180
I didn't deserve it.

139
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,920
Poor thing.

140
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,880
None of the people she loved loved her.

141
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,430
And none of them wanted to leave her alive.

142
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,640
It's my fault.

143
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,950
I shouldn't have...

144
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:46,940
You told me there was no one outside.

145
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,000
It was my illusion.

146
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,820
Why didn't you tell me

147
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,350
that she had been killed by your Air-slashing Smack?

148
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,150
Calm down.

149
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,790
She had been following us from the back of the mountain.

150
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,350
What else could I do?

151
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,820
We talked a lot that day.

152
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,700
There's something that can be told.

153
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,160
and something that can't.

154
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:11,310
Otherwise,

155
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,780
did you want her to spread the words?

156
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:19,390
I did this for you.

157
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,520
Shut up, Zongzheng Mingzhu.

158
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,860
You've done all these

159
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,700
cold-hearted, treacherous things.

160
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,580
You don't have

161
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,210
to pretend to be soulful now.

162
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,280
Young Master Fang.

163
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,240
Mr. Li.

164
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,350
Thank you for your concern.

165
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:33,410
Guards!

166
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,990
Lock Yu Mulan and Yun Jiao in prison.

167
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:37,710
Yes.

168
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,510
Prepare the carriage.

169
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,690
Send Young Master Fang, Mr. Li

170
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,840
and everyone in the inn out of town.

171
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,300
Wait.

172
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,520
Madam Yu, I don't think you should send us off like this.

173
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,180
Why did you put them in prison?

174
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,070
What about Zongzheng Mingzhu?

175
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,800
What do you plan to do with him?

176
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,500
This is my family matter.

177
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,420
I’ll take care of it.

178
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,610
This is a criminal case.

179
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,700
According to the law,

180
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,140
the case should be processed by Baichuan Academy.

181
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,370
He works in the court,

182
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,490
so he should be judged by the Public Prosecutor's Office.

183
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:19,620
Besides, Madam Yu killed the innocent

184
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,640

185
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,660
You are also guilty.

186
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,640
What's wrong with killing my own guards?

187
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,420
This is the rewarding record of the guards of Yucheng.

188
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,950
These guards have been rewarded repeatedly.

189

190

the private guards who have been rewarded three times

191
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,360
shall not be judged as house slaves.

192
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,680
Of course you are guilty

193
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,000
and should be punished.

194
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,460
Besides, you have to compensate the families of these guards.

195
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,640
Do you want to seek justice

196
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,350
for these guards?

197
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,930
They didn't deserve to die.

198

00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,390
Where is my senior, Shan Gudao's body?

343
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:14,780
Di Feisheng.

344
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,450
Di Feisheng.

345
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,940
How do you know his name?

346
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:25,530
Do you know him?

347
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:33,730
I was in daze just now.

348
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,270
I think I heard someone calling his name.

349
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:41,030
Be careful.

350
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,840
Do you know that the guy we ran into

351
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,540
just now is Di Feisheng, the final boss of the Jinyuan Alliance?

352
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,350
You,

353
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,060
you are really lucky.

354
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,760
The forest was full of miasma.

355
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,990
How did you get in?

356
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,080
I went to find my dog.

357
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,520
And suddenly, it exploded.

358
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,510
Luckily you were there.

359
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,960
Who would have thought that

360
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:07,220
the final boss had been hiding in such a remote place.

361
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,810
I heard that inside the cave,

362
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:10,430
there are all kinds of drugs that increase internal power.

363
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,770
During the battle at the East Sea,

364
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,300
he must have been severely injured back then.

365
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,760
That's why he practiced in seclusion there.

366
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:16,820
It's a pity

367
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,430
that I didn't see his face clearly.

368
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:20,800
If he's not dead,

369
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,750
there will be a storm coming in the wide world.

370
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,320
Since Di Feisheng is not dead,

371
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,200
Li Xiangyi must be alive, right?

372
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,300
He must be alive, right?

373
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,630
Are you out of your mind?

374
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,200
I knew

375
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,550
he must be alive.

376
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,940
He will come back for sure.

377
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,870
He's delayed by something for now.

378
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:41,670
And,

379
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:42,990
by the way,

380
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:44,780
I misunderstood you

381
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,340
about what happened last time.

382
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,480
So,

383
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,880
my suspicion of being the Drug Demon is cleared?

384
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,860
I was eager to catch the thief.

385
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,780
I'm sorry.

386
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:57,790
How do you want me to apologize to you?

387
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:58,870
Just tell me.

388
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,350
Nothing.

389
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,230
I'm just hungry.

390
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,250
That's it?

391
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,000
Fine.

392
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:04,900
I'll prepare it for you.

393
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,560
Wait for me.

394
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,130
Di Feisheng.

395
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,670
Since you are still alive,

396
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,440
I need to

397
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,260
ask you something and make it clear.

398
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,400
I was not able to catch up.

399
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,860
But it must be Di Feisheng.

400
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,270
The one beside him is Jiao Liqiao.

401
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,200
I can't be wrong.

402
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,320
I've investigated Yu Hongzhu.

403
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,490
She was one of the 12 Phoenixes of the Jinyuan Alliance.

404
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:29,100
When the Jinyuan Alliance was destroyed, she escaped

405
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,500
and returned to Yucheng.

406
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,050
If that's the case,

407
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:40,370
all these years, Jiao Liqiao has been secretly manipulating the remnants

408
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,900
of the Jinyuan Alliance to create chaos everywhere.

409
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,300
Di Feisheng must be the one behind all this.

410
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,860
Yu Hongzhu bit her tongue off and kept silent.

411
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,110
Zongzheng Mingzhu was arrested by the Public Prosecutor's Office.

412
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,380
It'll be hard to interrogate him since he's in the court.

413
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,580
We have no idea where Di Feisheng is now.

414
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,450
If Di Feisheng is still alive,

415
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,220
then our Head...

416
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,620
Xiangyi is different from Di Feisheng.

417
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,500
If he is still alive,

418
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,960
why wouldn't he come back?

419
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,820
Meaningless speculations hurt the most.

420
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,750
Don't mention it again.

421
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:34,370
Wanwan.

422
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,070
Zijin.

423
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,270
We should go back.

424
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,630
Okay, let's go.

425
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,680
You're daydreaming in broad daylight.

426
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,050
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

427
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:14,260
How dare you covet the No.1 beauty in martial arts, Qiao Wanwan?

428
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,650
You have to ask for permission from Xiao Zijin's Alkaid first.

429
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:18,850
Stop guessing,

430
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,240
and don't make jokes.

431
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:22,560
I'm just curious.

432
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,060
They've never been to Baichuan Academy.

433
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,270
Why are they here?

434
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,010
After all, they're old friends with Sigu Sect.

435
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,870
Since they're here and have heard

436
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,860
about the reappearance of the final boss, Di Feisheng,

437
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,160
of course they would show concern.

438
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,960
Fang Xiaobao!

439
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,840
She's already here?

440
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,930
Li'er must have exposed herself.

441
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:41,930
Brother, help me block it.

442
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,530
I'll give you the food later.

443
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,220
It's strange.

444
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,550
I heard his voice just now.

445
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,630
Who are you?

446
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,060
I'm Li Lianhua.

447
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,470
Li Lianhua?

448
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:59,300
[He Xiaofeng of Tianji Manor]

449
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,630
So you're the rumored owner of Lotus House?

450
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,150
You are the doctor who can miraculously

451
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,750
bring the dying back to life?

452
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,780
Doctor, I feel dizzy.

453
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,290
I feel dizzy.

454
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,640
Take a look for me.

455
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,100
Miss.

456
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,110
Doctor Li,

457
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,540
although you aren't as handsome as I thought,

458
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,300
but your chic temperament

459
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,650
gets my heart beating faster.

460
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:20,930
I've always admired

461
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,020
someone with extraordinary talent.

462
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,650
But you haven't treated me yet.

463
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:26,900
Miss,

464
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,430
you look rosy,

465
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,880
and your voice is loud like a bell.

466
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,770
You're fine.

467
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,630
That's good.

468
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,350
Maybe I ran after

469
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,690
my nephew too fast,

470
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,570
so I felt dizzy.

471
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,120
Doctor Li, have you seen him?

472
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:42,900
Oh, I forgot to introduce myself.

473
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,440
I am

474
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,620
He Xiaofeng, the younger sister of He Xiaohui,

475
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,020
the owner of Tianji Hall.

476
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,460
My nephew

477
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,810
is Fang Duobing.

478
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,840
His nickname is Xiaobao.

479
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,800
He's only a few years younger than me.

480
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,860
He's very naughty.

481
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,290
How dared he reject the marriage granted by His Majesty

482
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:55,470
and run away from home?

483
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,560
I'm so worried about him as his auntie.

484
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,910
I see.

485
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,160
Miss He,

486
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,220
Mr. Fang said goodbye to me just now.

487
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,930
He said he’s going to the North to broaden his horizons.

488
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:05,570
Miss He,

489
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,160
it's not too late for you to chase him now.

490
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:14,880
Doctor,

491
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,070
this is my special Phoenix Smoke.

492
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,080
If you want to see me,

493
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,220
you can burn this smoke and I'll find you.

494
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,500
See you, Doctor Li.

495
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:36,120
[Long Live the Foreworld]

496
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:09,590
Welcome back, Head.

497
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:14,780
Welcome back, Head!

498
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:13,180
[Long Live the Foreworld]

499
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:18,580
Welcome back, Head.

500
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:21,700
Get up.

501
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,320
This is a new place.

502
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,080
My Lord.

503
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,450
Ten years ago, with you in charge,

504
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,110
the Jinyuan Alliance dominated the world of martial arts.

505
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,440
and made everyone obey.

506
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,820
But since you retreated,

507
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:45,230
those so-called righteous rogues took the chance to attack,

508
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,970
so we had to give up the old headquarters.

509
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,640
Fortunately, the wise Saintess

510
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,590
led us to find this treasured land.

511
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,900
We rebuilt the headquarters.

512
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,100
And we've been waiting for your return.

513
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:59,690
I dare not take credit.

514
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,090
We worked hard in the past 10 years,

515
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:04,020
only to prepare for the return of my Lord

516
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,080
to take over Jinyuan Alliance again.

517
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,580
And I finally got what I wanted today.

518
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,310
It's such a great honor.

519
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,740
I, Ding Yun, the Wind and Thunder Emissary,

520
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,500
present the map of the Jinyuan Alliance's new headquarters.

521
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,210
I, Wan Renshan, the Star and Moon Emissary,

522
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,000
present the name list of the Jinyuan Alliance.

523
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,530
Please have a look, my Lord.

524
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,440
So it was you two.

525
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,480
My Lord,

526
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,480
I don’t know what they did wrong

527
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:43,810
and offended you.

528
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,740
In the battle of the Eastern Sea ten years ago,

529
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,660
we used thundering fire bombs to trap the Sigu Sect.

530
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,940
Do you know about this?

531
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,130
Of course I know.

532
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,430
Those thundering fire bombs not only blew up the Sigu Sect.

533
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:01,790
but also the arsenal of our headquarters.

534
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:03,580
Countless casualties.

535
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,580
They were in charge of our firearms.

536
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:09,080
Should we kill them or not?

537
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,330
Of course, we should.

538
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,610
I was negligent,

539
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,120
and I let them live for ten more years.

540
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,120
I've been in seclusion for ten years.

541
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,190
I keep thinking about the past.

542
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,550
Something is fishy.

543
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,960
I hate betrayal the most.

544
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,660
If I find out who betrayed me,

545
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,520
you will end up

546
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,820
like these two corpses here.

547
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,650
Good kill, my Lord.

548
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,770
If anyone is unfaithful to you,

549
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,170
I will not forgive him.

550
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,500
Today is the big day of your return.

551
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,380
take them as a celebration for you.

552
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:03,620
My Lord,

553
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,930
This is the decree of Jinyuan Alliance.

554
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,380
I've been protecting it with my life all these years.

555
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,710
It has always been safe.

556
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,980
I'm returning it to you today.

557
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,260
Congratulations my Lord on retrieving the decree.

558
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:35,110
Jinyuan Alliance will dominate the wide world soon.

559
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:41,270
My Lord,

560
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,440
I have something to report.

561
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,600
Yu Hongzhu let down her guard

562
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,740
when you retreated to Yucheng.

563
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,870
If not because of Saintess,

564
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:52,070
you would've been interrupted.

565
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,820
Yu Hongzhu has been arrested by Baichuan Academy.

566
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,910
Please give the order

567
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,460
to get rid of Yu Hongzhu immediately,

568
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,740
so that there won't be any trouble.

569
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,540
I also have something to report.

570
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,230
[Jinyuan Alliance, Granny Blood]

571
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,780
You need to tell the world about your return, Lord.

572
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,820
First, let justice be frightened.

573
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,350
Second, let the former subordinates return.

574
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:13,710
Boring.

575
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:14,690
My Lord,

576
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:18,230
I also sent someone to get a new Book of 10,000.

577
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,800
All the latest rankings are on it.

578
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,400
Please have a look.

579
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,210
I have another good news.

580
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,170
Go ahead.

581
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,330
I've found the whereabouts of the elixir that you've been

582
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,139
searching for since 10 years ago, which can help improve your

583
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:37,409
martial arts skills.

584
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:43,000
Here.

585
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,020
Well done.

586
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:50,650
Well done.

587
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,300
This is what I should do.

588
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:57,420
What else can I do for you?

589
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:05,400
You've been running the Jinyuan Alliance well for the past 10 years.

590
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,210
From now on,

591
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,570
the affairs of the alliance will be handled by Saintess.

592
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,880
Thank you, my Lord.

593
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:14,550
With you here,

594
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,080
I can rest assured.

595
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,030
I will help you to be the top in the world of martial arts,

596
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,960
and rule the world.

597
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:08,280
My Lord,

598
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:11,580
I've been waiting for you for 10 years.

599
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:14,070
All my efforts are not in vain.

600
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:38,710
Lord.

601
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,300
You were there just now.

602
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,850
Why do you only show up now?

603
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,350
I dare not disturb you

604
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,270
on the Enthronement Ceremony.

605
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,570
Stop talking nonsense.

606
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,050
You and the three kings already know

607
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:52,110
what I have truly cared about for 30 years.

608
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,380
My Lord only cares about being the peak of martial arts.

609
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,040
You have no care about others.

610
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,530
You are my personal guard.

611
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,060
Together with King Bai of Fire,

612
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,200
Four-faced Qingzun and King Xunming of Yama,

613
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,220
you all are just below me in the alliance.

614
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,820
Where are they now?

615
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:10,850
Find it out for me.

616
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,670
The four of you risked your lives with me

617
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,360
to build the Jinyuan Alliance.

618
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,220
No matter what,

619
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,780
they can't be locked in prison.

620
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,430
Yes, Lord.

621
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,030
You killed Wan Renshan and Ding Yun

622
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,490
with bursts of air.

623
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,280
In my opinion, you have now regained

624
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:30,720
60% of your power from 10 years ago.

625
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:32,920
Only 60%?

626
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,590
It seems that he really

627
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,250
left me a lot of trouble.

628
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:42,000
He is the only person

629
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,930
that can have my Lord keep him in mind.

630
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,010
We fought on the sea 10 years ago.

631
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:48,470
I won by half a move,

632
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,310
but he died.

633
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,060
I have no rival in the world anymore.

634
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,910
There are many new masters on the Book of 10,000

635
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,170
given by the Saintess.

636
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,420
The first one is Buddhist San Sheng from East Japan.

637
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,640
The second one is Yang Yunchun with the Royal Dragon.

638
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,030
And the third one is the Demon Monk of Blood Realm.

639
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:08,160
The three of them must be quite strong.

640
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,680
If you want to have fun,

641
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,910
I can search for their whereabouts.

642
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,480
After Li Xiangyi,

643
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,550
I have no rival in the world.

644
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,870
The map of Guanyin's Tears?

645
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:32,990
That's right.

646
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:34,790
Congratulations, Lord.

647
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:35,720
Guanyin's Tears

648
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,300
are the elixirs made by the Bodhisattva Herbal Lord

649
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,850
with his lifelong effort back in 100 years ago.

650
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,190
It only had three back then.

651
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,870
The first one was seized by the swordsman to save

652
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:43,920
his eldest son, whose heartbeat has stopped for 3 days.

653
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,600
The second one was taken by Qiu Wuya

654
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,450
and his power was drastically increased.

655
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,090
He had been the head in the martial arts world for over 10 years.

656
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:49,150
Now, with this map,

657
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,810
we can find the third one.

658
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:52,250
If you get this elixir,

659
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,210
it's no doubt that you will regain your power.

660
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:54,740
And maybe

661
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:57,330
we can even break through the seventh level of the Windy Poplar

662
00:38:57,330 --> 00:39:00,330
and reach the eighth level, where no one has ever been.

663
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,770
Of course, I need to get Guanyin's Tear.

664
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:05,170
Unfortunately,

665
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,430
I've lost all my power.

666
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,660
Who can I fight with?

667
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,050
Granny Blood,

668
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,500
keep an eye on the Lord.

669
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,320
By then,

670
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,770
he'll be eager to find the elixir.

671
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:20,130
Yes.

672
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,320
My Lord.

673
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:35,140
From now on, you'll be the only one by Qiao's side.

674
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,780
And you can only

675
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:41,500
have me by your side, too.

676
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,500
When we parted back then,

677
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,600
I told you that it's hard to be solved.

678
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,850
And you only have ten years left.

679
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:52,760
Now,

680
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,250
it's only one year left.

681
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,430
Have you settled it now?

682
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:59,700
Why don't you go back to meet your old friends in the Sigu Sect,

683
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,100
and find the way together to save yourself?

684
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:03,900
A monk doesn't lie.

685
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,480
Almsgiver Li, you're still young,

686
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,870
don't let the King of Hell take advantage of you.

687
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:09,600
Di Feisheng.

688
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:11,510
Where are you?

689
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,690
Look at you.

690
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,730
You disappeared in a blink of an eye

691
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,290
when I was hiding from my auntie.

692
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,380
Luckily, I'm smart.

693
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,180
I know you would sneak back here.

694
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,650
What were you burning just now?

695
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:29,710
It doesn't matter.

696
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:31,920
It's not important.

697
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,700
Did something happen to you?

698
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,960
Tell me if anything happens.

699
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,960
This young master will protect you.

700
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,320
You ran away from home to escape the marriage.

701
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,580
Your source of finance is cut off, and you braved the elements.

702
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,310
And you're in dire straits now.

703
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:46,120
They even brought back

704
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,240
the servant around you, right?

705
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,700
You have nowhere to go.

706
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,370
Are you

707
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,070
going to stay here forever?

708
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:54,580
I...

709
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,050
You can't say that.

710
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,550
We should help each other.

711
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,480
We went through thick and thin together.

712
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,410
We are brothers for life.

713
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:06,520
We all need friends

714
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,070
to survive in the wide world.

715
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,680
I'm not into the wide world and I don't make friends either.

716
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,080
You...

717
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,380
You look

718
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,180
easy-going and nice to talk to

719
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,040
on the outside,

720
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,440
as if you have no temper.

721
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,450
But, in fact, you're so cold

722
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,400
and you're not close to anyone.

723
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,440
This is not good.

724
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,540
You're always alone.

725
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,750
You don't even have friends to eat and drink with.

726
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:27,750
This is so boring.

727
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,230
Who says it's for you?

728
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,570
The hawthorn tastes good today.

729
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:42,470
Not bad.

730
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,290
Try drying the hawthorn next time,

731
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:47,350
then boiling it with sugar and dried tangerine peel.

732
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:48,350
It must be better.

733
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,300
You have a good taste.

734
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:51,320
Of course.

735
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,380
My reputation as the capital's food critic

736
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,910
does not come from nothing.

737
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:55,580
How is it?

738
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:56,730
Do you

739
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,530
need someone like me at Lotus House?

740
00:41:58,530 --> 00:41:59,900
A handsome partner

741
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,550
that can eat and fight.

742
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:03,870
Isn't it great to explore the wide world together?

743
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:04,440
Stop.

744
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,160
I made it clear

745
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,920
about solving cases together.

746
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,330
I don't understand.

747
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:11,990
Do you really want to get into Baichuan Academy?

748
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,340
Of course.

749
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,280
The Sigu Sect is gone.

750
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,900
My master is missing too.

751
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,960
But I can't forget my promise to him.

752
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,380
Furthermore, the final boss, Di Feisheng,

753
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,190
is still alive.

754
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:23,450
I have to teach him a lesson for my master.

755
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,100
We can't always

756
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,650
live up to the expectations of others.

757
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:32,190
Maybe Li Xiangyi

758
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,540
has never expected so much from you.

759
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,980
You know what, you are a nice person,

760
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,510
but you always rain on my parade.

761
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:39,630
I told you a lot of things.

762
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,080
And I treat you as a friend from the bottom of my heart.

763
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:41,480
You...

764
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,070
How could you...

765
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,500
Tranquilizing incense.

766
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:57,410
Sleep well.

767
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:03,230
Li Xiangyi doesn't remember anything,

768
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:04,680
and he won't go back.

769
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:07,830
Don't be too serious.

770
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:09,680
Silly boy.

771
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,120
Where's the carriage?

772
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,670
Li Lianhua.

773
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,650
You left me at the roadside again!
