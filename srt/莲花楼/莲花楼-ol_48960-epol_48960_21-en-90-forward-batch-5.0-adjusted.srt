5
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:58,130
I wanted to give you a surprise.

6
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,800
I didn't expect to bump into you.

7
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,900
I chose all the flowers in the yard

8
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,759
for you.

9
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:02,860
Do you like it?

Zijin.

11
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,830
Did you hear the rumors

12
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,150
about Li Xiangyi?

13
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,990
They're just rumors.

14
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,560
But about him,

15
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,780
you're always especially nervous.

16
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,580
I've checked.

17
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,590
Those rumors were spread on purpose.

18
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,510
Are you suspecting me?

19
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,130
I no longer have any feelings for Xiangyi.

20
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,620
He's just a friend.

21
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,120
In the past ten years,

22
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,180
you were the only one by my side.

23

Why don't you trust me?

24
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,870
When I became in charge of Sigu Sect,

25
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,630
you never once helped me with the discussions.

26
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,090
But as soon as the rumors about Li Xiangyi spread,

27
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,550
you rushed to question me.

28
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,090
You don't have romantic feelings for him,

29
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,020
but your feelings for him are true.

30
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,010
I never joined your discussions

31
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,130
because it's your first time being in charge of Sigu Sect.

32
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,530
I'm a senior in Sigu Sect.

33
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,390
If I were here, I was afraid I'd be in your way.

34
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,740
How could you be such a petty...

35
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,450
A petty man?

36
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,700
He founded Sigu Sect,

37
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,170
and I rebuilt Sigu Sect.

38
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,100
He's a Sect Leader.

39
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,360
I'm also a Sect Leader.

40
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,260
I don't understand

41
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,220
why I'm always inferior to him

We need to calm down.

Think about why you've come this far.

What do you mean?

48
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,310
I thought you took over Sigu Sect

49
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,300
just to bring peace back to the martial world.

50
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,130
But I didn't expect

51

that you only wanted a war trophy.

52

54

You said I couldn't let him go.

These calligraphy paintings are all painted by famous martial artists.

73

These martial artists' paintings

Liu Rujing.

173
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,370
Liu Rujing?

174
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,820
You're an ordinary member of the Cao Gang.

175
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,320
Today, you're judging

176
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,040
great heroes like Li Xiangyi and Shan Gudao.

177
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,260
If you dare to talk nonsense again,

178
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,960
I'll hook your tongue out to make dried sausage.

179
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,670
The one with the surname Liu, what did you say?

180
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,020
Senior Liu, there's no need to fight.

181
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,530
Let's convince them with logic.

182
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,020
Liu Jiangchuan, Jiang Hua and Xu Yi.

183
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,190
You three have gambling debts of hundreds of taels.

184
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,180
How dare you come to the Sigu Tea Party?

185
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,460
How shameless.

186
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:03,980
Who are you?

187
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,840
A detective from Baichuan Court

188
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,370
and Li Xiangyi's disciple,

189
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,230
Fang Duobing.

190
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,820
Well said.

191
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,310
You can't trust gamblers and thieves.

192
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,230
But what about me?

193
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,150
He Zhang?

194
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,300
As the head of Four Tigers with Silver Spears,

195
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,430
I should be trustworthy, right?

196
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,620
Kid.

197
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,530
Just now, you sought justice for Li Xiangyi.

198
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,310
You should recognize his handwriting.

199
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,410
This letter is a secret order from Li Xiangyi.

200
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:45,330
The letter ordered Shan Gudao to travel to Yangsha Valley alone.

201
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,680
That Yangsha Valley

202
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,150
is Jinyuan Alliance's secret sanctuary.

203
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,130
That's why Shan Gudao was besieged and killed by the four kings.

204
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,280
[Something is off with Jinyuan Alliance.
You should go to Yangsha Valley immediately.
I'm also rushing there to meet you.]

205
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,280
[Xiangyi]

206
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,570
Since it's a secret,

207
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,220
how would my master know?

208
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,680
It's just a coincidence.

209
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,800
I told Li Xiangyi this myself.

210
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,620
If he didn't mean to harm me,

211
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,390
he wouldn't have let Shan Gudao go there to die.

212
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,050
You want to frame Li Xiangyi with this alone?

213
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,220
Master He sure is talking nonsense.

214
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,400
I have more evidence.

215
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,820
Sect Leader Xiao.

216
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,530
May I ask

217
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,970
where the Bluestone Chessboard of Shan Gudao's courtyard

218
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,250
is at now?

219
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,420
It's still sealed in its original form in his room.

220
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,590
Please send someone to carry it here.

221
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,820
Minghuang Jinyun? It's a letter from the imperial court.

222
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,580
This is a letter from the imperial court?

223
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,330
Yes.

224
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,900
It's a letter from the imperial court.

225
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,920
Back then, Li Xiangyi refused the incorporation of the court,

226
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,520
so the court wrote a secret letter to Shan Gudao

227
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,840
to get him to replace Li Xiangyi's position

228
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,880
and become the leader of the Sigu Sect.

229
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,060
Of course Sect Leader Shan didn't agree.

230
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,190
So he sealed this envelope in the Bluestone Chessboard.

231
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,950
But this kind of thing naturally couldn't be hidden from Li Xiangyi.

232
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:17,150
So he came up with a plan to kill two birds with one stone.

233
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,290
Li Xiangyi had long wanted to break

234
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,380
the agreement with Jinyuan Alliance

235
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,870
and unify the world.

236
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,490
But he is the leader of an orthodox sect.

237
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,180
It was inappropriate for him to initiate the battle.

238
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,570
So he sent Sect Leader Shan to die

239
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,200
and used it as an excuse to attack Jinyuan Alliance

240
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,510
in order to destroy it.

241
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,020
If his plan succeeded,

242
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,160
the two troubles in his heart would have been solved together.

243
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,700
Unfortunately for him,

244
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,100
God isn't blind.

245
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,280
The human will cannot defy God's will.

246
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,480
Liu Rujing.

247
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:55,970
Let me ask you.

248
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:59,830
That night, when Sect Leader Shan went to Luoyan Ridge,

249
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,960
we were both on duty in the courtyard.

250
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,140
Have you heard

251
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,320
about the dispute between him and Li Xiangyi?

252
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:10,500
What?

253
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,890
You don't dare to say it now?

254
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,570
What do I have to be afraid of?

255
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,010
I did hear them

256
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,180
arguing about the matter of the imperial court.

257
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:24,710
Xiangyi.

258
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,680
Do you think

259
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,700
what you say is always right

260
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,500
and the truth,

261
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,260
and that Sigu Sect can't survive without you?

262
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,710
Yes.

263
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,420
You can lose anyone in the Sect

264
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,290
except Li Xiangyi.

265
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,200
I'd been silent for ten years

266
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,080
because Li Xiangyi is too famous

267
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,970
and I had nowhere to seek justice.

268
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,710
Taking the chance of today's Sigu Tea Party,

269
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,410
I request that you

270
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,480
move Li Xiangyi’s memorial tablet out of the Heroes Hall of Fame.

271
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,440
How dare you!

272
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:14,600
Why not?

273
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,910
If he dared to kill his senior,

274
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,220
then I'd dare to let his stinky reputation be known throughout the martial world.

275
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,240
I want Li Xiangyi out of the Heroes Hall of Fame!

276
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,170
Get out of the Heroes Hall of Fame!

277
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,420
Get out of the Heroes Hall of Fame!

278
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,620
Whoever dares to touch Sect Leader's memorial tablet,

279
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,820
I'll kill you.

280
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,100
A bunch of thugs.

281
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,220
Sigu Sect was built by Li Xiangyi.

282
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,150
Let's see who dares to mess around!

283
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,170
How dare you!

284
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,080
What kind of place do you think this is?

285
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,060
Although Sigu Sect was rebuilt,

286
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,410
I had already bought this place ten years ago.

287
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,340
It's a part of the private mansion of my Mumian Villa.

288
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,360
I didn't invite you all...

289
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,580
nor did I agree to lend it to Sect Leader Xiao.

290
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,390
If you are here for a cup of tea,

291
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:10,530
I welcome you.

292
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,080
But if you humiliate your former Sect Leader here,

293
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,170
don't blame me for ordering you to leave.

294
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,420
Sorry, everyone.

295
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:23,450
Let's go.

296
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,960
Let's go.

297
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,190
He Zhang.

298
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,320
What a coincidence that you came at this time.

299
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,580
Miss Qiao.

300
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,680
You're the one that's late.

301
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:45,740
Mr. Fang.

302
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,680
This matter is very complicated.

303
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,820
It's not exactly like what they said.

304
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,420
Of course,

305
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,550
I have always trusted Li Xiangyi.

306
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,150
Thank you for today, Miss Qiao.

307
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,930
I'll take my leave.

308
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,420
Did you arrange all this?

309
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,220
What are you talking about?

310
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,420
This chessboard was long gone from Shan Gudao's room.

311
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,290
[To Shan Gudao]

312
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,480
Did you specially get it out?

313
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,570
Yes.

314
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,670
In order to smear him,

315
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,300
you actually went this far.

316
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,360
I just threw the bait

317
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,890
and so many people came to back it up.

318
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,600
There are so many people in the world who hate Li Xiangyi.

319
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,800
Is that also my fault?

320
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,210
I thought you just need some time

321
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,290
to let it go.

322
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,710
I was wrong.

323
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,720
About our wedding...

324
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,260
Let's forget it.

325
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,910
You can't live the rest of your life

326
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,910
with this emotional knot.

327
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,150
Mian.

328
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,620
It's not some top-notch tea.

329
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,690
Drink some to quench your thirst.

330
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,040
I'm sorry.

331
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:58,930
Mian.

332
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,680
You didn't do anything wrong.

333
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,520
Why are you apologizing?

334
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,100
Besides,

335
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,720
about Shan Gudao's matter,

336
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,770
Li Xiangyi is also responsible.

337
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,710
But those rumors were spread by Zijin.

338
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,869
I tried to persuade him,

339
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,310
but he's too petty about the past.

340
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,569
That means he cares.

341
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:25,200
Mian.

342
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,339
It's better than being dull

343
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,490
and not taking anything to heart.

344
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,050
I shouldn't have come to you.

345
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,480
This time, I'm here

346
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,880
to ask for your forgiveness on behalf of Zijin.

347
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,070
On account of our past friendship,

348
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,910
can you forgive him for a moment of foolishness?

349
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,070
Li Xiangyi is gone,

350
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,850
and Li Lianhua doesn't care about these.

351
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,120
Can you promise me

352
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,860
that you won't hold a grudge against Zijin?

353
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:01,910
Okay.

354
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,250
I promise you.

355
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,110
Thank you.

356
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,800
I remember the last time I begged someone

357
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,960
was 14 years ago.

358
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,360
I begged the Sword Demon

359
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,290
to allow him to give Li Xiangyi one more year

360
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:27,510
before battling him.

361
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:29,980
Yes.

362
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,150
One year later,

363
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,670
Li Xiangyi perfected his swordsmanship,

364
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,180
beat the Sword Demon,

365
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,770
and became the best in the world.

366
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:46,390
Time

367
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,950
really flies.

368
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:53,660
Yeah.

369
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,070
Time flies indeed.

370
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,580
Is she your lover?

371
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,130
Fei.

372
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,720
Don't you have manners?

373
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:29,670
Am I right?

374
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,620
No.

375
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,580
Do you have a crush on her?

376
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,940
I'll help you kidnap her back

377
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,200
in exchange for a secret of one's origin.

378
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,980
Don't do anything stupid.

379
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,840
Let me tell you.

380
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,460
She's an old friend of mine

381
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,610
named Qiao Wanmian.

382
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,500
She's Xiao Zijin's fiancee.

383
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,760
Xiao Zijin?

384
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,390
The leader of the Sigu Sect?

385
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,190
That's right.

386
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,030
They are very close.

387
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,300
Listen.

388
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,070
Don't make any trouble.

389
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,070
So you have a crush on Qiao Wanyu

390
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,970
and you're afraid of Xiao Zijin,

391
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:07,940
so you dare not admit it.

392
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

393
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,290
Tell me a secret about your origin.

394
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,700
Why do I have to?

395
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,120
Or I'll go to Xiao Zijin

396
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,600
and tell him that you have a crush on his lady.

397
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:19,700
How unreasonable.

398
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,360
Are you going to tell me or not?

399
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:23,890
Fine.

400
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,460
I'll tell you then.

401
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,730
Actually,

402
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,510
you lost your memory because of someone you trust.

403
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,730
Aren't you the one I trust?

404
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,000
There's someone else

405
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,830
besides me.

406
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:37,710
Who?

407
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,540
I'm afraid we don't know yet.

408
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,510
But let me tell you,

409
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,660
with your skills,

410
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,660
the person who can hurt you must be someone around you.

411
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:49,880
Li Lianhua!

412
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:50,980
Bad news.

413
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,800
What’s wrong?

414
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,660
Fang Duobing.

415
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,020
H-he’s crazy!

416
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,430
Let's go.

417
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:14,370
Fang Xiaobao.

418
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,360
Stop what you're doing!

419
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,220
Stop what you're doing!

420
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:16,740
Stop!

421
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,190
I've got a prescription to cure your amnesia.

422
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,550
Here, drink the medicine while it's hot.

423
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,080
Drink it.

424
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,550
Are you crazy?

425
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,850
I am.

426
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,340
I've searched every town nearby

427
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,840
and got the folk prescription.

428
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,250
You must take the medicine today.

429
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:36,780
Drink it!

430
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,450
Are you really crazy?

431
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:51,070
You...

432
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,290
Fei.

433
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,290
Don’t blame Fang Duobing.

434
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,210
Although he's a bit abnormal today,

435
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,940
the medicine he bought is real.

436
00:21:59,020 --> 00:21:59,820
Fang Xiaobao.

437
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,780
I know you mean well.

438
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,740
But Fei

439
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,130
really doesn't have amnesia.

440
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,460
It's useless for him to take this medicine.

441
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,620
If you really want to help him,

442
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,140
you have to find another way, okay?

443
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,500
I'm not trying to help him.

444
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:09,870
I...

445
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,160
I just want him to remember

446
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,620
what happened ten years ago.

447
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,120
Move!

448
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,660
[Girls' Mansion]

449
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,750
[Lotus Tower]

450
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:42,690
Fang Xiaobao.

451
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,550
You didn't even eat dinner.

452
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,660
Are you full from all the gossip at the tea party?

453
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,270
The food smells so good.

454
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,690
And the good wine from town

455
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,160
is so fragrant.

456
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,250
Fine, if you don't want to eat,

457
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,460
I'll help myself.

458
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,440
I won't stand on ceremony.

459
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,420
Is what you said true?

460
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,240
About what?

461
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,200
You said my master had a cold nature,

462
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,070
and that's why they didn't get along.

463
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:34,100
Is it true?

464
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,540
Yes.

465
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,750
Then could he have

466
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,940
hurt your father?

467
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,420
I didn't say that.

468
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,070
Fang Xiaobao, think about it.

469
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:50,080
Your father forced you to marry the princess.

470
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,170
Your mother cut off your sources of making money.

471
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:52,970
Let me ask you.

472
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,520
Do you hate them?

473
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,090
Of course not.

474
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,830
Doesn't that explain it all?

475
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,770
As brothers and as family, Li Xiangyi and Shan Gudao

476
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:04,420
were bound to have some conflicts.

477
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,540
But he wouldn't have had killed his family

478
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,160
just for this.

479
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,750
Do you know

480
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:14,140
what Li Xiangyi's favorite line in a poem is?

481
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,390
Wine is left with an ordinary debt.

482
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,660
Swords don't waste their time.

483
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:25,730
In this world,

484
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,920
there are so many things that are not worth the effort.

485
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,810
Things that are worthy

486
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:29,810
are few.

487
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,170
Why would Li Xiangyi

488
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,470
waste his time

489
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,300
on these stupid schemes?

490
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,460
You're right.

491
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,620
My master won't waste his time for this.

492
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,850
I should not be so fixated.

493
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,700
I was narrow-minded.

494
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:51,920
That's right.

495
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,280
Li Lianhua.

496
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,370
Do you think my master might be

497
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,770
in hiding under an alias?

498
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:00,860
What's wrong?

499
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,900
Because I still think

500
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,660
the swordsman in white in the Yuanbao Villa was strange.

501
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,180
Since Di Feisheng is still alive,

502
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,110
maybe my master is still alive too.

503
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,090
Wait, Fang Xiaobao.

504
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:15,060
Are you having a fever and confused again?

505
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,260
How is that possible?

506
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,040
He's vain and values his reputation

507
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,160
and success.

508
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:19,580
You...

509
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,750

It has nothing to do with me.

I'm a detective from Baichuan Court.

Such a hassle just for a drink.

Should I throw away the gift that I brought for your master

down the mountain too?

710

Of course not.

711
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,410
It's just that we need to examine the gift

712
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,190
before presenting it to Master.

It's useless to go in with weapons.

Don’t you think the matters inside

are enough for you to handle?

719
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:10,000
I'm just here to taste the good wine.

We even need to prepare a gift.

By the way, Fang Xiaobao,

you must have prepared a gift.

You even hid the luminous pearl with you.

Those calligraphy paintings I hid for myself are very valuable.

before entering the mansion,

you have to choose an item.

Choosing an item is...

How about I give you an idea?

what's the name of the mountain where the Girls' Mansion is?

791

This mountain has no name on the map.

792
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,550
Only because of the fragrance of the flowers all year round,

793
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,550
Master named it Fragrant Mountain.

794

Fragrant Mountain?

795
