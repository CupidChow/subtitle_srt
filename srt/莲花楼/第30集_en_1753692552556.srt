1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I don't have much time

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
But I still have a lot of longing

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I ask myself thousands of times

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The most reluctant moment is that moment

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Live in the city, thousands of miles of wind and waves

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Who doesn't like to wander

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Who doesn't like to be separated from the world

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Live in the world, young and crazy

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The youth is not drunk as in sorrow

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A journey to the end of the world is like a dream

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Live in the world, thousands of miles of wind and waves

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Who doesn't like to wander

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Who doesn't like to be separated from the world

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Live in the world, young and crazy

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The youth is not drunk as in sorrow

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
A journey to the end of the world is like a dream

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Live in the world

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The King of Hell is going to marry again

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The King of Hell is going to marry again

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
There are many people in the city

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Most of them are still common

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This should be the King of Hell's mansion

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I just thought about it

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Since I was born on this broken neck

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's no fun hiding

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So you're here to surrender

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
There is no other choice

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Why don't we continue to cooperate together

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Cooperation

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's said that we find clues to communicate with each other

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Why do you know the way forward

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What are you playing again

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Don't waste time

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Otherwise, I will change my mind

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
it is good

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Why don't you send me to the prison

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
That's it

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Why don't you send me to the prison

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Your son is so precious

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
How can I treat you

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
There is always pressure in the world

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You want to go to the prison

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But I have to send you into the woodshed

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Did that doctor ask out the same person

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's not as good as you let me see

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm not going to see you

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm not going to see you

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's not as good as you let me see

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Maybe you can find some clues

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
No need

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
There is a form of the case

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You are here to surrender

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Just be a good prisoner

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Mr. Li

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Do you want to drink tea

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
No need, I'll do it myself

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Fang Xiaobao

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What's wrong with you

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
How can you let Mr. Li stay in the woodshed

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Hurry up and invite him to the upper class

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Mom, he took the initiative to file a case

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I just do as he wishes

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What nonsense are you talking about

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Really getting more and more ridiculous

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Mr. Li, ignore him

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Mom, don't worry

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I won't do anything to him

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's just that there are some things

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I want to ask in person

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You don't have to worry about it

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The problem between friends

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Do you have to solve it

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You really grew up

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Can't control you

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But Fang Xiaobao, let me tell you

76
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Dangerous

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's not easy to make a real friend

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Don't be so serious

79
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Ask what you want to know

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I just want to ask you three questions

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
First

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Why didn't you burn your heart that day

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But go to the lotus spring alone

84
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Second

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Why are you here to file a case today

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Third

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You are a man who is willing to take a move

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What is it for

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You shut up

90
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I don't want to listen to your explanation now

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Wait until you understand

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Let's talk about the truth

93
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Come to me again

94
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Watch him

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Let me know if there is anything

96
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes

97
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I have to go

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Young Master

99
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The li lotus made me tell you

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Said he was hurt

101
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What kind of injury

102
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I don't know

103
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Anyway, he said he couldn't recover

104
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Hands can't be lifted

105
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Watch out

106
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Transmit to that old fox

107
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Let him stop saying things like that

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yes

109
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Can it be internal injury

110
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,680
How's life?

111
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,720
What is this?

112
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,280
I just got sun burnt by a candle.

113
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,800
This is what you said,

114
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,280
to be unable to encourage negative pain one's arms cannot be led.

115
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,040
It is indeed painful.

116
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,880
One would be angry just by this.

117
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,200
Shooting linked pills? I'm hungry.

118
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,040
Get me something to eat.

119
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,440
Didn't you say your hOsPC had a pretty good chef?

120
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,200
Let me see.

121
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,200
My cook doesn't cook for the beggar.

122
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,200
Then get me a sheet of quilt.

123
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,000
This room is cold all night.

124
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,200
My coldness will always be there.

125
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,200
It's hard to bear.

126
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,800
Aren't you a star?

127
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
Where did you get this coldness?

128
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,200
Your master Yangzhou is invincible.

129
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,200
Stop acting like this.

130
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,900
You must find out a way to let me travel might not be enough.

131
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,400
Wait a moment.

132
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,800
Today's travel schedule is about to open.

133
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,200
When will you be able to sell it?

134
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,800
Half an hour from now, buy a lot of clothes for me.

135
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,500
Who's motivations are you to go to a shop?

136
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,000
I came to Die disagreeeletely with my plan

137
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
because I wanted the money for the design project.

138
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Know that I have treated my plan for three years.

139
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,500
If I lose someone, then you have to produce process.

140
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,780
It hurts again?

141
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,420
Li Lianhua didn't pretend this time.

142
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,900
She seems to be really sick.

143
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,500
How are you?

144
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,500
Li'er, get a few bedding.

145
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,500
Yes.

146
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,700
Come.

147
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,300
Here, be careful of the knife.

148
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,100
Drink slowly.

149
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,100
Li Lianhua, you're awake.

150
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,700
What's wrong with your cold?

151
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,100
Why can't you hold on to the Yangzhou Man?

152
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,300
Here, drink slowly.

153
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,300
Here, drink slowly.

154
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,300
Here, drink slowly.

155
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,300
Here, drink slowly.

156
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,300
Here, drink slowly.

157
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,300
Here, drink slowly.

158
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,100
Drink slowly.

159
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,700
This Yangzhou Man

160
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,700
is too wasteful.

161
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,500
Didn't he say he had the hot wine you gave him

162
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,900
and this blanket?

163
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,300
So,

164
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,100
you're fine.

165
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,100
You're sick.

166
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,300
What tricks are you playing?

167
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,100
The three questions you asked,

168
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,300
the first one is easy to answer.

169
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,900
Let me tell you first.

170
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,500
That day, I didn't smoke.

171
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,900
I knew the power of the B-shape.

172
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,900
Your legs and feet are fast.

173
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,100
If you encounter the power of the B-shape first,

174
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,700
you'll definitely suffer.

175
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,100
What about the other two questions?

176
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,100
I'll tell you the other two questions

177
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,700
later.

178
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,300
I'll tell you a story.

179
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,900
A story about a brother and sister

180
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,700
who are meant to be.

181
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,300
A pair of brothers and sisters

182
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,900
have been fighting since childhood.

183
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,100
They met their master

184
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,300
and got to learn martial arts.

185
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,500
Time flies.

186
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,900
As time goes by,

187
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,100
the brother is fifteen years old.

188
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,900
The first time he went down the mountain with the brother,

189
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,900
he encountered the tragedy of the Changma Dao He family's destruction.

190
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,100
The He family didn't go the right way.

191
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,300
They had been leaving the Jianghu for many years.

192
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,300
They rarely had anyone to trouble them.

193
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,500
But not long ago,

194
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,700
there was a rumor in his family

195
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,300
that there was a cloud in the sky that spread across the river.

196
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,500
It was a story that attracted countless people to remember.

197
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,300
When the brothers and sisters arrived at the He family,

198
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,300
only the He family's father and two brothers were left.

199
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,700
He was seriously injured.

200
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,900
So he begged the brothers and sisters

201
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,900
to take the only blood of the He family

202
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,900
and send them to the foreign families.

203
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,300
When they arrived in Luoyang,

204
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,500
the brother asked his brother to send his brother to the family.

205
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,100
He sent the blood of the He family to the family.

206
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,900
The brother didn't do anything wrong.

207
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,100
But soon, the rumor spread.

208
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,900
The news of the death of the enemy.

209
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,100
Three years later,

210
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,300
the brother sent the brother a strange soft sword

211
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,300
as a gift for the birthday.

212
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,900
It was too late.

213
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,900
The brother had forgotten the small thing about the cloud in his head.

214
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,700
So the soft sword

215
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,100
became the sword that the brother carried with him.

216
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,500
You want to say that my father stole the cloud in his head?

217
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,700
You want to say that my father was a thief who took the throne?

218
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,900
I don't know.

219
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,500
I don't want to know.

220
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,700
Whether it's true or not,

221
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,700
you can judge for yourself.

222
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,900
You know that

223
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,900
nothing is there to be said about the coat.

224
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,500
When you lose w itsa worth,

225
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,900
you still can't figure out something!

226
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,100
Maybe,

227
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,380
after we take the key

228
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,900
and I give it to him,

229
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,700
the double gun of the evil served a purpose.

230
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,780
North Cute

231
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,500
is lying on the edge of a false troth.

232
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,500
For that treachery,

233
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,700
the evil is wallowing.

234
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,300
The evil is lying on the edge of a false troth.

235
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,220
Li Lianhua.

236
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,260
No need.

237
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,300
I let go of Li Lianhua.

238
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,660
How could you?

239
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,900
Why not?

240
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,660
Li Lianhua saved my life.

241
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,540
You're ungrateful.

242
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,700
I'm a person who knows what's good for me.

243
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,460
All right, all right.

244
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,620
Don't be angry.

245
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,180
Li Lianhua said

246
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,540
he had his own arrangement.

247
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,340
I helped him steal the key to save someone.

248
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,540
He gave you the truth.

249
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,780
He asked me to give it to you.

250
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,060
And Lin Xiao's tracking style?

251
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,860
The doctor is not a lotus.

252
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,820
The lotus is dead.

253
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,540
The bull head is covered with oil.

254
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,700
He said

255
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,820
the two questions you asked

256
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,820
he'll tell you the answer tomorrow.

257
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,460
please calm down, books

258
00:12:47,900 --> 00:13:02,900
are on the street,

259
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,100
you two

260
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,060
would be safe.

261
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,020
It's going on.

262
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,380
Man cooperation

263
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,260
No need.

264
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,900
dok money

265
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,360
foreign

266
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:20,560
It's good

267
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:20,840
Ok

268
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,220
good

269
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,120
assventh

270
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:22,960
terrible

271
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,460
osmo

272
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:28,400
Li

273
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,780
It is very much

274
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,760
helpful

275
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:31,840
It's very good

276
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,140
Wish

277
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:32,240
Wish

278
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:32,440
Wish

279
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:32,960
I wish

280
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,260
Wish

281
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:38,960
you

282
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,000
n't

283
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,060
I wish

284
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:39,340
nonsense

285
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:39,480
nonsense

286
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:39,740
nonsense

287
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,600
nonsense

288
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:40,780
nonsense

289
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:40,880
nonsense

290
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,080
nonsense

291
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,140
nonsense

292
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:41,200
nonsense

293
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,240
science

294
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:41,340
nonsense

295
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:41,360
nonsense

296
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:41,380
nonsense

297
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,780
We will get Luo Mo and Tian Bing, right?

298
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,780
He used too much power to get the poison.

299
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,180
Now he can't even stand still.

300
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,180
This is a good chance to kill him.

301
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,780
You didn't rush to find Tian Bing.

302
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:55,500
You could have killed me first and got the

303
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:55,780
What did you say?

304
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,980
If I guessed it right,

305
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:03,780
you should have hidden Tian Bing under the chessboard of this house, right?

306
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,780
That day when I was testing the real armor,

307
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,180
I accidentally added a little pollen to Tian Bing.

308
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,180
Coincidentally, I have a secret bee that tracks pollen.

309
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:19,980
Half a day ago, this bee was wandering around your house.

310
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,380
That's why I led you here.

311
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:26,180
Now Tian Bing must have been taken away.

312
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:30,380
Then I will torture you to death and then change Tian Bing.

313
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,180
Hey, I'm not the one who's dead.

314
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,980
Look at your brother.

315
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,380
Brother!

316
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,580
Slow down.

317
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,180
The poison of Bichazhi.

318
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,780
The poison of Bichazhi.

319
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,580
One more.

320
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,180
Sit tight.

321
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,580
Go.

322
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,180
You were locked in the firewood house in Baishui Garden yesterday.

323
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,280
Now you're back in the Lotus House.

324
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,180
Now you know.

325
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,780
I was worried about you.

326
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,980
I asked about it.

327
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,180
Little girl.

328
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,780
Thank you for your concern.

329
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,780
You helped me feed the dog and control the money.

330
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,980
You asked about my life.

331
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,380
Not only your life,

332
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,380
I also asked about

333
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,780
the answers to the questions

334
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,980
of the two young masters.

335
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,780
What are they?

336
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,180
What answers?

337
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,780
They are all for the kids.

338
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,780
Speaking of which,

339
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,780
let's just pack up

340
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,780
and go find the next soldier.

341
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,980
You're leaving now?

342
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,980
The bullhead hasn't been released yet.

343
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,580
Besides, we can leave it to the antelope.

344
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,780
Don't worry.

345
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,980
What about those two?

346
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,980
Only one of them can fight now.

347
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,980
The antelope can handle it.

348
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,980
Not to mention that

349
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,980
there are traps around the White Water Garden.

350
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,180
Li Xiao

351
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,980
can't get in even if he wants to.

352
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,780
Let's go.

353
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,980
What's wrong?

354
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,980
I'll help you rest for a while.

355
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,180
It's okay.

356
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,980
Maybe you're tired.

357
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,980
I'll go.

358
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,980
What's that sound?

359
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,580
It's an explosion.

360
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,580
It seems to be the direction of

361
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,780
the White Water Garden.

362
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,980
There was an explosion before.

363
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,580
Is that the mine?

364
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,180
Is there someone else?

365
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,180
I don't know.

366
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,580
I think something must have happened to this mine.

367
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,980
Maybe the antelope can't say anything.

368
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,780
It's too late,ikk?

369
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:21,380
I know.

370
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,980
You're awake now.

371
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,380
You couldn't get the Luo Mo Theme Go that easily,right?

372
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,380
Since I already got the Strength Go,

373
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,980
why am I even here?

374
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,780
He should be here soon.

375
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,180
Not bad.

376
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,580
I'm here.

377
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,380
To lure me here,

378
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,980
you've come all the way here.

379
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,180
Sect Leader Li is very thoughtful.

380
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,380
He saved my brother from the trap,

381
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,580
but he also poisoned the world's first poison, the tea.

382
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,780
The tea poison.

383
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,780
Bring out the antidote.

384
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,980
You said the tea poison was the world's first poison.

385
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,980
How could I possibly have the antidote?

386
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,580
Others may not have it.

387
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,380
I believe that you must have it.

388
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,180
You should have heard of Li Xiangyi.

389
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,580
I advise you to let go as soon as possible.

390
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,980
Otherwise,

391
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,380
you will die a terrible death.

392
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,980
Don't move.

393
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,380
I know that you are a master of magic.

394
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,980
If it weren't for Young Master Fang,

395
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,180
I wouldn't dare to punish you so easily.

396
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,580
If it's not worth it,

397
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,180
I'll just use these ore

398
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,980
to return to the netherworld with you.

399
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,180
You think you can threaten Li Xiangyi with me?

400
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,380
Li Xiangyi is cold and ruthless.

401
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,780
He came here

402
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,780
just to smuggle the Heavenly Soldiers.

403
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,580
He's not a man of the world.

404
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,380
He's a man of the world.

405
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,180
He's not me for the sake of the Heavenly Soldiers.

406
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,580
Hey,

407
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,580
stop trying to smuggle the Heavenly Soldiers.

408
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,180
Get lost!

409
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,780
Get lost!

410
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,180
I didn't expect that you'd be so calm for ten years

411
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,180
and now you have a new friend.

412
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,180
You'd rather lose your reputation

413
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,980
than be safe.

414
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,380
Li Xiangyi is just a proud man.

415
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,180
The word cold and ruthless

416
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,580
is not related to him.

417
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,580
Back then,

418
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,780
Shang Gu Dao was looking for the descendant of the South Yin.

419
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,380
He was obviously trying to protect the Central Plains,

420
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,580
but he was actually trying to subvert the martial arts world.

421
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,780
There are rumors about this kind of secret.

422
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,580
But no one dares to tell him.

423
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,980
It's because everyone knows that he won't believe it.

424
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,580
I think he's still in the dark.

425
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,780
Li Xiangyi,

426
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,180
I'll ask you one more time.

427
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,180
What's the secret of the Bichazhi Pearl?

428
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:55,780
I really have no cure for the Bichazhi Pearl.

429
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:59,780
I didn't mean to poison the other land.

430
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,180
But I've been thinking about it.

431
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,580
There is a way to try it.

432
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,780
Say it.

433
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,980
In my text,

434
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,580
there is a phantom crystal.

435
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,580
Maybe it can remove the poison from the other land.

436
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,580
Take three steps back.

437
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,580
Li Xiangyi, you're poisoned by the Bichazhi Pearl.

438
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,380
It's true.

439
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,580
So when you were healing my brother,

440
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,180
you transferred the poison to his body.

441
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,980
The Bichazhi Pearl.

442
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,180
Don't be nervous.

443
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,580
I've been poisoned for a long time.

444
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,980
Look, I'm fine now.

445
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,980
It's not as serious as he said.

446
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,180
Leader Li, you're poisoned but you don't cure it.

447
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,780
It seems that the poison of Bichazhi Pearl is indeed incurable.

448
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,580
But my brother has been poisoned for a day.

449
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,180
And you've been alive for so long.

450
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,180
You can still be lively.

451
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:41,780
I think Yang Zhouman is the one who can cure this poison.

452
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,780
As long as you give me this prescription,

453
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,180
I'll let you two go.

454
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,580
I'll let you two go.

455
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,580
Even if I tell you this new method,

456
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,580
it's hard for you to learn.

457
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,980
Because you don't deserve to learn this new method.

458
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,180
I can't wait to play with you.

459
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,380
Give it to me.

460
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,780
Yang is born from the wood, Yin is born from the crystal,

461
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,980
Yin and Yang are transferred to the river and the Daoxue.

462
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,380
The body knows the mouth and the mouth hides the heart.

463
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,380
The heart knows the mouth as a weapon to return.

464
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,380
The one who has no one else is the one who has the final decision.

465
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,580
I'll listen to you all the next time.

466
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,900
Give the poison back to the Ginger,

467
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,780
and Irate Goshpoint,

468
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,340
Ah Jing.

469
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,460
Ah Yashe will jump in.

470
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,340
Oh.

471
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,900
Ah Jaro will be in trouble.

472
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:27,940
No!!!

473
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,540
We're done here.

474
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,660
Let's just save Qin.

475
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,580
Those who bully us

476
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,460
will die.

477
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,140
venues cl gebided,

478
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,940
Sir, please move back a little.

479
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,740
Be careful.

480
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:51,540
Okay.

481
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,100
18.

482
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,140
It's okay.

483
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,100
We're going to collapse here.

484
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,500
We have to leave immediately.

485
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,100
Bring the flag here.

486
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,060
Be careful.

487
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:24,660
Go.

488
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:46,940
You okay?

489
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,300
Be careful.

490
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,580
בeta Sí-xí

491
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,460
Master Fang, thank you for your hard work.

492
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,900
Master Fang, thank you for your hard work.

493
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:04,980
I justめて tension for you recently.

494
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:09,220
I just EAT IMHOE

495
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,580
step insideル

496
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,580
You don't wanna see Ruo Meng Tian's army.

497
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,700
you don't wanna see Ruo Meng Tian's army.

498
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,660
you don't wanna see Ruo Meng Tian's army.

499
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,860
Hand it over.

500
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,060
Look at your cold eyes.

501
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,460
It's so touching.

502
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,340
But it's not as good as my master.

503
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,380
Prime Minister Li is injured.

504
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,780
Go get Luo Mo's army back.

505
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,500
Go get Luo Mo's army back.

506
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,260
Go get Luo Mo's army back.

507
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,860
Go get Luo Mo's army back.

508
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,180
Go get Luo Mo's army back.

509
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,860
Luo Mo's army.

510
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,660
This guy is crazy.

511
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,420
Who dares to hurt Li Lian Hua?

512
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,500
I'm afraid of death.

513
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,620
Listen to me.

514
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,460
So great.

515
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:12,660
If you're a hero, you'll be a hero in time.

516
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,260
What a pity.

517
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,500
You're alone today.

518
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,300
Let's see how long you can hold on.

519
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,340
Go get him.

520
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,340
Who said my son is alone?

521
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,660
Bao.

522
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,940
Tian Ji Hall never interferes with the martial arts world.

523
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,540
Do you want to break the rules today?

524
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,300
Li Lian Hua is badly injured.

525
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,660
You don't interfere with the martial arts world.

526
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,580
It doesn't mean you're afraid of it.

527
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,820
You all bully my son.

528
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,740
Do you think I can be a good person?

529
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,860
Tian Ji Hall, listen to me.

530
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,380
Catch these devils.

531
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,100
Just you?

532
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,540
You witch.

533
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,140
You're not even a hero.

534
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,860
Saintess, Baichuan Court is here.

535
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,380
We've got Luo Mo's army.

536
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,500
We can't kill ourselves.

537
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,300
Go.

538
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,660
Wait.

539
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,820
Although Luo Mo's army was taken away,

540
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,580
Li Lian Hua is still here.

541
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,460
I'll take her back for interrogation.

542
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,180
I must take her away.

543
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,100
Don't you dare touch her.

544
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,420
If you really want to take Li Lian Hua away,

545
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,940
you'll have to offend me.

546
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:39,060
Fang Tuo Bin is a good man.

547
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,940
Fang Tuo Bin, you're from Baichuan Court.

548
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,940
As the head of the court, I order you

549
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,620
to keep Li Lian Hua.

550
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,060
I must take Li Lian Hua away.

551
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,300
The four ancient gates have been taken.

552
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,780
I don't want this Saintess' identity.

553
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,900
Could it be...

554
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,820
Bi Che?

555
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,100
Li Lian Hua.

556
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,180
Li Lian Hua.

557
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,620
You're awake.

558
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,340
How do you feel?

559
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,780
Is it painful or cold?

560
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,380
It's...

561
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,740
It's...

562
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,060
It's...

563
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,740
The medicine is in the Lotus Pavilion, right?

564
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,540
Yes.

565
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,660
I'll go and get it.

566
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,860
I'll go and get it.

567
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,980
I'll go and get it.

568
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,940
I'll go and get it.

569
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,540
Wait here.

570
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,380
I'll get it right now.

571
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,580
Stay with me.

572
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,360
Fine.

573
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,540
Come.

574
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,220
So embarrassing.

575
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:14,560
What do you mean we had to float all this money,

576
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,460
why did I place them here.

577
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,720
I don't think I'm a man of my words.

578
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,100
You truly are a woman of self- -...

579
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,020
Since when will you kidnap me?

580
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,320
Lie down now!

581
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,940
Are you cold?

582
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,900
Come on, let's drink.

583
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,220
Why are you coughing?

584
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,940
Don't let it spread.

585
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:13,740
Lianhua.

586
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,060
Are you okay, Lianhua?

587
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,300
Mom!

588
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,420
Xiaobao.

589
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,060
How is Lianhua?

590
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,220
She's been poisoned.

591
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,460
She was a good person before.

592
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,860
Why did she become like this?

593
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,620
I don't have time to explain.

594
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,020
I want to see your Zhuo Yun Shang

595
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,140
and take her to see Guan He Meng.

596
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,420
It's not too late.

597
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,460
You should go.

598
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,340
Xiaobao.

599
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,820
You must save the life of Doctor Li.

600
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,780
I'll go.

601
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,340
Is that a trick?

602
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,620
Li Lianhua didn't collude with Golden Apple Alliance.

603
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,940
It's not the only reason.

604
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,140
That letter was defamed.

605
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,020
It's unbelievable.

606
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,300
You think so, too?

607
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,380
Jiao Liqiao took a master of Golden Apple Alliance

608
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,380
to attack Li Lianhua.

609
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,380
He seriously injured Li Lianhua.

610
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,620
He almost lost his life.

611
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,740
We all witnessed it.

612
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,740
He's hurt.

613
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:13,780
Brother Guan!

614
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,620
Brother Guan, help!

615
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,140
Brother Guan, help!

616
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,140
Hurry.

617
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,460
Hurry and save Li Lianhua.

618
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,540
She's in a coma.

619
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,180
You entered without asking.

620
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,380
You're so powerful.

621
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,020
I can't save her.

622
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,140
Only you can save her now.

623
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,740
Just tell me what you want.

624
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,180
I won't break my promise.

625
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,900
Get her up first.

626
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,260
You can't save her right now.

627
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,540
I won't letação.

628
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,020
I won't save her right now.

629
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,980
Your Highness.

630
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,580
UT.

631
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,220
Senin izh nam là ai t realidad Wilson.

632
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,460
Your Highness.

633
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,620
I don't know your existence.

634
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,300
But I've heard yours are in the capital.

635
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,540
Your Highness, I've vs you to protect you.

636
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,340
Okay.

637
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,340
Gui Xiu, how is she?

638
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:15,980
Let me talk to her.

639
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,340
She's dying.

640
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,900
There must be a way.

641
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,980
She's too weak.

642
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,780
Her wound is in the original wound.

643
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,700
Even if she's repaired and repaired,

644
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,060
she's still alive.

645
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,940
Her blood can't be used anymore.

646
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,340
But when I treated her last time,

647
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,140
she was still alive for four months.

648
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,940
A few days later,

649
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,260
she lost half of her life to kill me.

650
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,460
What poison did she get?

651
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,780
It's the poison of tea.

652
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,700
Once the poison of tea enters the blood,

653
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,660
it will be very strong and no medicine can be used.

654
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,740
She will die.

655
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,340
If you want to use poison to kill her,

656
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,020
you can make her

657
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,020
more sober.

658
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,260
You can try to help her.

659
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,620
If you're not strong enough,

660
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,660
I suggest

661
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,820
you can use the medicine to kill her.

662
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,820
Although the tiger palm is poisonous,

663
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,980
its effect

664
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,580
can slow down the wind.

665
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,260
Use poison to kill her?

666
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,420
That's right.

667
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,700
She used the Yangzhou Bay to suppress the poison of tea.

668
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,020
She shouldn't use her strength

669
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,100
every time.

670
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:34,860
What will happen

671
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,380
if she uses her strength?

672
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,300
The more she uses her strength,

673
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,100
the more the poison will enter her lungs

674
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,460
and harm her life.

675
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,300
When the time comes,

676
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,180
it will be like this.

677
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,300
Even if I try to kill her,

678
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,100
it can last for a month.

679
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,580
You always want to get rid of me

680
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,220
because you're afraid that I'll know who you are.

681
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,140
So you're also the White-spawn Hero.

682
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,980
You've been hiding it from me for so long.

683
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,380
I don't know anything.

684
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,500
I'm still worried about your safety.

685
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,060
Lord Fang,

686
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,020
I didn't

687
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,860
hide something on purpose.

688
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,980
I always thought she pretended not to know martial arts.

689
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,660
It's just to hide her identity.

690
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,260
She used the Yangzhou Bay to save people more than once.

691
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,060
It's actually a cost of life.

692
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,420
She taught me the Yangzhou Bay.

693
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,820
She used the Yangzhou Bay to save me and others.

694
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,420
Can I save her too?

695
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,740
How long have you been practicing the Yangzhou Bay?

696
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,500
A few months.

697
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,340
Then you can practice the Yangzhou Bay every day

698
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,140
to attract her inner energy

699
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,300
so that she won't be dizzy and sleepwalking every day.

700
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,660
But if there is no Yangzhou Bay's pure inner power

701
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,100
that can last at least ten years,

702
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,420
it's impossible to save people

703
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,860
like her.

704
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,740
She only has one month's life.

705
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,580
She can't wait ten years.

706
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,100
I don't believe it.

707
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,020
There is no way out.

708
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,140
No one believed she could come back alive.

709
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,460
Isn't that good?

710
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,100
There will be a time.

711
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,060
Even if I have to search the world,

712
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,380
I must find a way to save her.

713
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,300
You can go to Yun Yin Mountain to find Qin Po.

714
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,460
Maybe you can save her.

715
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,780
Isn't this where Master Li Xiang Yi

716
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,180
came from, Mount Qimu?

717
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,740
Is this where Qin Po is?

718
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,940
Don't you know that the wife of Mount Qimu is Qin Po?

719
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,340
She still lives in the Cloud Pavilion of Mount Yun Yin.

720
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,180
It's just that this place is very secretive.

721
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,460
You've got everything I want, right?

722
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:58,020
My Zong

723
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,220
You've succeeded.

724
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,020
Thanks to you,

725
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,540
the Golden Thread Embroidery has destroyed so many secret chambers.

726
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,660
Don't worry.

727
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,500
Baichuan Courtyard will punish you and punish you.

728
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,700
I will help you get the medicine back.

729
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,340
There's one thing I want to figure out.

730
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,980
Xiao Qiao got married.

731
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,620
You sneaked into the Four Gu Sects.

732
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,340
You poisoned Qiao Wanmei.

733
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,260
Who did you do it for?

734
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,340
You're asking me like this.

735
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,740
I guess you already know.

736
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:29,580
Of course I want to test Yang Zhongman.

737
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,860
Li Xiangyi is not dead.

738
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,020
He is...

739
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,020
Li Lianhua.

740
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,140
It's really her.

741
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,820
Look at your expression.

742
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,660
What's wrong with her?

743
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,060
Li Xiangyi has become Li Lianhua.

744
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,500
She's not as old as she used to be.

745
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,700
But there's one thing

746
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,820
you should worry about.

747
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,420
You used the poison of Bichazhi to harm her.

748
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,500
She will come to you to settle it.

749
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,300
So,

750
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,540
why don't you solve it in secret first?

751
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,740
In case of future trouble.

752
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:14,860
Saintess.

753
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,300
Save me.

754
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,820
Saintess.

755
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,740
What's wrong with you?

756
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,420
Someone sent back the letter of the Pearl of Zongzheng.

757
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,780
And they also killed this couple.

758
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,020
They sent love jade butterfly.

759
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,180
Don't you know

760
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,460
Qiao's feelings for Saintess?

761
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,580
I can't die if I have a second heart.

762
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,140
It's her wishful thinking.

763
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,780
Her wishful thinking?

764
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,540
It's said that you've been dating her for years.

765
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,500
Since it's not for her,

766
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,140
is it because of Wan Shengdao?

767
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,620
What are you talking about?

768
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,660
When you were recovering from your injury,

769
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,980
I went to check the battle in the East Sea.

770
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,620
I found out that Wan Shengdao has the risk of retreating to the South.

771
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,300
I wanted to find out the bottom line.

772
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:12,100
So I wanted to approach you and cooperate with you.

773
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,260
Really?

774
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,980
What did you find out?

775
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,340
Have you seen the owner of Wan Shengdao?

776
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:25,220
You haven't remembered those things?

777
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:32,540
Master, he's very secretive.

778
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,060
Qiao only contacted Fengqing.

779
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,660
I don't know anything else.

780
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,380
But if you give Qiao some time,

781
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,460
I'll find out the person behind him

782
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,620
and give it to you.

783
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:44,940
Then you should know

784
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,060
why they want to find Luo Moding.

785
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,460
It's hard to deny.

786
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,580
You're the descendant of the South Indian royal family.

787
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,420
Qiao Liqiang,

788
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,740
what else do you have to hide from me?

789
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:03,500
Master, I have nothing to hide from you.

790
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:07,420
I'll tell you everything about Luo Moding.

791
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,420
Luo Moding

792
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,820
has the Purple Peacock that can detect the Night Fire Peacock.

793
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,100
Through the Purple Peacock, it can find the Peacock

794
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,220
and generate more Night Fire Peacocks.

795
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,980
So Wan Shengdao

796
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,780
wanted to manipulate the Night Fire Peacock.

797
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,020
So he sent someone to kill the Peacock

798
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,420
and let them follow the order.

799
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,660
How did he do that?

800
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,340
Qiao has been away from his homeland for too long.

801
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,540
How could I know this?

802
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,740
Only a special insect specialist knows it.

803
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,340
What can you get then?

804
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,260
Qiao's heart for you.

805
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,180
You can see it clearly.

806
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,180
I don't ask for anything.

807
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,260
I just want to help you

808
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,060
to accomplish your great cause through those people.

809
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,460
In that case,

810
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,260
give me the thing.

811
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,260
Open the Heavenly Army of Luo Moding.

812
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,660
Master, you are so kind.

813
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,300
Qiao only has one.

814
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,380
Besides, I've been with the Pearl of Zongzheng

815
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,860
for so long.

816
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,820
I just want to use it to collect all the Heavenly Army

817
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:08,900
and open Luo Moding.

818
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,380
So I can make any move to you.

819
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,060
Since then,

820
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,860
everything is under the control of you.

821
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,540
Isn't it good?

822
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,020
Give it to me.

823
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,580
Master.

824
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,060
Give it to me.

825
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,020
Do as I said.

826
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,540
Let your Pearl of Zongzheng

827
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:41,100
find Luo Moding and the rest of the Heavenly Army as soon as possible.

828
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,260
Mom.

829
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:21,820
Mom.

830
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,660
Run.

831
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,180
Hurry.

832
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:28,860
Are you okay?

833
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,540
I'm fine.

834
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,180
This is my place.

835
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,180
I'll beat you next time.

836
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:39,780
Go.

837
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,860
Hurry.

838
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,660
Hurry.

839
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,660
Hurry.

840
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,660
Hurry.

841
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,660
Hurry.

842
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,660
Hurry.

843
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,660
Hurry.

844
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,660
Hurry.

845
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,660
Hurry.

846
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:51,860
Hurry.

847
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,460
Mother.

848
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:14,420
You're blocking me with the Mewu Formation again.

849
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,540
I just want to go down the mountain and have a drink.

850
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,540
Do you have to be so angry?

851
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,260
I'm not angry.

852
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:53,260
I'm just a little bit angry.

853
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,260

00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,260
