2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Kissing myself thousands of times

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The most reluctant moment is that moment

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Live in the world

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A thousand miles of madness

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who doesn't wander

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
On the edge of the world

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Live in the world

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
A thousand times of youthfulness

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not drunk like a grudge

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
A journey through the world

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Like a dream

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Live in the world

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
A thousand miles of madness

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Who doesn't wander

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
On the edge of the world

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Live in the world

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
A thousand times of youthfulness

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm not drunk like a grudge

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
A journey through the world

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Like a dream

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Live in the world

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
A thousand times of youthfulness

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
End of martial arts battle

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
At one time became a legend

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Someone took him as the hope of the Central Plains martial arts

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But more people have defeated him

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Including the leader of the demon sect, the Golden Abyss Alliance, Di Feseng

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He didn't hesitate to hurt Li Xiangyi's senior brother, Shan Gu Dao

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Caused Li Xiangyi to fight

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The weather is cold, this is too much

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Don't talk

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Be careful of the leader

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Is there someone there?

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's Li Xiangyi

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Li Xiangyi

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Li Xiangyi

40
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Li Xiangyi

41
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You finally came

42
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
As you wish

43
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Today is the death day of you and the Golden Abyss Alliance

44
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Where is my senior brother Shan Gu Dao's body?

45
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Want to know, win me first

46
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Li Xiangyi

47
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Li Xiangyi

50
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Li Xiangyi

51
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Li Xiangyi

52
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Li Xiangyi

53
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Li Xiangyi

54
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Li Xiangyi

55
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Li Xiangyi

56
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Li Xiangyi

57
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Li Xiangyi

58
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Li Xiangyi

59
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Li Xiangyi

60
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Li Xiangyi

61
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Li Xiangyi

62
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Li Xiangyi

63
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Li Xiangyi

64
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Li Xiangyi

65
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Li Xiangyi

66
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Li Xiangyi

67
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Li Xiangyi

68
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Li Xiangyi

69
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Li Xiangyi

70
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Li Xiangyi

71
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Li Xiangyi

72
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Li Xiangyi

73
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Li Xiangyi

74
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Li Xiangyi

75
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Li Xiangyi

76
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Li Xiangyi

77
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Li Xiangyi

78
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Your biggest weakness is that you like being a hero

79
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
A swordsman should have no weakness

80
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,940
No.

81
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,540
You're gonna kill us soon.

82
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,540
No.

83
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,740
No need.

84
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,820
We are planning to meet you with home people.

85
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,340
Kill them.

86
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,340
I won!

87
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,340
Where is my senior brother's body?

88
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,340
Where is my senior brother's body?

89
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,340
Go.

90
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,340
That day,

91
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:44,340
the sun and moon were not shining in the dark of the sky.

92
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,340
It is said that

93
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:51,340
Li Xiangyi was poisoned by the trap of the Golden Abyss Alliance.

94
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:57,340
But the Golden Abyss Alliance was eliminated by the Four Gu Sects not long after.

95
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,340
But the Four Gu Sects

96
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,340
are also very powerful.

97
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:07,340
They only left a white-clad grudge.

98
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,340
Isn't Li Xiangyi the best in the world?

99
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,340
How can he die the best in the world?

100
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,340
Li Xiangyi must be still alive.

101
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,340
His sword is so fast.

102
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,340
He can kill Ji Feisheng with one sword.

103
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,340
No.

104
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,340
It must be the Demon King who killed him with a sharp knife.

105
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,340
Congratulations.

106
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,340
You have a wife.

107
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,340
Are you crazy?

108
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,340
Why should I be pregnant?

109
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,340
I'm here to see my waist.

110
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,340
Waist. Waist.

111
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,340
Although you hurt your waist,

112
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,340
but the lady in the street hurt her heart.

113
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,340
I'm here to see my waist.

114
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,340
What does it have to do with the Wang Guangfu?

115
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,340
Don't move.

116
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,340
I'm also curious.

117
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,340
Why did the lady in the street hit your waist?

118
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,340
You...

119
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,340
What nonsense are you talking about?

120
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,340
Your face is swollen.

121
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,340
Your tongue is tired.

122
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,340
It must be caused by the fire.

123
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,340
But your father is very kind.

124
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,340
Your wife is smiling.

125
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,340
It's not her fault.

126
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,340
You said your waist was pulled out from the neighboring village.

127
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,340
But there are clearly some marks of the octagonal marks left by the washing machine.

128
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,340
You sell pork.

129
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,340
From the collar to the foot,

130
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,340
it's all clean.

131
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,340
And the fragrance of the foot.

132
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,340
What a coincidence.

133
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:43,340
The lady in the street is the one who does the washing.

134
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,340
Okay.

135
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,340
I'm doing business.

136
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,340
Can't I take care of the business?

137
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,340
Of course you can.

138
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,340
It's only ten miles from the neighboring village to bring a pig.

139
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,340
It's a short journey.

140
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,340
It's necessary.

141
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,340
Is it necessary?

142
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,340
You stop on the way and take a bath.

143
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,340
Do you still want to eat?

144
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,340
Is this kind of bar really a stage?

145
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,340
You put the song of the song under the table.

146
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,340
You dare not go to worship it in the open.

147
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,340
You want a child but don't want to be responsible.

148
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,340
No wonder someone kicked you out.

149
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,340
Okay, five taels of silver.

150
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,340
I'll pay you every day.

151
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,340
You rob?

152
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,340
These high-quality people.

153
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,340
Five taels of silver.

154
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,340
You don't want it?

155
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,340
Okay, it's okay if you don't want it.

156
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,340
I'll ask my wife to get it.

157
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,340
Don't don't don't don't.

158
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,340
I want it.

159
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,340
I want it.

160
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,340
Here you are.

161
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,340
Give it to me.

162
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,340
Thank you.

163
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,340
Let's go.

164
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,340
This rib is good.

165
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,340
Fat and lean.

166
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,340
You can cook a good dinner.

167
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,340
You old sick ghost.

168
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,340
You coughed in the middle of the night.

169
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,340
I can hear it all the way.

170
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,340
You coughed a little silver.

171
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,340
You're a police officer.

172
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,340
You're a police officer.

173
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,340
I can raise a fox.

174
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,340
Right? Fox?

175
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,340
You are the divine doctor Li Lianhua.

176
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,340
Who?

177
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,340
Divine doctor Li Lianhua.

178
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,340
No.

179
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,340
Divine doctor Li, you're back.

180
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,340
Yes.

181
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,340
Last March,

182
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,340
did you save the dead young master of the family

183
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,340
Shi Wenjue from the Iron Pillar Gate in Yizhou?

184
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,340
I don't remember this person.

185
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,340
It seems like it's not me.

186
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,340
I want you to cure someone for me.

187
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,340
A dead person.

188
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,140
According to the latest news,

189
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,840
noes from Old Tang's Competition Space

190
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:10,880
are illegal.

191
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,000
They are not for sale.

192
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,500
Song Yi Kun.

193
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:14,960
You are not that kind of person.

194
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,600
Did he say it before?

195
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,800
Don't wanna see his face.

196
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,000
My man.

197
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,000
What a mean creature you were back there.

198
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:27,720
Mr. Wang,

199
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,660
there is this farewell store

200
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,340
Dear clip.

201
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,600
That vegetables he bought

202
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,000
steer a combo with saying

203
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,540
that Mr. Zhang is calling from the street.

204
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,440
Yeah,

205
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,240
you're taking a group photo of him.

206
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,620
Come on.

207
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,460
The ritual of Baichuan Brothel is about to begin.

208
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,340

for the three tests.

216
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,300
He'll be the new recruit

217
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,020
of this year's Baichuan Academy.

218
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,820
The fake candidate for this year's test

219
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,260
is Yuan Jiankang,

220
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,340
the young hero.

221
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,340
Mr. Chen.

222
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,780
Mr. Chen.

223
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,820
Yuan Jiankang?

224
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,500
Why does his name sound so familiar?

225
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,580
Hand over the badge.

226
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,100
Wait.

227
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,020
Take off your mask.

228
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:32,620
Aren't theyฺye Life hubs ฺthe former pass squad澤t

229
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,180
Headmaster,

230
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,400
I suppose you meet the right person first.

231
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,280
Yes.

232
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,860
Valve!

233
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,040
It's you!

234
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,420
Hello,

235
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,280
my Lanyan!

236
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:46,860
Hello.

237
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,780
I hear this familiar.

238
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,860
They are all

239
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,960
in Followed by Sa andll急,

240
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:53,720
right?

241
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,420
It's She,

242
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,240
BTW.

243
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,220
Wait,

244
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,220
what are you doing here again?

245
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,880
Why can't I be here?

246
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,540
I've been studying here for three years,

247
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,180
and you're

248
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,100
You said it.

249
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,660
Does your parents know you're here?

250
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,420
I...

251
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,940
Minister Fang and Master He sent a letter.

252
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,460
They haven't finished it yet.

253
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,060
If Wu'er enters the Baichuan Courtyard,

254
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,820
we'll tear it down and cover it with bamboo.

255
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,860
You're the only one in the Tianji Villa and the Fang family.

256
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,060
We...

257
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,300
Of course, we're not afraid of anything.

258
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,180
But we don't need to do anything.

259
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,340
All right.

260
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,100
Tie Young Master up and send him back.

261
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,580
Wait.

262
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,260
Sect Leader Li asked me to come.

263
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,980
Don't you even listen to Sect Leader Li's order?

264
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,500
Sect Leader Li?

265
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,860
My master left me this sword.

266
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,540
You should know the words on it.

267
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,660
How should I know?

268
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,540
You're...

269
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,300
She's right.

270
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,300
As my master,

271
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,220
I'm in charge of nascent lift.

272
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,060
And I'm a disciple of your sect leader, Qingchen.

273
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,140
the Sword of the Master who made the steel.

274
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,780
But few people know

275
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,620
that he made the Sword of the Softness.

276
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,220
It's called Wenjing.

277
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,020
My master never pulled out Wenjing

278
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:39,980
in public.

279
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,980
People all over the world know that

280
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,700
there are more than five swords.

281
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,300
And I've seen it.

282
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,260
Are you really the disciple of the master?

283
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,020
I've said it.

284
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,140
We're family.

285
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,820
How could I lie to you?

286
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,380
Well.

287
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,380
Now you can take me in.

288
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,900
But I...

289
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,460
There was a disaster in the Silk Valley.

290
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,860
The shipyard gave this land to my mother.

291
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,900
It's a contract.

292
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,100
I won't let the shipyard of the master

293
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,580
be torn into a bamboo roll by my mother.

294
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:21,860
It's...

295
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,420
Since it's the master's last wish...

296
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,500
It's his last wish.

297
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,380
It's not his last wish.

298
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,300
My master just disappeared.

299
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,060
He didn't die.

300
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,460
So I want to stay in the shipyard

301
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,300
and wait for my master to come back

302
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,740
to rebuild the Silk Gate.

303
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,340
Young Master,

304
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,420
is it a success?

305
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,740
Luckily, my uncle told me

306
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,740
a good reason.

307
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,140
Luckily, my uncle told me

308
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,420
a secret of the master.

309
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,660
Otherwise,

310
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,900
I almost failed.

311
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,300
Young Master, you're so great.

312
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,020
But if Madam knows that

313
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,620
you pretended to be ill and came here

314
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,180
to take the exam,

315
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,860
will she break your leg?

316
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:05,740
And Young Master,

317
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,380
if Master knows that

318
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,180
His Majesty wants Young Master to be the Prince Consort,

319
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,860
and Young Master overheard it and ran away from it,

320
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,140
will he break your other leg?

321
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,620
You two

322
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,540
can't be afraid of your Young Master's good side.

323
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:19,900
Don't worry.

324
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,060
After your Young Master

325
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,980
becomes a detective in the civil and political world,

326
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,260
they'll know

327
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,740
that I'm more suitable

328
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,180
for the civil and political world

329
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,340
than the temple.

330
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:30,900
So, Young Master,

331
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,020
where are we going now?

332
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,260
Jiazhou.

333
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,260
Wang Qingshan, the leader of the Mount Ling Sect,

334
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,940
sent me a letter a few days ago.

335
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,900
He said that he found the contact number of the Golden Abyss Alliance

336
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,780
in Jiazhou.

337
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,100
He suspected that there were still evil spirits in Jiazhou.

338
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,940
We were going to send someone to investigate,

339
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,700
but we just got the news

340
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,460
that Wang Qingshan had died.

341
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,980
How did he die?

342
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,340
He was sent back to the Immortal Sect.

343
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,700
The Mount Ling Sect has a long life-long practice.

344
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,620
But the time to go to the Immortal Sect

345
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,180
is too coincidental.

346
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,500
I'll go to Jiazhou to investigate it.

347
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:06,540
Okay.

348
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,260
Sir, this way, please.

349
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:36,980
Please.

350
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,900
Sir, what would you like to order?

351
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,740
Anything goes.

352
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,580
I'll have it.

353
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,580
Then give me one of each.

354
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,540
Okay.

355
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,380
Wait a moment, sir.

356
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,100
Be more certain in heart!

357
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,220
Get in there!

358
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,660
Fuck dozen!

359
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,980
How dare you trick me!

360
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,740
You said that you went to the brothel

361
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,180
You're asking for trouble.

362
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,980
You're just doing it.

363
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,220
But you want that dog to bark.

364
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,980
You bark and bark every day.

365
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,500
Are you playing with the big men?

366
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,980
Is it dog or you who likes to bark?

367
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:21,980
You're right.

368
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,820
Sometimes, animals not only like to bark,

369
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,540
but also talk more than humans.

370
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,700
If you don't save them today,

371
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,100
I'll destroy your useless claws.

372
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,500
I'll see how you can play tricks on us.

373
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:38,260
Let's go die.

374
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,820
You're forcing me to do it.

375
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:06,940
Waiter!

376
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,060
Sir.

377
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,220
Tell me.

378
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,740
What's going on?

379
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,540
These men

380
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,980
stopped at a coffin.

381
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,740
They caught a doctor

382
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,820
and forced him to save the dead.

383
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,940
This doctor is interesting.

384
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,140
He said he needed a condition to save the dead.

385
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,340
He had to make his dog fall out of the coffin.

386
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,140
He's not an immortal.

387
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,340
How could he save the dead?

388
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,580
This man is right.

389
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,980
If people don't follow the rules,

390
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,660
what's the difference between them and animals?

391
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,300
You brat, what's your background?

392
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,500
How dare you meddle in Fenghuo Hall's affairs?

393
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,820
Who am I?

394
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,100
Bai Chuan Yuan?

395
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,580
It's a misunderstanding.

396
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,500
It's all a misunderstanding.

397
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,780
You're Bai Chuan Yuan's brother.

398
00:23:59,020 --> 00:23:59,780
I didn't know that.

399
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,740
Sorry for the inconvenience.

400
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,020
But Fenghuo Hall is not a criminal.

401
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,460
I don't know why Bai Chuan Yuan

402
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,980
has to meddle in Fenghuo Hall's affairs.

403
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,020
It's a misunderstanding.

404
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,140
It's a misunderstanding.

405
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,260
It's a misunderstanding.

406
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,860
It's a misunderstanding.

407
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,060
Bai Chuan Yuan

408
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,620
is a man of his word.

409
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,380
Well said.

410
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,780
Well said.

411
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,220
Little brother.

412
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,300
You're a detective, right?

413
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,300
You're here at the right time.

414
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,620
You're here at the right time.

415
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,500
They...

416
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,900
They killed someone.

417
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,660
Killed someone?

418
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,700
Who did they kill?

419
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,260
Arrest them quickly.

420
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,100
Tell me.

421
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,540
What case is it?

422
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,660
We killed the people we should kill.

423
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,260
We shouldn't die now, right?

424
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,620
Right.

425
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,500
You said we should die now.

426
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,140
You opened the shop in front of us.

427
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,100
You opened it.

428
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:53,900
You opened it.

429
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:54,780
You opened it.

430
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,620
You opened it.

431
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,420
You opened it.

432
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,340
You opened it.

433
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,460
What are you doing?

434
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,260
Look.

435
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,300
You're staring at me.

436
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,140
Okay, stop talking.

437
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,180
Where is he?

438
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,780
Take me to see him.

439
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,820
The God-like hand of the temple?

440
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,580
It's him.

441
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,100
Li Er.

442
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,580
Your nose is cold.

443
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,020
Your breath is dry.

444
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:29,940
There's no pulse.

445
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,100
You can't die anymore.

446
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,220
As for the cause of death,

447
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,140
it's probably your meteor hammer.

448
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,140
Young... Young Hero.

449
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,940
He stole the treasure of our Fenghuo Hall.

450
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,940
The thief is a disciple of the Shaolin School.

451
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,980
He practiced the Golden Bell.

452
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,860
He can't die like this.

453
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:48,980
Right.

454
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,500
If that's the case,

455
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,940
then we should kill him.

456
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:53,980
Yes.

457
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,980
If that's the case,

458
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,340
what does it have to do with this doctor?

459
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,700
Did he kill him?

460
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:00,700
No.

461
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,980
He stole the thing with the temple master?

462
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:03,820
No.

463
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,900
If that's the case,

464
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,300
why would you make it difficult for this...

465
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,020
Li Lianhua?

466
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,220
Where's Dr. Li Lianhua?

467
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,020
Well said, Young Hero.

468
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,260
Did... Did we lose our treasure for nothing?

469
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,940
Didn't you just kill someone?

470
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,020
He took your thing.

471
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,300
You took his life.

472
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,260
It's a loss for him.

473
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,100
You could have found the thing.

474
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,900
But before you do it,

475
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,980
you should think twice.

476
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,780
Everyone's life is precious.

477
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,100
You have to pay for it.

478
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:40,100
I'll inform the Baichuan Courtyard about this body.

479
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,420
As for how to deal with it,

480
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,620
it's up to us.

481
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,180
Dr. Li.

482
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:46,980
You may leave.

483
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,780
Thank you, Young Hero.

484
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,740
He can't leave.

485
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:52,900
Bro.

486
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,820
We lost the treasure of the temple.

487
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,060
He's the only hope we can get.

488
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,340
The Iron Armor Gate Master Wen Jue and Iron Man Xiao

489
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,980
all said that Li Lianhua

490
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,020
is a doctor who can cure people's dead bones.

491
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,420
They wouldn't lie.

492
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,660
But I only remember

493
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,980
I gave them some phoenix-like ointment.

494
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,500
But this ointment

495
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,380
can't make people die.

496
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,820
I'm not that good.

497
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,820
You believe in the story of

498
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,540
treating people's dead bones and deceiving children?

499
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,540
Exactly.

500
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,940
If this man can come back to life,

501
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,100
I'll believe him.

502
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,220
What?

503
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,420
You're not convinced?

504
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,460
Thirteen years ago,

505
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,460
the court had an agreement with the Four Gu Sects.

506
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,740
The people's affairs were under the control of the Gui Ya Sect.

507
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:39,860
The grudges of the martial arts world

508
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,300
were decided by the Baichuan Courtyard.

509
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,340
You don't even care about

510
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,580
the financial situation of the Baichuan Courtyard?

511
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,340
Fine.

512
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,340
We'll never

513
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,820
let the Phoenix Hall take over the matter.

514
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:52,700
Let's go.

515
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,100
Let's go.

516
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,660
Thank you for saving my life.

517
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,100
But Young Hero,

518
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,500
now,

519
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,380
they should...

520
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,380
Don't worry.

521
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,940
As long as I'm here,

522
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,540
no one dares to mess with you.

523
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,580
Don't play with me tonight.

524
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,300
I'll send you out of the city tomorrow morning.

525
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,060
Well...

526
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:20,980
Well...

527
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,300
I'm so embarrassed.

528
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,900
But my city...

529
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,900
I'll take care of

530
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,660
all the expenses.

531
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,500
It's a good thing.

532
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,260
Young Master,

533
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,220
the dessert is coarse.

534
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,220
I'll go and prepare some more.

535
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,060
Thank you, Minister Feng.

536
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,220
Don't be so polite.

537
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,580
How do you know my surname is Fang?

538
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,180
You dare to call Minister Feng's son

539
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,300
as your son.

540
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,100
You're so bold

541
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,580
to call him that.

542
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,620
You know my father?

543
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,740
It's in our fusha that

544
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:18,900
бытьuqu'o

545
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,460
Lizang,

546
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,620
we finally get to eat it.

547
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,060
Young Master Fang.

548
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,500
Your sword is broken.

549
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,780
If I'm not mistaken,

550
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,340
this sword was created since

551
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,700
it merges the satisfied beauty of the америк for the first time.

552
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:34,620
Last year,

553
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:35,740
place of the crane

554
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,780
was made in a sunshine戒

555
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,500
and calculations were remembered by Tianji Temple.

556
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,900
Young Master Fang

557
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,380
has a better reputation than Xing.

558
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,260
ın my mind,

559
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,300
I didn't want to be too arrogant

560
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,300
when I was walking around the world.

561
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,300
Young Master Fang,

562
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,940
you must be a new member of the Bai Chuan Academy.

563
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,940
That's right.

564
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,940
I've been a lawyer since I was a child.

565
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,940
When I grew up,

566
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,580
I must join the Bai Chuan Academy

567
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,100
and rebuild the Four Valley Gate.

568
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,100
So,

569
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,580
I don't want others to know

570
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,980
that I'm the son of the direction.

571
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,980
I just hope

572
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,380
that others will remember me

573
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,660
as a common Bai Chuan Academy member.

574
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,660
Have a taste.

575
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,980
You're so ambitious.

576
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,020
I like you,

577
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,660
a young man who's passionate about his passion.

578
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,660
It seems that we're really close.

579
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,180
Come on.

580
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,860
To Young Master Fang.

581
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,580
To Bai Chuan Academy.

582
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,260
Come on.

583
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,100
It's an honor.

584
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:29,620
Cheers.

585
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,620
Cheers.

586
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,260
By the way,

587
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,260
Young Master Fang,

588
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,460
I wonder how you plan to

589
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,460
deal with the mastermind of the temple, Kun.

590
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,260
I'll send a letter to the Bai Chuan Academy later

591
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,060
and ask them to send someone to bring it back.

592
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,060
By the way, Li,

593
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,180
I'm curious about one thing.

594
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,140
Why did the people of the Fenghuo Hall

595
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,380
say that

596
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,380
you once saved two dead people?

597
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,020
I don't believe in any way

598
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,300
to bring back the dead.

599
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,820
Of course,

600
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,660
there's a way to bring back the dead.

601
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,220
Because sometimes,

602
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,220
the dead may not be the dead.

603
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,620
Li,

604
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,940
what do you mean?

605
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,620
This tea water...

606
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,900
I haven't met a detective for so many years.

607
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,820
I didn't expect that the first detective

608
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,220
is such a bold man like you.

609
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,940
Bai Chuan Academy

610
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,940
is really a year away from being a year.

611
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,820
Who are you?

612
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,220
Since you helped me,

613
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,820
I'll say a few more words.

614
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,620
When you first came down the mountain,

615
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,620
you made the first mistake of being a detective.

616
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,620
You believed in others too easily.

617
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,620
You deserve it.

618
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,820
The second one

619
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,420
is that you're not professional.

620
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,420
You deserve it.

621
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,420
I'm not saying that you're not a good detective.

622
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,020
Just go home after playing for a few rounds.

623
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,220
By the way,

624
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,220
there's also

625
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,620
a maid and a servant outside.

626
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,620
It's really not a good thing.

627
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,820
Wait for me.

628
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,420
Get up.

629
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,620
Li,

630
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,820
why are you so late?

631
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,620
Do you know that

632
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,420
it will only take three days for the Ghostly Seat Palace to be built?

633
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,820
Keep your voice down.

634
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,220
The people of the Phoenix Hall are too cruel.

635
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,620
They almost killed me.

636
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,820
Why are you so nosy?

637
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,220
I'm just a little bit worried.

638
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,420
I'm just worried about you.

639
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,620
I'm just worried about you.

640
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,820
You really killed me.

641
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,820
Why are you so nosy?

642
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,820
Hurry up and leave.

643
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,820
Okay, let's go.

644
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,820
Let's go.

645
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,620
Hurry up.

646
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,020
Hurry up.

647
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,820
Where's the person in the lotus?

648
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,420
My men just found out

649
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,220
that he knew the palace and the palace.

650
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,420
He clearly deliberately led us to find him here.

651
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,620
Boss,

652
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,620
bad news.

653
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,420
The person in the coffin is missing.

654
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,620
Hurry up and chase after him.

655
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,220
Wait for me here.

656
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,220
Wait for me.

657
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,020
Hua Hua,

658
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,620
you prepared quite well.

659
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,020
Stop right there.

660
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,020
Don't run.

661
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,220
Let's go.

662
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,620
You brat,

663
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,820
what did you say before?

664
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,220
If this brother can really bring his son back to life,

665
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,220
you're like him.

666
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:13,620
I must

667
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,620
ask Bai Chuan Yue for an explanation about this.

668
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,020
Let's go.

669
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,220
Let's go.

670
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,620
Li Liehua.

671
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,420
Hua Hua, did you see that?

672
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,620
That man's face just now

673
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,020
was really so ugly.

674
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,020
I owe you a favor.

675
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,420
I'm sorry.

676
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,420
This Phoenix Hall

677
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,820
is not a good thing.

678
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,020
The bandits from Zuoshan started to take advantage of it.

679
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,020
Five years ago,

680
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,420
they forcibly took away the secret of the Shi family

681
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,220
and used it as their own.

682
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,020
They couldn't help it.

683
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,620
They could only find me to steal it back.

684
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,620
But today,

685
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,220
fortunately, you're here.

686
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:47,820
This play...

687
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,820
Where's my stuff?

688
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,420
Right.

689
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,420
Here.

690
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,420
What's wrong?

691
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,420
I'm not sure.

692
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,420
I'm not sure.

693
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,420
I'm not sure.

694
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,820
Here.

695
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,820
You're really strange.

696
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,220
You said you'd steal it.

697
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,420
I want to give you half of the money.

698
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,220
You don't want it?

699
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,220
You only want the stone manual and five taels of silver.

700
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,620
You said you wouldn't steal it.

701
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,220
Whoever owes you three cents,

702
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,820
you have to chase them back to the end of the world.

703
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,820
My medical fee

704
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,220
is five taels.

705
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,020
One more is not enough.

706
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,620
One less is not enough.

707
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,820
This is the manual

708
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,220
my master hid.

709
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,620
I don't know how it got into

710
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,220
other people's hands.

711
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,620
I just like to eat this.

712
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,620
You're always mysterious.

713
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,420
I didn't know you had some skills.

714
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,820
You can do some light work.

715
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,420
Who's your master?

716
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,820
Don't think too much.

717
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,020
I'm just a lonely ghost.

718
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,020
Li Lianhua.

719
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,220
Are you looking for

720
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,020
the people of the Golden Abyss Alliance?

721
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,420
It's my professional habit.

722
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,420
I'm just curious.

723
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,220
Besides,

724
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,220
I'll just turn you over.

725
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,020
I can't find anything important.

726
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,420
Goodbye.

727
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,620
There's a temple in the home.

728
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,620
Maybe someone you're looking for

729
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,820
is in the forest.

730
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,020
Young Master,

731
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,620
calm down.

732
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,620
We often walk in the rivers and lakes.

733
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,620
Sometimes we get wet.

734
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,020
It's common.

735
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,020
I just didn't expect that person

736
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,620
to be so unruly.

737
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,020
Who knew it was an old fox?

738
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:23,820
Young Master,

739
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,020
why don't we go back to the village?

740
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,620
Do you remember the owner said

741
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,020
if you dare to join the Baiquan Academy,

742
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,020
I'll teach you a good lesson.

743
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,820
My mother always scares me.

744
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,020
When did you make me look good?

745
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,820
Actually, Young Master,

746
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,020
I just found out

747
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,820
that all the money we brought out

748
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,820
was wasted.

749
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,020
What?

750
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,820
The manager asked us to move out overnight.

751
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,820
But you know

752
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,420
we're used to living in high-class rooms.

753
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,220
We can't stay outside.

754
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,220
No.

755
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,820
Since we've made up our minds,

756
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,420
how can we go back so easily?

757
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,620
Let's go to Jiazhou

758
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,620
and handle Zhen's.

759
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,020
I'll go with you.

760
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,420
I'll be back before the flower is withered.

761
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,820
Li Lianhua,

762
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,820
even if the world calls me to catch you,

763
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,620
I can only get rid of this evil spirit.

764
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:27,620
Brother,

765
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,620
I'm here to see you.

766
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,020
I want to ask you

767
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,020
how is the Lingshan Sect in Jiazhou?

768
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,820
You want to join the Lingshan Sect?

769
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,820
You're a bit old.

770
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,020
There are many people who want to join the Lingshan Sect.

771
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,020
Go and ask them.

772
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,420
Do you know that

773
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,620
the person the Lingshan Sect is looking for

774
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,620
is the successor of their sect leader?

775
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,220
If I can

776
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,220
find this young man,

777
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,420
then this young man

778
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,420
can inherit all the resources of the Lingshan Sect.

779
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,420
Which child

780
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,420
can be so lucky?

781
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,620
The sixth birthday of the fourth month of the year.

782
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,420
Lingshan Zhi?

783
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:09,820
Wang Fu,

784
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,220
what are you doing?

785
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,020
Young Master,

786
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,420
I'm the sixth birthday of the fourth month.

787
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,820
Look at this Zhi.

788
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,820
Does it look like Lingshan Zhi?

789
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:16,820
Wang Fu,

790
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,020
how long have you not washed your feet?

791
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,020
I think you have a Zhi in your head.

792
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,020
You believe in this kind of thing?

793
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,620
Wang Fu!

794
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,020
Fu,

795
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,220
why are you here?

796
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,220
I've been looking for you everywhere.

797
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,220
Cousin?

798
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,220
Did I tell you?

799
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,020
It's clearly you.

800
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,820
Come with me to the Lingshan Sect.

801
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,420
Wait.

802
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,820
What cousin?

803
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,620
Make it clear before you leave.

804
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,020
When the matter of the stone bronze of Lingshan came out,

805
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,220
I thought

806
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,220
this is our Wang Fu.

807
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,820
I hurried to the mountain villa to find you.

808
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,220
The people in the mountain villa said

809
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,620
you and the young master ran out.

810
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,820
Fortunately, I met you here.

811
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,020
We came

812
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,420
for the sake of the Lingshan Sect's sect leader,

813
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,620
so you should tell me everything you know.

814
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,020
The Lingshan Sect

815
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,820
is mainly a sect of Fengshui Xuanmen.

816
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,220
There are many disciples,

817
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,620
so they are rich and rich.

818
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,420
Of course,

819
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,020
compared with you, the young master of the Fang family,

820
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,020
it's not comparable.

821
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,620
But in our local area,

822
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,020
it's also a different kind of sect.

823
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,820
But the Lingshan Sect

824
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,020
can't marry.

825
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,820
Once the sect leader is gone,

826
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,420
it can only be a lost sect.

827
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,620
But seven days ago,

828
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,820
the sect leader of the Lingshan Sect

829
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:28,220
actually took the lead in public.

830
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,420
Master,

831
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,820
it's time to start the negotiation.

832
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,020
Don't panic.

833
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,620
You have been following our Lingshan Sect

834
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,020
for many years.

835
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,020
Today, I summon you here

836
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,420
not for the sake of the Xuanfa,

837
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:53,220
but to say goodbye to you.

838
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:58,220
I will be guided by the gods

839
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,620
to cultivate the Three Flower Pavilion

840
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,220
and the weapon of the Tongyuan Sect.

841
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:06,220
I will remove this body

842
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,620
and leave the golden body as a bodyguard.

843
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,220
In the future,

844
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:14,020
you can see the golden body as you see me.

845
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,420
Goodbye, Sect Leader.

846
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,420
I will leave now.

847
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,420
It's like this.

848
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,620
He died like this

849
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,020
and became the Lingshan Sect?

850
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,420
It's true.

851
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,620
Fu,

852
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,620
this is fate.

853
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,620
You said that you would never

854
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,220
see the golden body again

855
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,420
when you were young.

856
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,420
But now,

857
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,020
you are not.

858
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,420
Your father abandoned you two

859
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,220
and your mother died.

860
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,620
I thought

861
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,620
you would be so miserable in this life.

862
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,620
But who knew

863
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,420
we would have such a good thing to do?

864
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,820
It sounds so lively and interesting.

865
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,020
It seems that I have to go.

866
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,020
No, no, no.

867
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:03,820
Be gentle.

868
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,820
We are so rude.

869
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,420
Get out of here.

870
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,420
Although your sect is dead,

871
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,020
you have to pay me back

872
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,020
for being rude.

873
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:16,820
You are its disciple.

874
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:17,820
Take this money.

875
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,020
Get out.

876
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,420
Listen,

877
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,220
I know your sect leader.

878
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,220
Can I go in and pay my respects?

879
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,420
You are not leaving, are you?

880
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,620
Then I will not be polite.

881
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,420
Don't come down.

882
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,020
I will go.

883
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,220
What a coincidence, Doctor Li.

884
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,220
I thought it would take a long time to find you.

885
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,620
I didn't expect that

886
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,620
the world is so good.

887
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,420
We meet again so soon.

888
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,620
It is a coincidence.

889
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,620
I am sorry.

890
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,020
I didn't mean to disturb you.

891
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,220
I was just thinking that

892
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,220
you are not here.

893
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,220
I was just thinking that

894
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,220
you are not here.

895
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,220
I was just thinking that

896
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,220
you are not here.

897
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,220
I was just thinking that

898
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,220
you are not here.

899
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,220
I was thinking that

900
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,220
you are not here.

901
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,220
Internally empty,

902
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:24,520
and gorgeous except for

903
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,140
I was in prison for a long time.

904
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,060
Little brother,

905
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,860
you're not going to be there for a long time, right?

906
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,260
Actually, I just helped out.

907
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,940
I got five taels of silver for the debt.

908
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:38,140
That's the least I can do.

909
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,100
Besides,

910
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,220
I'll explain it to you.

911
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,180
Actually, this Miaoshou Kong Kong

912
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,860
went back to the West Palace, right?

913
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,460
That's right.

914
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,980
I never believed

915
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,420
in anything that could bring me back to life.

916
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,340
That day, I thought about it all night.

917
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,460
What did you do?

918
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,980
You finally made me think it through.

919
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:04,700
Little brother,

920
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,060
you're really something.

921
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:08,820
I can't tell

922
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,940
that you have a lot of knowledge.

923
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,820
Now, this Guixi Palace

924
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,540
is just a little bit left.

925
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,500
Ordinary people really can't tell.

926
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,060
I'm smart. I know.

927
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:19,220
Come with me.

928
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,100
Wait, little brother.

929
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,260
Since you're so smart,

930
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,700
you must know

931
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,180
what's most useful to you.

932
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,520
I've found something.

933
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:30,860
It's the

934
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,300
drought from the North Road.

935
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:46,580
There were

936
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:49,540
still steamed 만들어,

937
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,340
yellow sea,

938
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:57,060
women's clothing,

939
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:30,460
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

940
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:33,460
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

941
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:36,460
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

942
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:39,460
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

943
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:42,460
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

944
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:45,460
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

945
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:48,460
