00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Kissing

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
After four thousand times

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Thousands of times

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The most reluctant moment

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Is that moment

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Live in the world

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A thousand miles of madness

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who has never wandered

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Who doesn't know

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The faraway faraway

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
On the edge of the world

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Live in the world

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Youthful and wild

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
No matter how drunk or sad

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
A journey through the world

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Like a dream

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Live in the world

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
A thousand miles of madness

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Who has never wandered

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Who doesn't know

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The faraway faraway

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
On the edge of the world

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Live in the world

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Youthful and wild

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
No matter how drunk or sad

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
A journey through the world

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Like a dream

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Live in the world

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The head is a very strange thing

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's a very strange thing

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Will reveal many secrets

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Whether it's dead or alive

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Same

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What do you mean

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Now

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We still have to put it first

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let Zhang Xingchi's matter be investigated

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The murderer killed in front

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Knock on the wall and drive the goods behind

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That means he must have entered from the front door

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But Zhang Jingwu lives in the same room

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But I didn't see anything

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What if they didn't live in the same room

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Room 4 and room 5 are in the same row

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Which one is room 4

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Do you still need to ask

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
One four one five

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Of course this side

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
strange

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Why is this also four

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Mud on the mud

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The darker it gets

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The murderer only needs to cover

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The white dot in the door

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And this white dust

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Add a little on the door number four

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Then four and five will be replaced

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Only need to go back to the house separately

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Then in the middle of this time gap

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Just move a little

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The one who goes back to the house later

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Will mistake room 5

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
As room 4

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But I saw last night

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The two brothers of the lion and tiger

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Go to the library together

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You should go back to the house together

69
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Why are you still separated on the road

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Then why did you lose them

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'll take you

72
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'll go with them last night

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I lost more people

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I know

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Let's show it

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'll go with you

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Lotus

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You took the wrong way

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
This is the Xuanji last night

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The fog here is heavy

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You can go to the west gate and support me

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The masters don't need to do more

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Simple steps will make people lost

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Lotus

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Zhang Qinghu and her brother

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Just separated by this

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It turns out so

88
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,000
That's what happened last night.

89
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,360
I see.

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,920
I was drunk and walked too slowly.

91
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,920
My brother couldn't wait.

92
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,200
So he went back to his room.

93
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,680
Nine years later,

94
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,240
the house is different from your relatives' house.

95
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,080
Your brother was separated by the community.

96
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,360
When he went back to his room,

97
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,080
he lived in a different room.

98
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,280
We two lived in the same guest house.

99
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,280
Did you hear your brother's voice?

100
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,880
No.

101
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,160
I was drunk and sleepy.

102
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,320
So I went back to my room.

103
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,560
So your brother lived in room 4.

104
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,160
And you lived in room 5.

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,160
After last night's banquet,

106
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,280
the master said that on the way back,

107
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,720
he was separated by the city.

108
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,600
Zhang Qing was in front.

109
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,400
Zhang Qing was behind.

110
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,720
Zhang Qing couldn't wait to go to Zhang Qing's house.

111
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,600
So he went back to room 4.

112
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,240
The murderer put black mud and white ash on the door signs.

113
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,040
They were in the same room.

114
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,280
He went to room 4 and killed Zhang Qing.

115
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,040
When Zhang Qing came back,

116
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,280
the night was dark.

117
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,200
He saw the door sign.

118
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,800
So he moved into room 5.

119
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,440
The murderer opened the door.

120
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,000
He knocked on the door.

121
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,520
He told the suspect to the kid.

122
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,840
Then he took the door sign.

123
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,640
Zhang Qing's business has been changed.

124
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,320
He was transferred to room 4.

125
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,040
Then he found his brother was killed.

126
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,080
Please tell me.

127
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,440
Who killed my brother?

128
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,640
He could think of the spy on the way to the city.

129
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,040
And he could think of the way to lead people away.

130
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,440
In my opinion,

131
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,480
he knows the skill of the chessboard.

132
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,160
Jennifer,

133
00:06:38,880 --> 00:07:02,840
prettyว

134
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,080
We brothers have no grudges against you.

135
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,600
Why did you kill him?

136
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,320
No grudges?

137
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,040
Do you remember the name Yu Wanwan?

138
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,680
Luo Chendie Yu Wanwan?

139
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,760
I heard that

140
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,040
he was with his brother on his way to the business.

141
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,840
His brother is you?

142
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,480
The Dun family is hard to learn and hard to enter.

143
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,160
The hard work is not used much.

144
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,760
The disciples of the Shiyi School are all light-hearted.

145
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,640
Under the circumstances,

146
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,360
I have seen the Tao.

147
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,520
Not only can I learn something,

148
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,560
but also make money.

149
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,200
I am fascinated.

150
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,600
I took my sister

151
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,840
and became the head of the family.

152
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,480
Five years ago,

153
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,520
my cousin joined hands with the Shihu and Shuangshas.

154
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,760
But Zhang Jinshi took advantage of it.

155
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,160
I have been looking for a chance to avenge.

156
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,240
But the Shihu and Shuangshas

157
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,080
are too powerful to do anything.

158
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,120
I have waited for this opportunity

159
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,720
to avenge.

160
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,000
Zhang Jinshi is the Yuzan Chunhou of my sister.

161
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,720
I killed him.

162
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,760
I should kill him.

163
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,240
But I didn't see his dog head.

164
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,960
I killed you to avenge my brother.

165
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,440
Call me.

166
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,280
Stop.

167
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,960
I have found the murderer who killed my brother.

168
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,280
What does Master Wei mean?

169
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,920
I asked you to come to the Yipin Firm.

170
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,440
Just let go of your personal grudges.

171
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,840
After you succeed,

172
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,360
you can kill as you like.

173
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,200
Whatever you want.

174
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,080
Lord Wei,

175
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,720
did you take the wrong medicine today?

176
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,440
What I said just now

177
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,440
is for everyone here.

178
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,480
Listen to me carefully and go to the Yipin Firm.

179
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,400
Otherwise,

180
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,680
I can't die in this mountain out of my own will.

181
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,320
Master Wei,

182
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,240
We're here to be punished.

183
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,000
Do you think

184
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:26,320
you can use it to

185
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,320
Frozen Man.

186
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,180
It can be ​​刺�ُ蜉

187
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,000
this poison that's Lyc force

188
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,920
You've done it.

189
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,120
You poisoned the wine?

190
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,680
Ghost-stewing soup has no color and no taste.

191
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,400
It's not hard to cure it at first.

192
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,960
But after six hours,

193
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,480
the poison will enter the bone.

194
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,600
Then it will be the only antidote

195
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,120
for the person who can be poisoned.

196
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,840
In order to wait for the poison to be released,

197
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,080
I've been listening to you

198
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,320
making a fuss all night.

199
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,680
Don't worry about it.

200
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,600
Master Wei Zhuang,

201
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,640
what are you doing this for?

202
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,600
Since yesterday,

203
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,960
since I entered Wei Zhuang,

204
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,440
you've been having conflicts.

205
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,720
How can you be united?

206
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,320
Now it's easy.

207
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,480
If you want to live,

208
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,760
just listen to me.

209
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,720
Help me enter the Ghost-stewing Fountain to live.

210
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,640
Give me the antidote.

211
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,560
The Huangquan silk.

212
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,560
The Huangquan silk of the Huangquan Fourteen Thieves.

213
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,840
How did you get it?

214
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,840
The Huangquan silk of the Huangquan Fourteen Thieves

215
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,120
was naturally obtained

216
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,760
from the corpse of the Huangquan Fourteen Thieves.

217
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,600
You two are the descendants

218
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,520
of the Huangquan Fourteen Thieves, Zhang Qian Huang.

219
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,120
I've known it for a long time.

220
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,520
The seven headless corpses of the Huangquan Fourteen Thieves

221
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,320
are the seven tailed ones of the Huangquan Fourteen Thieves.

222
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,880
I cut their heads off

223
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,400
just to make you know

224
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,960
that even the Huangquan Fourteen Thieves died here.

225
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,720
You dare not come.

226
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,520
How can you kill the Fourteen Thieves?

227
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,320
Don't accuse me of this.

228
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,080
I didn't lie in the wine and wine.

229
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,200
The seven tailed ones have been dead in a single grave for ten years.

230
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,800
I cut their heads off

231
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,120
just to hide their identities.

232
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,360
The head is a very strange thing.

233
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,680
It will reveal many secrets.

234
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,400
Whether dead or alive, it's the same.

235
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,400
The Huangquan Fourteen Thieves have been dead for ten years.

236
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,200
You don't think that the Fourteen Thieves disappeared

237
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,520
because they were rich and left for a long time, right?

238
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,600
It's also a pity that you two

239
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,000
took the token to find someone.

240
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,080
But it's simple now.

241
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,240
Just be obedient and help me record a grave.

242
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,520
Maybe I can see the remains of your family.

243
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,880
The Yin Poison of the new Wei...

244
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,880
Everyone, let's go together.

245
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,200
There is still a chance to win.

246
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,400
Everyone, go!

247
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,400
It's painful to be poisoned into the internal organs and organs.

248
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,720
Sect Leader, please help me.

249
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,560
Sect Leader, please forgive me for being rude.

250
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,520
I'm in the grave.

251
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,720
I'll use my soul to help you.

252
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,280
Please spare my life.

253
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,080
We are of the same kind.

254
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,920
I don't want to do anything.

255
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,320
As long as you are obedient,

256
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,440
I'll send you half a antidote

257
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,760
to slow the poison down for three days.

258
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,160
After the test is done,

259
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,520
I'll give you the rest of the antidote.

260
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,640
And I'll send the treasure in the grave to the prison.

261
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,880
I'll be very happy.

262
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I promise to be obedient.

263
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,440
Please give me the antidote.

264
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,400
I'll be very happy.

265
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,560
Please give me the antidote.

266
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,640
Please give me the antidote.

267
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,400
Please give me the antidote.

268
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,920
Please give me the antidote.

269
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,280
Please give me the antidote.

270
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,360
Very good.

271
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
After you have taken the antidote,

272
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,840
go to the warehouse and pick some tools to use.

273
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,840
Get ready to leave at any time.

274
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,160
Go.

275
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,840
Li Lianhua.

276
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,840
I know there are few guards in the northeast corner.

277
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,360
It's more convenient for you to go from there.

278
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:10,840
Go?

279
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,840
Master Wei has lived in Mount Puchu for a lifetime.

280
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,320
If he really has the ability to enter the grave,

281
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,200
he can move the 14th Tao of the Imperial Fist out.

282
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,680
Why do you have to wait for this time?

283
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,960
There must be a man behind the seven Tao Chen's case.

284
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,960
The chief of the fake sect is behind the man's death.

285
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,320
This is a dangerous task.

286
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,200
You don't know martial arts.

287
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,200
You'd better leave now.

288
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,760
If I leave,

289
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,200
you'll be back to the boat gang.

290
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,200
Leave me alone.

291
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,240
It's too late if you don't leave.

292
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,160
Go.

293
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,280
Go.

294
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,200
Don't be anxious. Listen to me.

295
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,040
I'll be honest.

296
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,880
Actually,

297
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,360
I'm the same as them.

298
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,040
I came for this one-piece fan.

299
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,240
You want to get back to the main character?

300
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,680
How do you know?

301
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,320
It's not so simple you want to copy.

302
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,760
Have a try.

303
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,260
Although you're an empty-minded.

304
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,520
Be hairy eater.

305
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,600
Of course you don't care

306
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,920
about the elite talent in the one-piece review.

307
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,240
I'll stand in front of you

308
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,160
and I have never once questioned real martial arts for you.

309
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,480
You surely don't care about the chaos in martial art?

310
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,640
Also,

311
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,320
you don't work for Zhu Jia any more.

312
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,800
And you are not interested in the spiritual weapon.

313
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,560
You only wanted Guan Yin절.

314
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,800
So what is this situation?

315
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,000
I have to increase my medical experience.

316
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,600
I...

317
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,800
I need to treat my illness.

318
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,600
Treat your illness?

319
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,640
You're injured. Are you sick?

320
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,000
But when I was young,

321
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,720
I had a heart attack.

322
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,040
I couldn't sleep or eat well at night.

323
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,920
My heart ached too.

324
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,880
Only this guanyin hammer

325
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,160
could cure my illness.

326
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,520
This guanyin hammer

327
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,080
is just a medicine that can hide for a hundred years.

328
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:48,960
If it can't save people,

329
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,000
what's the point?

330
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,040
Besides,

331
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,200
I'm a man of many diseases.

332
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,640
I'm not a man of many graces.

333
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,200
Don't worry.

334
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,520
I'll find a way to get this guanyin hammer.

335
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,120
Actually, I don't have to do it.

336
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,320
Then be fair.

337
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,720
I'll get you the medicine.

338
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,000
You'll check it for me.

339
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,800
What do you think?

340
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,400
It's settled.

341
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,840
What's the child's background?

342
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,120
The owner controlled everyone with poison

343
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,680
to poison her.

344
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,800
She was even carried up the mountain.

345
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,280
Maybe she's afraid that she'll get into a difficult situation.

346
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,040
I don't believe it.

347
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,160
No.

348
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,960
I have to find a chance to try.

349
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,160
Don't go.

350
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,600
Why?

351
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,600
Don't you think Zhang Qinghu is strange?

352
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,040
You'd better

353
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,320
pay more attention to her.

354
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,680
I'm not afraid of her.

355
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,280
I'm afraid she'll be in danger.

356
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,800
I'm afraid she'll be in danger.

357
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,120
I'm afraid she'll be in danger.

358
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,280
I'm afraid she'll be in danger.

359
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,560
You'd better pay more attention to her.

360
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,520
There's a problem.

361
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,400
The door in front should be blocked.

362
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,080
Look.

363
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:17,880
Hmm?

364
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,040
Such a big bell

365
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,520
was pierced.

366
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,320
It's obvious that it fell from the finger.

367
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,600
It should be here

368
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,200
when you look at it like this.

369
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,200
The Seven-storied City is here.

370
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,080
The Yi Pin Firm is here, too.

371
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,320
The person behind should be nearby

372
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,800
waiting for us to enter the tomb.

373
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,080
Everyone,

374
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,360
you see it, right?

375
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,320
This is the Yi Pin Firm.

376
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,400
It's a pity that

377
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,600
it was blocked by the Qi Sect's tree.

378
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,480
Brother Gu,

379
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,720
thank you.

380
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,120
Hmm.

381
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,280
Hmm.

382
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,880
The Qi Sect's Firm is really amazing.

383
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,480
It hides the body

384
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,800
because of the mountain.

385
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,040
But

386
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,520
the eye of the formation was broken not long ago.

387
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,560
Otherwise, even my master came,

388
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,120
he wouldn't have found this place.

389
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,600
The mountain wall in front

390
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,000
is not natural.

391
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,440
It should be a secret gate of the Qi Sect.

392
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,480
It must be the entrance of the Yi Pin Firm.

393
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,000
The gate is built with the mountain.

394
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,080
The men of Nanyin have put their blood in it.

395
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,840
Unless the mountain is blocked,

396
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,840
it's hard to open it.

397
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,280
There's a gap there.

398
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,200
If we can get in,

399
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,640
maybe we can open the gate from the inside.

400
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,680
There are more than ten gaps on the ground.

401
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,400
No one can get in.

402
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:14,920
Brother Gu.

403
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,400
You're sending sound send�s all over.

404
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,160
You're....

405
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,880
He Station has a very tired punish Owner.

406
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,960
But you still recognize him.

407
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,660
Today,

408
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,600
we'll punish him правильно.

409
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,800
I can't leave.

410
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,260
No, no.

411
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,220
No?

412
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,160
Sir!

413
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,040
What?

414
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,660
You can't.

415
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,260
Let's go.

416
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,680
I can't hurt theumard.

417
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,720
With her...

418
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,440
Okay, okay.

419
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,040
Now you know why you're in the first-class tomb.

420
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,040
It's because of my senior.

421
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,960
Did you see that?

422
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,480
Don't be so anxious.

423
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,080
This Qinggong is good at sunbathing.

424
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,400
Not only is it good,

425
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,280
but also it's famous in the book of outsiders.

426
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,760
Why are you so quiet?

427
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,480
I can't tell the truth.

428
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,960
I can't tell the truth.

429
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:14,840
Ohhh

430
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,520
Then you eat.

431
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,520
How was it?

432
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,400
Duan Hai was unlucky.

433
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,800
He worked in our field.

434
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,000
I haven't seen the dead yet.

435
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,320
Now the tomb is open.

436
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
Don't waste time.

437
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,200
Tian Nu, you stay here.

438
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,080
If anyone comes, send a signal.

439
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:21,800
Go.

440
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,640
Why are you laughing?

441
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,080
It's more like a human heart.

442
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,840
Get some water.

443
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,200
Maybe someone enemies.

444
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,600
Turn the10 Moscow's direction.

445
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,560
Could it be Zhang Qing?

446
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,280
If he doesn't try to change direction,

447
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,880
two people would get hurt.

448
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,080
His body will be deets down.

449
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,800
He is very powerful.

450
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,280
Marry him.

451
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,800
The King's Avatar

452
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,800
Episode 16

453
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,800
The long-lost lanterns of Kang Jinmen are all gold-plated.

454
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,800
This is a good ranking.

455
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,800
Everyone, you won't lose.

456
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
After the test is done,

457
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,800
you won't be able to do this underground business for the rest of your lives.

458
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,800
This... this is going up?

459
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,800
The Sword-gathering Pillar?

460
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,800
It is indeed the Sword-gathering Pillar.

461
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,800
The other wooden pillars are all facing down.

462
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,800
The Sword-gathering Pillar is built on a mountain.

463
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,800
The wooden pillars are built on the top of the mountain

464
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,800
so that the owner can rest under the sky.

465
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,800
This way, the construction of the wooden pillars can be considered as a crime of not serving the owner.

466
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,800
And the bell of the mountain is not the prestige of the royal family.

467
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,800
The craftsmen of Nanyin have also put in a lot of effort.

468
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,800
This is strange.

469
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,800
Why is this door open?

470
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Don't move!

471
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,800
Father!

472
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,880
Father!

473
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,500
Father!

474
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,300
Father!

475
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,300
Father!

476
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,800
Father!

477
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,800
An Att crime of competitive fishing

478
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,800
is only known to status Rex and bacteria

479
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,800
This is the other one of the 14th Thieves of the Imperial Faction.

480
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,920
I've already said that

481
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,320
the 14th Thieves of the Imperial Faction have been dead in this tomb for 10 years.

482
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,320
Zheng Qinghu, I never lied to you.

483
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,720
The corpse is not badly damaged.

484
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,320
I think it's because the tomb is special.

485
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,120
That's why the body of the Prime Minister of the Mountain King

486
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,920
is considered to be a new corpse.

487
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,720
It seems that the 14th Thieves of the Imperial Faction

488
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,320
are not really dead.

489
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,520
I think it's because of the body of the Prime Minister of the Mountain King

490
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,320
that the body of the Prime Minister of the Mountain King

491
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,240
was buried here 10 years ago.

492
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,240
In fact, they were trapped here.

493
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,240
Why are they half buried in the tomb and half buried under the mountain?

494
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,240
How can I know that?

495
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,720
But the 14th Thieves of the Imperial Faction

496
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,440
actually brought us the news of the Ghost Valley

497
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,840
and let us know.

498
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,240
Then we can't let them down.

499
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,240
Everyone, follow me.

500
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,640
Come on, open it.

501
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,720
She wasn't just a selbstvideo.

502
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,440
Here she is.

503
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,520
Lady 올� agricultural hostess.

504
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,520
How many treasures are there in the Zhenmu City of King of Jingjing?

505
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,520
Everyone, aren't you curious?

506
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,020
What are you curious about?

507
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,020
The treasure is important!

508
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,520
It's small. The scale is small.

509
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,020
Why are you so eager to take these second-class goods?

510
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,520
Once we find the Zhenmu City, I'm afraid your pockets won't be enough.

511
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,520
This is the end of the road.

512
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,520
The real entrance must be around here.

513
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,020
Whoever finds the entrance first will be the first to be selected.

514
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,520
If you want to be rich, you can use your skills.

515
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,020
Most of the entrance to the mechanism here is complete.

516
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,020
How do you think the person behind the door

517
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,020
threw the abandoned body out of the tomb?

518
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:03,020
The most simple way is to throw it out.

519
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,520
Throw it out?

520
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,520
The first-class goods are not on the ground, but on the bottom of the mountain, isn't it?

521
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,020
Stretch out your hand.

522
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,020
Hey!

523
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,020
What feeling?

524
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,520
What feeling?

525
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,020
Why is there wind?

526
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,520
There is indeed a gap here.

527
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,020
Now I understand.

528
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,520
These seven bodies were thrown out of here.

529
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,020
They were accidentally bumped into by the mountain people who were taken to the wedding.

530
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,020
So they saw the moon's sudden wind and the flowers of the flowers

531
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,020
were distorted and twisted.

532
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,020
They thought the bodies were still alive.

533
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,020
It's exactly the same.

534
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,020
What?

535
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,020
What?

536
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,020
Oh, I mean,

537
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:08,020
the gap here is exactly the same as the gate of the tomb.

538
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,020
They were all cut open by a palm.

539
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,520
So,

540
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,020
the person behind the door's power is beyond any doubt.

541
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,520
When he came here, he didn't find the real tomb.

542
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,020
So he threw the body out.

543
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,520
Then he broke the gate.

544
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,020
The purpose is to lure others to help him find the real tomb.

545
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,520
You're right.

546
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,520
We are just as he expected.

547
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,020
Interesting.

548
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,020
Gopan, what do you want?

549
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,020
Have you forgotten that you were forced to poison?

550
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,020
The poison of the Wei family is so strong

551
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,020
that it can't be detoxified after it's done.

552
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:08,020
By then, it's the safest way to kill everyone and take the treasure.

553
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,020
I don't want to be your enemy.

554
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,520
I just want to live.

555
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,520
We'll catch him and torture him.

556
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,520
And we'll give him the antidote.

557
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,020
By then, you'll have the same amount of treasure.

558
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,020
Isn't that better?

559
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,020
You didn't come.

560
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,020
So you're the one who's rebelling.

561
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,520
Be good and listen to me.

562
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,520
Don't try to kill me.

563
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,020
This kid...

564
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,020
This Tu Fu Zi is a master.

565
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:57,520
It's normal for him to have a student from the Wei family.

566
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,020
Besides, look at him.

567
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,520
He's a good talker.

568
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,020
He's a master of secret weapons.

569
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,520
Hero Ge, how are you?

570
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,520
Let me help you up.

571
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,020
Hero Ge, are you okay?

572
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,520
Thank you, Young Master Fang.

573
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,520
We've been poisoned by the Sect Leader.

574
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,020
We're all in the same boat.

575
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,020
If we don't get the antidote this time,

576
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,020
we'll have to work hard to take you back to Bai Chuan Court

577
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,520
to find the owner of the White House to save us.

578
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,020
Of course.

579
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,520
Thank you.

580
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,520
You all know now, right?

581
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,520
Whoever kills my young master will die.

582
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,020
Hurry up and find him.

583
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,020
Lady, this way.

584
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,020
You'll have to make a move.

585
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,020
You don't have to.

586
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,020
The secret weapons here

587
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,020
correspond to six places in the middle of eight directions.

588
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,020
Therefore, they only need twochemists.

589
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,020
Here is a trap

590
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,020
even if the originally targeted one is in one of them.

591
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,500
Brothers, when did you receive that important map?

592
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,220
Someone wanted to find it and then you sent them away?

593
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,180
How do you know?

594
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,740
This is an emergency remote control Scratch.

595
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,060
Any danger that happens,

596
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,460
just use it to hide.

597
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:43,180
The

598
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:43,220
Guanyin Gate

599
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,460
Germ―

600
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,860
You really want to get rid of the ấyózé?

601
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,300
Kill them all?

602
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,580
There are still some ways.

603
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,460
The plum blossom watch

604
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,380
was sent by the three of you.

605
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,380
Tell me, who is it?

606
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,300
Who?

607
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,420
I was almost killed by the dark aura just now.

608
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,180
I was hurt by the inner core.

609
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,700
I don't need any more martial arts.

610
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,580
Zhang Qinghu,

611
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,500
the two of you are the same.

612
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,500
I remember you used the dark aura.

613
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,860
The fire was extinguished just now.

614
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,860
It's the same.

615
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:10,860
Exactly.

616
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,660
I used the tiger teeth watch.

617
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,700
I've never used the plum blossom watch.

618
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,300
But you're good at acting

619
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,500
when you're in the same situation.

620
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,860
Aren't you tired?

621
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,420
What do you mean?

622
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,580
I mean,

623
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,060
is it tiring to act as your own brother?

624
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,340
Have you forgotten who you are?

625
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,340
Zhang Qingshi.

626
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,580
Zhang Qingshi?

627
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,380
I've killed her.

628
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,100
You did kill someone.

629
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,340
But it doesn't mean

630
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,100
you killed Zhang Qingshi.

631
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,540
I followed Zhang Qingshi to the room last night.

632
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,900
I won't kill her wrong.

633
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,740
Everyone knows

634
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,980
the two of you are the same.

635
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,380
You're the same person.

636
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,140
How do you distinguish them?

637
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,140
Zhang Qingshi wears a double hammer

638
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,340
and black clothes.

639
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,100
Zhang Qinghu wears a white coat

640
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,660
and a black bag.

641
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:06,900
They're the same.

642
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,380
Let me ask you.

643
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,100
If they change their clothes,

644
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,300
what about the weapon?

645
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,260
Why did they do that?

646
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,140
It's a coincidence.

647
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,940
I once told the owner of the restaurant

648
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,580
that in the middle of the battle,

649
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,860
Zhang Qingshi

650
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,500
loves to drink the wine.

651
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,860
He treats everyone

652
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,060
with the new noodles.

653
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,980
Yes.

654
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,780
How much did they win yesterday?

655
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,580
Zhang Qingshi drank half a jar

656
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,260
and then he was drunk.

657
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,980
Zhang Qinghu

658
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,620
drank half a cup of wine

659
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,700
and then he kicked it with tea.

660
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,420
You should know

661
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,420
you're wrong.

662
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,900
The Zhang Qingshi you followed last night

663
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,220
was very sober.

664
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,620
Instead, he followed Zhang Qinghu

665
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,980
and was full of wine.

666
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,620
Besides, you said

667
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,020
you had a jade hairpin

668
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,420
and a monkey's snout.

669
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,140
After you killed him,

670
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,340
I want to ask you

671
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,100
where the head went.

672
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,820
I also wonder

673
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,660
why he was beheaded.

674
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,780
It's simple.

675
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,420
Because he was beheaded,

676
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,940
we don't know who he is.

677
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,420
Last night,

678
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,660
it was a mess.

679
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,020
It's hot.

680
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,380
Brother, come on.

681
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,380
Put it on.

682
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,540
Last night at nine,

683
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,180
Zhang Qingshi was drunk

684
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,660
because of the wind.

685
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,180
He was hot.

686
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,660
So he took off the black long-sleeved shirt

687
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,660
and put it on Zhang Qinghu.

688
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,660
The white suit was revealed.

689
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,540
His double-knit

690
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,940
was also held by brother.

691
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:02,020
The old Fengxing who has been hiding in the dark

692
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,820
has been dressed in black.

693
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,220
Zhang Qinghu, who held the double-knit,

694
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,660
was Zhang Qingshi.

695
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,340
He went into room 4

696
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,660
and killed him.

697
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,540
Zhang Qinghi

698
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,380
But Zhang Qingli

699
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,940
hid and came in room 5.

700
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,640
An odd situation

701
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,900
soon became a true-love scenario.

702
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,620
Zhang Qingshi's turning point

703
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,800
in the opening of room 5

704
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,800
After he turned around, he followed the right door and went back to room 4.

705
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,800
He saw his brother being stabbed and killed by a knife.

706
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,800
He put on his black shirt and double-knit shirt

707
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,800
to let him know that this was a disaster caused by his old friend.

708
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,800
And his brother became a scapegoat.

709
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,800
He thought that the murderer would continue to kill if he knew he had killed the wrong person.

710
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,800
But there was only one person left in the body.

711
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,800
He couldn't defeat the other person.

712
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,800
So he cut off his brother's head and hid it.

713
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,800
Then he became Zhang Qinghu.

714
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,800
First, to protect himself.

715
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,800
Second, to find out the murderer.

716
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
Who knows who the murderer is

717
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,800
who lost his head?

718
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,800
Brother!

719
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,800
Zhang Qingchi,

720
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,800
am I right?

721
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,800
How about this?

722
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,800
Let me analyze it for you.

723
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,800
You've read a lot of books before you left.

724
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,800
There's no evidence to prove that you've been talking about this.

725
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,800
Look, you're still so stubborn.

726
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,800
Let me say it again.

727
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:16,800
Outside the door, the dead body was suddenly turned into a sea of rubble.

728
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,800
There's no one as powerful as him.

729
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,800
Zhang Qinghu couldn't do it.

730
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,800
Only Zhang Jingshi could.

731
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,800
Look, in order to pretend to be Zhang Qinghu,

732
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,800
you've picked up this fake mole.

733
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,800
It's almost falling off.

734
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,800
Why are you so nervous?

735
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,800
I was just talking nonsense.

736
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,800
Zhang Jingshi,

737
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,800
is Zhang Qinghu's head in your room?

738
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,800
So you bastard is still alive.

739
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,800
But Zhang Jingshi doesn't know how to use hidden weapons.

740
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,800
What about this plum blossom watch?

741
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,800
Hero Ge, I won't play a trick on you.

742
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,800
Although you're injured,

743
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,800
you can still kill people with the tattoos on your sleeves.

744
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,800
You've seen him disguise as his brother

745
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,800
and use the trap to coerce him to cooperate with you.

746
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,800
So Zhang Jingshi gave you the weapon in your hand.

747
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,800
I was forced to kill you by the will of the Custodians of the Hundred-Garment Courtyard.

748
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,800
Soon, other forms will surround this place.

749
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,800
If you want to live,

750
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,800
I'll be there to help you.

751
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,800
I still advise you to let me go.

752
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,800
By the order of Bai Chuan Court?

753
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,800
No.

754
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,800
Your clothes are covered with dust and dust.

755
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,800
Only the disciples of the Sword Sect who were not able to pass the exam could wear it.

756
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,800
I asked you to beg the Master of Bai Chuan Court to read it.

757
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,800
But you agreed.

758
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,800
You didn't know that the Master of Bai Chuan Court is the most uneducated in reading books.

759
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,800
You are clearly a new disciple of the Sword Sect.

760
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,800
Also, although the bandits on the road are guilty, they shouldn't die.

761
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,800
But you killed them all.

762
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,800
You are so despicable and greedy.

763
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,800
You should go back to Bai Chuan Court with me

764
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,920
and let the

765
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,800
This is too heavy.

766
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,800
Who are you?

767
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,800

00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,840
The old man thatné

787
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,240
I need to go to the office now.

788
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,600
Your worker?

789
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,400
I have worried about him at this hour.

790
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,600
God Year Internet eggang

To talk to him, ask for an invitation,

I can't, with things done this way...

I shouldn't not to be called god or sword.

Now you ask this question,

796
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,800
I think it's good that how can god or sword have to do better?

797
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,000
It's not up to you to decide

798
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,800
how to use the treasure here.

799
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,200
