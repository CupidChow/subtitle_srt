[Episode 20]

4
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,830
Wansheng Clan.

5
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,330
Feng Qing.

6
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,220
Back then, Jiao Liqiao secretly purchased thundering fire bombs.

7
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,020
All the funds came from the Wansheng Clan.

8
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,380
My Lord, your plan is good.

9
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,450
You knew that there must be someone who secretly helps Jiao Liqiao

10
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,979
and let the cat out of the bag.

11
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:00,539
Besides,

12
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,710
when I was investigating Jiao Liqiao,

13
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:04,710
I also accidentally found

14
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:07,420
that Jiao Liqiao has been secretly intercepting the clues about the Styx Flower.

15
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,950
I don't know her intention.

16
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,100
Keep an eye on the Styx Flower.

17
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,360
Jiao Liqiao.

18
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,990
I'll investigate her myself.

19
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:15,770
Yes.

20
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,630
What do you mean by the secret letter?

21
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,720
Your master asked me to seize power in the Jinyuan Alliance?

22
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,850
Saintess Jiao, why are you so nervous?

23
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,710
My master just wants you to think about it.

24
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,060
Sooner or later,

25
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,620
Di Feisheng will know what you've done.

26
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,680
By then, if you're in charge of the Jinyuan Alliance,

27
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,170
it'll benefit both of us.

28
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:11,660
Tell me.

29
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,800
Who is your master?

30
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,010
Ask him to come out to see me.

31
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,000
My Lord.

32
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,120
I...

33
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:20,980
My Lord.

34
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,360
I don't need people who betray me.

35
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,980
My internal power...

36
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,180
Wuxin Huai.

37
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,410
You put Wuxin Huai into his body?

38
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,820
The medicine can only be used a little.

39
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,620
Otherwise, he'll lose his mind.

40
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,600
When he made an attempt on your life,

41
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,440
he didn't hesitate at all.

42
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,970
That's a matter between me and him.

43
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,950
If Master hadn't rescued you in time,

44
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,079
you would have died.

45
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,790
Don't flatter yourself.

46
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,060
I've already placed Wuxin Huai in his room.

47
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,680
He smelled it for days.

48
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,290
In a few days,

49
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,810
he'll definitely be addicted to it.

50
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,380
Or what?

51
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,150
His limbs and internal power

52
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,010
are weak today.

53
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,740
Otherwise,

54
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,140
you couldn't have harmed him.

55
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,350
In that case,

56
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,020
consider it as a help.

57
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:48,460
Don't worry.

58
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,240
I know you want to keep him.

59
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,140
The Wuxin Huai I put into his body can't kill him.

60
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,230
He's just injured.

61
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,210
As for how you're going to explain to the Jinyuan Alliance when you go back,

62
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,220
you can only rely on yourself.

63
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,880
Are you forcing me to turn against my lord?

64
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,560
It's been ten years.

65
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,390
The game rules should be changed.

66
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:31,800
Master.

67
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,700
Since he found out about us,

68
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,030
we can't keep him alive.

69
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,330
The doseage of the Wuxin Huai

70
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,900
is high enough to ruin his martial art skills.

71
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,020
He's useless.

72
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:43,260
What's there to worry about?

73
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,600
The effect of the knockout incense is so strong.

74
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,780
Hot steamed buns.

75
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,510
Are they freshly steamed buns?

76
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,300
-Have a look.
-I'll buy them later.

77
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:21,920
Have one.

78
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,830
I just bad-mouthed Li Xiangyi.

79
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,380
Why are you so angry?

80
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,230
What's there to be angry about?

81
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,980
Is Liu Rujing here?

82
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,340
Are you looking for Liu Rujing?

83
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,740
Blind Liu quit long ago.

84
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:44,650
He quit?

85
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,580
Blind Liu?

86
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,360
May I ask

87
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,400
how Liu Rujing went blind?

88
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,880
Ten years ago, one of his eyes was damaged

89
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,030
in the great battle.

90
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,830
His other eye also became useless during these two years.

91
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,410
You kicked him out because he went blind?

92
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,770
You're so heartless.

93
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,230
We didn't kick him out.

94
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,480
He didn't want to stay here for free.

95
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,660
But he uses dead people to do business now.

96
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,890
The money he makes is much more than the money he made when he was a guard.

97
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,690
What kind of business does he do?

98
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,460
This place is not safe.

99
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,330
There are always people who seek revenge.

100
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,970
They don't care whether or not their enemies are dead.

101
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,340
No one dares to deal with those corpses.

102
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,350
Blind Liu

103
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,180
used to belong to the Sigu Sect.

104
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,550
No one dares to make trouble for him even if he deals with corpses.

105
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,830
If you want to find him,

106
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,260
go to an inn in the suburbs

107
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,510
when you see the moon.

108
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,170
If a ghost lantern is lit,

109
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,910
it means that he's doing business tonight.

110
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,170
You'll see him inside.

111
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:33,370
Thank you.

112
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,850
Ghost lanterns.

113
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,790
He should be here.

114
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,150
Blind Liu, you screwed me over.

115
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,580
Damn you!

116
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,060
You want to sell the person who feigned death

117
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,380
for 100 taels of silver?

118
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,250
Wait and see.

119
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,040
This...

120
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:55,980
Let go of me!

121
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,470
Let's go.

122
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:08,460
Di...

123
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,580
Why are you here?

124
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:17,810
You know me?

125
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,700
Who are you?

126
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,430
Don't you remember us?

127
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,100
Don't you know who you are?

128
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,100
Who am I?

129
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,220
You almost died.

130
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,880
You forgot who you are.

131
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,100
I saved you from the river.

132
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,660
You're the husband I matched to the dead woman,

133
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,920
Yi Cunhong.

134
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,840
I'm your friend.

135
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,540
I'm your good friend.

136
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,180
Friend?

137
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:54,980
That's impossible.

138
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:05,960
This...

139
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,980
What happened?

140
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,300
I haven't gotten even with you.

141
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,590
Look for Li Lianhua.

142
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,700
His illness is not fatal,

143
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,410
but he needs to be treated as soon as possible.

144
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,590
It's hard to return the final boss's favour.

145
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,390
Are you Liu Rujing?

146
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:37,980
Tell me.

147
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,010
Who do you want to buy?

148
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,620
Yi Cunhong or Xue Lijian?

149
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,340
Let me make it clear.

150
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,300
Xiao Feidao has been chopped into 18 pieces by someone.

151
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,760
I only found three pieces.

152
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,130
But I can give you a discount.

153
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,210
We're not here to buy corpses.

154
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,930
I'm already blind.

155
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,710
I don't know who killed them.

156
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,180
It's none of my business either.

157
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,930
If you want to look for someone or seek revenge,

158
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,750
don't disturb me when I'm doing business.

159
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,480
We're not here to seek revenge.

160
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,000
We are detectives from the Baichuan Court.

161
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,400
Get lost.

162
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,010
Mr. Liu.

163
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,490
I know you used to work

164
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,660
for Shan Gudao.

165
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,330
We are colleagues.

166
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,510
Colleagues?

167
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,920
My colleagues have all died.

168
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,210
When I left the Sigu Sect,

169
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,100
I said because the Sigu Sect split,

170
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,100
I'd think of them all as dead people.

171
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,730
In my life,

172
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,420
if anyone dares to mention the Sigu Sect in front of me again,

173
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,500
I won't be polite.

174
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:33,490
You...

175
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:36,820
Mr. Liu.

176
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,230
We can leave.

177
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,530
But this person is still alive.

178
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,190
You can't sell him as a corpse.

179
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:42,740
You...

180
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,340
That's right.

181
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,700
He's a criminal on the blade list of the Baichuan Court.

182
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,940
I have to take him back.

183
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,820
So what?

184
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,880
This bastard has lain here for five days.

185
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,110
I failed to sell him.

186
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,600
He also ruined my plan.

187
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,970
Even if I don't sell him as a corpse,

188
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,080
I'll ruin his martial art skills

189
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,120
and let him do everything for me.

190
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,520
This...

191
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,920
He's seriously injured.

192
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,810
If he doesn't get treated soon,

193
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,400
he'll really die.

194
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,060
We'll pay 100 taels of silver.

195
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,700
If you were not from the Baichuan Court,

196
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,240
100 taels of silver would be acceptable.

197
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,240
But you're from the Baichuan Court.

198
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:23,980
1,000 taels of silver.

199
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,090
1,000 taels of silver?

200
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,820
Why don't you go and rob people?

201
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,770
Are you going to give it or not?

202
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:28,400
-No.
-Yes.

203
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,020
Didn't you bring money?

204
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,850
You want to spend 1,000 taels of silver ransoming him?

205
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:34,600
You know I...

206
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,230
I owe you a favour.

207
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,200
I'll explain to you later.

208
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,460
Ransom him first.

209
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
That's all I have.

210
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,020
Move over.

211
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,190
I smell of corpses.

212
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,880
You'd better give me a reasonable explanation.

213
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,070
He was poisoned with a lot of Wuxin Huai.

214
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:17,680
So?

215
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,840
Isn't it satisfying?

216
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,220
Wait.

217
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,070
Once someone is poisoned with Wuxin Huai,

218
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,920
they can't use their internal power anymore.

219
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,770
It's the top incense which can ruin people's martial art skills.

220
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,810
Why does he still have martial art skills?

221
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:33,360
Look.

222
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,570
He pierced his Laogong acupuncture point first.

223
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:37,900
He let his Genuine Qi out

224
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,100
to prevent the Wuxin Huai from going into his internal organs.

225
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,910
Then he used his internal power to reverse his meridians

226
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,980
and forced the Wuxin Huai to go into the Baihui acupuncture point behind his head.

227
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,290
Apart from Di Feisheng,

228
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,810
no one can think of this method.

229
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,700
So,

230
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,420
the reason why he didn't lose his martial art skills

231
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,340
is that the Wuxin Huai went into his Baihui acupuncture point.

232
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,400
He also lost his memory because of it.

233
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:58,760
Even so,

234
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,400
this is not the reason we should save him.

235
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,820
Because the final boss lost his memory,

236
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,820
should we forget

237
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,950
his evil deeds?

238
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,190
In my opinion,

239
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,460
we should take him

240
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,660
to the Baichuan Court

241
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,000
and put him in the 188 prisons immediately.

242
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,290
Actually, I've found the evidence before.

243
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:15,370
Di Feisheng didn't kill Shan Gudao.

244
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,340
When Shan Gudao died,

245
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,990
there was half a stick of Wuxin Huai beside him.

246
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,590
Di Feisheng was also poisoned with Wuxin Huai.

247
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,800
What a coincidence!

248
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,130
Besides, Di Feisheng's martial art skills are unpredictable.

249
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,250
Who could

250
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,780
plot against him?

251
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:36,270
You mean there's an internal conflict in the Jinyuan Alliance?

252
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,340
The person who killed your father

253
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,620
used this as bait

254
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,870
to start a battle between the Jinyuan Alliance and the Sigu Sect.

255
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,330
The Sigu Sect was damaged.

256
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,890
It didn't benefit the Jinyuan Alliance much either.

257
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,400
In the great battle at the East Sea,

258
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,320
the Jinyuan Alliance suffered a great loss.

259
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,620
Di Feisheng wouldn't do things

260
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,820
that hurt others and don't benefit himself.

261
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,440
I guess

262
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,340
someone in the Jinyuan Alliance is colluding with outsiders

263
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,540
to scheme something.

264
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,910
Wuxin Huai and the ice shards can prove it.

265
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,380
These people haven't stopped during these ten years.

266
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,510
Why don't we keep him

267
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,750
and find a breakthrough from him?

268
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,240
But he lost his memory.

269
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,060
It seems that he can't provide us

270
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,220
with any clues.

271
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,750
That's temporary.

272
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,760
With the help of his power,

273
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,220
he'll recover gradually.

274
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,210
Di Feisheng is like a good knife.

275
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,190
It'll be a pity if we break him.

276
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,740
I'm afraid he's a snake.

277
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,700
A frozen snake.

278
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,700
He'll bite you if he's awake.

279
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,640
Think about it.

280
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,890
If he really wants to kill someone,

281
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,510
he won't stop.

282
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,460
Besides,

283
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,740
he wants to get even with the people who betrayed him

284
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,900
in the Jinyuan Alliance.

285
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,770
What about now?

286
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,530
How are you going to use this broken knife

287
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:42,820
that always wants to kill people?

288
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,580
Don't worry.

289
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,360
This is the most powerful helper in the world.

290
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,750
When the sun rises tomorrow,

291
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:58,760
among the twenty people,

292
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,960
only one of you can walk out of this door.

293
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,190
Why do you make us kill each other again and again?

294
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,730
Because only in this way

295
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,410
can you remember the desire

296
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,700
to win

297
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,510
and

298
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:14,560
become the best killers.

299
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,079
Don't listen to him.

300
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,040
It's useless.

301
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,170
They planted that kind of thing in our bodies.

302
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,170
We will always submit to the family.

303
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,460
We can't escape.

304
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,550
It's inappropriate for you to treat your master like this.

305
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,460
Since you're awake,

306
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,520
take the medicine.

307
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,460
Who are you?

308
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,850
Look at your palm.

309
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,790
You can read your own handwriting, right?

310
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,900
The person you're looking for

311
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,820
is Li Lianhua.

312
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,260
That's me.

313
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,670
Look outside.

314
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,530
[Lotus Tower Medical Center]

315
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,040
You must want to ask

316
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,270
who you are.

317
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,900
Your name is Fei.

318
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,310
You're a spy from the Baichuan Court.

319
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,240
Baichuan Court?

320
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,540
Spy?

321
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,480
Give me more details.

322
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,130
The Baichuan Court is the court of the martial arts world.

323
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,770
It specializes in judging cases in the martial arts world.

324
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,370
Recently,

325
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,180
I've been investigating an old case which happened ten years ago.

326
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,300
So I asked you to infiltrate the enemy as a spy.

327
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,180
I didn't expect you

328
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,180
to be found out and plotted against.

329
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,380
It's my fault.

330
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,600
Then why did you say you are my master?

331
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,230
You used to be an abandoned disciple of the Nanhai Sect.

332
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,090
You were caught

333
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,830
as Iron Head Slave before.

334
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,510
I ransomed you.

335
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,700
You were grateful to me.

336
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,100
So you wanted to repay me.

337
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,500
But I'm not a person who helps people to be repaid.

338
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,020
So I advised you

339
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,130
to work in the Baichuan Court.

340
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,260
You helped the weak, eradicated violence,

341
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,120
and helped me investigate cases.

342
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,460
I helped the weak

343
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,600
and eradicated violence?

344
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,460
I only remember

345
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,010
I killed people.

346
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,500
You said I saved people.

347
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,210
I won't kill you.

348
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,270
I don't believe you either.

349
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,530
Do you think I'm a fool?

350
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,500
You're not a fool.

351
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,700
At least you saved one person before.

352
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:21,700
Who?

353
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:22,890
Me.

354
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,630
Your pulse is a mess.

355
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,140
You were poisoned.

356
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,410
Examine me again.

357
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,130
You have my internal power

358
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,510
in your body.

359
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,010
I'm dying.

360
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,700
You tried to save me before.

361
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,580
You have my internal power.

362
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,740
But why hasn't your condition improved?

363
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,900
Because I've been poisoned with the deadliest poison.

364
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,900
I'll die for sure.

365
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,590
You cried

366
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,370
and transferred your internal power to my body before.

367
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,860
You tried to cure me at all costs, but you failed.

368
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,510
Now I'm dying.

369
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,900
I'm not lying, right?

370
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,150
Do you believe me now?

371
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,750
It seems that you're really important to me.

372
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,020
Are you really...

373
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:12,990
Your master.

374
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:18,980
I don't think I can say these two words.

375
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,360
Never mind.

376
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,000
It doesn't matter.

377
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,290
What matters is

378
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,690
that you want to stay alive and repay me.

379
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,840
If you leave now,

380
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,010
there will be many people who want to kill you.

381
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,040
You don't know them,

382
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,080
but they know you.

383
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,480
Should I be afraid?

384
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,700
You're not afraid of fighting.

385
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,050
But it's not easy to avoid being plotted against.

386
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,290
If you die,

387
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:44,350
who will pay me back?

388
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,810
Let's count.

389
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:46,970
When I ransomed you,

390
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,020
I spent 1,000 taels of silver

391
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,070
and asked you to be a spy.

392
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,130
But you found nothing.

393
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,590
Instead, you were taken to a mortuary.

394
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,340
So

395
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,670
I spent 10,000 taels of silver

396
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,430
and ransomed you from Blind Liu.

397
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,310
If you die,

398
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,840
who will pay me back?

399
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,390
What do you want?

400
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,140
Keep investigating cases for me.

401
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,170
Each case is worth 1,000 taels of silver.

402
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,610
You can leave

403
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,760
when you pay me back.

404
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:11,980
It's strange.

405
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,670
You're dying.

406
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,380
You should think about how I can save your life.

407
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,190
Many things are more important than being alive.

408
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,740
You just said there are many things that haven't been dealt with.

409
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,900
Why were you poisoned?

410
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,220
Why was I plotted against?

411
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,680
What kind of opponent is the Jinyuan Alliance?

412
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,220
Why do you have so many questions?

413
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,020
No reason.

414
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,120
When you pay me back,

415
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,760
you'll know everything.

416
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,090
Here.

417
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:38,750
It's a deal.

418
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:43,090
You're awake.

419
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,030
Can we eat now?

420
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,660
Even Fox Spirit is hungry.

421
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,700
Who is he?

422
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,390
Your colleague.

423
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,120
Colleague?

424
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,620
Are people from the Baichuan Court so bad at martial arts?

425
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,590
What did you say?

426
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:56,500
If it weren't for me,

427
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,280
you would still be lying in the coffin with Yi Cunhong

428
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,890
who has maggots on her body.

429
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:00,570
Right.

430
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,940
You caught me off guard

431
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,780
before.

432
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,110
But today,

433
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,740
my Erya Sword is very lonely.

434
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,930
Let's have a battle.

435
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:08,170
Enough.

436
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,570
I cooked a new dish today.

437
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:10,140
Let me take you to try it.

438

It seems that Li Lianhua is not my enemy.

441
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,020
But he's hiding something.

442
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:22,490
I'll get the truth out of him sooner or later.

443
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,090
Do they smell good?

444
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,450
Look at you.

445
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,100
I created two new dishes.

446
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,250
Have a taste.

447
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,120
What a spread.

448
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,310
There are four dishes today.

449
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,500
Were all these dishes cooked by you?

450
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,100
No.

451
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,020
This one was bought at the market.

452
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,590
In that case,

453
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:48,940
you eat first.

454
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,210

Okay.

Try this one.

460

It tastes terrible.

461
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,110
I'm not blaming you.

462

Even the person who has no sense of taste

463
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,830
thinks the dishes you cooked taste terrible.

464
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:30,980
Wait.

465

It tastes good.

Fine.

You do care about him.

480

Does he know

481
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,280
you were poisoned?

you can keep this secret for me.

I have a feeling.

487
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,310
Regardless of whether what you said in the room

488
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,710
is true,

489

there is one sentence I believe is true.

490
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,360
You said I want you to be alive. I believe it.

491
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,560
You said you only remember how to kill people.

492

Did you remember

493

something which happened in the past?

00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:17,900
Mr. Liu.

512
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,670
We're here to ask you

513
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,230
about the Sigu Sect.

514
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,270
The Sigu Sect again.

515
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,990
The Sigu Sect no longer exists.

516
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,390
Although you said so,

517
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,410
you still hung a token

518
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,460
of the Sigu Sect on your waist.

519
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:33,900
Mr. Liu.

520
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:36,740
Since you still think about the Sigu Sect,

521
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,170
why are you so hostile

522
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,430
to the Baichuan Court?

523
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,410
Ten years ago,

524
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,350
since the Sigu Sect split,

525
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,480
it has no longer been in existence for me.

526
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,090
When Sect Leader was in trouble,

527
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:48,870
they all had their own schemes.

528
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,550
No one protected the sect for Sect Leader.

529
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,260
Baichuan Court, the court of the martial arts world?

530
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,050
In my eyes,

531
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,400
it's nothing.

532
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,190
In the world, it's the trend

533
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,050
that things which separate for a long time will unite

534
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,210
and that things which unite for a long time will separate.

535
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,290
The Sigu Sect was resurrected.

536
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,220
Your old colleagues are all there.

537
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,330
If you want,

538
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,560
you can go back too.

539
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,160
You don't understand.

540
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,710
There's only one Sigu Sect.

541
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,530
That's Li Xiangyi's Sigu Sect.

542
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,310
Sect Leader is gone.

543
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,380
They threw mud

544
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,500
at Sect Leader.

545
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,690
Xiao Zijin is one of them.

546
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,690
I won't accept him as the sect leader

547
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:22,690
unless I die.

548
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,340
They all said it was because Li Xiangyi

549
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,700
wanted to take revenge on the Jinyuan Alliance for Shan Gudao's death

550
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,390
that he was trapped.

551
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,920
But the matter is not that simple.

552
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,400
Why am I telling you these?

553
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,460
Leave now.

554
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,080
Mr. Liu.

555
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:38,630
Hurry up.

556
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,330
We're here for this matter.

557
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,030
Actually, this young hero

558
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,920
is Sect Leader Li's disciple.

559
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:46,080
Shan Gudao is his birth father.

560
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:46,850
What?

561
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:52,330
Mr. Liu.

562
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,210
Here.

563
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:54,850
Feel it.

564
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,750
This is my father's token.

565
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,860
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

566
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,860
You didn't give me a chance to say it.

567
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,690
Mr. Liu.

568
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,790
You said there's something wrong with my father's death.

569
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,830
Before he died,

570
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,410
did you notice anything unusual?

571
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,910
Or did he offend anyone?

572
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:17,390
Follow me.

573
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:30,600
[Jin Banshan]

574
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,710
What is this?

575
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:33,890
Before Second Sect Leader died,

576
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:35,800
I found

577
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,460
Xiao Tianhu, who was one of Four Tigers with Silver Spears,

578
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,780
was gathering information.

579
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,660
But back then,

580
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,770
it was I who was in charge of collecting information

581
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,230
in the martial arts world.

582
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,300
I found he did it behind my back.

583
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,310
I was worried that he betrayed the Sigu Sect.

584
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,410
So I followed him several times.

585
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,060
But in the end,

586
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,870
I found it was Second Sect Leader

587
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:56,260
who ordered Four Tigers with Silver Spears to do it together.

588
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:56,990
To be honest,

589
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,880
I was a little unhappy.

590
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,410
I thought Second Sect Leader

591
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,160
didn't consider me as one of them.

592
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,020
But that night,

593
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,230
he called me

594
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,440
and told me a secret.

595
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,430
What secret did he tell you?

596
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,420
He said he was worried

597
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,690
that the Jinyuan Alliance secretly supported Nanyin's plan to resurrect the country

598
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,220
and harmed Central Plains.

599
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,540
Didn't Nanyin

600
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,390
disappear a couple of hundred years ago?

601
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,780
I had the same reaction.

602
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,880
But Second Sect Leader told me

603
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,230
that

604
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:30,950
it has always been the Nanyin people's ambition to resurrect their country.

605
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,430
In the past few centuries,

606
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,540
they've successively

607
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,540
sent many people to Central Plains.

608
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,800
The most important people

609
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,060
are these four people.

610
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:42,060
These four rich Nanyin merchants

611
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,460
brought countless treasures and four magic weapons

612
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,180
from Nanyin.

613
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,990
It's said that there is one weapon that can destroy the world.

614
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,230
But somehow something went wrong.

615
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,590
These four people didn't take action.

616
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,420
They stayed in Central Plains instead.

617
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:59,280
Their descendants who are currently alive are the third generation.

618
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:00,960
Liu Rujing.

619
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,340
I want to stop them.

620
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,560
For some unknown reason,

621
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,750
Second Sect Leader found they were colluding with the Jinyuan Alliance.

622
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,220
They were ready to do something.

623
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,300
So he wanted to use this opportunity

624
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,620
to find the descendants of these four people.

625
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,550
Unfortunately,

626
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,380
he only found the Nanyin names

627
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,300
of the four rich merchants.

628
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,700
He couldn't find the third generation of their descendants.

629
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:25,860
I think

630
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,690
it was because Second Sect Leader

631
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,740
alerted the Jinyuan Alliance

632
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,460
when he was looking for these four people

633
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,740
that he was killed.

634
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,540
Why are you looking at me?

635
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,120
I also went undercover and investigated it.

636
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,660
You mean

637
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:50,370
that what Deputy Sect Leader Shan showed you

638
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,930
was one of the four names?

639
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,060
Yes.

640
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,940
After he wrote it down and showed it to me,

641
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,900
I burnt it.

642
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,570
I wanted to help him.

643
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,850
So I wrote it down from memory.

644
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,070
Unfortunately,

645
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,390
I only remember one of them.

646
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,820
Do you still remember

647
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:11,550
Deputy Sect Leader Shan asked you to go to the Yipin Tomb?

648
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,600
How did you know?

649
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:17,030
Because the one buried in the Yipin Tomb

650
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:21,590
was the last princess of Nanyin who was sent here to get married.

651
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,520
There was Bagua Formation outside the Yipin Tomb.

652
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,460
Even though he knew the general location,

653
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,540
Second Sect Leader failed to enter the Yipin Tomb.

654
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,040
Then he died.

655
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:33,650
No wonder.

656
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,130
Fang Xiaobao.

657
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,180
Do you still remember the box

658
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,010
lost in the Yipin Tomb?

659
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,610
Yes.

660
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,740
What's wrong?

661
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,530
Now that I think about it,

662
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,110
that box is the secret treasure

663
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:49,810
which the descendants of Nanyin are trying to find.

664
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:52,380
It can overthrow the martial arts world and the court.

665
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,140
Weeping Guanyin was just the bait

666
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,470
which was used to attract Di Feisheng

667
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,790
to open the Yipin Tomb.

668
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,010
Their ultimate aim

669
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,920
is the secret treasure in the box.

670
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,280
It's been seven days.

671
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,860
You still haven't found the whereabouts of Director?

672
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,330
No.

673
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:10,520
Don't worry.

674
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,690
Director is capable.

675
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:13,480
That bit of Wuxin Huai can't hurt him.

676
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,540
Maybe he is being treated somewhere.

677
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,620
It's not like him.

678
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,330
If he were really fine,

679
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,060
he would definitely come back.

680
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:23,740
Saintess.

681
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,280
Some old followers of Director

682
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,000
gathered in the sanctuary.

683
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,360
They complained

684
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:30,010
about Director's disappearance.

685
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:30,890
It seems

686
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,470
that they're going to accuse you again.

687
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:34,580
Give the order.

688
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,740
Lock all the old followers of Director up.

689
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:38,840
If there are people who disobey,

690
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,830
kill them.

691
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,110
I just don't want to hurt Director.

692
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,750
I won't show mercy

693
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:48,150
to those old men.

694
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,370
Yes.

695
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,320
The next piece of Heavenly Ice...

696
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,280
We can't miss it.

697
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:00,040
Everything I do is for him.

698
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,160
If he wants to be the director of the martial arts world,

699
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,460
I'll help him become the director of the martial arts world.

700
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,480
If he wants to be the number one in the martial arts world,

701
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,560
I'll help him become the number one in the martial arts world.

702
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,890
If he doesn't want them,

703
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,310
I'll become the number one in the world

704
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,310
and make him the husband of the woman who's the number one in the world.

705
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,330
When you get four pieces of Rama Heavenly Ice,

706
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,530
open the Rama Vessel,

707
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,080
and get that thing,

708
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,650
the whole world will be in your hands,

709
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,210
not to mention

710
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,330
Di Feisheng.

711
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:38,950
Sect Leader.

712
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,930
Do you believe what Li Xiangyi said?

713
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,890
He won't come back to the Sigu Sect?

714
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:46,680
He used to live a great life.

715
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,660
He also had a beauty beside him before.

716
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,860
I don't believe he can let go of the past.

717
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,660
Whether he wants it or not,

718
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,460
I can't give him a chance.

719
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,620
Then

720
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,920
what should we do?

721
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,550
Go and spread the news

722
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,040
secretly.

723
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,210
When Li Xiangyi was the sect leader,

724
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:10,610
he offended many people.

725
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,810
After he died,

726
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,920
people in the martial arts world forgot about it.

727
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,050
I should remind them

728
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:18,940
what kind of person Li Xiangyi is.

729
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:23,219
[Jin Banshan]

730
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,190
Nanyin script is hard to read.

731
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,980
Even if you eat the words,

732
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:28,070
you still can't understand them.

733
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,679
Scripts have their origins.

734
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,870
Maybe I'll be enlightened after I copy them a few more times.

735
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:35,460
Forget it.

736
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,980
Since you've cooked, let's eat first.

737
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,460
When did I cook?

738
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,960
Isn't it the smell of food?

739
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:53,980
Mr. Li.

740
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,150
I've also learnt

741
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,300
the dishes you created.

742
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,159
Check if I learnt them correctly.

743
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,139
Why are you here?

744
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,270
I want to learn cooking from Mr. Li.

745
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,260
Is it strange?

746
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,690
It's not strange to learn cooking.

747
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:06,260
It's strange to learn cooking

748
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,190
from Li Lianhua.

749
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,650
The wound on your face almost healed.

750
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,750
That's great.

751
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,900
My sworn brother's Green Jade Beauty Cream

752
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,220
is the best in the world.

753
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,060
I won't

754
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:17,870
have a scar.

755
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:19,810
Mr. Li.

756
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:21,930
You don't admit it,

757
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,910
but you still care about me.

758
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,340
Don't think too much.

759
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,360
If Fox Spirit broke its leg,

760
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:29,910
he would care about it too.

761
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,730
My sworn brother is busy these days.

762
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,660
I'll stay in the Lotus Tower for a few more days

763
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,190
and learn cooking from you.

764
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:39,730
These days,

765
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:40,900
we've been investigating something urgent.

766
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,720
I'm afraid we can't entertain you.

767
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,780
You're investigating Nanyin names.

768
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:47,840
You know it?

769
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,060
He copied the words onto the table for so long.

770
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,120
I happened to read them.

771
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:52,920
I knew it then.

772
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,980
What's the name?

773
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,300
You don't allow me to live here.

774
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,060
But you want me to answer your questions.

775
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,660
It depends on my mood.

776
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,120
I...

777
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:09,730
Who is it?

778
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,220
Don't be afraid, Miss Su.

779
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,350
This is Fei from the Nanhai Sect.

780
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,790
He's not only my servant

781
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:16,740
but also my underling.

782
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,740
He only eats rice.

783
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,310
Why is he wearing a mask?

784
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,580
He has a bad temper.

785
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,510
So he wears a mask to hide his anger.

786
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,060
Miss Su.

787
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,140
How about this?

788
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,230
If you help me read Nanyin script,

789
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,800
you can live in the Lotus Tower

790
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,470
from now on.

791
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:30,690
Really?

792
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:32,420
You can't go back on your word.

793
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,020
I won't.

794
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:37,250
I'm the granddaughter of the All-Knowing.

795
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,680
Because you've been investigating things

796
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,750
about Nanyin,

797
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,360
I learnt a little from my grandfather.

798
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:44,770
Although I learnt it in a short time,

799
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,920
it's not hard for me

800
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,170
to read a name.

801
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,950
What's this person's name?

802
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,850
Jin Banshan.

803
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,340
His surname is Jin?

804
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,260

00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,460
I never knew

807
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,140
there is a garden here.

808
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,200
The Nanyin people worship grass and trees.

809
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,230
This garden should be its ancestral shrine.

810
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:28,230
This is the spirit tablet of Jin Banshan.

811
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,170
This should be Jin Banshan's memorial tablet.

812
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:33,090
He's Jin Mantang's grandfather.

813
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,580
The names inscribed onto the other memorial tablets

814
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,730
should be the names

815
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:38,450
of the Jin family's ancestors.

816
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,290
Whether it's ten years ago or ten years later,

817
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,350
everything is connected with Nanyin.

818
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:44,050
The secret treasure which Blind Liu mentioned

819
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,340
that can destroy the world

820
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,680
should be the reason.

821
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:51,000
Then where should we start the investigation of the secret treasure?

822
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,110
Look over there.

823
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:07,370
This is Suiyan, the fiend of Nanyin.

824
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,230
The one he holds in his left hand should be Wuxin Huai.

825
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,870
Asura Grass is in his right hand.

826
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,310
What is on his head?

827
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,320
Burn your body.

828
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,380
Release your soul.

829
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,700
Offer sacrifices to Suiyan.

830
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,250
Burn the sky with the searing fire.

831
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,780
Burn your soul.

832
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,820
Isn't it the sentence on the ice shard of Jin Mantang?

833
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,280
Burn the sky with the searing fire.

834
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,250
The secret treasure which can destroy the world.

835
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,500
That means

836
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,740
the fire on the head of the fiend

837
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,120
might be the top of Nanyin's Three Magical Techniques,

838
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,460
searing karmic fire.

839
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,980
Searing karmic fire?

840
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,460
That's the king of Gu

841
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,100
and the head of sorcery.

842
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,340
Back then, it was because the ancestors of the Nanyin people

843
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,870
got the searing karmic fire

844
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,810
that they gathered

845
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:50,200
tens of millions of evil soldiers to wipe out the Southwest Seven States

846
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,600
and established Nanyin.

847
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,520
Is it a legend?

848
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,810
That's impossible.

849
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,880
My grandfather

850
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,980
never writes things without evidence down.

851
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,820
Let me think.

852
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:01,130
Searing karmic fire.

853
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,550
My grandfather described it

854
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,650
as not only the sorcery which didn't belong to mortals

855
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,250
but also the root of all evil.

856
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,880
This thing is quite evil.

857
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,500
But in the past hundred years,

858
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,840
no one has mentioned it.

859
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,750
I thought they had already disappeared.

860
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,360
The Nanyin people respect grass and trees.

861
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,980
The searing karmic fire is being held at the top.

862
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:17,820
There's "fire" in its name.

863
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,240
Fire burns grass and trees.

864
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,640
I guess the Nanyin people not only respect it but also fear it.

865
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,120
The vessel with the searing karmic fire in it

866
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,990
should be the Rama Vessel.

867
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,170
Why does the vessel have such a strange name?

868
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:32,320
This should be right.

869
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,710
The Rama Vessel was made in the Blood Realm Tianqiao Palace a few hundred years ago.

870
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,580
It has mechanisms in it, so it is extremely hard to open.

871
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,940
Only by using four pieces of Rama Heavenly Ice as a key

872
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,060
can it be opened.

873
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,330
My aunt said

874
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,080
Jin Mantang's ice shard

875
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:43,410
is a kind of key.

876
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,420
Could the ice shard be the Rama Heavenly Ice?

877
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,060
So the reason why those people

878
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,130
want to collect four pieces of Rama Heavenly Ice

879
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,800
is that they want to open the Rama Vessel.

880
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,460
There were four Nanyin people

881
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,020
who came to Central Plains.

882
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,480
Each of them had one piece.

883
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,590
It seems that if we find the remaining three descendants

884
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:02,290
and the other three ice shards,

885
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,570
we can find the person

886
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,310
who's hidden in the dark.

887
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,300
If the searing karmic fire

888
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,830
is really something scary,

889
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,770
we must inform the Baichuan Court immediately.

890
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:11,250
No.

891
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:11,980
Why?

892
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,530
Think about it.

893
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,940
Yipin Tomb and Yuanbao Villa.

894
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,780
Every time when we sent the messages

895
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,230
to the Baichuan Court before,

896
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:21,710
we would be attacked.

897
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:22,860
You suspect

898
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,300
there's a spy in the Baichuan Court?

899
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:25,860
Yes.

900
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,500
So we have to look for the remaining three people

901
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,740
ourselves.

902
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,110
But there are three people.

903
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,870
We only know one name.

904
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,050
How can we investigate the rest?

905
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,400
Miss Zhiyu.

906
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,980
Does Jin Mantang

907
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:42,220
have any friends who he meets regularly?

908
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,660
Not many.

909
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,300
But he goes out for a few days every fall.

910
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,540
He said he went out for a feast.

911
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,830
Feasts in fall?

912
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,000
Could it be Mountains Red?

913
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,180
"Mountains Red" was written on the invitations.

914
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,440
What is Mountains Red?

915
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,620
Aren't you the granddaughter of the All-Knowing?

916
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,550
You don't even know Mountains Red?

917
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:03,670
No one knows play

918
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,490
better than you.

919
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,750
-Right?
-Of course.

920
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:09,080
Let me teach you something new.

921
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,180
Every year when the color of maple leaves becomes red,

922
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,590
Yu Louchun

923
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,780
invites six strange people to the banquet.

924
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,580
This is called "Mountains Red".

925
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,580
Coincidentally,

926
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,520
Yu Louchun is also fabulously rich.

927
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,300
He doesn't go out of his house

928
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,630
and lives in seclusion.

929
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,750
He's very similar to Jin Mantang.

930
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:26,460
Since we're suspicious of Yu Louchun the most,

931
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,300
why don't we

932
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,450
go and see him?

933
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,480
Yu Louchun is not a person

934
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,180
who you can see when you want to.

935
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:32,940
Although

936
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,820
he holds Mountains Red every year,

937
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:35,660
so far,

938
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,340
no one knows

939
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,840
where he lives.

940
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,140
Only guests who are invited

941
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,290
can see him.

942
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:43,960
I wonder if he needs a doctor.

943
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,850
He didn't say he's sickly.

944
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,500
Let me put it this way.

945
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:48,940
If you want to see him,

946
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:51,220
you must become the most famous strange people

947
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,810
in the martial arts world this year.

948
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,970
If you want to be invited, you have to be strange.

949
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,170
We have to be strange?

950
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,650
Among us,

951
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,980
isn't Fei

952
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,460
the strangest person?

953
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,720
How about we ask him to perform on the street

954
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,980
to attract Yu Louchun?

955
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,070
Don't bother.

956
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:12,550
Just kill them all.

957
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,340
Don't be afraid.

958
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,620
He likes to talk nonsense.

959
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,970
It seems that if we want to see Yu Louchun,

960
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:24,350
I have to take matters into my own hands.

961
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,430
Are you here

962
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:33,520
for the rumors in the martial arts world

963
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,260
which have a negative effect on the Sigu Sect?

964
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:35,820
Yes.

965
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:38,830
I wonder who spread the rumor

966
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,280
that Second Sect Leader Shan died because of Sect Leader Li.

967
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,760
The nonsense

968
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:45,490
is slanderous.

969
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,160
Actually,

970
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,500
I've heard a little about it.

971
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,460
The Baichuan Court sent me here today

972
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,860
to discuss this with you.

973
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,000
What are you going to do?

974
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,390
I've decided

975
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,050
to hold the Sigu Tea Party.

976
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:05,290
The first aim is to invite our friends in the martial arts world

977
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:06,850
and let the former subordinates come back.

978
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,320
The second aim is to quash the rumor

979
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,330
and ask everyone to be united.

980
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:11,720
The Sigu Tea Party is Sect Leader Li's private tea party.

981
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,920
Who are you to hold it?

982
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,630
The word "Sigu" in the "Sigu Tea Party"

983
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,250
refers to the Sigu Sect, not Li Xiangyi.

984
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,270
And now,

985
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:22,970
I'm the sect leader of the Sigu Sect.

986
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,170
Can't you just quash it in person?

987
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,980
Why do you want to invite so many people to talk about it?

988
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,300
Rumors are like water.

989
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,980
It's better to give them rational explanation than stop the spread.

990
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,700
If Sect Leader Li knows his tea party is used to solve the crisis of the Sigu Sect,

991
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,460
he'll be happy.

992
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:49,120
Wanmian.

993
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,030
I wanted to give you a surprise.

994
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:53,540
I didn't expect you to find it in advance.

995
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,830
All the flowers in the garden

996
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:55,830
were chosen by me.

997
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:56,660
Do you like them?

998
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:57,150
Zijin.

999
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:59,490
Did you hear the rumors

1000
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:00,900
about Li Xiangyi?

1001
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:04,730
They're just rumors.

1002
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:05,920
But

1003
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,300
you always

1004
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,500
pay extra attention about things about him.

1005
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,630
I've investigated.

1006
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:13,020
Those rumors were spread on purpose.
