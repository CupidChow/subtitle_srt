[Episode 18]

4
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,259
Yes.

5
00:01:57,729 --> 00:01:58,390
Who are you?

6
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,920
You're such a hindrance.

7
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,400
I'll scratch you more.

8
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,200
Who are you?

9
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,870
Sister Qiao.

10
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,930
When people in the martial arts world talk about beauties,

11
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,250
we're tied.

12
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,910
Tell me.

13
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,570
Between us, who is prettier?

14
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:57,870
But I'm not here to compete with you.

15
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,790
I'm here to tell you

16
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Li Xiangyi

17
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,170
is still alive.

18
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,060
Where is he?

19
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,730
I also want to know where he is.

20
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,430
After going through the pear trees,

21
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,090
you'll see the Heaven Prison.

22
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,700
Miss Pear Tree Formation?

23
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:03,930
I've heard of it before.

24
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,130
What's the solution?

25
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,260
The Miss Pear Tree Formation

26
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,880
was based on the Later Heaven Bagua.

27
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,680
Yin and Yang were reversed here.

28
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,140
The Death Gate is in Qian.

29
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,400
The Life Gate is in Kun.

30
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,070
The Open Gate is in Gen.

31
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,900
Li Xiangyi.

32
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,820
Are you playing tricks on me?

33
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,680
Director Di.

34
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,980
If you hadn't explored the way,

35
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,800
you would have gone through the trees safely.

36
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,250
But that copper coin

37
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,850
made the Life Gate the Death Gate.

38
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,730
Do you think it can trap me?

39
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,280
Of course not.

40
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:29,920
But today,

41
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,360
all sects are here.

42
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,780
You can't make trouble easily.

43
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,120
He's in the direction of the Heaven Prison.

44
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,690
I'm leaving.

45
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,090
Di Feisheng is trapped in the Miss Pear Tree Formation.

46
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,240
The final boss voluntarily gave us a chance

47
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,080
to catch him.

48
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,400
The formation has been destroyed.

49
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,090
Be careful.

50
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,490
You're all old faces.

51
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:35,170
Unfortunately, all of you were defeated by me before.

52
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,790
We haven't seen each other for ten years.

53
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,930
I wonder why

54
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,030
you came here today?

55
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,570
I haven't seen you for ten years.

56
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,430
You're still bad at martial arts.

57
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,760
You have no right to ask me.

58
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,240
I'm not the number one in the martial arts world.

59
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,840
But if you want to disrupt

60
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,600
my wedding,

61
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,030
don't blame me for being rude.

62
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:00,590
Zijin.

63
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,810
Your martial art skills improved a lot.

64
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,580
I heard Weeping Guanyin

65
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,600
greatly helped you to cure your internal injuries.

66
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,130
But it's still hard for you to defeat all of us.

67
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,320
Let's fight him together.

68
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,650
Don't pull any punches.

69
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,720
I'll come again.

70
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:31,880
Bad news!

71
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,550
Bad news!

72
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:33,820
Something happened in the bridal chamber.

73
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,750
Ms. Qiao was poisoned and fainted.

74
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:46,690
Wanmian.

75
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,030
Wanmian.

76
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,230
Her hands are so cold.

77
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,980
[Iced Cicada. Cold Frost. Detoxify the poison. Use Yangzhouman.]

78
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,600
Iced Cicada.

79
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,300
Cold Frost.

80
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,050
Detoxify the poison.

81
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:19,380
Use Yangzhouman.

82
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,480
It's Jiao Liqiao.

83
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,290
She poisoned Sister Qiao.

84
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:30,370
Mr. Guan.

85
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,060
You're good at detoxifying poisons with golden needles.

86
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,270
You can definitely detoxify this poison.

87
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,170
Please save Wanmian.

88
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,840
I just examined Ms. Qiao.

89
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,660
Iced Cicada and Cold Frost

90
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,150
are two types of deadly poisons.

91
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:39,740
When the poison enters the viscera

92
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,660
through the mouth,

93
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,940
it can freeze the viscera in an hour.

94
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,730
There's no way to detoxify the poison.

95
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,340
You can only use the purest internal power of a man

96
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,420
to protect her viscera

97
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,250
and battle with the deadly poison.

98
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,910
After Iced Cicada is removed,

99
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,830
the patient will be safe.

100
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,860
The purest internal power of a man?

101
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,990
If the internal power which is used to resist cold

102
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,210
is strong,

103
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,310
it will hurt the extremely fragile viscera

104
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,970
which was caused by frostbite

105
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,690
and make the patient die soon.

106
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,410
The only purest internal power in this world which can do this

107
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,340
is Yangzhouman.

108
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,000
That's why it writes

109
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,590
that we should use Yangzhouman to detoxify the poison.

110
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,110
Otherwise, six hours later,

111
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,000
the attack of Iced Cicada will be unavoidable.

112
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,270
Ms. Qiao will freeze to death.

113
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,730
Yangzhouman?

114
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,460
That's Li Xiangyi's unique internal power.

115
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,700
If he could really save Wanmian,

116
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,100
I would kneel and beg him.

117
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,160
But Li Xiangyi is already dead.

118
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,960
What does Jiao Liqiao want?

119
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,690
You don't have to use internal power to save her.

120
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,490
May I examine Ms. Qiao?

121
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,970
It's none of your business.

122
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:41,800
Don't touch Wanmian.

123
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,730
Do you have another way to save her?

124
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,980
Actually, I've discussed a method of using poisons to detoxify poisons

125
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,180
with Mr. Guan before.

126
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,900
I only saw Bhante Wuliao, who's from Pudu Temple,

127
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,360
use this method to detoxify poisons before.

128
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,490
Bhante Wuliao

129
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,860
has verified this method before?

130
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,430
Of course the process is not simple.

131
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,430
The poison must be neutralized by another posion.

132
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:13,460
The cold caused by Iced Cicada can be resisted by Arsenic.

133
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,520
Use special medicinal soups to stop the toxicity of Arsenic.

134
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,920
And then use acupuncture

135
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,650
to send it directly into the viscera

136
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,580
and make it work.

137
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:25,650
But

138
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,430
it takes six hours

139
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,160
to take Bhante Wuliao here.

140
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,600
It's too late to invite him.

141
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,580
When Abbot was detoxifying poisons,

142
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,580
I was beside him.

143
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,830
I learnt a little from him.

144
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,410
If you trust me,

145
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,170
could you let me have a try?

146
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,410
Can it really be detoxified?

147
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,460
Do you know the consequences

148
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,060
if you talk through your hat?

149
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45,560
It's a matter of life and death.

150
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,520
I'm serious.

151
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,340
But I need Cold Winter Plum Blossom,

152
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,580
Early Spring Prunus Salicina,

153
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,240
Late Summer Lotus,

154
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,180
and Early Autumn Chrysanthemum, 60 each.

155
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,950
Make Arsenic Medicinal Soup on a big fire

156
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,430
to help me detoxify the poison.

157
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,740
How can we find the things you mentioned

158
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,980
in a short time?

159
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,740
Don't fool us.

160
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,670
They can be collected from the pharmacies,

161
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,250
the fruit shops,

162
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,850
and the tea shops in the town.

163
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:09,980
Let's look for them together.

164
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,440
We can definitely find them.

165
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,450
I trust Mr. Li.

166
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,340
There's no need for you to go.

167
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,000
We can help.

168
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,210
I'll go and look for them.

169
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,170
Cure Ms. Qiao without worries.

170
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,300
Leave the rest to us.

171
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,160
Please prepare three buckets of hot water.

172
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,170
Ms. Qiao will use them when the poison is being detoxified.

173
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:38,690
Yes.

174
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,540
She was here for me.

175
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,880
You were involved in it because of me.

176
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:35,610
Mr. Li.

177
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,930
I've boiled the water.

178
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,140
How is Miss?

179
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,550
Can I open the door?

180
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,590
Mr. Li.

181
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,300
My Lord.

182
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,450
Situations of Mumian Villa have changed.

183
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,810
Xiangyi.

184
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,560
Xiangyi.

185
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,490
For her, you abused your true force

186
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,820
and was seriously injured.

187
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,770
Is it worth

188
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,570
risking your life?

189
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,090
How is she?

190
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,610
How's the situation inside?

191
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,680
Mr. Li keeps the door closed.

192
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,880
He hasn't responded.

193
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,180
Li Lianhua.

194
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,420
We've prepared what you need.

195
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,920
Mr. Guan and the others are making the medicinal soup.

196
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,520
How's the situation inside?

197
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:23,720
Li Lianhua.

198
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,690
What's going on?

199
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:26,710
Tell me.

200
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,070
If you don't want them to know,

201
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,020
I can help you.

202
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,310
What do you want to do?

203
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,120
What are you doing?

204
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:46,960
Don't come.

205
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,180
Di Feisheng, you…

206
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,220
If you want her to live,

207
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,240
come to the gazebo on the back hill after two hours

208
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,040
and bring King Xunming of Yama in exchange for her.

209
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,310
Wanmian.

210
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,180
Are you hurt?

211
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,740
Was it Di Feisheng who hurt you?

212
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,340
I'm fine.

213
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,170
It's just an attack of my illness.

214
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:04,900
Go after him.

215
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,460
Why do you have an attack at this time?

216
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,690
Sit down.

217
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,370
How are you?

218
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,130
Where is your medicine?

219
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,130
It's in the Lotus Tower.

220
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,880
Go and get it for me now.

221
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:20,190
Go.

222
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:22,220
Go.

223
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,420
Okay. Hold on.

224
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,800
I'll be right back.

225
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,670
When you have an attack of Bicha Poison,

226
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,410
it feels as if there are insects eating your bones.

227
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,770
The poison will eventually pierce your internal organs and the marrow of your head.

228
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,300
At first, you'll temporarily become deaf and blind.

229
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,760
Then you'll gradually lose all five senses,

230
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,330
become crazy, and die.

231
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:04,310
My Lord.

232
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,440
The toxins in her body have already been removed.

233
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,940
She's still not awake because her acupuncture point for sleep was hit before.

234
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,000
I didn't expect you

235
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,870
to cover for Li Xiangyi.

236
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,660
Li Xiangyi still owes me a competition.

237
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,580
I can't let him die easily.

238
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,700
Besides, our competition

239
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,870
doesn't need such dirty tricks.

240
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,980
Jiao Liqiao did this behind your back

241
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,670
because she found Li Xiangyi is still alive

242
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,960
and wanted to smoke him out.

243
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,210
Why does Jiao Liqiao

244
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,710
care whether or not Li Xiangyi is dead?

245
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,970
She and I are not on the same side anymore.

246
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,410
Go back and keep an eye on her.

247
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,410
Check how many people in the Jinyuan Alliance

248
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,110
can still be used.

249
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,300
Yes.

250
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,510
Di Feisheng.

251
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,900
I've brought the person you want.

252
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,460
I just want Wanmian to be safe.

253
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,000
The poison has been detoxified.

254
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,890
She's fine now.

255
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:06,820
Wanmian.

256
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:07,790
Wanmian.

257
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:12,990
Wanmian.

258
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,350
Xiangyi.

259
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:17,870
Xiangyi.

260
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:20,030
Come.

261
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,780
This way, please.

262
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,600
He said he has heart disease before.

263
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,140
I didn't expect the disease to be so scary.

264
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,620
He's still unconscious after taking the medicine.

265
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,260
The doctor didn't find anything wrong after examining him,

266
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,650
so he couldn't prescribe medicine.

267
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:30,090
Guan.

268
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,770
Please examine him.

269
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,860
I thought it's because you have grudges against him

270
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,030
that you always target him.

271
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,830
Why are you so worried about him?

272
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,820
I'm just angry with him.

273
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,290
His life matters.

274
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,220
Mr. Guan,

275
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,160
please examine Mr. Li.

276
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,010
Didn't I tell you to rest well?

277
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,640
But I'm worried about Mr. Li.

278
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,370
His pulse is hard to feel.

279
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,880
Why is it so strange?

280
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,690
His pulse is thin and soft.

281
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,900
He's quite weak.

282
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,220
His Qi and blood have dissipated.

283
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,550
They can't be regained.

284
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,580
The pulse

285
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,730
is insufficient.

286
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,960
What do you mean?

287
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,600
Is it serious, Mr. Guan?

288
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,210
His Qi and blood are insufficient.

289
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,050
It's caused by his congenital heart disease.

290
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,750
Although his life is not in danger,

291
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,130
he should stop worrying

292
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,710
and rest well.

293
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,480
Only in this way can he be fine.

294
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,180
It's good to hear he's fine.

295
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,130
I was poisoned with Iced Cicada.

296
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,730
Jiao Liqiao said only Yangzhouman can save me.

297
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,100
Then...

298
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,660
The Jinyuan Alliance was just creating panic

299
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,040
because they wanted to put pressure on us.

300
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,130
Di Feisheng threatened me with your life.

301
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,730
He asked me to let King Xunming of Yama go.

302
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:25,550
King Xunming of Yama

303
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,860
is much less important than you.

304
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,790
I did as he asked.

305
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,140
Di Feisheng detoxified the poison?

306
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:32,410
Of course.

307
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:36,110
Li Lianhua claimed that he could detoxify the poison.

308
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,020
I believed him

309
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,350
and let him mess around.

310
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:41,730
Fortunately,

311
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,850
the Jinyuan Alliance wanted something.

312
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,020
Except Di Feisheng,

313
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,000
no one has this ability.

314
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:56,800
But

315
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,260
today is our wedding day.

316
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,110
I failed to protect you.

317
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,040
I'm fine now.

318
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,210
We expected that the Jinyuan Alliance would come to provoke us.

319
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,220
But

320
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:14,730
they did this

321
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,420
only for King Xunming of Yama?

322
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:22,940
Wanmian.

323
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,720
Just now...

324
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,790
I mean

325
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,440
no matter it's the Jinyuan Alliance or anyone else,

326
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,480
I won't let them have chances

327
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,960
to hurt you again.

328
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,770
I have something to discuss

329
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,370
with Ji Hanfo and the others.

330
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,430
You're still weak.

331
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,700
Get more rest.

332
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,850
I'm here to tell you

333
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,110
Li Xiangyi

334
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,290
is still alive.

335
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,540
Xiangyi.

336
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,650
Yangzhouman.

337
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,720
I have the internal power, Yangzhouman, in my body.

338
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,120
I've seen Xiangyi.

339
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:29,860
It's not a dream.

340
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:32,690
How is that possible?

341
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,580
Your favorite osmanthus cakes.

342
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,190
I queued up for a long time.

343

right?

345
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,690
It's different from the knots tied by others.

346
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:51,890
I can't even untie it.

347

Why are they

348

the same?

349

It's you.

I'm so stupid.

351
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,140
You're alive.

How are you now?

356
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,460
I'm fine.

357
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,830
I just feel a little dizzy.

358
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,270
I feel much better.

359
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,820
Mr. Guan gave you a prescription.

360

Fang Duobing went to get the medicine.

Mr. Guan said

372
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,210
he has a method.

373

He'll cure me.

Don't worry.

375
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,760
By the way, Mr. Li,

376
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,620
I received a letter from my grandfather today.

377
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,690
He wrote that he didn't find the information about the ice and the script.

378
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,280
But the incense you got

379
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,950
is Nanyin Incense for sure.

380
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,480
Is the effect of Nanyin Incense

381
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,620
the same as what Miss Zhiyu said?

382
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,840
This is the second magical technique of Nanyin.

383
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,300
The knockout incense was made by Wuxin Huai.

384
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,060
Burning it

385
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:15,360
can make people fall into a pleasant illusion,

386
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,390
lose the feeling of pain,

387
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:17,520
and be manipulated.

388
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,740
They don't struggle even if they're being peeled.

389
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,460
If a large amount of Nanyin Incense are used

390
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,460
to deal with people who practice martial artists,

391
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,980
they will ruin the martial artist skills

392
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,230
which those people practice.

393
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,760
Who on earth used Wuxin Huai

394
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:28,030
to deal with my senior?

395
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:32,120
If King Xunming of Yama of the Jinyuan Alliance had intended to kill my senior,

396
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,880
he wouldn't have used it.

397
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:37,370
But

398
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,480
Nanyin is no longer in existence.

399
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,340
There is less and less Wuxin Huai.

400
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,600
The incense is quite rare and precious.

401
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,380
Not everyone

402
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,020

403
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,150
Nanyin Incense.

404
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:50,370
By the way, Mr. Li,

405
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,740
speaking of Nanyin,

406
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,460
when I met Jiao Liqiao today,

407
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,590
she was speaking Nanyin dialect.

408
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,690
Although I don't know the meaning,

409
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,510
I'm sure that was Nangyin dialect.

410
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,820
My grandfather learnt it before.

411
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,590
She doesn't know I heard it clearly.

412
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,410
Otherwise, she'll kill me.

also to urge me to go home.

In three days,

423
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,620
your grandfather will know

424
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,870
what happened today.

if you want to recover soon,

00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,080
You're not like

515
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,700
who you used to be anymore.

516
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:52,970
What has happened

517
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:56,310
in the past ten years?

518
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:03,950
When I fell into the sea that year,

519
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,240
I was hung on the ship of Di Feisheng.

520
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,190
I didn't sink to the bottom of the sea.

521
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,390
I went back to the Sigu Sect before.

522
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:16,030
I also saw the letter you wrote to me before.

523
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:17,860
Later,

524
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,670
I just wanted to live a different life.

525
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,139
No.

526
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,570
That's not what I meant.

527
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,139
Is it because you hated me for breaking up with you

528
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:30,600
that you left?

529
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:38,639
That's not true.

530
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,090
Mian.

531
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,420
I suddenly figured it out.

532
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,530
The bossy and arrogant

533
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,870
Li Xiangyi

534
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:51,190
is indeed dead.

535
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:52,980
No.

536
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,500
That's not what I meant

537
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,100
when I wrote you that letter.

538
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,770
He's the light that people pursue.

539
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:07,460
His brilliance will also hurt people's hearts.

540
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,130
He's also the one who I can never catch up with.

541
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:10,830
But how could it be his fault?

542
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,770
Do you know how much I regret it?

543
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,340
During these ten years,

544
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,800
I've been dreaming of you.

545
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,740
I dreamt that the moment you stepped out of the door,

546
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,230
I tried my best to pull you and stop you.

547
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,990
But when I woke up,

548
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:26,270
I realized there's nothing reversible.

549
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:27,850
Since you came back,

550
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,400
why didn't you tell us?

551
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:34,870
It's been so long.

552
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:37,760
I'm tired.

553
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,740
I just want to be free.

554
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,250
Then why did you

555
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,570
appear at my wedding?

556
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,240
I've promised you before

557
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,120
that I would give you the sweetest

558
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,260
wedding candies.

559
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,680
In the past,

560
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,920
I've broken my promise to you many times.

561
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,890
At least

562
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,580
I must keep this promise.

563
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,200
In Pudu Temple,

564
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,210
if you hadn't told me he is dead,

565
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,210
I wouldn't have married Zijin.

566
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:27,320
It's not beaucse you married Zijin that you're sad.

567
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,000
It's because you don't regret marrying Zijin.

568
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:38,830
Xiangyi.

569
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,910
You're still...

570
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,520
You're still the same.

571
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,030
You can kill someone with one sentence.

572
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,340
Mian.

573
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,640
You like Zijin

574
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:57,650
and rely on Zijin.

575
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:58,930
It's not wrong.

576
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,860
You don't love someone anymore.

577
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,770
You don't have to blame yourself for it.

578
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:07,540
Then...

579
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,340
Don't you hate me?

580
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,060
Yes.

581
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:21,710
I hated you before.

582
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:25,050
In the early years, I hated everyone.

583
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,940
Then I figured it out.

584
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:31,330
It was my fault.

585
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,680
I was too conceited.

586
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,700
I acted willfully.

587
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,970
Why should Li Xiangyi be invincible

588
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,240
and do everything successfully?

589
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,500
Mian.

590
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,790
When we met and knew each other,

591
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,930
I was young and ignorant.

592
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,800
I also didn't know

593
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,460
what our relationship was.

594
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,220
What do you mean?

595
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,440
What do you mean?

596
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:10,940
You mean

597
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,400
you never loved me?

598
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:20,340
We were both young at that time.

599
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,290
Don't take what we said seriously.

600
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:24,440
Mian.

601
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:27,630
Time flies.

602
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:30,970
You and I are no longer young.

603
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:32,810
Forget

604
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:36,950
what should be forgotten.

605
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:42,760
I saved you

606
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:45,000
because of our friendship.

607
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,660
Don't get me wrong.

608
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,000
You know me well.

609
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,180
I hate

610
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,960
being involved in many things.

611
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,220
The world is vast.

612
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,830
Living a life of freedom

613
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,660
is what I want.

614
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,590
Please

615
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,550
don't let others know I'm still alive.

616
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,030
I really hope

617
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:16,560
you and Zijin

618
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:19,940
can grow old together

619
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,490
and love each other forever.

620
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:27,210
We haven't seen each other for ten years.

621
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,940
Don't you have anything else to say to me?

622
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:36,790
What else should I say?

623
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,210
Ten years is a very long time.

624
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:40,330
Mian.

625
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:42,030
Today,

626
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:44,900
we should say goodbye.

627
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,370
Live the life you want.

628
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:52,940
Okay.

629
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:58,350
Okay.

630
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:13,000
Let me ask you again.

631
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:17,470
Is Li Xiangyi really not coming back?

632
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,610
No.

633
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,510
You like candies so much.

634
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,890
They're not what masters like.

635
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:48,720
Who says masters can't eat candies?

636
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,530
At our wedding,

637
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,250
I'll let everyone eat this kind of candy.

638
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,510
Is it delicious?

639
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,270
Not bad.

640
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:00,570
Eat one more.

641
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,490
You're busy with those big things every day.

642
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:19,780
You always let me look at your back.

643
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,840
I'm really tired.

644
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,580
Something really happened to the Feiying Gang.

645
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,110
Mian.

646
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,680
I need to go out now.

647
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:35,200
By the way, Mian,

648
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,740
what did you say just now?

649
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:38,420
Forget it.

650
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,190
Let's talk when I'm back.

651
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:45,060
The world is vast.

652
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:47,980
I can't keep you.

653
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,840
I'm tired.

654
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:56,130
I respect you, but I can't accompany you anymore.

655
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,090
I can't love you anymore.

656
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,040
I wrote this letter to say goodbye to you.

657
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,100
I wish you good health

658
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,070
and a happy life.

659
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,350
I hope you can fulfill your dreams.

660
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,540
Mian.

661
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,970
You want to die without letting everyone know.

662
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,970
I don't understand why you're pathetic and stubborn.

663
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,310
You scared me.

664
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,390
Why didn't you walk through

665
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:38,340
the front door?

666
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,990
Since we have chosen our own paths,

667
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:42,890
why should I bother them?

668
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,070
I don't understand.

669
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:45,890
But I respect your persistence.

670
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,220
No need, Director Di.

671
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,290
Just don't make trouble for me.

672
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:15,460
I didn't let Jiao Liqiao poison you.

673
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,190
I know.

674
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:18,810
You

675
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,580
killed a large amount of people.

676
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,510
But you do things

677
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,710
above board.

678
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:26,130
You don't like to argue.

679
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:26,940
I

680
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,880
just wanted to confirm it.

681
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,880
Compared to who you used to be,

682
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,540
you're much more cunning now.

683
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:35,770
You tried to cover for me this time.

684
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,420
I owe you a favor.

685
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:43,390
Why did you bring him here?

686
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,820
Don't you always blame the Jinyuan Alliance

687
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,220
for killing your senior?

688
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,410
My Lord asked me to explain to you.

689
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:51,590
Ten years ago,

690
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,700
I, King Bai of Fire, and Four-faced Qingzun

691
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:55,430
[King Xunming of Yama]

692
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,650
received a challenge letter from Shan Gudao.

693
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:00,120
Of course we didn't think he could defeat us.

694
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,920
But when we arrived at the place,

695
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:04,700
we found that Shan Gudao had already died.

696
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,450
It was my senior who challenged you?
