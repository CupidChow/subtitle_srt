Ten years ago,

00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,530
the fastest sword in the wide world was Li Xiangyi's sword.

6
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:45,979
He defeated the Demon of the Blood Realm at 15

7
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:48,300
and became the best martial artist in the world.

8

He established Sigu Sect at 17.

9

Some take him as the hope of the martial arts world in the Central Plains.

including Di Feisheng, the head of the Jinyuan Alliance of the Cult of Devil.

He even killed Shan Gudao, Li Xiangyi's senior

I took the exam for three years in a row,

If you let my son enter Baichuan Academy,

00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,710
put a coffin at the back

345
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,580
and caught a doctor here.

346
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:44,060
They forced him to save the people in the coffin.

347
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,660
What an interesting doctor.

348
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,100
He said he needed a condition to save people.

349
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,490
He needs to get his dog to pick up the luckiest draw.

350
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,780
He's not an immortal.

351
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,990
How could he save the dead?

352
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,220
You are right.

353
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,220
If people don't have morality,

354
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,280
how are they different from animals?

355
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,220
Who are you?

356
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,700
How dare you meddle with things of the Hall of Wind and Flame?

357
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,620
Who am I?

358
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,740
Baichuan Academy.

359
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,930
A detective from Baichuan Academy.

360
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,540
It's a misunderstanding.

361
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,200
It's all a misunderstanding.

362
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,790
So you're a friend from Baichuan Academy.

363
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,740
I didn't know.

364
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:25,530
I'm sorry.

365
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:27,930
But we didn't do anything wrong.

366
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,460
I don't know why Baichuan Academy

367
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,100
is hard on the Hall of Wind and Flame.

368
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,460
So many of you bullied one of him.

369
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,260
It's not fair.

370
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,770
People who know martial arts bully him who doesn't know martial arts.

371
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:35,500
It's unjust.

372
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,930
For unfair and unjust things,

373
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,130
people of Baichuan Academy

374
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,860
will definitely get involved.

375
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:41,520
Well...

376
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,260
Well said.

377
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,620
Well said.

378
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,080
Young man.

379
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,830
You're a detective, right?

380
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,420
Then you came at the right time.

381
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,880
You came at the right time.

382
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,230
They...

383
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,810
They killed someone.

384
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,830
Killed someone?

385
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,900
Who did they kill?

386
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,220
Arrest them now!

387
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,090
Tell me.

388
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,460
What case?

389
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,890
We killed those who deserve to be killed.

390
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,850
But he shouldn't die at this moment.

391
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:17,250
Right?

392
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,550
That's right.

393
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,350
You'll die anytime I want.

394
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,120
You own the Yama's Palace?

395
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:22,580
You...

396
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,430
What are you doing?

397
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:23,910
Look.

398
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,020
He's staring at me.

399
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,080
All right, stop it.

400
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,860
Where is he?

401
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,420
Show me.

402
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,950
Emptying Hands, the master thief?

403
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,410
That's right.

404
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:40,660
Li.

405
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,750
His mouth and nose are cold.

406
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,620
There's no pulse at all.

407
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,790
He can't die anymore.

408
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,260
As for the cause of death,

409
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,150
it's probably your meteor hammer.

410
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,980
Sir.

411
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:12,980
He stole the treasure of Hall of Wind and Flame.

412
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,720
He is a Shaolin lay disciple.

413
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,180
He practiced Impenetrable Defence.

414
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,710
He shouldn't die like this.

415
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,060
That's right.

416
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,300
In that case,

417
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,020
what does it have to do with this doctor?

418
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,980
Did he kill him?

419
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,020
No.

420
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:28,220
Did he still with Emptying Hands?

421
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,280
No.

422
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,260
In that case,

423
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:32,780
why are you making things difficult for this...

424
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,440
Li Lianhua.

425
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,530
Doctor Li Lianhua?

426
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,380
Well said, young man.

427
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:39,920
This...

428
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,700
Did we just lose our things for nothing?

429
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,360
Didn't you just kill someone?

430
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,520
He took your stuff.

431
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,610
You killed him.

432
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,520
He's at a disadvantage.

433
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,910
You had a chance to find the lost thing.

434
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,360
Unfortunately...

435
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,080
Think about it before you take action next time.

436
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:58,040
Everyone's life is expensive.

437
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,300
You have to pay for killing, right?

438
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,540
As for this dead body,

439
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,220
I'll stay and inform Baichuan Academy.

440
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,620
As for how to deal with it,

441
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,420
it's also up to us.

442
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,100
Doctor Li.

443
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,140
You may leave now.

444
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,540
Thank you.

445
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,820
He can't leave.

446
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:17,750
Brother.

447
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,940
We lost the treasure of our Hall.

448
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,030
He is the only hope we can get it back.

449
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,270
Shi Wenjue of the Iron Armor Sect.

450
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,200
Iron Flute Hero.

451
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,860
It is said that Li Lianhua

452
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:28,140
is a miracle-working doctor who can cure the dead.

453
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,340
They would never lie.

454
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,460
But I only remember

455
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,050
I gave them

456
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,680
some rheumatic plasters.

457
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,260
But this plaster

458
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,420
can't bring people back to life.

459
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,680
I'm not that powerful.

460
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,660
I can't cure the dead.

461
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,900
How could you believe

462
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,430
words to cheat kids?

463
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,460
That's right.

464
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,900
If he can bring people back to life,

465
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,160
I'll take his surname.

466
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,390
This...

467
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:53,980
What?

468
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,720
You're not convinced?

469
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,310
13 years ago,

470
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,760
the court had an agreement with Sigu Sect.

471
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,090
The affairs of the people are under the government's jurisdiction.

472
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:07,540
Baichuan Academy judge the grudges between people who know martial arts.

473
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,260
Are you disregarding the ruling

474
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,460
of Baichuan Academy?

475
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,070
Fine.

476
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,510
For today's matter,

477
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,660
we will not just let it go.

478
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:17,710
Let's go.

479
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,090
Let's go.

480
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,470
Thank you for saving my life.

481
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,930
But

482
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,240
now,

483
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,260
they should...

484
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:35,340
Don't worry.

485
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,040
As long as I'm here,

486
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,830
no one dares to touch you.

487
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,540
Stay with me tonight.

488
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,440
I'll send you out of the city tomorrow morning.

489
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,170
How can I?

490
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,820
But my money...

491
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:54,420
I'll pay for it.

492
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:57,330
How loyal!

493

[Lingshan Sect]

494
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,760
[Lotus Tower]

495
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:14,980
Young Master.

496
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,830
The dessert is not delicate enough.

497
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,160
I'll prepare some more.

498
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,900
Thank you so much, Mr. Fang.

499
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,100
Li, don't mention it.

500
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,440
How do you know my surname?

501
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,880
Daring to recruit the only son of Minister Fang,

502
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:36,240
Fobi Baishi is really bold.

503
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,360
You know my father?

504
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:45,270
Mr. Fang.

505
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,930
If I'm right,

506
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,030
your sward ornament

507
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,740
should be a rare jade, cold smoke.

508
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,390
Last year, only one piece came out.

509
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,130
Fuyu Building charged an extremely high price.

510
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,710
Tianji Manor got it.

511
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,090
Your name is more frightening

512
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,020
than the title of a detective.

513
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,830
I didn't expect that although you don't know martial arts,

514
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,290
you're quite insightful.

515
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,780
I didn't want to be ostentatious

516
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,220
in the wide world.

517
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,530
Mr. Fang,

518
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,500
you must have just entered Baichuan Academy, right?

519
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:19,990
Yes.

520
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,420
Since I was young, I swore

521
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,980
I would join Baichuan Academy when I grow up

522
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,660
and revive the Sigu Sect.

523
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,050
So I don't want anyone to know

524
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,000
I'm the son of Prime Minister Fang.

525
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,660
I just want others to remember me as

526
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:36,790
an ordinary detective of Baichuan Academy.

527
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:41,650
Good ambition.

528
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:45,250
I like passionate young men like you.

529
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,550
It seems that we really get along well.

530
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,350
Here.

531
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,220
To Mr. Fang.

532
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,300
To Baichuan Academy.

533
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:52,630
Here.

534
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:53,850
It's my honor.

535
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,320
Cheers.

536
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:54,920
Cheers.

537
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,620
By the way,

538
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:00,570
Mr. Fang,

539
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,690
what's your plan on

540
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,310
handling the body of Emptying Hands?

541
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,180
I'll send a pigeon to Baichuan Academy

542
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,780
and ask them to bring it back.

543
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,780
By the way, Li.

544
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,060
I'm curious about one thing.

545
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,100
Why is the Hall of Wind and Flame so sure that

546
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,020
you saved two dead people?

547
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,980
I don't believe in resurrection.

548
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,640
In this world,

549
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,350
there are ways to revive the dead.

550
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,580
Because sometimes,

551
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,930
the dead may not really be the dead.

552
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,110
Li,

553
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,360
what do you mean?

554
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,300
This tea...

555
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:58,250
I haven't met a detective for so many years.

556
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,780
I didn't expect that the first detective

557
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,830
to meet is you, a newbie.

558
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,760
Baichuan Academy is getting worse every year.

559
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,650
Who are you?

560
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,020
For the sake of your help,

561
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,920
I'll say something more.

562
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,560
You made the first mistake as a detective

563
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,490
as soon as you got off the mountain.

564
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,430
You trust others too easily.

565
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,610
You deserve a beating.

566
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,520
Secondly,

567
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,460
your autopsy is not done professionally.

568
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,860
That's another beating.

569
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,590
I'm not blaming you.

570
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,460
Being a detective doesn't suit you.

571
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,120
Go home after one or two cases.

572
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:38,750
By the way,

573
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:39,960
also,

574
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:43,090
you even brought maids and servants with you.

575
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:44,750
Can you be more ostentatious?

576
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,690
Just you wait.

577
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,100
Get up.

578
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,250
Li.

579
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,400
Why are you so late?

580
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:20,770
Do you know that the Unbreathing Skill

581
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,260
can only last for three days at most?

582
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,420
Lower your voice.

583
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,970
The Hall of Wind and Flame is so cruel.

584
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,360
They almost killed me.

585
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,400
Cut the crap.

586
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,220
Leave now.

587
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:32,640
Okay.

588
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:33,820
Let's go.

589
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:36,760
Hurry!

590
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:40,160
Hurry!

591
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,350
Where is Li Lianhua?

592
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,270
My people just found out that

593
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,020
he knew Emptying Hands long ago.

594
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,900
He deliberately

595
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,300
lured us here to find him.

596
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,000
Boss.

597
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,160
Bad news!

598
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,100
The man in the coffin is gone.

599
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,140
Go after him!

600
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:07,780
Wait for me!

601
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:09,850
Wait for me!

602
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:14,550
Huahua?

603
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,200
You are well prepared.

604
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,270
Stop! Stop!

605
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,700
Stop! Stop!

606
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,690
-Stop!
-Go!

607
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,000
Kid.

608
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,210
What did you say?

609
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,940
If this brother can really come back to life,

610
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,340
you'll take his surname.

611
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,740
I must seek an explanation from Baichuan Academy for this.

612
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,270
Let's go.

613
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:46,480
Let's go.

614
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:49,970
Li Lianhua.

615
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,010
Did you see Huahua?

616
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:58,610
That detective was so stern.

617
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,890
I owe you nothing now.

618
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:04,290
All clear.

619
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,180
The Hall of Wind and Flame

620
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,440
is really not good.

621
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,659
They started off as bandits.

622
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:11,050
Five years ago, they took the Shi family's secret book

623
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:11,889
as their own.

624
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,730
I had no choice.

625
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,190
I have to find and steal it.

626
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,139
But today,

627
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,020
fortunately, you're here.

628
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,880
-This play...
-Where's my stuff?

629
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,420
Yes.

630
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,190
Here.

631
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,340
You're really weird.

632
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:31,820
If you're stingy,

633
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,090
when I want to give you half of the silver, you didn't want it.

634
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:36,179
You only want the recipe and five taels of silver.

635
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:37,380
If you're not stingy,

636
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,110
when anyone owes you three coins,

637
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,739
you have to get it back no matter where you have to go.

638
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:41,659
My consultation fee

639
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:42,719
is just five taels.

640
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:43,980
No more.

641
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,840
No less.

642
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,760
This is my master's recipe.

643
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:48,679
I wonder

644
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,920
how it ended up in someone else's hands.

645
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,429
I just like eating this.

646
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,290
You are always mysterious.

647
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,480
I can't tell if you know any martial arts.

648
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,940
But you're good at flying.

649
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,260
Who is your master?

650
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,660
Stop studying.

651
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,820
I'm just a lonely ghost.

652
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,320
Li Lianhua.

653
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,880
Are you looking for people of the Jinyuan Alliance?

654
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,410
It's my professional habit.

655
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:17,330
I was just curious.

656
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:17,860
Besides,

657
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,860
even if I search you thoroughly,

658
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,040
I can't find anything important.

659
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:23,990
Goodbye.

660
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,660
Go to Lingshan Taoist Rite

661
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,540
in Jiazhou,

662
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,510
you might find the person you're looking for.

663
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:32,790
Lingshan Sect?

664
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,260
Young Master.

665
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,460
Calm down.

666
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,670
We travel in the wide world,

667
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:43,320
it is normal to get our feet wet occasionally.

668
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,940
It's unexpected that

669
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,620
he looks harmless.

670
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,020
Who knows he's an old fox?

671
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:48,930
Young Master,

672
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,820
let's go back to the manor.

673
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,820
Do you remember that Lady said

674
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,180
if you dare to join Baichuan Academy, she will teach you a lesson.

675
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,910
My mother always threatens me.

676
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,980
When did she really teach me a lesson?

677
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,420
Actually, Young Master,

678
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,060
I just found that

679
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,980
all the money we brought out this time

680
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,110
has become invalid.

681
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:07,260
What?

682
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,850
The manager asked us to move out overnight.

683
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:10,850
But you know

684
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,460
we're used to living in the superior room.

685
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,140
We can't sleep on the streets.

686
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:16,720
No.

687
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,850
Since I've made up your mind,

how can I return so easily?

Excuse me,

698

how do I get to Lingshan Sect in Jiazhou?

699
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,660
You're going to Lingshan Sect?

Are you too old?

701
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,690
There are many people going to Lingshan.

Go ask them.

Do you know?

704
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,330
I heard that the person the Lingshan Sect is looking for

[Notice]

In my opinion,

if they can find this boy,

709
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:19,940

Young master,

I was born on the sixth day of the fourth month of the lunar year.

Does this look like a lotus mole?

Wangfu.

720

How long haven't you washed your feet?

721
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,940
I think you have a mole in your brain.

How can you believe that?

Why are you here?

I've been looking for you.

727

Cousin.

728
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,360
Did you see the notice?

729
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,810
It's clearly you.

730
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:56,920
Let's go.

731
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:57,740
Go to Lingshan Sect with me.

732
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,180
Wait.

733
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,120
What cousin? From Lingshan Sect?

734
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,800
Make it clear before we go.

735
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,190
As soon as Lingshan's notice came out,

736
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:09,880
I thought

737
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,870
isn't this Wangfu?

738
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,760
I went to the manor to find you.

739
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,090
But the people in the manor said

740

you and Eldest Young Master ran out.

741

Luckily I met you here.

That's why it's super rich.

749

Of course.

750
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,770

752

it's one of the richest.

But followers of the Lingshan Sect can't marry.

00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,980
Now the head of Lingshan Sect

859
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:56,910
has been killed.

860
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,780
I can help you solve the case

861
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,320
and help you pass the test of Baichuan Academy

862
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,760
so that your parents have nothing to say.

863
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,960
If I seal these two acupoints,

864
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,980
ordinary people can't unseal them.

865
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:13,630
Don't even think about escaping.

866
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:16,410
As for whether Head Wang was killed,

867
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,990
I'll get into it myself.

868
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,120
I don't need you, a talkative

869
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,140
fake miracle-working doctor, to help me.
