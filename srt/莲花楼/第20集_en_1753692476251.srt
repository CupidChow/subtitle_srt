After four thousand times

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The most reluctant

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Is that moment

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
On the earth

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A thousand miles of madness

A young man is young

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's late

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Fengqing

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Back then, Jiao Liqiao secretly bought the silk gold of the thunder fire

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
All from Wan Shengdao

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Your Lordship is so clever

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
If he knew Jiao Liqiao was behind him

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
He would have made a mistake

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Besides, I followed Jiao Liqiao's information line

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And accidentally found out that Jiao Liqiao

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Has been secretly intercepting Wang Chunhua's clues

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I don't know what this is about

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You keep an eye on Wang Chunhua

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Jiao Liqiao

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'll talk to him in person

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yes

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What do you mean by the secret letter?

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Your Lordship wants me to take over the power of the Golden Agreement Alliance?

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Saintess Jiao, why are you so nervous?

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
My master just wants you to think it over

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Di Feisheng will know what you did sooner or later

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
By then, the Golden Agreement Alliance will be in your hands

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It will be beneficial to both of us

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Say it

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Who is your master?

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Tell him to come out and pick me up

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Your Lordship

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Your Lordship

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
There are people who are twice-intentioned in my manor

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You are the second master

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm sorry

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm sorry

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm sorry

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm sorry

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm sorry

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,460
But there's someone with a secret fundamentally.

62
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,760
My tender Republican influence...

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,320
How could the one who is playing is such a fool...

64
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,000
Wu Xing Huai.

65
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,080
You've installed Wu Xing Huai in his body.

66
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,360
Then we must use Maels.

67
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,840
Otherwise, he will die naturally!

68
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,800
You met the ping-pong 비� JB

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,360
against my desire.

70
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,960
Don't try to be so serious.

71
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,080
I've already put Wu Xinhua in her room.

72
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,800
She has been in the camp for many days.

73
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,960
After a while, she will be in the camp.

74
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,640
What else can she do?

75
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,720
She's so weak today.

76
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,920
How can you guys

77
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,080
even trick her?

78
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,440
If that's the case,

79
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,160
I'll help you in advance.

80
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,360
Don't worry.

81
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,080
I know you want to keep her.

82
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,880
Wu Xinhua can't take her.

83
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,440
At most, she'll only get hurt a little.

84
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,000
As for how you will explain to the Queen of Golden Garden,

85
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,360
you can only do it with your own ability.

86
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,480
Are you forcing me to

87
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,200
turn against you?

88
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,760
It's been ten years.

89
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,440
This game

90
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,640
should be played differently.

91
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,160
Continue.

92
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,200
Master.

93
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,960
Since that's found out that Wu Xinhua is above us,

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,040
we need to keep her.

95
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,840
You have brainQuoemp

96
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,680
for how to manufacturer her additional power.

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,280
A useless person

98
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,760
has nothing to worry about.

99
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:05,280
Only quedar

100
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:14,960
Excepting

101
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,920
Her Majesty

102
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,280
One more!

103
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,720
One more!

104
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,320
Next!

105
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,040
やってみましょう!

106
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,280
Hot steamed buns.

107
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:21,960
Take a look at this.

108
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,120
Come and buy it.

109
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,920
gel

110
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,300
Have a look

111
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,900
Don't you mean, Li Xiangyi some bad words

112
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,860
Just this well

113
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,200
What's up

114
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,540
hum

115
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,720
Hey, you Azlation

116
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,260
You find Aming

117
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,580
Liu audio нею

118
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,020
已經 вы

119
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,320
с

120
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,120
Нет

121
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,800
I'll ask you one more question.

122
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,600
Why is Liu Ruo Jing blind?

123
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,080
Didn't she get blinded by a war in the martial arts world ten years ago?

124
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,520
And the other one is useless these two years.

125
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,120
She's driven out because she's blind.

126
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,680
You guys are being too heartless.

127
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,240
We didn't abandon her.

128
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,520
She didn't want to stay here and eat.

129
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,440
But she's doing more business of being a dead person now.

130
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,280
She's making more money than being a guard.

131
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,600
Oh.

132
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,560
Then what kind of business is she doing?

133
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,360
Our land is not very flat.

134
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,120
There will always be people who seek revenge and fight.

135
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,640
We agreed to live or die.

136
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,120
No one dares to collect the body even if they die.

137
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,200
Only Liu Xiazi

138
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,240
is the one who used to be a fourth-class official.

139
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,360
No one dares to bother her even if she's out to face the world.

140
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,800
If you want to find her,

141
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,040
wait until the moon rises

142
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,560
and go to the outskirts to find a hotel.

143
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,920
If there's a ghost lamp,

144
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,720
it means she's doing business tonight.

145
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,560
She's right there.

146
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,040
Thank you.

147
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,560
Ghost lamp.

148
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,440
It should be here.

149
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,240
Liu Xiazi, you're hurting me.

150
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,680
You're so stupid.

151
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,840
You're selling a dead person.

152
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,160
You still have 100 taels.

153
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,120
Wait for me.

154
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,000
This...

155
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,840
Let me go.

156
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,280
Let's go.

157
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,720
You...

158
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,280
Why are you here?

159
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,000
You know me?

160
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,920
Who are you?

161
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,720
You don't remember us?

162
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,000
You don't know who you are anymore?

163
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,240
Who am I?

164
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,640
I went around the ghost temple.

165
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,520
I forgot who I am.

166
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,320
I was the one who got you out of the river.

167
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,960
I was a redhead for that bitch.

168
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,920
I didn't know you were a ghost.

169
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,840
I was a ghost.

170
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,840
I was a redhead for that bitch.

171
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,840
I was a ghost.

172
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,360
I'm your friend.

173
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,520
A good friend.

174
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,880
Friend?

175
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,560
Impossible.

176
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,040
This...

177
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,320
What's going on?

178
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,640
I didn't even ask you to settle the score.

179
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,440
You want to get Li Lianhuan?

180
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,640
I don't know the exact name yet,

181
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,360
but I need to treat her as soon as possible.

182
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,360
The demon's kindness is really not easy to repay.

183
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,120
You're Liu Rujing?

184
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,600
Tell me.

185
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,000
Who are you here to buy?

186
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
A redhead or a blood sword?

187
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,400
Let's make it clear first.

188
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,000
The knife has been chopped into 18 pieces.

189
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,720
I only cut three pieces.

190
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,320
But I can give you a discount.

191
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,600
We're not here to buy food.

192
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm blind.

193
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,920
I don't care who killed who.

194
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,720
You're here to find people or enemies.

195
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,520
Don't come to my business.

196
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,400
We're not here to find enemies.

197
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,000
We're the form of the White Shrine.

198
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,080
I'm blind.

199
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,400
Mr. Liu,

200
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,800
I know you were the branch master of the Shangu knife.

201
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,480
We're kind of colleagues.

202
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,080
What colleagues?

203
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,200
My colleagues are dead.

204
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,480
When I left the Four-Bones Sect, I said

205
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,880
that the Four-Bones Sect was broken.

206
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,880
I'll just treat them all as dead.

207
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,200
In this life,

208
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,200
whoever dares to mention the Four-Bones Sect in front of me,

209
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,880
don't blame me for being rude.

210
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,280
You...

211
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,560
Mr. Liu,

212
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,960
you can leave,

213
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,760
but this person is still alive.

214
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,560
You can't be a corpse.

215
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,560
You...

216
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,760
That's right.

217
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,960
This person is a criminal on the list of the White Shrine.

218
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,160
I have to take him back.

219
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,760
So what?

220
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,160
This bastard has been here for five days.

221
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,760
I didn't sell any money.

222
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,160
He ruined my business.

223
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,560
Even if I don't treat him as a corpse,

224
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,560
I have to abolish his martial arts

225
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,360
and make him a cattle.

226
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,440
I'm going crazy.

227
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,040
This...

228
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,440
He's badly injured.

229
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,640
If he doesn't get treated,

230
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,240
he might really die.

231
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,760
100 taels.

232
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,240
We'll pay.

233
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,040
If you're not from the White Shrine,

234
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,560
100 taels is fine.

235
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,840
But you're from the White Shrine.

236
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,360
1,000 taels.

237
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,440
1,000 taels?

238
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,240
Why don't you go rob him?

239
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,240
Are you going to give him or not?

240
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,840
No!

241
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,240
Didn't you

242
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,640
bring the money?

243
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,840
I'll pay for it.

244
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,840
You know I...

245
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,720
I owe you a favor.

246
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,320
I'll explain it to you later.

247
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,720
I'll pay for it.

248
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,520
That's all?

249
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,320
Move.

250
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,120
I'm full of bad smell.

251
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,200
You'd better give me a reasonable explanation.

252
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,000
He's hit by a lot of Wu Xing Huai.

253
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,400
So?

254
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,400
Isn't that a big deal?

255
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,920
Wait.

256
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,000
Once Wu Xing Huai gets hit by it,

257
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,800
he can't use his qi to move.

258
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,720
It's a top-notch flash.

259
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,800
Why hasn't his martial arts been used up?

260
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,400
Look.

261
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,560
He pierced through his husband's qi

262
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,120
and forced his qi to go out.

263
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,360
In order to prevent Wu Xing Huai

264
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,120
from entering his Wuzang Six-Poem

265
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,920
and using his internal power to reverse his meridians.

266
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,600
He forced Wu Xing Huai

267
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,000
into his own brain's White Shrine.

268
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,400
This method,

269
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,920
except for the sound of the flute,

270
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,120
I can't imagine anyone else can do it.

271
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,120
So,

272
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,400
he'll be attacked,

273
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,320
but because Wu Xing Huai entered the White Shrine,

274
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,600
he lost his memory.

275
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,320
Even so,

276
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,400
this isn't the reason we should save him.

277
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,800
Has the devil lost his memory?

278
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,800
Can the evil he did

279
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,400
be washed away?

280
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,400
If you ask me,

281
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,680
I'd like to arrest him

282
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,680
and lock him up in the White Shrine

283
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,000
right now.

284
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,280
Actually, I've already found the evidence.

285
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,920
Di Feisheng

286
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,920
didn't hurt Shan Gu Dao.

287
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,640
When Shan Gu Dao died,

288
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,000
there was still half of Wu Xing Huai by his side.

289
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,120
Now, Di Feisheng is also hit by Wu Xing Huai.

290
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,560
It's all

291
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,520
too coincidental.

292
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,120
And Di Feisheng's power is unimaginable.

293
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,720
Who could have done that?

294
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,520
You mean,

295
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,120
the Empress of Golden Moon Alliance?

296
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,400
The person who killed your father

297
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,600
provoked the conflict between

298
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,800
Golden Moon Alliance and the Four Gu Sect.

299
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,320
The Four Gu Sect was defeated.

300
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:51,880
Golden Moon Alliance

301
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,920
didn't do anything good.

302
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,400
In the East China Sea War,

303
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,320
Golden Moon Alliance suffered heavy losses.

304
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,520
Di Feisheng

305
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,600
wouldn't do such a thing

306
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,840
that would harm people.

307
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,240
I guess

308
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,440
there's someone in the Golden Moon Alliance

309
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,640
and others are plotting something.

310
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,040
Wu Xing Huai and Bing Ping can explain that

311
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,440
they haven't stopped for ten years.

312
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,840
Why don't we keep him

313
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,040
and find the breakthrough from him?

314
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,640
But he's lost his memory now.

315
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,640
It seems that

316
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,640
he can't provide us with any clues.

317
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,640
It's just temporary.

318
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,640
With his power,

319
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,440
he will definitely recover slowly.

320
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,240
Di Feisheng is a good knife.

321
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,440
It's a pity to cut him off.

322
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,640
I'm just afraid that he's a snake

323
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,040
or a frozen river.

324
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,840
When he comes back to the Shennan,

325
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,640
I'll bite you.

326
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,840
Think about it.

327
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,240
If he really wants to kill someone,

328
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,840
will he not do it?

329
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,040
Besides,

330
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,840
he wants to settle the old debt of Golden Moon Alliance.

331
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,440
What about now?

332
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,640
How do you plan to use this

333
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,640
to kill him?

334
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,040
Don't worry.

335
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,840
He's the most powerful

336
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,040
help in the world now.

337
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,840
The sun rises tomorrow.

338
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,240
Among you twenty people,

339
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,040
only one of you can walk out of this gate.

340
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,040
Why do you want us to kill him

341
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,040
one by one?

342
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,040
Because that's the only way

343
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,040
to make you

344
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,040
want to live

345
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,040
and become the best killers

346
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,040
in your bones.

347
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,040
Don't listen to him.

348
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,040
It's useless.

349
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,040
I'm not going to kill him.

350
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,040
I'm not going to kill him.

351
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,040
It's useless.

352
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,040
They're in our body.

353
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,040
We'll never be able to

354
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,040
get rid of them.

355
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,040
We can't get rid of them.

356
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,040
This is not good for your master.

357
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,040
Since you're awake,

358
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,040
go and take the medicine.

359
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,040
Who are you?

360
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,040
Look at your palm.

361
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,040
You know your own character, right?

362
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,040
You're looking for Li Dianhua?

363
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,040
I am.

364
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,040
Look at the outside.

365
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,040
You must be wondering

366
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,040
who you are.

367
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,040
You're called Fei.

368
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,040
You're the undercover of Bai Chuan Yue.

369
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,040
Bai Chuan Yue?

370
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,040
Undercover?

371
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,040
Make it clear.

372
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,040
Bai Chuan Yue is a criminal

373
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,040
who's been in the world

374
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,040
for years.

375
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,040
He's been in the world to question

376
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,040
and cut the secret.

377
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,040
Recently,

378
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,040
I've been investigating

379
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,040
an old case ten years ago.

380
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,040
You were also

381
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,040
caught as an undercover.

382
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,040
Who knows

383
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,040
you were also found to be a spy.

384
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,040
It's all my fault.

385
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,040
Then why did you say

386
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,040
you're my master?

387
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,040
Oh.

388
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,900
You were once the

389
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,040
gas thief from Nan'an.

390
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
You were caught

391
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,040
and made the leader of the gang.

392
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,040
I paid you to be my subordinate.

393
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,040
You were grateful

394
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,040
and so I wanted to report you.

395
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,040
But I'm not a person who

396
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,040
takes revenge.

397
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,040
So I gave you a name

398
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,040
and asked you to work in Bai Chuan Yue.

399
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,040
You'll be punished for your crimes

400
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,040
and help me investigate.

401
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,040
Punish for my crimes?

402
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,040
I can only remember

403
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,040
when I kill people.

404
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,040
You said I was a savior.

405
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,040
I won't kill you.

406
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,040
I don't believe you either.

407
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,040
You think I'm a fool.

408
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,040
You're not a fool.

409
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,040
You saved at least one person.

410
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,040
Who?

411
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,040
Me.

412
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,040
Your appearance is very messy.

413
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,040
You're poisoned.

414
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,040
It's still messy.

415
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,040
You have my inner power in your body.

416
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,040
I'm dying.

417
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,040
You tried to save me.

418
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,040
But why do you have my inner power

419
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,040
and still not get better?

420
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,040
Because I've been poisoned by the poison of the world.

421
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,040
I have no choice but to die.

422
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,040
You cried and shouted

423
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,040
to pass that to me.

424
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,040
You risked everything to save me.

425
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,040
Now I'm already dead.

426
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,040
I won't lie to you.

427
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,040
Do you believe me now?

428
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,040
It seems you're really important to me.

429
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,040
Are you really...

430
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,040
Your master.

431
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,040
These two words

432
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,040
seem to come out of my mouth.

433
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,040
It doesn't matter.

434
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,040
It's not important.

435
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,040
What's important is

436
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,040
you want to keep your life

437
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,040
and repay my kindness.

438
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,040
If you go out now,

439
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,040
many people want to kill you.

440
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,040
You don't recognize them,

441
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,040
but they recognize you.

442
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,040
Should I be afraid?

443
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,040
You're not afraid of fighting alone.

444
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,120
But it's hard to avoid a

445
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,040
public gun.

446
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,040
If you die,

447
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,040
who will pay for my money?

448
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,040
Let's do the math.

449
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,040
When I lost you,

450
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,040
I spent a thousand taels of silver

451
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,040
to make you an insider.

452
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,040
But you didn't find anything for me.

453
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,040
Instead,

454
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,040
it was a pain when I was received.

455
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,040
So I spent ten thousand taels of silver

456
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,040
to buy it from the summer house.

457
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,040
If you die,

458
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,040
who will pay for my money?

459
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,040
What do you want?

460
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,040
Keep listening to my investigation.

461
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,040
Even if a case is a thousand taels,

462
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,040
when will you pay me back

463
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,040
and leave?

464
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,040
It's strange.

465
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,040
You're dying.

466
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,040
You should think about

467
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,040
how I can save your life.

468
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,040
There are many things

469
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,040
more important than living.

470
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,040
You said there are many things

471
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,040
that are not clear.

472
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,040
Why are you poisoned?

473
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,040
Why am I being plotted?

474
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,040
What kind of opponent is the Golden Alliance?

475
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,040
Why do you have so many reasons?

476
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,040
No reason.

477
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,040
When you pay me back,

478
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,040
you'll know everything.

479
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,040
Come on.

480
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,040
I'm going to kill you.

481
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,040
Come on.

482
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,040
Chen Jiang.

483
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,040
You're awake.

484
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,040
Can you eat now?

485
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,040
Even the fox is hungry.

486
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,040
Who is this person?

487
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,040
Your colleague.

488
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,040
Colleague?

489
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,040
Is the martial arts of the Baichuan Courtyard

490
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,040
so bad?

491
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,040
What did you say?

492
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,040
If it weren't for me,

493
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,040
you would have been with

494
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,040
Yu Sun Hong of the Zhangle District

495
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,040
and you would have been with me in the same coffin.

496
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,040
Yes.

497
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,040
I did give you a wrong hand before.

498
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,040
But today,

499
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,040
I'm very lonely.

500
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,040
Let's have a competition.

501
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,040
Okay.

502
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,040
I made a new dish today.

503
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,040
I'll take you to try it.

504
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,040
Who is going to cook it?

505
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,040
I'm not unfamiliar with this place.

506
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,040
The person named Li Lian Hua

507
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,040
is not a enemy.

508
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,040
But he's half-blind.

509
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,040
I'll get all the truth from him sooner or later.

510
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,040
It's not good.

511
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,040
It's not good.

512
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,040
It's not good.

513
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,040
Look at you.

514
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,040
I've developed two dishes.

515
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,040
Try it.

516
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,040
It's so rich.

517
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,040
There are four dishes today.

518
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,040
Did you make all of them?

519
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,040
No.

520
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,040
Except this one,

521
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,040
I bought it in time.

522
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,040
In that case,

523
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,040
you're the guest.

524
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,040
You eat first.

525
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,040
Okay.

526
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,040
How is it?

527
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,040
Come on.

528
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,040
Try it.

529
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,040
Try it.

530
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,040
It's so bad.

531
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,040
I'm not talking about you.

532
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,040
Even people who can't taste it

533
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,040
think your cooking is bad.

534
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,040
Wait.

535
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,040
Do you have a taste?

536
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,040
You two don't have a taste?

537
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,040
Which one is bought in time?

538
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,040
It tastes good.

539
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,040
You...

540
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,040
Good for you.

541
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,040
You didn't help me.

542
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,040
I'm not hungry.

543
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,040
Eat more.

544
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,040
You're still not that old.

545
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,040
I'm telling you.

546
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,040
He can't beat you now.

547
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,040
He might not be able to

548
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,040
make it in time.

549
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,040
You're quite concerned.

550
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,040
I'm not.

551
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,040
I'm not.

552
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,040
I'm not.

553
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,040
I'm not.

554
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,040
You're quite concerned about him.

555
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,040
Does he know that you're poisoned?

556
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,040
Only you know about this.

557
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,040
I hope you can

558
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,040
keep this secret for me.

559
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,040
I have a feeling

560
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,040
that no matter how many times

561
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,040
you said it in the room,

562
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,040
it's true.

563
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,040
I believe one thing is true.

564
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,040
You said you hope

565
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,040
you're alive.

566
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,040
You said you only remember

567
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,040
how to kill people.

568
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,040
Then,

569
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,040
do you remember anything from the past?

570
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,040
I can remember where I was when I was young.

571
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,040
Where did you come from?

572
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,040
From the blood of the mountains and the sea.

573
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
Don't say that.

574
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,040
Take it.

575
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,040
Now,

576
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,040
you have too many enemies.

577
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,040
It's safer to wear this mask.

578
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,040
The End

579
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,040
I don't do business during the day.

580
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,040
Get out of here.

581
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,040
Mr. Liu,

582
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,040
it's not good to

583
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,040
make people get out of here.

584
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,040
What are you doing here?

585
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,040
Didn't they give you the medicine?

586
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,040
Mr. Liu,

587
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,040
we're here

588
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,040
to ask about

589
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,040
the Fourth Ancient Gate.

590
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,040
You're talking about the Fourth Ancient Gate again.

591
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,040
The Fourth Ancient Gate has been destroyed.

592
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,040
Although you said so,

593
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,040
your medicine

594
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,040
is still

595
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,040
on the fourth ancient gate.

596
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,040
Mr. Liu,

597
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,040
since you care so much about the Fourth Ancient Gate,

598
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,040
why are you

599
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,040
so hostile to us?

600
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,040
Ten years ago,

601
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,040
when the Fourth Ancient Gate was divided,

602
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,040
I thought there was no Fourth Ancient Gate in the world.

603
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,040
When the master was in trouble,

604
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,040
everyone was

605
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,040
playing their own tricks.

606
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,040
No one

607
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,040
was protecting the master.

608
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,600
The world is full of

609
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
evil.

610
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
In my eyes,

611
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,040
it's nothing.

612
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,040
The world is full of

613
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,040
evil.

614
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,040
You can't separate the good and the bad.

615
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,040
Look,

616
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,040
the Fourth Ancient Gate has been rebuilt.

617
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,040
Your old friends are all here.

618
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,040
If you want to,

619
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,040
you can go back.

620
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,040
What do you know?

621
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,040
There's only one Fourth Ancient Gate.

622
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,040
That's the Fourth Ancient Gate of Li Xiangyi.

623
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,040
When the master is gone,

624
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,040
everyone

625
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,040
will blame the master for it.

626
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,040
Xiao Zijin is one of them.

627
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,040
Now I have to accept him as the master

628
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,040
unless I die.

629
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,040
They say

630
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,040
Li Xiangyi was

631
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,040
killed by the Golden Fist Alliance

632
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,040
because he was revengeful for the old knife.

633
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,040
It's not that simple.

634
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,040
Why do I tell you this?

635
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,040
Go, go.

636
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,040
Mr. Liu,

637
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,040
we're here for this.

638
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,040
In fact, this young man

639
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,040
is the disciple of the master,

640
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,040
the Golden Fist Alliance.

641
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,040
The Golden Fist Alliance is his father.

642
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,040
Really?

643
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,040
Mr. Liu,

644
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,040
here.

645
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,040
Touch it.

646
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,040
This is my father's token.

647
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,040
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

648
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,040
You didn't give me a chance to tell you.

649
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,040
Mr. Liu,

650
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,040
you said my father died of an abnormality.

651
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,040
Before he died,

652
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,040
did you find anything strange

653
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,040
or

654
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,040
did he offend anyone?

655
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,040
Follow me.

656
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,040
What is this?

657
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,040
Before the second master

658
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,040
died,

659
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,040
I found

660
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,040
the four tigers, the Silver Fist and the Sky Tiger

661
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,040
were collecting information.

662
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,040
But at that time,

663
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,040
I was responsible for

664
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,040
the gathering of information

665
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,040
and collecting information.

666
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,040
I found that he jumped over my situation

667
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,040
and was afraid that he was suspicious of the four tigers.

668
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,040
So I followed him secretly several times.

669
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,040
But in the end,

670
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,040
I found that

671
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,040
the second master was lucky

672
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,040
and the other three tigers

673
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,040
did the same thing.

674
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,040
To be honest,

675
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,040
I was a little unhappy

676
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,040
because I thought that

677
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,040
the second master

678
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,040
didn't take me as his own person.

679
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,040
At that time,

680
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,040
he called me over

681
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,040
and told me a secret.

682
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,040
What?

683
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,040
He said that he was worried

684
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,040
that the Golden Fist Alliance

685
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,040
secretly supported the re-establishment of Nanyin

686
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,040
and harmed the Central Plains.

687
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,040
Didn't Nanyin

688
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,040
die a hundred years ago?

689
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,040
I was also in this reaction at that time.

690
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,040
But the second master told me that

691
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,040
Nanyin had never died

692
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,040
before the re-establishment.

693
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,040
In the past hundred years,

694
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,040
they sent many people

695
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,040
to the Central Plains one after another.

696
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,040
The most important

697
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,040
is these four people.

698
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,040
These four Nanyin merchants

699
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,040
brought countless wealth

700
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,040
and four treasures

701
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,040
from Nanyin.

702
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,040
It is said that one of them

703
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,040
has the ability to destroy the world.

704
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,040
But later,

705
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,040
I don't know what happened.

706
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,040
These four people

707
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,040
never took action,

708
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,040
but stayed in the Central Plains.

709
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,040
Now,

710
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,040
they are the descendants

711
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,040
of the third generation.

712
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,040
Liu Rujing,

713
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,040
I want to stop them.

714
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,040
The second master didn't know why,

715
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,040
and found that

716
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,040
they were colluding with the Golden Thread Embroidery.

717
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,040
They were just moving.

718
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,040
So he wanted to find out

719
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,040
the descendants of these four people.

720
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,040
It's a pity

721
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,040
that he only found these four merchants.

722
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,040
Nanyin's name

723
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,040
couldn't find

724
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,040
the family history of the third generation.

725
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,040
I think

726
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,040
the second master was also

727
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,040
worried about the Golden Thread Embroidery

728
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,040
when he was looking for these four people.

729
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,040
That's why he was in such a hurry.

730
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,040
Why are you looking at me?

731
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,040
I'm going to do the undercover investigation.

732
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,040
That means

733
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,040
the master of Shanfu

734
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,040
showed you

735
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,040
the names of these four people.

736
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,040
Exactly.

737
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,040
After he wrote it down and showed it to me,

738
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,040
I took it back.

739
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,040
I wanted to help him,

740
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,040
so I put it down.

741
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,040
It's a pity

742
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,040
that I only remembered one of them.

743
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,040
Do you still remember

744
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,040
the master of Shanfu

745
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,040
asked you to go to the first-class tomb?

746
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,040
How did you know?

747
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,040
Because in the first-class tomb,

748
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,040
the princess was buried

749
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,040
by Nanyin Mo, who came to Heqing.

750
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,040
There is a Ba Gua Formation outside the first-class tomb.

751
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,040
Even if it's confirmed,

752
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,040
the second master

753
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,040
never entered the first-class tomb.

754
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,040
Then something happened.

755
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,040
No wonder.

756
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,040
Fang Xiubang,

757
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,040
do you still remember

758
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,040
the lost box

759
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,040
in the first-class tomb?

760
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,040
Yes.

761
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,040
What's wrong?

762
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,040
Now I think about it.

763
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,040
That box

764
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,040
is the secret treasure

765
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,040
that Nanyin Mo and the others

766
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,040
have been looking for

767
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,040
and can subvert the martial arts and the court.

768
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,040
And this Guan Yin Hammer

769
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,040
is just a bait

770
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,040
to lure Di Feisheng to open the first-class tomb.

771
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,040
And their ultimate goal

772
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,040
is the secret treasure in the box.

773
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,040
It's been seven days.

774
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,040
Is there still no sign of the chief?

775
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,040
No.

776
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,040
Don't worry.

777
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,040
With the chief's ability,

778
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,040
that little Wu Xinhua

779
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,040
can't hurt him at all.

780
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,040
Maybe he's healing in a place.

781
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,040
It's not like him.

782
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,040
If he's really okay,

783
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,040
he'll definitely come back.

784
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,040
Saintess,

785
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,040
some of the old cloths of the Lord

786
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,040
were rejected at the altar.

787
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,040
They called the Lord

788
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,040
and didn't know where he was.

789
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,040
It seems that this hat

790
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,040
is pointing to you again.

791
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,040
It's like you.

792
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,040
Pass my order.

793
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,040
Lock up all the old cloths of the Lord.

794
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,040
Those who don't accept it,

795
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,040
will be killed.

796
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,040
I just don't want to hurt you.

797
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,040
Killing these old guys,

798
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,040
I won't be soft-hearted.

799
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,040
Yes.

800
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,040
What about the next Tian Bing?

801
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,040
Of course I can't let him go.

802
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,040
I've been asking for it all my life

803
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,040
for him.

804
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,040
He wants to be the chief of the martial arts.

805
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,040
I help him become the chief of the martial arts.

806
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,040
If he wants to be the best in the martial arts,

807
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,040
I'll help him become the best in the martial arts.

808
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,040
If he doesn't want it,

809
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,040
then I'll be the best in the world.

810
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,040
Let him become the best

811
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,040
man in the world.

812
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,040
When you get the four Luomuo Tian Bing

813
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,040
and open the Luomuo Cauldron,

814
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,040
and get something like that,

815
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,040
the world is in your hands.

816
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,040
He's just a student.

817
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,040
How can he escape your hands?

818
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,040
Sect Leader,

819
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,040
you believe Li Xiangyi's words?

820
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,040
He won't come back to the Four Gu Sect?

821
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,040
The past is limitless.

822
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,040
Everyone is worried.

823
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,040
I don't believe he can let it go.

824
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,040
No matter what he thinks,

825
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,040
I can't give him this chance.

826
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,040
Then what should we do?

827
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,040
Go and spread these news

828
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,040
secretly.

829
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,040
When Li Xiangyi was in position,

830
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,040
he offended a lot of people.

831
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,040
Since he died,

832
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,040
the people in the martial arts world

833
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,040
have forgotten these things.

834
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,040
I'll remind them

835
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,040
what kind of person Li Xiangyi is.

836
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,040
The golden color of the South Yin Wen

837
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,040
even if you eat it,

838
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,040
you won't understand it.

839
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,040
There's a source of the word.

840
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,040
I'm not sure.

841
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,040
Maybe if you aim a few more times,

842
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,040
you'll be able to see it.

843
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,040
Forget it.

844
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,040
Since you've cooked the food,

845
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,040
let's eat first.

846
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,040
When did I cook?

847
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,040
Isn't this like a meal?

848
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,040
Brother Di,

849
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,040
I've learned the dishes

850
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,040
you invented before.

851
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,040
See?

852
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,040
Why are you here?

853
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,040
I wanted to learn cooking from Brother Li.

854
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,040
Is it strange?

855
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,040
It's not strange to learn cooking.

856
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,040
It's strange to learn cooking from Li Lianhua.

857
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,040
Miss Su's face

858
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,040
is almost healed.

859
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,040
That's great.

860
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,040
My brother's green jade skin cream

861
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,040
is the best in the world.

862
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,040
It's a scar.

863
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,040
Of course it can't be kept.

864
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,040
Brother Li,

865
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,040
you don't admit it.

866
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,040
You really care about me.

867
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,040
You miss the girl's family.

868
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,040
Don't think too much.

869
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,040
The fox at the door broke her leg.

870
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,040
Shouldn't you ask?

871
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,040
Anyway, my brother is busy recently.

872
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,040
I'll learn cooking from you

873
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,040
when I live in Lianhua Hotel.

874
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,040
We have an urgent tea session recently.

875
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,040
I'm afraid I can't entertain you.

876
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,040
Isn't it just tea with a name?

877
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,040
You know?

878
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,040
He spent so long on the table.

879
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,040
I just happened to recognize him.

880
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,040
I knew it.

881
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,040
What's the name?

882
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,040
What's the name?

883
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,040
You don't let me live here.

884
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,040
You're in a hurry to find me.

885
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,040
It depends on whether I'm happy or not.

886
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,040
Who is it?

887
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,040
Miss Su, don't be afraid.

888
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,040
This is Fei from South China Sea.

889
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,040
He's my ordinary.

890
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,040
He's also my younger brother.

891
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,040
He only eats rice.

892
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,040
Why are you wearing a mask?

893
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,040
He has a bad temper.

894
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,040
So wearing a mask is really a bad temper.

895
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,040
Miss Su,

896
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,040
how about this?

897
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,040
Tell me that

898
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,040
you're going to live in Lianhua Hotel

899
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,040
with Nan Yiwen.

900
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,040
Really?

901
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,040
Don't regret it.

902
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,040
I won't.

903
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,040
I'm a granddaughter of a million people.

904
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,040
Since Brother Li has been

905
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,040
investigating Nan Yiwen,

906
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,040
I've learned from my grandfather.

907
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,040
Although I'm a Buddhist,

908
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,040
it's not difficult to recognize a name.

909
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,040
What's his name?

910
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,040
Jin Banshan.

911
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,040
Jin Banshan?

912
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,040
His surname is Jin.

913
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,040
Yuanbao Villa.

914
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,040
This is the first time I know

915
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,040
that there's a garden here.

916
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,040
It's a crime to worship grass and wood.

917
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,040
This garden

918
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,040
should be his ancestral hall.

919
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,040
The god of the Golden Palace and Ban Mountain

920
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,040
is the one who is suspicious.

921
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,040
This should be the rank of Jin Banshan.

922
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,040
He's the grandfather of Jingwen Hall.

923
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,040
Nan Yiwen in the other ranks

924
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,040
should be the ancestor of the Jin family

925
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,040
who came to the Central Plains.

926
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,040
Ten years ago and ten years later,

927
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,040
everything is related to Nan Yiwen.

928
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,040
Liu Xiazi mentioned

929
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,040
the Nan Yin Secret Treasure

930
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,040
that ruins the world.

931
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,040
This should be the reason.

932
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,040
Then how can we find out the secret treasure?

933
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,040
You and Nan Yiwen.

934
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:22,340
This is the Nan Yin Demon God's

935
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,040
Night Fire Fountain.

936
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,040
The soul of the Ruan Ru.

937
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,040
Isn't this the one on the ice sheet of Jin Ban Hall?

938
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,040
Night Fire Fountain.

939
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,040
The secret treasure that ruins the world.

940
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,040
It means that

941
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,040
the fire on the head of the Demon God

942
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,040
is perhaps the hand of the three secrets of Nan Yin.

943
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,040
Night Fire Hall.

944
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,040
Night Fire Hall.

945
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,040
That's the hand of the Demon King.

946
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,040
The ancestor of Nan Yin

947
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,040
got the Night Fire Hall

948
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,040
because of it.

949
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,040
So they gathered thousands of evil soldiers

950
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,040
to destroy the West Nan Qi Gang

951
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,040
and founded Nan Yin.

952
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,040
It's just a myth.

953
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,040
How is that possible?

954
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,040
My grandfather's handwriting

955
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,040
never remembered anything about Meilan Oil.

956
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,040
Let me think about it.

957
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,040
Night Fire Hall.

958
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,040
The symbol my grandfather gave him at that time

959
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,040
was the magic of the human world

960
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,040
and the source of all evil.

961
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,040
This thing is very evil.

962
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,040
But no one has mentioned it

963
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,040
for almost a hundred years.

964
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,040
I thought it had disappeared.

965
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,040
Nan Yin has the highest level of

966
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,040
the Night Fire Hall of the grass and wood.

967
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,040
There are many people who know about it.

968
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,040
The music

969
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,040
is very unique.

970
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,040
The top of the Night Fire Hall

971
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,040
should be the Demon King's top.

972
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,040
Why is there such a strange name

973
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,040
for a top?

974
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,040
I don't think it's wrong.

975
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,040
A hundred years ago,

976
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,040
the Demon King was made by Xuanyu Tianqiao.

977
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,040
It's a very difficult mechanism to open.

978
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,040
It needs to be opened

979
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,040
with four Demon God's lives.

980
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,040
My aunt once said

981
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,040
the ice in the Golden Pond

982
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,040
is a key.

983
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,040
Could it be that the ice

984
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,040
is the Demon King's ice?

985
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,040
So those people

986
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,040
want to gather four Demon God's soldiers

987
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,040
to open the top of the Demon God's top?

988
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,040
The man from the Central Plains

989
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,040
just died.

990
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,040
It happens that one man has a soul.

991
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,040
It seems that if we find the three men

992
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,040
from the rest of the South,

993
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,040
and the three ice pieces,

994
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,040
then we can find

995
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,040
who the real person behind the scenes is.

996
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,040
Then the Night Fire Hall

997
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,040
is such a scary thing.

998
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,040
We have to inform the board of directors immediately.

999
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,040
No.

1000
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,040
Why?

1001
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,040
Think about it.

1002
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,040
Before we spread the news

1003
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,040
to the first-class grave

1004
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,040
in the Central Plains,

1005
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,040
there would always be

1006
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:48,360
a

1007
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,360
few friends.

1008
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,360
But he would go out

1009
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,360
for a few days every autumn.

1010
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,360
He said he was going to eat.

1011
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,360
Eat in autumn?

1012
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,360
Could it be Man Shan Hong?

1013
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,360
What is written in the invitation

1014
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,360
is Man Shan Hong.

1015
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,360
What is Man Shan Hong?

1016
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,360
Aren't you the granddaughter of Wan Ren Ce?

1017
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,360
You don't even know Man Shan Hong?

1018
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,360
Who can be compared to

1019
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,360
the eldest young master of the Fang family

1020
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,360
when it comes to eating and playing?

1021
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,360
Right?

1022
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,360
Of course.

1023
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,360
Let me show you

1024
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,360
a little bit.

1025
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,360
When the autumn moon is like fire every year,

1026
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,360
the Yugu Xiu Ke Yulou Spring

1027
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,360
will invite six people

1028
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,360
to attend the banquet.

1029
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,360
This is called Man Shan Hong.

1030
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,360
Coincidentally,

1031
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,360
the Yulou Spring

1032
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,360
is also a middle-aged house

1033
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,360
with a rich family.

1034
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,360
It's very similar

1035
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,360
to the Golden Pagoda.

1036
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,360
Since the suspicion of this Yulou Spring is the biggest,

1037
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,360
why don't we go and see it?

1038
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,360
This Yulou Spring

1039
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,360
is not something you can see.

1040
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,360
Although

1041
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,360
it is said that it is held every year

1042
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,360
in Man Shan Hong,

1043
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,360
until now,

1044
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,360
no one knows

1045
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,360
where his residence is.

1046
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,360
Only the guests invited

1047
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,360
can see him.

1048
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,360
I wonder

1049
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,360
if he is a doctor or not.

1050
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,360
He didn't say that he was sick.

1051
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,360
In this way,

1052
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,360
if you want to see him,

1053
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,360
you must become the most famous

1054
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,360
chess player in this world.

1055
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,360
If you want to be invited, you have to play chess.

1056
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,360
Houchi.

1057
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,360
Among us,

1058
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,360
the strangest

1059
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,360
is Fei.

1060
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,360
Or else,

1061
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,360
let him go to the street to sell clothes

1062
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,360
to attract this Yulou Spring.

1063
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,360
No need to bother.

1064
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,360
Just kill them all.

1065
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,360
Don't be afraid.

1066
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,360
He is

1067
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,360
just a talkative person.

1068
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,360
It seems that if you want to see this Yulou Spring,

1069
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,360
you have to go out in person.

1070
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,360
You came here

1071
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,360
because of the sudden

1072
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,360
rumors of the Buli Si Gu Sect in the martial arts world?

1073
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,360
Exactly.

1074
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,360
I came here

1075
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,360
to see the Yulou Spring.

1076
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,360
I heard the rumors.

1077
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,360
Exactly.

1078
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,360
I don't know who is spreading the rumors.

1079
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,360
Sect Leader Shan'er

1080
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,360
was forced to die by Sect Leader Li.

1081
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,360
These ridiculous words

1082
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,360
are all slanderous.

1083
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,360
Actually,

1084
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,360
I also heard about it.

1085
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:57,360
Bai Chuan School sent me to discuss this with you today.

1086
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,360
Sect Leader Xiao, what are you going to do?

1087
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,360
I decided

1088
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,360
to repeat the four martial arts tea meetings in the past.

1089
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,360
First, I came to invite friends in the martial arts world

1090
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,360
to return to the old school.

1091
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,360
Second, I came to clarify the rumors.

1092
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,360
I have the whole intention.

1093
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,360
The four martial arts tea meetings

1094
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,360
are the private tea meetings of Sect Leader Li.

1095
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,360
How can you do that?

1096
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,360
The four martial arts tea meetings

1097
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,360
in the four martial arts tea meetings

1098
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,360
refer to the four sects

1099
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,360
and not Prime Minister Li.

1100
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,360
Now,

1101
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,360
I am the sect leader of the four sects.

1102
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,360
Can't you just clarify this in person?

1103
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,360
Why do you need to involve a bunch of people to discuss this?

1104
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,360
Rumors are like water.

1105
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,360
It's better to read than to read.

1106
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,360
Using his tea meeting

1107
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,360
to solve the crisis of the four sects,

1108
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,360
if Sect Leader Li knows, he will be happy.

1109
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,360
Wan Mian,

1110
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,360
I wanted to give you a surprise.

1111
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,360
I didn't expect him to bump into you.

1112
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,360
I chose all the flowers in the garden for you.

1113
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,360
Do you like them?

1114
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,360
Zi Jin,

1115
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,360
have you heard about the rumors about Prime Minister Li?

1116
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,360
It's just some rumors.

1117
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,360
But,

1118
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,360
I am always very nervous about his matter.

1119
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,360
I checked it.

1120
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,360
Those rumors were deliberately spread.

1121
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,360
I don't know what to do.

1122
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,360
I don't know what to do.

1123
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,360
I don't know what to do.

1124
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,360
I don't know what to do.

1125
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,360
I don't know what to do.

1126
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,360
I don't know what to do.

1127
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,360
I don't know what to do.

1128
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,360
I don't know what to do.

1129
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,360
I don't know what to do.

1130
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,360
