4
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:45,660
Let's go.

5
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,950
What's on your mind?

6
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,350
Since no one went out all night,

7
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,300
the murderer and the body

8
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,900
might not have left.

9
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,470
Li.

10
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:25,820
Li.

11
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,780
Why is there such a big red candle here?

12
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,960
These are all instructed by the Second Sect Master.

13
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,570
She likes luxurious things.

14
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,370
She likes lively moods.

15
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,740
She also wanted the bridal chamber to be lit up

16
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,700
by candlelight for three days and three nights.

17
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,100
So she specially ordered these big red candles.

18
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,440
There are some more in the cabinet.

19
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,440
Here, have a look.

20
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,030
It's all gone.

21
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,760
They're all burned up.

22
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,030
It's only been one night since the wedding.

23
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,430
How did they burn so fast?

24
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,360
Look at this.

25
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,120
There's something inside.

26
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,360
What are these?

27
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,980
These are fragments of the red jade bed.

28
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:14,940
A few years ago,

29
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,810
my mother got some fine raw red jade.

30
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,030
She made our beds with them.

31
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,700
It's warm in the winter and cool in the summer. It's very useful.

32
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,980
Red jade bed?

33
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,079
This is not red jade.

34
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,380
It's wax.

35
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,900
The red candles in the cabinet disappeared.

36
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,650
The red candles on the candlestick are of varying lengths.

37
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,440
Looks like someone broke the bed

38
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,870
and melted the red candles in the room

39
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,829
to cover it up.

40
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,880
Looks like

41
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,079
the broken red jade fragments

42
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,900
were probably scattered

43
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,720
in every corner of the room.

44
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,220
If I'm not mistaken,

45
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:02,720
the body

46
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,290
is under the red jade bed.

47
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,050
Why is it a female body?

48
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,430
Judging from her hairstyle,

49
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,430
she should be a maid of the Tianji Mountain Manor.

50
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,390
This seems to be Er Yue.

51
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,649
Er Yue?

52
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,829
Why don't I know her?

53
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,780
She only came recently.

54
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,550
Young Master, you haven't been home.

55
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,390
It's natural that you don't know her.

56
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,720
She only came recently?

57
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,120
On her back.

58
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,220
There's a strangling mark on her neck.

59
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,750
Her neck bone is broken too.

60
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,030
It's a fatal injury.

61
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,310
Such a thin strangling mark.

62
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,180
That means the murder tool

63
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,150
must be tough and fatal.

64
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,330
But there is no such thing

65
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,350
in this room or the entire manor.

66
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,220
This is the murder weapon.

67
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,730
Looks like this woman came prepared.

68
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,000
The murderer

69
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,790
killed her with her own item.

70
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,780
I'm afraid she wanted to kill someone,

71
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,310
but she was killed instead.

72
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,100
But originally,

73
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,020
only the Second Sect Master and Wei Qingchou were here.

74
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,150
Unless, last night,

75
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,140
someone escaped your sight and barged in.

76
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,180
Otherwise, the other possibility is that

77
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,520
the groom is not dead.

78
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,200
He plotted all this.

79
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,950
He deliberately embroidered the same pattern

80
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,210
on the murderer's back

81
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,909
and pretended to be dead.

82
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,100
Then, he ran away.

83
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,140
That's right.

84
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,260
Look.

85
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,460
There's a wine stain here.

86
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,720
Why is there a wine stain here?

87
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,510
Did someone spill it here on purpose?

88
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,230
That means

89
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,080
Wei Qingchou knew something was wrong with the wine.

90
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,830
But he never pointed it out.

91
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,830
It's likely that the wine

92
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,420
was poisoned by Er Yue herself.

93
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,710
She sneaked into the bridal chamber with her

94
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,640
hidden weapon and intended to kill Wei Qingchou.

95
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,530
But unexpectedly,

96
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,700
she was killed by Wei Qingchou instead.

97
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,210
But I kept guard outside the entire time.

98
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,820
How did Er Yue get in?

99
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,430
If I'm not mistaken,

100
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,680
the wedding night is full of rites.

101
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,460
So a lot of people were moving in and out.

102
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,700
Maybe this Er Yue

103
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,400
came in to decorate the room and never left.

104
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,460
Er Yue hid in the room,

105
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,110
drugged the wine,

106
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,420
and waited for the chance to attack Wei Qingchou.

107
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,180
But when Wei Qingchou returned to the room,

108
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,280
he noticed something wrong

109
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,690
and decided to play along.

110
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,580
He pretended to be drunk, went to bed,

111
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,780
and waited for the chance to kill Er Yue.

112
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,240
I was thinking about this.

113
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,700
If someone had knocked into the dressing table during the fight,

114
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,460
shouldn't the dressing table and mirror rack

115
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,060
both topple with the mirror?

116
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,250
Why did the first two remain untouched

117
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,040
while the mirror alone fell down?

118
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,400
You mean

119
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,160
Wei Qingchou used this mirror

120
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,500
to kill Er Yue?

121
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,550
After Wei Qingchou took Miss He to bed,

122
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,880
he pretended to use the mirror to tidy up his appearance.

123
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,270
Er Yue thought Wei Qingchou

124
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,980
was already drugged by the wine,

125
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,440
so she prepared to strike.

126
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,040
But Wei Qingchou had long noticed

127
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,780
Er Yue's every move.

128
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,770
So this mirror

129
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,410
is evidence of Wei Qingchou killing Er Yue.

130
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,430
But...

131
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,290
But what?

132
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,350
The mark on the neck

133
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,280
is very clear.

134
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,460
It's obviously a fatal move.

135
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,150
It proves that the murderer

136
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,770
is not bad at martial arts.

137
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,580
Zhan.

138
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,380
Are you sure Wei Qingchou is bad at martial arts?

139
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,539
I once tested his skills.

140
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,460
His moves were clumsy

141
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,390
and cowardly.

142
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,380
His inner power was weak too.

143
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,440
He admitted defeat

144
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,770
within two to three moves.

145
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,970
That's strange then.

146
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,370
Who is Wei Qingchou?

147
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,060
Why did Er Yue want to kill him?

148
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:54,600
Also,

149
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:55,820
how did he

150
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,480
avoid Zhan's surveillance and escape the room?

151
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,420
Er Yue's headpiece

152
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,270
seems to be different from yours.

153
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,540
I think I've seen the shape carved

154
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,720
on the silver plate of the headpiece before.

155
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:22,950
This pattern

156
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,090
is the same as the pattern on Xing Ziru's jade pendant.

157
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,010
Is she Xing Ziru's spy?

158
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,330
Did they use this pattern to identify each other?

159
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:30,830
Oh no.

160
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,710
Er Yue was also here for the Rama Heavenly Ice.

161
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,340
Let's go check on Xing Ziru.

162
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,210
Let's go.

163
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,980
Young Master.

164
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,180
Xing Ziru is missing.

165
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,120
What happened?

166
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,220
Didn't I ask you to keep an eye on him?

167
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,320
It's our fault.

168
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,530
We had someone keeping an eye on Xing Ziru at first.

169
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,530
But the incident in the bridal chamber

170
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,460
attracted many people in the manor.

171
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,170
Xing Ziru took the chance to sneak into the crowd

172
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,030
and disappeared.

173
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,710
What about the Rama Heavenly Ice?

174
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,170
Guardian Zhan is guarding the secret warehouse.

175
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:00,890
It is safe.

176
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,100
But not long before Xing Ziru went missing,

177
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,460
he did wander outside the secret storehouse for a while.

178
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,720
He disappeared later.

179
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,420
The entrance to the villa is still sealed.

180
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,960
He can't escape from the villa.

181
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,690
Take some men to search around.

182
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:12,610
Yes.

183
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:13,460
Let's go.

184
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,350
Since Er Yue

185
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,420
was the link between Wei Qingchou

186
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,820
and Xing Ziru,

187
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,510
let's see if she left anything behind.

188
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,260
This was Er Yue's bed.

189
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,970
[Book of 300 Poems]

190
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,690
Book of 300 Poems?

191
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,220
Oh, right.

192
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,580
Er Yue often

193
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,910
sat alone in the corner reading this book.

194
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,750
She had the mood to read when she was here to kill someone.

195
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,390
That's similar to Xing Ziru's and his mood for chess.

196
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:23,720
Take a look.

197
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,150
Which poem is this?

198
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,520
Are you kidding me?

199
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,220
This is not the Book of 300 Poems.

200
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,570
[Carefree and Innocent Pastime Collection]

201
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,520
Carefree and Innocent Pastime Collection.

202
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,150
Look.

203
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,390
Xing Ziru

204
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,410
set up the chess pieces according to this book.

205
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,030
Er Yue also had a copy of this book.

206
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,100
This can't be a coincidence, can it?

207
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,560
The picture of the Four Immortals of Chengdu.

208
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,520
I knew it.

209
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,470
What do you mean?

210
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,340
Look.

211
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,890
The text on the right page

212
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,330
of every chess array in this book

213
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,260
has exactly 19 rows and 19 columns.

214
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:19,090
It's exactly the same as the number of lines on the chessboard.

215
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,090
You mean,

216
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,980
the position of each word

217
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,510
corresponds to an intersection on the board?

218
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,130
If I'm not mistaken,

219
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,790
every piece in the chess array

220
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,520
represents a corresponding character.

221
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,980
The picture of the Four Immortals of Chengdu

222
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,780
that Xing Ziru displayed

223
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,110
has two more chess pieces than usual.

224
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,590
The same goes for the other three arrays.

225
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:45,060
Pretty much every array has two to three extra pieces.

226
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,160
The corresponding words of these extra pieces

227
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,480
will form the message Xing Ziru wanted to send out.

228
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,460
Xing Ziru's Shangqing array

229
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,320
has an extra white piece

230
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,600
in the third column of the seventh row.

231
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,820
The word in the third column of the seventh row

232
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,480
is "Bride".

233
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,670
There's also an extra black piece.

234
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,550
This one corresponds to "Groom".

235
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,100
Bridegroom.

236

[Bridegroom. Rama Heavenly Ice. Another in the secret warehouse. Change of plan.]

237

Bridegroom.

238
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:23,990
Rama Heavenly Ice.

239
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,850
Another in the secret warehouse.

240
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,780
Change of plan.

241
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,420
"Another in the secret warehouse" should refer to

242
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,200
the Rama Heavenly Ice displayed by my mother.

243
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,600
As for the Bridegroom...

244
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,120
Is the missing Rama Heavenly Ice

245
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,040
in Wei Qingchou's possession?

246
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,240
Xing Ziru is missing.

247
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,290
Could it be that he knows where Wei Qingchou is?

248
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,050
Maybe.

249
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,250
When he heard that something had happened in the Manor,

250
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,580
he probably knew

251
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,940
that Er Yue had an accident.

252
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,330
If we can find out

253
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,660
how Wei Qingchou left the bridal chamber,

254
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,630
we can follow the clues to find his whereabouts.

255
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,190
Li, the group of you

256
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,040
had been on standby outside.

257
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,020
Then who found out about the incident today?

258
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,300
We came in together.

259
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,220
According to the rules, this morning,

260
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,980
the eight of us bridesmaids were supposed to

261
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,580
bring the basin in for the couple to groom themselves.

262
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,640
But after knocking at the door,

263
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,370
no one answered for a long time.

264
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,420
We were afraid of a delay,

265
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,530
so we decided to enter the room ourselves.

266
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,370
Then, we saw the mess on the floor

267
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,970
and a bloody bed.

268
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,220
And then?

269
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,700
I was scared at the beginning.

270
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,250
I saw everyone run out,

271
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,610
so I followed them.

272
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,460
Me too.

273
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,460
Me too.

274
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,060
Who ran out first?

275
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,180
Who called for help?

276
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:56,950
It wasn't me.

277
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,340
It wasn't me.

278
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:58,980
Not me either.

279
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,060
I was so scared,

280
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,220
I could only focus on running.

281
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,150
I didn't have time to call for help.

282
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,640
I think you were in front of me.

283
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,640
You shouted, didn't you?

284
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,480
I didn't.

285
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,180
Neither did I.

286
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,110
This is strange.

287
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,470
None of us ran out first?

288
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,100
None of us yelled for help either.

289
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,410
But I definitely heard it.

290
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:13,890
Indeed.

291
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,940
I heard it too.

292
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,360
A woman called for help.

293
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,810
That's why I rushed here.

294
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,920
Since none of you ran out first,

295
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,060
and none of you yelled for help,

296
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,220
that means

297
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,190
a ninth person called for help.

298
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:27,700
A ninth person?

299
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,980
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

300
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,320
There's no ninth person here.

301
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,070
You mean Wei Qingchou

302
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,420
disguised himself as a maid,

303
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,350
mixed into the group, and escaped?

304
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,030
Exactly.

305
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,180
Since Er Yue can make use of the crowd

306
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:41,880
to sneak in,

307
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,620
why can't Wei Qingchou

308
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,730
use the same method to sneak out?

309
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,930
This explains why

310
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,460
Er Yue's outer clothing is missing.

311
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,870
If we were talking about a woman,

312
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,220
that's completely possible.

313
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,620
But Wei Qingchou is a man.

314
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,640
No matter how good his disguise was,

315
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,000
he couldn't possibly have changed his voice.

316
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,430
Maybe the groom

317
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,800
is a woman.

318
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,600
Li Lianhua.

319
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,340
Can you stop fooling around?

320
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,620
Fang Xiaobao, did you forget?

321
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,620
You couldn't recognize Su Xiaoyong

322
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,300
when she disguised herself as a man.

323
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:14,720
I...

324
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,820
I wasn't looking clearly back then.

325
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:19,510
Besides,

326
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,390
there are so many people here.

327
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,180
Can't any of us tell the difference between a man and a woman?

328
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,980
Besides, my aunt and Wei Qingchou

329
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,290
spent so much time together.

330
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,980
How could she not have noticed?

331
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,460
I just figured it out.

332
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:30,860
Brother Zhan,

333
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,060
you said Wei Qingchou's martial arts skills

334
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,990
were clumsy and cowardly.

335
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,460
Did you notice that

336
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,180
he was constantly shielding his Shenque acupoint

337
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,910
and didn't dare to fight freely

338
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,750
during the spar?

339
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,100
How did you know?

340
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,460
That's it.

341
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,160
Have you heard of

342
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,880
a unique martial arts skill

343
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,600
called the Dragon Phoenix Shift?

344
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,940
The Dragon Phoenix Shift?

345
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,690
Rumour has it that

346
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:01,910
this magical skill can temporarily change one's gender.

347
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,560
In actual fact, it can only change

348
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,140
one's appearance and voice.

349
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,610
Still, it's hard for ordinary people to tell the difference.

350
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,380
But it's a hard skill to master.

351
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,780
That's why few people in the martial world know it.

352
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,510
I know someone who does.

353
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:18,849
Liangyi Fairy.

354
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,410
Liangyi Fairy was the wife of Four-faced Qingzun,

355
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,240
one of the three masters of the Jinyuan Alliance.

356
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,839
I heard she had completely mastered the Dragon Phoenix Shift.

357
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:33,040
Four-faced Qingzun?

358
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,630
Didn't we find out in the Girls' Mansion that

359
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,890
Four-faced Qingzun was

360
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,560
one of the four descendants of Nanyin?

361
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,360
That's right.

362
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,550
Maybe

363
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,500
this is the real reason why Liangyi Fairy

364
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,570
also wanted the Rama Heavenly Ice.

365
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,270
Sect Master.

366
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,230
I've got the kitchen ledger for you.

367
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:51,890
Thank you.

368
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,590
Since Wei Qingchou came,

369
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,690
eels have been included

370
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,220
on the daily menu.

371
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,020
The chef said Wei Qingchou told him himself.

372
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,420
He said he was weak and

373
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,640
needed to replenish blood every day.

374
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,190
It's not for replenishing his blood.

375
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,120
But he did need it

376
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,730
to maintain the Dragon Phoenix Shift.

377
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,130
What does it have to do with that?

378
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,380
All eels

379
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,050
are born female.

380
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,540
After laying eggs,

381
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,220
they turn male instead.

382
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,780
So eating the eels

383
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,870
can maintain the stability of the Dragon Phoenix Shift.

384
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,200
Is the Shenque acupoint

385
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,600
the weakness for dispelling this skill?

386
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:44,630
Yes.

387
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,120
So, Wei Qingchou...

388
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:47,850
No.

389
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,450
I should call her Liangyi Fairy.

390
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,430
When you fought her,

391
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,570
her moves were clumsy and cowardly.

392
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,190
But when she killed Er Yue,

393
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,360
she didn't have to hide her gender.

394
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,620
So she killed her with one move.

395
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,460
According to your analysis,

396
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,450
after killing Er Yue,

397
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,600
Liangyi Fairy turned back to her female self.

398
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,690
[Liangyi Fairy]

399
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,300
Madam?

400
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:41,550
Master?

401
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:54,680
Blood!

402
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,580
Help!

403
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,360
Somebody!

404
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,320
There's blood!

405
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,460
Liangyi Fairy realized that they knew

406
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,740
the Rama Heavenly Ice was in her hand.

407
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,400
So she pretended to be killed,

408
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,290
cut off the skin on Er Yue's back,

409
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,480
embroidered the same tattoo she had on it,

410
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,880
and finally hid the body.

411
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,060
This way, she made her secret escape.

412
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:11,660
So,

413
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,720
Wei Qingchou was really Liangyi Fairy in disguise?

414
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:15,980
That's how

415
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,660
he managed to escape

416
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,260
under Guardian Zhan's nose.

417
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,380
My poor silly sister.

418
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,030
Currently, the Rama Heavenly Ice

419
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,890
must still be with Liangyi Fairy.

420
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:29,190
The Dragon Phoenix Shift consumes a lot of inner power.

421
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,590
Liangyi Fairy must be extremely weak right now.

422
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,290
So we must

423
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,870
find her before Xing Ziru does.

424
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,340
Exhausted, you say?

425
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,120
Mother,

426
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,890
do you remember the ice fire hot spring in the back mountain?

427
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:43,210
Did Liangyi Fairy visit that place

428
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,650
during the time she was here?

429
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:45,290
Yes.

430
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,120
Why didn't I think of that?

431
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,460
The hot spring balances Yin and Yang perfectly.

432
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,980
It must be a good place to help people restore their power.

433
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,160
With your aunt's personality,

434
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,270
she must have taken Wei Qingchou there

435
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,210
when she saw that

436
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,700
he was heavily injured.

437
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,610
I believe the Liangyi Fairy

438
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,220
is there right now.

439
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,030
This Liangyi Fairy.

440
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,160
How dare she lie to me!

441
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,620
Just wait till I catch her.

442
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,140
It’s really her.

443
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,220
Give me the Rama Heavenly Ice

444
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,530
and I'll spare your life.

445
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:26,330
Dream on!

446
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,310
How dare you

447
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,660
make a scene in Tianji Hall's territory?

448
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,260
Xiaofeng!

449
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,380
I'll deal with you later.

450
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,310
Second Sect Master.

451
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,420
Do you still intend

452
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,450
to protect this husband of yours?

453
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:48,890
So what if I do?

454
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,400
We had a wedding together.

455
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,870
Her matters are my matters.

456
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:52,840
And I'm the only one

457
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,170
who can decide her fate.

458
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,260
That'll depend on your ability.

459
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:06,030
Be careful!

460
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,310
I was drugged.

461
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,280
I haven't fully recovered.

462
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,060
If you dare,

463
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,260
we'll fight again

464
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,820
when I fully regain my martial arts skills.

465
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:28,640
Good.

466
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,330
You can leave with me.

467
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,140
Once we leave this place,

468
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:36,010
I'll have plenty of time to wait for your recovery.

469
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:43,950
Yunfei!

470
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:58,050
Aunt!

471
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,350
Are you okay?

472
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,310
Are you okay?

473
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,280
I'm fine.

474
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,120
How dare you ask?

475
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,860
Why didn't you come to save me?

476
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,220
If it weren't for Yunfei,

477
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,060
I would have been

478
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,220
abducted by Xing Ziru

479
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,420
to be his trophy wife.

480
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,250
Thank goodness Zhan is here then.

481
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,120
Let's meet up with Li Lianhua.

482
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:21,560
[Tianji Mountain Manor]

483
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:26,640
[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

484
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,590
Li Lianhua.

485
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,130
How is she?

486
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,610
Her true force is exhausted.

487
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:43,300
I'm afraid

488
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,790
there's nothing we can do.

489
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,200
It doesn't matter.

490
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,380
I've done

491
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,360
what I was requested to do.

492
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,580
Is this matter you speak of,

493
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,320
related to the Rama Heavenly Ice?

494
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,990
So the Rama Heavenly Ice

495
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,500
is really with you.

496
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,340
Master He.

497
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,280
Master He.

498
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:19,420
Mr. Pi helped us a lot.

499
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,220
Before he died,

500
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,600
he told me to give you

501
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,060
the Rama Heavenly Ice.

502
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,120
Before he died?

503
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,300
So Senior Pi...

504
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,540
After he left Tianji Hall,

505
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,430
he was ambushed

506
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,380
and lost function in both legs.

507
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,310
He was saved by Fo, Bi, Bai, and Shi of Baichuan Court.

508
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,890
So he decided

509
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,620
to help Baichuan Court

510
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,860
guard the 188th prison,

511
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,020
the Dragon King's Coffin.

512
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,500
Since then, he never entered the martial world again.

513
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,450
No wonder

514
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,630
he disappeared for the past years.

515
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,660
My husband and I

516
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,260
were trapped in the Dragon King's Coffin for years.

517
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:05,590
He was injured when he was still alive,

518
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,640
and Mr. Pi helped him several times.

519
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,590
I don't know how

520
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:14,890
the Jinyuan Alliance found the location of the Dragon King's Coffin.

521
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,150
They came to attack us.

522
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,860
In order to protect the Dragon King's Coffin,

523
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:22,730
Mr. Pi

524
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:26,830
died in battle.

525
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,670
Jiao Liqiao ventured into the 188 prisons several times

526
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:42,030
to find the Four-faced Qingzun

527
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,180
and take away his Rama Heavenly Ice.

528
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,050
That's right.

529
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,860
Unfortunately, 10 years ago,

530
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:53,220
my husband noticed that Jiao Liqiao

531
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,060
secretly coveted the Rama Heavenly Ice.

532
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,460
He had also started to distrust the Jinyuan Alliance.

533
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,570
So before he died,

534
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:05,670
he gave the Rama Heavenly Ice to Mr. Pi.

535
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,940
When the Dragon King's Coffin was broken into,

536
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,260
Mr. Pi knew this item was dangerous,

537
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,500
but he couldn't destroy it.

538
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:17,790
So he asked me to take Rama Heavenly Ice

539
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,290
to Tianji Mountain Manor

540
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,590
and pass it to Master He.

541
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,350
In that case,

542
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,720
why did you lie to me?

543
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,650
Xiaofeng.

544
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,840
I didn't mean to lie to you.

545
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,260
Unfortunately,

546
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:43,200
after I got out of the 188th prison,

547
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,160
I've been hunted by Jiao Liqiao's henchmen.

548
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,880
In order to conceal myself,

549
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,110
I had to turn myself into a man

550
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,420
using the Dragon Phoenix Shift.

551
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:53,860
But

552
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,920
I was badly injured.

553
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:57,420
So, I fainted

554
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,290
on the roadside that day.

555
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,550
Then,

556
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:04,990
I saved you and brought you back to Tianji Mountain Manor.

557
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,380
But Master He was not home.

558
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,340
Mr. Pi asked me to

559
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,910
hand it to you personally.

560
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,980
I dared not give it to anyone else.

561
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,150
Meanwhile,

562
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:20,990
Xiaofeng proposed to marry me.

563
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,380
I thought,

564
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,430
Master He would surely return

565
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,030
for Xiaofeng's marriage.

566
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,200
So

567
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,370
I agreed.

568
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,790
Xiaofeng.

569
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:36,580
I'm sorry.

570
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,130
I used you.

571
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,500
So,

572
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,330
you were the one who mixed the

573
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,560
Rama Heavenly Ice among the wedding gifts?

574
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,490
I didn't want to expose my identity

575
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,750
and be noticed by Jiao Liqiao's people,

576
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,250
which would certainly result in trouble.

577
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,180
That's why I came up with this plan.

578
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,430
I planned to leave

579
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,540
the day before the wedding,

580
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:03,020
just after Master He had received the Rama Heavenly Ice.

581
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,060
Unexpectedly,

582
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,780
I saw someone

583
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:10,320
using a flying skill from the Jinyuan Alliance.

584
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,550
At that time, I knew that

585
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,460
Jiao Liqiao's people may not have recognized me,

586
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,190
but they'd followed me to Tianji Mountain Manor.

587
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,860
As expected, I saw

588
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,220
a man in black looking for something from room to room.

589
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,460
I thought a spy must have mixed into the manor

590
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,560
and compromised its safety.

591
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,220
So I had to take the Rama Heavenly Ice away first.

592
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,880
When you entered the bridal chamber last night,

593
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,520
you noticed someone had already sneaked in

594
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,550
and tampered with your wine.

595
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,180
You found that someone was stalking you.

596
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:50,800
So,

597
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,380
you killed the assassin.

598
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,020
That's right.

599
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,780
But Er Yue

600
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,330
was not the man in black I saw that day.

601
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,620
The enemy was in hiding,

602
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,000
while I was in the open.

603
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,260
I wanted to

604
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,730
resolve the crisis here.

605
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,530
So I played along.

606
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,870
It was an urgent matter.

607
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,590
I didn't have time to explain to everyone.

608
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,580
So I hid the body

609
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,680
to complete my plan.

610
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,620
What a fool.

611
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:25,980
What made you think

612
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,650
you can complete all the plans

613
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,790
and get out of here unharmed?

614
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:33,160
Since I planned to use myself as bait,

615
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,040
I'd never thought of leaving unscathed.

616
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:39,210
You don't have the Rama Heavenly Ice.

617
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:42,470
It was hidden somewhere else.

618
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,260
It's in Xiaofeng's sachet.

619
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,180
I've done

620
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,630
what Mr. Pi asked.

621
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,180
What about the skin with the tattoo?

622
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:04,950
Do you

623
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,680
have something to tell us?

624
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,940
The pattern on the skin

625
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:14,230
was embroidered on my back by my husband.

626
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,860
It recorded

627
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,780
the way to exterminate the Karmic Bug.

628
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:20,640
Unfortunately,

629
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,570
I don't know what it means.

630
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,630
I knew

631
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,400
my days were numbered.

632
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,660
So I embroidered the pattern

633
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,390
on Er Yue's back

634
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,840
and kept it in the room.

635
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,440
Remember.

636
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,490
The remains are buried in bliss.

637
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:51,220
Ascend towards Yujing.

638
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,370
Xiaofeng.

639
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,430
I hope

640
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,340
you won't blame me.

641
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,060
I, Liangyi,

642
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,900
did not let my savior down.

643
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,140
I did not

644
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,250
let my husband down either.

645
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:31,620
I...

646
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,510
Have no regrets.

647
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,100
No regrets...

648
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,610
She was a person of chivalry and loyalty.

649
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,020
Oh no.

650
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,380
An enemy is attacking.

651
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,580
We'll go check it out.

652
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:10,120
Do you think the likes of you can stop me?

653
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,590
After so many years,

654
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,440
the Tianji Mountain Manor is still so overconfident.

655
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:19,430
Who is speaking with such arrogance?

656
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,050
Shan Gudao.

657
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,000
It's you.

658
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,680
Master He.

659
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,200
Long time no see.

660
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,260
Who wants to see you?

661
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,380
The earlier you die, the better.

662
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,580
If it weren't for you,

663
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,780
my sister wouldn't have lost her life.

664
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,450
I can't die.

665
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,900
If I die,

666
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,510
how can I repay you

667
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,580
for raising my son?

668
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:47,210
Enough.

669
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,020
What do you want

670
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,140
today?

671
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,320
What?

672
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,360
After so many years,

673
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,050
is this how you were taught

674
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:57,060
to talk to your father?

675
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,980
Last time, you pretended to be righteous and convinced me to go with you.

676
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,640
Today, you came here with an army.

677
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,500
Since you are so stubborn,

678
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,240
I don't have to spare any consideration

679
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:10,210
for you anymore.

680
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:13,660
You don't have to get involved in the adults' matter.

681
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,370
Go in first.

682
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:20,880
No need.

683
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,490
I should face my own matters

684
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,940
myself.

685
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,110
Regardless of whom,

686
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,400
if he dares to harm the world and the martial world,

687
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,020
I will fight him

688
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:33,730
to the end.

689
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,550
My son

690
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,630
has spent too much time with you.

691
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,460
He's starting to sound like you back in the day.

692
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,640
Don't you think so,

693
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:44,880
Xiangyi?

694
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,910
Xiangyi?

695
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:55,680
It's him?

696
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,170
This...

697
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,310
Really?

698
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,700
Are you really Li Xiangyi?

699
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:01,340
I knew it.

700
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,160
Li Xiangyi wouldn't have died so easily.

701
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:03,960
This is great.

702
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:32,920
Senior.

703
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,679
Long time no see.

704
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,960
You're still so weak.

705
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,050
I guess

706
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:47,550
you're here for the Rama Heavenly Ice, right?

707
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,250
Junior.

708
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:51,120
I see you still like playing these cheap tricks.

709
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,650
Looks like you haven't improved much either.

710
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,770
But you are still my junior.

711
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:57,330
You know exactly

712
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,270
what I want.

713
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,340
Don't worry.

714
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,430
I won't give you the Rama Heavenly Ice.

715
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,190
That's not up to you.

716
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,070
Look at these Xianri Sedans

717
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,580
and the martial arts masters around me.

718
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:14,150
They're itching for a good fight.

719
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:21,170
Demon Monk!

720
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,350
[Demon Monk]

721
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:34,700
The Demon Monk,

722
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,960
the third-strongest martial artist on the ranking list.

723
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:41,780
Give me the Rama Heavenly Ice,

724
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,940
and I will spare your lives.

725
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,330
Senior,

726
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,350
did you forget about me?

727
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,910
Do you think you are still the same Li Xiangyi?

728
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,950
Your remaining strength is so meager,

729
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:56,220
it's not worth mentioning.

730
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:56,860
Really?

731
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,760
Then why do you need so many helpers?

732
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:03,660
You need their help to get the Rama Heavenly Ice today.

733
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,290
Oh, Shan Gudao.

734
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,110
You're still a weakling.

735
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,670
Fine.

736
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,410
I'll exchange 10 moves with you instead.

737
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,400
If you can defeat me,

738
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,390
I'll leave here with my men.

739
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,960
If you lose to me,

740
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,720
I'll not only take the Rama Heavenly Ice,

741
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:32,340
but also your life.

742
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:34,470
Deal.

743
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,000
Li Lianhua.

744
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,040
You can't go.

745
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:39,360
Come at me instead!

746
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,030
Don't worry.

747
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,540
He has never defeated me before.

748
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,420
Please be okay.

749
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,370
I remember Master and Madam

750
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,620
always wanted us to compete in the past.

751
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,760
It's been more than ten years.

752
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,840
I haven't witnessed your strength

753
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,350
in a long while, Senior.

754
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:09,410
Then,

755
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,380
I'll give you a good demonstration today.

756
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,040
Ten moves.

757
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,880
I could only hold on for ten moves.

758
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,410
I must win within ten moves.

759
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:00,750
Senior.

760
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,260
I won again.

761
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,410
Looks like you've changed.

762
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,420
After ten years,

763
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,490
you've improved a lot.

764
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,820
It's all thanks to Master

765
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:49,180
and his generous teaching before he died.

766
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,260
What did you say?

767
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,460
What?

768
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,200
You don't believe me?

769
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,340
My move just now

770
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:01,470
can only be executed by using

771
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,280
Master's unique inner power.

772
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,510
Are you surprised?

773
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,180
What did you do to Master?

774
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,620
I just told him

775
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:15,650
about your life and death situation

776
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:18,250
at the East Sea, against the Jinyuan Alliance.

777
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:19,740
Unfortunately, Master

778
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:23,220
was at a critical moment in his meditation training.

779
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,940
When he heard that his favorite disciple

780
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,820
was in trouble,

781
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,790
he became anxious

782
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,820
and lost control of his inner power.

783
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,640
It backfired on him and fatally injured him.

784
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,990
You're really despicable.

785
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,030
Master loved you so much.

786
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:46,070
After knowing you were in trouble,

787
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:46,940
he disregarded his injuries

788
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,940
and transferred all his powers to me

789
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,340
so that I could save you

790
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,560
in his stead.

791
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,450
But he

792
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,850
was spent and died a pathetic death.

793
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,210
Master fell for your lies

794
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,850
because he wanted to save me.

795
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:16,050
Why?

796
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,060
Master

797
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,570
saved our lives.

798
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,050
We're indebted to Master and Madam.

799
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:33,350
Why didn't you let Master go?

800
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,470
It's all because of you!

801
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,250
I...

802
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,040
Because of your arrogance

803
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:44,290
and self-righteousness back then!

804
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:04,800
Ten years!

805
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,690
Ten years later, you finally lost to me!

806
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:11,190
You still lost to me!

807
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,110
Master.

808
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:22,560
You're indeed indebted to Master.

809
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,770
But I'm not.

810
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:26,550
Master never had me

811
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,110
in his heart.

812
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,160
Even when he died, he was thinking about you.

813
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,840
Did he ever think about me?

814
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,940
He asked me to go to the East Sea to save you.

815
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,730
Did he ever consider my safety?

816
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,090
Once a teacher, forever a father.

817
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,280
I treated him as my family.

818
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,330
I practiced hard every day

819
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:47,470
just to beat you and prove myself to him.

820
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,930
But Master had only ever scolded me.

821
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:54,450
Did he ever consider my feelings?

822
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:00,770
Now, I have his entire life's worth of power.

823
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:07,290
It's what I deserved.

824
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,790
You're a traitor and a murderer.

825
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:16,800
I must avenge Master!

826
00:42:58,830 --> 00:42:59,270
You...

827
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:03,690
Yangzhouman is truly amazing.

828
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,720
Even when poisoned by the Bicha Poison,

829
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,030
he managed to survive

830
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,880
for ten years thanks to it.

831
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:12,350
And you've mustered such strong inner power just now.

832
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,400
I underestimated you.

833
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,320
But so what?

834
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:17,510
Don't forget.

835
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,050
Only the Styx Flower can

836
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,740
cure the poison in your body.

837
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:21,810
Without it,

838
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,200
no one can save you.

839
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:25,040
Think about it.

840
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,060
How long can you live?

841
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,200
Didn't you tell me

842
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,890
your poison has been cured?

843
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:33,560
Stop nagging and dragging.

844
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,360
I'm losing interest in killing you.

845
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,160
Fang Duobing.

846
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:38,170
I’ll give you one last chance.

847
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:40,030
Give me the Rama Heavenly Ice.

848
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:41,680
Stop wasting my time.

849
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,550
Stop dreaming!

850
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:43,870
Fine.

851
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,600
Then don't blame me for being ruthless.

852
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,130
Charge!

853
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:27,050
His power has increased. Be careful.

854
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,190
Don't worry.

855
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:28,990
I won't die.

856
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,520
Be careful.
