After four thousand times

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Thousands of times

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The most reluctant

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Is that moment

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Live in the world

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A thousand miles of madness

00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who doesn't wander

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Who doesn't stand by the scattered

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The moon on the edge of the cliff

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000

The most reluctant

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Is that moment

00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The moon on the edge of the cliff

00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000

A thousand miles of madness

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The day before

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
After three thousand times

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The fires of Tong abound

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The achievements that bring home the past

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,600
This place is just for a rest.

36
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,280
I'll serve you with tea.

37
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,240
I didn't mean to do that.

38
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,760
Wait.

39
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,480
I was careless just now.

40
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,640
It's not about this Miss Qing'er.

41
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,040
Can you not take this into consideration?

42
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,320
I'm just following the rules.

43
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,920
But the girls have made a mess of the young master.

44
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,680
Oh.

45
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,840
All the girls are fine.

46
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,800
I have a question

47
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,400
to ask Miss Bi Huan.

48
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,800
Go ahead, Young Master.

49
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,120
Will the girls in the girl's house

50
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,680
be punished if they make a mistake?

51
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,000
The punishment is clear.

52
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,800
It's just to deduct some money.

53
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,280
Then why are they so afraid?

54
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,440
We came here to make money.

55
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,000
Of course, we are very reluctant to deduct money.

56
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,440
In that case,

57
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,680
I would like to ask Miss Bi Huan for a favor.

58
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,480
If all the girls who serve today

59
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,800
make a mistake,

60
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,240
I'll pay for the punishment, okay?

61
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,520
I'm afraid...

62
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,160
If the girls are in a mess,

63
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,800
the guests won't be able to enjoy their own time.

64
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,360
If Miss Bi Huan can't make a decision,

65
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,880
I'll go and tell Yu Lou Chun.

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,880
Wait.

67
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,800
Since it's Young Master Fang's request,

68
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,280
I dare not disobey.

69
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,280
I'm the manager of the girl's house.

70
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,440
I'll make a decision.

71
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,120
I'll not have to supervise today.

72
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,200
I'll report to the master later.

73
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:20,920
Yes.

74
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,760
Thank you.

75
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,160
I thought the son of the minister of the Ministry of Revenue

76
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,960
was a useless second-class man.

77
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,960
I was wrong about Lu Dianchi.

78
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,440
I don't like tea.

79
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,960
But I don't have wine today.

80
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,160
I'll treat you with tea instead of wine.

81
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,440
Brother Lu, don't be so polite.

82
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,720
You should leave your stomach

83
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,280
to the beautiful wine of Manshan Hall.

84
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,720
The son of the minister of Revenue,

85
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,360
Fang Duo Bing.

86
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,480
Your Highness.

87
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,760
Your Highness.

88
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,960
Your Highness.

89
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,240
Something bad happened to Your Highness.

90
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,560
His Majesty appointed

91
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,360
the son of the minister of Revenue for Your Highness.

92
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,080
Fang Duo Bing is missing.

93
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,280
What did I do?

94
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,560
But now people say he's running away from marriage.

95
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,600
They also say

96
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,360
you're tall and strong.

97
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,480
You're as tall as a giant.

98
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,480
You scared him away.

99
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,480
What?

100
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,280
You're running away from marriage?

101
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,200
I'm the one who wants to run away.

102
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,120
By the way,

103
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,640
where did Fang Duo Bing run away?

104
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,840
It seems to be the Jianghu.

105
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,920
Jianghu?

106
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,160
It's so fun to get into the Jianghu.

107
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,360
Boss, how to sell this?

108
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,920
Did you come here to play by yourself?

109
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,840
Yes.

110
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,800
I have more interesting things

111
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,080
in my warehouse.

112
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,240
Would you like to have a look?

113
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,600
Then take me there.

114
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,560
Fang Duo Bing, it's you.

115
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,080
What kind of Jianghu did you break into?

116
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,120
You even made me

117
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,640
be dragged here to serve you.

118
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,320
Miss,

119
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,560
you should be more gentle with your hands.

120
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,400
If you accidentally break the cup,

121
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,880
you'll be trapped again.

122
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,240
Thank you.

123
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,280
You're welcome.

124
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,680
Doctor Li.

125
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,120
Why are you here so late?

126
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,120
It's okay.

127
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,720
Since Doctor Li is here,

128
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,920
please go with me to see the master first.

129
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,520
Did Man Shan Hong

130
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,960
open so early?

131
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,040
The banquet was still early.

132
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,320
The master wanted to see you two alone.

133
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,760
You two,

134
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,640
the master is in this Golden Fish House.

135
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,160
Please come in.

136
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,280
The layout here

137
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,040
is different from other places.

138
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,000
Don't you think it's a bit like

139
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,240
Yun Bao Manor?

140
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,220
05,

141
00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:11,520
Glue the

142
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,080
在

143
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:17,000
This is Horses V test into wei muo pastime.

144
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,920
Above once,

145
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,880
on one shifts use it to climb entered ni gö

146
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,960
I've heard of it.

147
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,880
Duke of Yugu's sword and spear are not weak.

148
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,280
But it's a hard attack that can be compared with the Zhaoxiang in the capital.

149
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,320
You two are honored to welcome me to the temple.

150
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,680
I'm very grateful.

151
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,360
Since it's a temple,

152
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,880
there must be something urgent.

153
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,320
I do have an unkind request.

154
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,680
I want to know who killed my best friend,

155
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,040
Jin Mantang.

156
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,880
So you asked us to come here for this.

157
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,040
Then may I ask, Mr. Yu,

158
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,920
are you and Jin Mantang going to be together?

159
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,680
Now this Golden Jade Tower is built by me for Jinxiong.

160
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,480
I will invite him to the Manchang Hong every year.

161
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,280
Jinxiong and I know each other.

162
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,560
The murderer has been caught.

163
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,840
Mr. Yu, you can go to the Manchang Garden to investigate.

164
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,160
Why do you come to us?

165
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,880
Jinxiong is a cautious person.

166
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,080
He won't be killed by a greedy thief.

167
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,240
I know there's an article in it.

168
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,200
When you were there,

169
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,160
could you tell me what happened?

170
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,760
Sorry.

171
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,080
Mr. Yu, you don't have to think too much.

172
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,720
The article behind this is very clear.

173
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,320
You don't believe that I'm in contact with Jinxiong?

174
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,920
How could we, Mr. Yu?

175
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,360
You're thinking too much.

176
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,680
But when the murderer killed Jin Yuanwen,

177
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,120
he really wanted to steal the head of the person.

178
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,680
It seems that I'm thinking too much.

179
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,200
But after the murder,

180
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,240
there's something strange.

181
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,760
I don't know if I should tell you.

182
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
What's that?

183
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,080
It's okay to tell you.

184
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,120
When we were in Yuanbao Manor,

185
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,520
we lost a baby.

186
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,320
It seems that the baby was put together with the head of the person.

187
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,040
Mr. Fang, you saw it, right?

188
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,640
That baby is as thin as silk.

189
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
It's crystal clear.

190
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,200
It's more like...

191
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,400
A piece of ice?

192
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,800
In my opinion, it's more like a jade bamboo leaf.

193
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,680
What?

194
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,280
Mr. Yu, have you seen it?

195
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,040
I'm just guessing.

196
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,160
Do you know what the person who stole the treasure is?

197
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,160
No clue.

198
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,320
But our Baichuan Court suspects that

199
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,000
Jing Mantang is not from the Central Plains.

200
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,840
They suspect that he's the one who stole the treasure.

201
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,560
Mr. Yu, do you know who he is?

202
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,680
Jinxiong is not from the Central Plains.

203
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,080
This is the first time I know that.

204
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,600
That's definitely a misunderstanding.

205
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,400
I think Mr. Yu is as black as a black belt.

206
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,520
He's very beautiful.

207
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,280
He thought he had foreign blood.

208
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,440
I'm a man from the Central Plains who knows everything.

209
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,280
It's late.

210
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,080
I'll go prepare for Man Shanhong.

211
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,680
Please excuse me.

212
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,560
He not only knows about the ice,

213
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,360
but he also wants the ice.

214
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,080
Why don't we enjoy the moon tonight

215
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,080
and explore the female village?

216
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,880
Let's see where the secret is.

217
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,600
Doctor Li, Mr. Fang.

218
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,160
It's noon.

219
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,280
Why don't you go back to your room first?

220
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,960
It's not quiet.

221
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,360
You're right.

222
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,080
This is a ancient temple.

223
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,200
It's about two or three mountains away.

224
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,520
But it's quiet nearby.

225
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,040
We usually do our best to visit it.

226
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,680
Other temples

227
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,560
only knock twice.

228
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,560
I've never heard of the noon of noon.

229
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,360
This temple is hard to build.

230
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,880
So we knock once every day

231
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,840
at noon and at night.

232
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,440
Then we won't bother you.

233
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,680
We can just walk around.

234
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,640
Okay.

235
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,320
Okay.

236
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,880
Did you hear about the Four-Five Tea Party

237
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,720
when you came up from the mountain?

238
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,480
It's spread all over the world.

239
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,880
I didn't expect

240
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,560
that Li Xiangyi is such a person.

241
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,520
I knew it long ago.

242
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,680
When this happened,

243
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,440
I was there.

244
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,000
I happened to pass by that day.

245
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,000
I wanted to save this Shanchu Sword.

246
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,480
But after a few moves,

247
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,080
I lost.

248
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,440
I let Li Xiangyi

249
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,960
take the life of the Shanchu Sword.

250
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,600
Then why did he let you go?

251
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,880
I saved Li Xiangyi's life before.

252
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,520
Otherwise, he would have killed me.

253
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,600
They say Mr. Yu invited the Qi people.

254
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,520
I didn't expect that the hero Dong Fang

255
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,800
would come here

256
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,400
because he was good at talking.

257
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,440
Fang, what do you mean?

258
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,800
Let's have a competition.

259
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,080
Come on. I'm not afraid of you.

260
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,920
Fang Xiaobao, don't be impulsive.

261
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,960
Why are you in a hurry?

262
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,760
Maybe this Dong Fang

263
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,640
really saved Li Xiangyi's life.

264
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,560
What are you talking about?

265
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,960
May I ask you, Dong Fang?

266
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,960
When Li Xiangyi was young,

267
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,520
did he have any enemies he couldn't defeat?

268
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,760
Yes.

269
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,800
But in this way,

270
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,160
maybe when the enemy forced Li Xiangyi

271
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,440
to kneel and beg for mercy,

272
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,440
this Dong Fang

273
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,120
was angry and helped him with a sword.

274
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,400
He helped Li Xiangyi

275
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,080
to kill 18 people.

276
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,840
Finally, he saved Li Xiangyi's life.

277
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,640
Li Lianhua,

278
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,040
you two are fighting against me.

279
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,160
No. No. No.

280
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,040
Dong Fang,

281
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,040
it's a joke.

282
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,840
Don't take it seriously.

283
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,560
Yes, it's a joke.

284
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,240
Everyone,

285
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,760
the competition is about to start.

286
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,680
Please go to the Qinghong Hall with me.

287
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,880
No, it's dangerous trying to lead us there.

288
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,360
There are many treasures

289
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,360
in circular holes around the mountain.

290
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,600
It's time to adjust ourselves.

291
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,480
'

292
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,600
Why did you

293
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,080
leave the land

294
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,320
full of sweet surgeons?

295
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,520
Everyone, you're all here.

296
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,520
Everyone present here

297
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,520
is someone I admire.

298
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,520
I'm fortunate to have all of you here.

299
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,520
Everyone, please enter.

300
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,520
Everyone, this pot of wine

301
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,520
is made by Xiangshan Ice Fist.

302
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
It's been preserved for a hundred years.

303
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,520
Every year, a new pot is made.

304
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,520
Manshan Hong is the name of this wine.

305
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,520
Manshan Hong is wine?

306
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,520
Exactly.

307
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,520
Isn't there anything else?

308
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,520
It's not enough to brew it for a hundred years.

309
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,520
What else do you want?

310
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,520
Good wine.

311
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,520
My gift can help with alcohol.

312
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,520
This glass is made by the Snow Mountain Ice Fist.

313
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,520
It's a perfect match with Manshan Hong's wine.

314
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,520
Everyone, don't miss it.

315
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,520
One mountain is full of red, two are full of silk.

316
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,520
Three are full of red, four are full of white.

317
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,520
The candle is lit, the dream is awake.

318
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,520
A more authentic glass is made.

319
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,520
The poem is full of regrets.

320
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,520
It seems that the poet loves red,

321
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,520
more than the wine.

322
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,520
What a coincidence.

323
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,520
I was also very poetic just now.

324
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,520
I also wrote a poem.

325
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,520
No wonder everyone says that the poem is not appropriate.

326
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,520
The poet doesn't want the title of the poem.

327
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,520
He is forced to be a ruse in the martial arts world.

328
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:46,520
This one word can see the picture of the tiger and the light of the jade bowl.

329
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:55,520
Did Li Shengyi and Mr. Fang really not prepare a gift?

330
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,520
Mr. Fang's gift is to help everyone

331
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,520
find the real Manshan Hong.

332
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:09,520
The real Manshan Hong should be around us.

333
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,520
Everyone, please listen carefully.

334
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,520
There are clouds and stars in the sky.

335
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,520
And now the mountains are full of wind.

336
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,520
The clouds and clouds in the sky are not fading away.

337
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,520
If I'm not wrong,

338
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,520
the clouds and clouds are not fading away.

339
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,520
Mr. Fang is really smart.

340
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,520
The clouds and clouds are the silk

341
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,520
embroidered by the girls.

342
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,520
Mr. Fang has seen through the mystery.

343
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,520
I don't hide it anymore.

344
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,520
Girls, Manshan Hong,

345
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,520
let's start.

346
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,520
Yes.

347
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,520
This is Manshan Hong.

348
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,520
I'm sorry.

349
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,520
I'm sorry.

350
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,520
I'm sorry.

351
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,520
This is Manshan Hong.

352
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,520
The girls who chose the red perfume

353
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,520
before the gate of the mountain

354
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,520
are all here.

355
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,520
You chose the good fate around you.

356
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,520
There is a god in it.

357
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,520
Come on.

358
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,520
Let's drink this cup together.

359
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,520
Since we have such a good fate today,

360
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,520
let's return this red perfume to the girl.

361
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,520
My name is Xi Fei.

362
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,520
I'm here to meet the god doctor today.

363
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,520
He gave me this jade flower.

364
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,520
I have this jade flower every day.

365
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,520
It seems that the people who have been to the girl's house

366
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,520
have this red embroidery sticker.

367
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,520
This is Manshan Hong's rule.

368
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,520
It's a good luck.

369
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,520
That...

370
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,520
I'm sorry to break my chicken feet in my arms

371
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,520
and throw them away.

372
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,520
Can I not return them?

373
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,520
You are a hero who has been through the world.

374
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,520
What can I do if I lose them?

375
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,520
Mr. Yu,

376
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,520
this red perfume

377
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,520
should belong to Bi Huang.

378
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,520
I'm sorry.

379
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,520
I'm sorry.

380
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,520
It should belong to Bi Huang.

381
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,520
Why did you call someone else?

382
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,520
I'm sorry, Mr. Dong Fang.

383
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,520
Bi Huang is the manager of the girl's house.

384
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,520
Manshan Hong is busy with things.

385
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,520
I'm afraid that I'll be late.

386
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,520
That's why I asked Bin Rong to replace me.

387
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,520
Brother Dong Fang, don't worry.

388
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,520
You know what others don't know.

389
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,520
After Manshan Hong,

390
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,520
you have plenty of time.

391
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,520
Okay.

392
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,520
Bi Huang,

393
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,520
you heard it clearly.

394
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,520
Everyone,

395
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,520
besides the wine,

396
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,520
there is another type of red perfume

397
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,520
that you must try.

398
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,520
This fish soup

399
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,520
called the spring is not known to be here

400
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,520
is made by using the white fish in the North Sea

401
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,520
for many days.

402
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,520
It's a big supplement.

403
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,520
Manshan Hong doesn't have it every time.

404
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,520
Everyone is convinced this time.

405
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,520
Miss Xifei,

406
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,520
I'll do it myself.

407
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,520
Qing.

408
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,520
It's okay.

409
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,520
I don't like soup.

410
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,520
It's good that you don't drink it.

411
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,520
Mr. Fang,

412
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,520
if you don't drink it,

413
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,520
I'll be rude

414
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,520
and punish myself.

415
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,520
Someone,

416
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,520
make another bowl for Mr. Fang.

417
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,520
Okay.

418
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,520
Doctor Li,

419
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,520
how do you think of this soup?

420
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,520
This soup is really good.

421
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,520
But except for Mr. Yu,

422
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,520
there should be no one

423
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,520
who needs to improve.

424
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,520
Mr. Yu's ancient skills,

425
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,520
no knife, no spear,

426
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,520
what nonsense are you talking about?

427
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,520
Who are you talking about?

428
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,520
It's not a big deal.

429
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,520
It's just that Mr. Yu is a little bit timid.

430
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,520
Otherwise,

431
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,520
how could he

432
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,520
carry a bodyguard with him?

433
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,520
The one next to me

434
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,520
is called Xin Xue.

435
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,520
She is the guardian of the woman's house.

436
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,520
She is not leaving

437
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,520
because there are too many women in the woman's house.

438
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,520
It's troublesome to walk around.

439
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,520
So it's like this.

440
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,520
I'm really rude.

441
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,520
Mr. Yu is really

442
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,520
taking care of the girl.

443
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,520
These girls

444
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,520
are just drinking and reciting poems with their friends.

445
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,520
What I'm afraid of is

446
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,520
that these guards

447
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,520
are really disturbed.

448
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,520
Mr. Yu's words

449
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,520
are not too humble to himself.

450
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,520
The girls in the woman's house

451
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,520
stay here

452
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,520
just to make money.

453
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,520
No matter who the master is,

454
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,520
he must keep some affection.

455
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,520
If Mr. Yu doesn't treat people as people,

456
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,520
in other people's eyes,

457
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,520
Mr. Yu is just a living money bag.

458
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,520
Isn't this a little bit of self-righteousness?

459
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,520
I'm taught.

460
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,520
It's my turn.

461
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,520
Mr. Murong sent a jade drum

462
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,520
and a dance called thunder dance a few months ago.

463
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,520
It's hard to understand.

464
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,520
Even the best dancer of the woman's house,

465
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,520
Chilong,

466
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,520
can't learn it.

467
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,520
Today,

468
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,520
I'll let Mr. Murong

469
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,520
dance thunder dance for you all here.

470
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,520
Let's have a good talk.

471
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,520
It's really not fair.

472
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,520
Miss Chilong, please help me.

473
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,520
Please take the jade drum

474
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,520
and put it on the stage.

475
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,520
Come on.

476
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,520
Here, Li Shengyi,

477
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,520
Miss Hong,

478
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,520
I'm here to dance thunder dance.

479
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,520
I'll help you obtain the jade drum.

480
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,520
Thank you, Miss Chilong.

481
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,520
Please take it.

482
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,520
Any questions?

483
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,580
Canyonasha,

00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,020

Tradition only until it

488
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,520
is in internationally known media.

489
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,520
What

490
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,560
military strategy

491
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,520
I can bet

492
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,920
Li Shiyi, please.

493
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,880
Thank you.

494
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,560
Li Shiyi

495
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,920
Very good

496
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,340
Great!

497
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,500
Great!

498
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:10,220
While I'm pitäpping into

499
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,980
a fantastic dream.

500
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,960
I think you guys did pretty well.

501
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,460
Since you're all busy with yourzwannessierter,

502
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,900
please go back on your guard.

503
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,580
Thank you very much,speaker.

504
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,720
I'm going back to my room.

505
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,720
Okay.

506
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,720
Miss Bi Huang,

507
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,320
don't refuse.

508
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,320
Can you?

509
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,720
Bi Huang,

510
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,520
if you're willing, go.

511
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,320
Master, Bi Huang can't obey orders.

512
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,520
Bi Huang only cares about his master.

513
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,920
He will never be the other person.

514
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,720
God's will is up to his heart.

515
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,320
Bi Huang,

516
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,520
you're in charge.

517
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,320
Don't break the rules.

518
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,520
I know I shouldn't do that.

519
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,520
But I've been loyal to you.

520
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,920
Even if I'm punished,

521
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,720
I won't do anything against you.

522
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,920
I know you've been here for a long time.

523
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,320
You have some savings.

524
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,520
You're not afraid of being deducted.

525
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,520
Then change your way.

526
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,520
Today, the whole place is full of people.

527
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,120
I'll punish you to go to the star-picking stage

528
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,720
and dance for everyone.

529
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,320
You can't go to the stage until the dawn.

530
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,520
Mr. Yu,

531
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,520
what's wrong with Bi Huang's loyalty to you?

532
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,520
What's the point of being punished?

533
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,720
Mr. Fang,

534
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,120
Bi Huang is the master's slave.

535
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,720
You don't have to say anything.

536
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,920
Well...

537
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,320
Bi Huang is punished.

538
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,120
Dongfang,

539
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:45,920
I'm sorry.

540
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,720
I ruined your mood.

541
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,920
But I think

542
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,320
Mr. Fang is a little tired.

543
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,120
Then let Miss Qing and Bin Rong

544
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,920
chat with you to relieve your boredom.

545
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,720
That's good.

546
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,120
No, I don't want to.

547
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,920
Mr. Fang is looking for me.

548
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,920
Look at Mr. Fang.

549
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,320
Don't make it difficult for him.

550
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,320
Miss Qing has an appointment with me.

551
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,120
That's right.

552
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,720
It's not a long-term practice to come to Manshan Hong.

553
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,520
Mr. Fang is very urgent.

554
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,120
What about me?

555
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,520
I'll give you more treasures tomorrow.

556
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,120
You can have a good rest tonight.

557
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,720
Everyone, tomorrow morning,

558
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,720
we will gather at Guanri Hall

559
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,920
to enjoy the view of the sunrise.

560
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,120
Tonight,

561
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,120
you can go back to your room and rest.

562
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,720
Mr. Fang, I'll take Doctor Li back to his room.

563
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,920
Hey, don't forget to go to the hospital.

564
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,320
I'll wait for you.

565
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,120
Are you trying to avoid me?

566
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,120
No.

567
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,120
What's going on?

568
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,520
I just drank too much and came back.

569
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,520
Thank you for bringing me back.

570
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,920
I'm not a kind person.

571
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,920
But I'm very fond of you.

572
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,520
Since you don't like to be close to people,

573
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:38,520
I can only be a good friend and show my love.

574
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,920
I won't bother you tonight.

575
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,320
I'll go to the hospital.

576
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,320
I'll wait for you.

577
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,320
Only the moon is full of love.

578
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,720
A person is looking for a person.

579
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,320
Doctor Li, good night.

580
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,720
Okay.

581
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,920
I just remembered.

582
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,720
Someone is waiting for me outside.

583
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,520
How about this?

584
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,520
You sleep in this bedroom and I sleep in this living room.

585
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,320
I won't bother you, okay?

586
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,920
Give me a glass of water.

587
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,920
What?

588
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,320
The teapot is there.

589
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,320
I've been tired all day.

590
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,920
Oh.

591
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,120
Oh, there are snacks.

592
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,120
Bring me some.

593
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,120
Here.

594
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,120
Please.

595
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,120
Why are you looking at me?

596
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,520
Don't be a gossip.

597
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,520
Miss Qing, I sincerely advise you to change your career.

598
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,920
Change my career?

599
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,920
You're not talented and you're clumsy.

600
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,520
You're always angry.

601
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,120
You're really inferior to other girls.

602
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,120
So I advise you to leave here.

603
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,720
Why are you here alone all day?

604
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,520
You think I'm a prostitute?

605
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,720
I'm here to pick up customers.

606
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,720
No.

607
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,520
I left long ago.

608
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,920
The girls here left early.

609
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,920
Didn't you stay here for money?

610
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,520
But Bi Huang lied to you.

611
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,920
The girls here are robbed and kidnapped.

612
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,120
They're all kidnapped here.

613
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,520
Didn't you say that you won't be punished?

614
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,320
You only deduct money if you make a mistake.

615
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,520
If the money is deducted, you'll lose your life.

616
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,120
The Yulou Spring Beauty is a law-abiding beauty.

617
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,920
But the food and clothing here need to be spent.

618
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,120
Once you make a mistake, you'll be deducted a large sum of money.

619
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,120
If you don't have enough money and you're hurt by hunger,

620
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,520
if you owe too much,

621
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,520
you'll be sent to the guards outside the door as a proof.

622
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,520
I didn't expect this house to be such a place.

623
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,520
Such a place?

624
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,120
A gangster like you

625
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,520
always comes here every year.

626
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,520
I...

627
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,520
May I ask where you are from?

628
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,120
Why are you here?

629
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,520
My family lives in the capital.

630
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,120
My family is poor and can't afford to eat fish.

631
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,520
We can only eat 100 meters of fish.

632
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,720
I saw the garbage two months ago.

633
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,520
I was dragged here for no reason.

634
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,120
Why are you lying now?

635
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,720
You can't afford to eat 100 meters of fish.

636
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,920
And you don't have money.

637
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,520
It's a big family.

638
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,120
I don't want to say it.

639
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,120
Anyway, I was dragged here that day.

640
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,520
I was so confused.

641
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,520
I was dragged here when I woke up.

642
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,920
It's a secret medicine.

643
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,120
I can trust you now.

644
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,720
Don't you like to break into the martial arts world?

645
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,720
Then go knock down the guards now.

646
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,920
Put the bridge down and get me out.

647
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,320
You really want to go?

648
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,520
If what you said is true,

649
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,920
I will give you justice.

650
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,920
Hurry up.

651
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,720
Yulou Chun's house is at the Kaming Peak.

652
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,320
You won't find him tonight.

653
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,720
Yulou Chun.

654
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,720
Yuyuan.

655
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:56,120

660
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,120
You have a lot of money in your bank account.

661
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,840
It seems that you are hardworking and have a lot of strength.

662
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,680
I'm just doing my job for my master.

663
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,280
How many treasures are there?

664
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,640
It's a matter of the guest. It's not worth it.

665
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,000
I'm worried about your master.

666
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,680
I'm afraid that he has done too many bad things

667
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,680
and is worried that he will be a ghost knocking on the door at midnight.

668
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,480
Forget it. I can't tell you.

669
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,320
I'll just look for him tomorrow.

670
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,000
Are you going to stay here alone for the night?

671
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,440
Don't worry about it.

672
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,760
At this time, when the bell rings,

673
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,440
everyone in the inn will be quiet.

674
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,880
I don't care.

675
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,480
Please go back to your guest.

676
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,680
Don't worry too much.

677
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,520
What's wrong with you?

678
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,720
You know Taizheng, right?

679
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,760
Do you want to see him?

680
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,000
You...

681
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
what?

682
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,200
Why don't you go with some other people?

683
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,800
Verbal is the most Vaults increase the maargammal energy.

684
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,680
Keep practicing.

685
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,600
You tried in this way until now too, don't you want to say hi?

686
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:35,600
You...

687
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,680
Rosemallow School then...

688
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,280
I'm sure I'll find a way to settle the score tomorrow.

689
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,920
You still have to do that?

690
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,880
I left you half a piece of dessert.

691
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,240
Miss,

692
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,480
you really have a sharp appetite.

693
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,440
Is it possible that the things in this room

694
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,480
don't need to be bought by me?

695
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,680
Of course I'm going to be full.

696
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,720
You're not going to eat anything?

697
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,760
I'm not going to eat anything.

698
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,680
I'm going to eat.

699
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,680
I'm going to eat.

700
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,680
I'm going to eat.

701
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,680
I'm going to eat.

702
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,200
Why did you use the cup so many times?

703
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,680
You're so nosy.

704
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,520
By the way,

705
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,280
has Li Lianhua been here?

706
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,600
It's already midnight.

707
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,760
Why hasn't she come yet?

708
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,680
Fang Debing,

709
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,800
tell me the truth.

710
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,880
Did you get into the martial arts world

711
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,000
because you were afraid of someone

712
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,000
and wanted to hide from her?

713
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,720
I wasn't afraid of anyone.

714
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,400
Maybe you were just afraid

715
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,480
of a woman.

716
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,480
A woman?

717
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,480
There are two of them.

718
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,480
Two?

719
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,960
You're so busy.

720
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,080
One is my mother,

721
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,480
the other is my aunt.

722
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,080
You're so fierce.

723
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,640
Actually, I didn't mean to lie

724
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,880
when I was in the room.

725
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,400
But you'll know it later.

726
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,640
Today, you helped me to solve the problem.

727
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,600
I'll remember it.

728
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,080
As long as you send me out,

729
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,640
I won't bother you with the past things.

730
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,200
By the way, tomorrow you...

731
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,000
Fang Debing,

732
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,400
I'm talking to you.

733
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,160
I knew you wouldn't be able to get out.

734
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,280
I'll escape

735
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,040
if I'm not guarded by anyone.

736
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,480
Why did she fall asleep suddenly?

737
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,520
il

738
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,600
absentmindedly obedient

739
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,520
What are you doing

740
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,080
in the early morning, Fang Xiao Bao?

741
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,320
Windy abdomine is against my will,

742
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,360
but you forgot

743
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,720
your powderupbeat

744
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,960
and contemptibly disobedient Cinefa!

745
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,000
I was gonna lie down and go to you later

746
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,800
why did I fall asleep by myself?

747
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,440
I've been sleeping in the living room thinking

748
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,080
that you gone to sleep.

749
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,040
Have you come up with more?

750
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,640
Come here.

751
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,680
challenging my own wishes

752
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,880
You went to her house secretly.

753
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,280
I...

754
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,440
I cried all night.

755
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,440
But you didn't come.

756
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,080
But,

757
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,120
do you know that

758
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,560
Yulou Chun is not a good person?

759
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,200
The girls here

760
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,520
are not from here.

761
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,920
They are from Guai.

762
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,680
You can tell?

763
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,480
Think about it.

764
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,320
For so many years,

765
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,120
no one knows where the house is.

766
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,560
If they are from here,

767
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,480
they would have been killed if they came.

768
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,560
Yulou Chun

769
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,640
built the house on the peak of the mountain

770
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,840
and didn't let outsiders in and out.

771
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,720
She must have sent someone to look for her.

772
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:37,720
I guess

773
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,880
this ice sheet

774
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,120
is also hidden there.

775
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,000
Doctor Li.

776
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,640
I've been waiting for you.

777
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,400
So, Mr. Fang is here.

778
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,280
You two are going to Guanri Pavilion.

779
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,960
I've prepared a jade basin for Doctor Li.

780
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,360
Did Qing'er

781
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,720
prepare the jade basin for you?

782
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,040
She went to the bath early in the morning.

783
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,840
I saw that she slept so well

784
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,720
that I didn't wake her up.

785
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,840
Then I'll prepare a jade basin for Mr. Fang.

786
00:36:59,080 --> 00:36:59,640
I have it.

787
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,520
Guanri Pavilion is outside the girl's house

788
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,480
and is next to the camp.

789
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,200
It's inconvenient for us to accompany you.

790
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,080
Don't catch a cold on the way.

791
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,880
Thank you, Miss Xi Fei.

792
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,520
Let's go.

793
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,680
In the warm night of blend putter

794
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,080
香山红叶성应宏

795
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,360
Well,

796
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,040
it is beautiful

797
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,440
as well is of a speciality.

798
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,280
Over last night

799
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,760
your foular was in no place to go.

800
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,520
It's a pity that you were tooThe friend Newman

801
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,400
over last night passed away from the bowl.

802
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,080
Brother Lu,

803
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,920
you're a imposs Rush.

804
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,440
This is a girl who doesn't have a drink

805
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,000
but makes you sleep until the dawn.

806
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,480
He has every snoring reward

807
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,280
for having the fresh couldn in the end.

808
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,080
Well,

809
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,720
since you two are here,

810
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,120
I'll let you cook

811
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,000
You are all men of the right kind.

812
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,240
You only sleep and watch the scenery.

813
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,040
Then today,

814
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,040
I'll be the one to explain to the girls.

815
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,000
I advise you not to

816
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,120
be so rude to these girls.

817
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,800
They were all locked up here.

818
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,160
They weren't willing to do so.

819
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,120
Didn't you say that they were paid for?

820
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,480
I'm afraid that the money

821
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,640
is all in the pockets of the criminals.

822
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,160
But I heard that

823
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,520
these girls have made a lot of money here.

824
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,440
That's not a bad deal for them.

825
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,440
Brother Dong Fang,

826
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,800
how about I give you 10,000 taels

827
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,880
and sell you to Jibiц of Lan City?

828
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,600
No. You…

829
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,400
Let's ask Yuluo Chun when he comes.

830
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,840
If what Master Fang says

831
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,840
is true, I'll punish him.

832
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,040
What's that?

833
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,200
Isn't the ring from Yulou Chun?

834
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,240
Is it…

835
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,680
It hasn't charred yet.

836
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,640
It took some time to长 down.

837
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,240
What's the hand on Yulou Chun?

838
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,040
Where's he?

839
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,000
I'm going to the inn to ask for a house.

840
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,200
You'll know when you see it.

841
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,040
Where's Yulou Spring?

842
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,080
The owner is asking for a house in the mountain top.

843
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,320
Take us up there to have a look.

844
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,680
The owner is asking for a house.

845
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,880
No outsiders are allowed to enter.

846
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,960
Will your owner

847
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,680
go down the mountain on his own?

848
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,800
I can only see the clouds

849
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,960
by sitting on the fence.

850
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,040
I haven't seen the owner

851
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,120
go down the mountain on his own.

852
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:30,800
Everyone,

853
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,280
is there anything wrong with him?

854
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,280
Today, we found that

855
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,800
the owner's arm was cut off

856
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,080
and left at Guanri Pavilion.

857
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,440
There's no jade ring.

858
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,720
You don't recognize it, do you?

859
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,640
How...

860
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,640
How is that possible?

861
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,000
If you don't send us up there,

862
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
it'll be hard for your owner

863
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
to live or die.

864
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,840
Hurry up!

865
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,120
I'll call the guards

866
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,240
to the inn right away

867
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,240
to send us up there.

868
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,680
What's wrong?

869
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,680
I'm fine.

870
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,720
Thanks, Komomo.

871
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,840
I'll send you upstairs with me.

872
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,440
Xinjue was looking for you, Master.

873
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,680
What room is this?

874
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,680
This is the secret room of the owner.

875
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,680
But now it's been moved out.

876
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,680
Look.

877
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,680
The phone call on the silk cloth

878
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,680
is the same as the one on the bottle.

879
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,680
The man is still here.

880
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,680
Could it be that

881
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,680
he's going to the bottle again?

882
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,680
I don't know.

883
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,680
I'm not sure.

884
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,680
I'm not sure.

885
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,680
I'm not sure.

886
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,680
I'm not sure.

887
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,680
I'm not sure.

888
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,680
He's going to the bottle again.

889
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,680
He might be running away for the silk cloth.

890
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,680
Speak.

891
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,680
Where were you last night?

892
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,680
Every guest slept in his room last night.

893
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,680
Where could he go?

894
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,680
It's a dream.

895
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,680
Where were the bodyguards and guards last night?

896
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,680
Without the guards' order,

897
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,680
they couldn't have entered the female house.

898
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,680
I was also in the yard last night.

899
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,680
The guards can testify.

900
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,680
That means

901
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,680
there's no suspicion.

902
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,680
Hello.

903
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,680
What's the matter with you

904
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,680
visiting the Clouds and Wind last night?

905
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,680
Your master

906
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,680
is trying to seduce the maids to come here.

907
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,680
I'm here to testify.

908
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,680
But you secretly found out

909
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,680
that there's a treasure on the mountain.

910
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,680
Isn't that normal?

911
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,680
It's hard to say.

912
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,680
I rushed in to find the treasure

913
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,680
and it seems

914
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,680
that it's not normal.

915
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,680
Guard Xing,

916
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,680
we found the owner's leg.

917
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,680
There's a man in the cave.

918
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,680
We blocked him.

919
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,680
Tell the guards to watch the bridge.

920
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,680
Yes.

921
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,680
No one is allowed to leave.

922
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,680
If you don't come out,

923
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,680
I'll set the fire and smoke.

924
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,680
The beauty is too fast.

925
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,680
The waiting is not enough.

926
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,680
The sky is yellow.

927
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,680
The next day will come again.

928
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,680
I want to change my life.

929
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,680
The beauty is too fast.
