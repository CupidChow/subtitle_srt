[Episode 12]

4
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,710
Do you have to

5
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:03,460
wrapped yourself up like that?

6
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,820
We have to find a reason to stay.

7
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,850
What about Guo Kun?

8
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,660
He always runs around carrying a skeleton.

9
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,620
Have you ever thought

10
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,600
where did the skeleton

11
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,530
come from?

12
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,830
Could it be from the lotus pond?

13
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,150
It shouldn't be a coincidence.

14
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:18,790
Let's go.

15
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,740
Let's talk to Guo Kun.

16
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,200
You go ahead.

17
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,060
I said I don't care.

18
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,470
Let's go.

19
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,820
You guys are really going without me?

20
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,740
It's miserable!

21
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:46,060
It's not worth it.

22
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,300
Guo Kun.

23
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,260
Guo Kun.

24
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,950
Do you know this?

25
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,310
Do you really like the woman

26
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,230
who wore this brown wedding dress?

27
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,630
Where are you going?

28
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,360
Where are you going?

29
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,500
I found it strange yesterday.

30
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,710
Guo Kun went crazy when he saw a person

31
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,140
in brown wedding dress.

32
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,930
Then why did he

33
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,650
hang up this brown curtain in his room?

34
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,340
In fact,

35
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,390
he doesn't care about
this wedding dress at all.

36
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,340
Why are you carrying the skeleton all day?

37
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:38,890
Tell me,

38
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,380
and I'll give it back to you.

39
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,829
You bastard!

40
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,790
Why are you here?

41
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,130
The day before yesterday was 5th day,

42
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,390
yesterday was 6th day,

43
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,980
and today is 7th day.

44
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,060
Today is 7th day, I going to play
at the center of the lake.

45
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,380
We can't get anything from this lunatic.

46
00:03:59,380 --> 00:03:59,910
Let's go.

47
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,620
Wait.

48
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:05,850
Guo Kun.

49
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,610
Who is this bastard?

50
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,670
Monster!

51
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:13,830
Monster!

52
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,080
Monster!

53
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,270
If Guo Kun is not sensitive to the bride,

54
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,900
why don't we try someone else?

55
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,580
Lion Soul.

56
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,940
Do you remember me?

57
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,780
Bastard!

58
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,970
You can't escape.

59
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,220
Go to hell!

60
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,670
Just like what happened
in front of the mirror stone yesterday.

61
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,540
He made a palm hit first,

62
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,440
but it was weak.

63
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,650
Guo Kun practiced the Arhat legs.

64
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,730
But this palm

65
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,770
is immature Bagua Xingyi Palm.

66
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,460
Bagua Sect?

67
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,100
Guo Qian's Sect?

68
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,830
It seems Guo Kun imitated his brother.

69
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,260
I looked through the casebook again
last night.

70
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,820
When the three women died,

71
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,380
there are no palm marks on their bodies.

72
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,650
Then, who is the target of this palm?

73
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,360
When Madam Xu died,

74
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,420
Lion Soul should have been present.

75
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,060
I haven't eaten anything since last night.

76
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,860
I'm starving.

77
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,200
Is Second Master's medicine ready?

78
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,850
Yes.

79
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,980
Why did you brew it
according to yesterday's prescription?

80
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,640
It's wrong.

81
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,500
Throw it away, hurry!

82
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,230
Don't blame us.

83
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,100
Granny Housekeeper.

84
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,670
Today is Madam Wang's death anniversary.

85
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,980
Accidents happened in Cailian Manor
one after another.

86
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,510
There's a vengeful spirit.

87
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,640
I need to burn more joss paper for her.

88
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,170
Don't blame us.

89
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,700
Please forgive us.

90
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,170
Death anniversary?

91
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,970
It was the day the second murder happened

92
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,950
in Cailian Manor seven years ago.

93
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,570
The day before yesterday was 5th day,

94
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:40,830
yesterday was 6th day,

95
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,780
and today is 7th day.

96
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:47,840
I'm going to play at the center of the lake.

97
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,020
Center of the lake?

98
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,020
Young man,

99
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,550
are you waiting for Second Master Guo?

100
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,340
Who are you?

101
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,130
Are you from Lotus Manor?

102
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,430
Why are you waiting for him?

103
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,100
Today is my birthday.

104
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,370
Every year on my birthday,

105
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,050
Mr. Kun will come to play with me

106
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,370
and learn opera together.

107
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,040
But why didn’t he come today?

108
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,810
Did his brother lock him up again?

109
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:28,940
Every birthday...

110
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,140
Today...

111
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,380
Young man,

112
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,320
have you known Mr. Guo for a long time?

113
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,600
It's been seven years.

114
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,930
You recall it so clearly

115
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,700
without even thinking about it?

116
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,460
Of course.

117
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,870
Because it was on the evening
of my eighth birthday.

118
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,530
I was separated from my family.

119
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,940
When I was crying alone in the alley.

120
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,740
Mr. Kun also sneaked out to play.

121
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,830
He saw me crying,

122
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,420
and came to play with me.

123
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,490
We played together until dawn.

124
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,290
He left after my family found me.

125
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,320
So,

126
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,310
Guo Kun wasn't at Cailian Manor

127
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,330
at the night when Madam Wang died.

128
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,050
What are you doing here?

129
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,350
I know you haven't eaten anything

130
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,630
since last night.

131
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:19,860
Eat up.

132
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,060
You have a conscience.

133
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,220
Don't think you can

134
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,420
calm me down with a chicken.

135
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,750
My gut feeling is right.

136
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,820
Fei's background is not simple.

137
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,679
I don't know how much you know about him.

138
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:48,080
But in the martial world,

139
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,740
it's always good to be alert.

140
00:08:51,169 --> 00:08:52,799
You're just a kid,

141
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,280
but you're lecturing me.

142
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,530
My biggest advantage is
to learn from mistakes.

143
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,460
I'll learn ten things from a single mistake.

144
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,620
I can remember every time

145
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,280
when I got scammed by someone.

146
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,110
You,

147
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,030
you're a big mouth,

148
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,440
a little cheap,

149
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,310
and also keeping many secrets,

150
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,710
but still you're considered a good person.

151
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,520
You are also

152
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,020
the first friend I made in the martial world.

153
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,550
I don't want you to be in danger.

154
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,260
Fine.

155
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,080
I will be more cautious

156
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,570
in everything.

157
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,420
This chicken is not for free.

158
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,700
If Detective Fang doesn't participate

159
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,380
in the case of Cailian Manor,

160
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,830
there’s no way to investigate it further.

161
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,760
Since you said so,

162
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,650
I'll help you.

163
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,870
Are you also wondering

164
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,470
why Guo Kun suddenly
attacked you last night?

165
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,780
This is the residue of Guo Kun's medicine yesterday.

166
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,370
I checked his prescription.

167
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,430
Guess who ordered the servants
to change his medicine?

168
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,420
Of course it was his brother.

169
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,460
Guo's Sect is green with a pond of silk,

170
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,290
accompanied by ten miles of jade hairpins.

171
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,180
Just a man of the Sect in the woods,

172
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,460
watching lanterns with chrysanthemum wine
in a melon field.

173
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,300
Not bad.

174
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:29,880
It's a good poem.

175
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,070
I didn't expect that Doctor Li has some literary talent.

176
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:35,840
Wait.

177
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:36,840
Dad.

178
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,940
It seems to be

179
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,420
an acrostic poem.

180
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,060
Guo Shi Sha Gua.

181
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,160
Guo is a fool.

182
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,080
Master, bad news.

183
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,680
The guests are in Madam Xu's study again.

184
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,900
You keep barging into my manor's backyard.

185
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,930
You really don't respect me.

186
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,400
In that case,

187
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,890
don't blame me for being rude.

188
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:12,620
See them out.

189
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:40,580
You...

190
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,410
You're afraid of people entering this room

191
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,820
because you don't them want to see this.

192
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,180
When the moon is bright,

193
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,340
with the wedding dress,

194
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,340
see you next to the mirror.

195
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,540
be there or be square.

196
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,580
Lord Guo,

197
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,700
if my guess is right,

198
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,720
this should be a letter from Shi Hun to Madam Xu.

199
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:06,980
They are both in the manor.

200
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,980
Why did they need to date

201
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,700
in such a vague way?

202
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,240
What did you do to them?

203
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,070
How would I know what happened?

204
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,980
Maybe they had an affair,

205
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,460
and dated secretly by a secret letter.

206
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,340
However, they ran into my crazy brother,

207
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,400
and he killed them.

208
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,210
Imposing a charge on a lunatic,

209
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,480
it's really safer.

210
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,800
But seven years ago,

211
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,550
when Madam Wang died,

212
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,100
Guo Kun wasn't in the manor.

213
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,300
Young Master Liu in the town can prove that

214
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,560
he wasn't there at all.

215
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,090
Guo Kun was not there when Madam Wang died.

216
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,050
But it can't prove that

217
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,460
he didn't kill Madam Xu.

218
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,300
You’re so stubborn.

219
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,270
Lord Guo,

220
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,060
can you recognize these two residues

221
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,120
of herb medicines?

222
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,840
One of these is the medicine

223
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,140
that Kun usually takes to heal the madness.

224
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:55,870
And this one,

225
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,990
I found it from the trash.

226
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,010
I've shown it to the doctor.

227
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,040
These two medicines are totally different.

228
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,860
Yesterday's medicine was clearly not right.

229
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,590
It'll make him more irritated.

230
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,890
That's why Guo Kun came out last night to scare people.

231
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,550
This is all because you want Guo Kun
to be the scapegoat.

232
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,840
Am I right, Lord Guo?

233
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,090
Lord Guo.

234
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,140
Obviously, Shi Hun stayed

235
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,300
in the Cailian Manor for a long time.

236
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,670
The Corpse Fragrant Flower Tomb in the lotus pond

237
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,870
is the best proof.

238
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,860
But you said he only stayed for three days.

239
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,060
If you are not guilty,

240
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,200
why did you lie for such a trivial matter?

241
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,280
Corpse Fragrant Flower Tomb?

242
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,060
I don't know what you're talking about.

243
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,570
Don't you know the corpses
in the mass grave outside the city

244
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,570
that has been missing for ten years?

245
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,320
Do you want me to help you recall it?

246
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,500
Or ask someone to dig up the lotus pond and take a look?

247
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,400
Even a fool

248
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,300
can't learn from anyone he sees.

249
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:02,570
He must be learning from the closest person.

250
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,130
So what Guo Kun said

251
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,430
is not nonsense at all.

252
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,580
He is imitating what you said

253
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,040
on the night of the murder.

254
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,190
-Uncle. -You can't escape!

255
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,820
-You can’t.
-Uncle.

256

Let's go.

257
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,340
Where can you run to?

258
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,150
The palm that Guo Kun hit Fang Duobing

259
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,680
was the Bagua Xingyi Palm
you hit Shi Hun with.

260
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,890
Why did Madam Xu die in the end,

261
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,020
instead of leaving?

262
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,170
Where did Shi Hun go after that?

263
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:27,760
Lord Guo,

264
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,620
don’t you want to tell me?

265
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,550
If you don’t,

266
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,560
let me speak for you.

267
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,900
I guess it's like this.

268
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,660
Ten years ago,

269
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,220
Lion Soul accidentally fell into your lotus pond,

270
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,620
and was saved by Madam Xu.

271
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,690
Lion Soul suffered a lot

272
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,760
because of his appearance.

273
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,270
That's why he's timid and self-abased.

274
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,950
But Madam Xu was kind-hearted

275
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,770
and didn't treat him as a monster.

276
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,030
She took him in to stay.

277
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,110
That's why they fell in love.

278
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,160
All right.

279
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:02,850
Thank you.

280
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,840
You were suspicious.

281
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,450
You must had been harsh on Madam.

282
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,880
So Shi Hun asked her to elope.

283

That's why you killed them in anger.

00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,400
That night,

288
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,630
Guo Kun witnessed the whole process of your murder.

289
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,610
Guo Kun memorized your move to Shi Hun,

290
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,790
and saw how you carried and hid the bodies.

291
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,420
That's why he runs around

all his actions

295
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,130
were just an imitation of your murder.

296
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,740
You were afraid of being exposed,

297
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,940
so you played along

298
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,460
and put the blame on your

343
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,790
So you killed them for that?

344
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,700
I killed that Six Fingers Monster

345
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,300
in a rage.

346
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,540
As for that bitch,

347
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,640
she was too flustered

348
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,780
and drowned herself in the pool.

349
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,350
But that bitch deserves to die, too.

350
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,280
Lotus is noble.

351
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,900
That bitch is a slut

352
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,300
who cheated on me.

353
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,110
She doesn't deserve to love the lotus.

354
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,250
She deserved to die.

355
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,780
Who are you to decide others' life and death

356
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,840
with your own will?

357
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,620
You always say you love Lotus.

358
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,620
Do you deserve it?

359
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:21,980
One more thing.

360
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,280
Where are the body and relics of Shi Hun?

361
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,500
That monster

362
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,260
was thrown into the pool to be fertilizer.

363
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:39,920
Okay.

364
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,900
You all go into the water

365
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,260
and get all the corpses.

366
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,720
We must find the body with six fingers

367
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,450
even if we have to turn over
the bottom of the pond.

368
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,180
Go into the water.

369
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,860
Lotus is noble,

370
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,940
but it got haunted.

371
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,570
Found it.

372
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,240
There's nothing here.

373
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,970
Didn't you say Shi Hun
never leaves his things behind?

374
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,650
The body has been soaked in water
for so many years.

375
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,450
Even if he has any relic with him,

376
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,060
it would have been rotten.

377
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,280
The Kun's skin bag of Shi Hun
is a treasure of Tianshan.

378
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,200
It won't rot.

379
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,600
Since he's here, but the thing is not,

380
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,200
it must still be somewhere
in Cailian Manor.

381
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,940
We will go find it.

382
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,770
Where are you going?

383
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:55,250
Where are you going?

384
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,920
We've searched the whole Cailian Manor,
but still couldn't find it.

385
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,860
Take them back to Baichuan Court first.

386
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,750
As for Shi Hun,

387
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,630
I will come up with another way.

388
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,290
Let's go.

389
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,580
You killed Madam Xu,

390
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,920
because she wanted to leave with Shi Hun.

391
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,700
But why did you kill

392
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,570
the second and the third?

393
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,010
I killed them anyway.

394
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,790
Why?

395
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,820
Is it important?

396
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,110
Beef with coriander.

397
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,090
I'm really sorry, guests.

398
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,170
Corianders is sold out today.

399
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,920
I've replace it with celery.

400
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,340
I just bought some

401
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,900
famous coriander meat cakes.

402
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,010
Would you like to try one?

403
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:11,750
I have two.

404
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,980
Come on.

405
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,240
Thank you. No need.

406
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,680
My Lady,

407
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,840
I brought you the wedding shoes

408
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,800
embroidered by Old Madam.

409
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:26,210
But why did the wedding become a funeral?

410
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,590
My lady.

411
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,450
My lady.

412
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,830
My condolences.

413
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,110
May I ask

414
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:39,470
why does your lady use plain colors?

415
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,940
Does she not like other colors?

416
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,600
Because...

417
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,170
Because my lady has slight color-blindness.

418
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,590
She can't distinguish many colors.

419
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,180
So she only used things with plain colors.

420
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,800
My lady

421
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,590
doesn't allow us to tell anyone.

422
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,950
No, turn around.

423
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,210
[Cailian Manor]

424
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:02,930
Let's go.

425
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,130
Hurry up!

426
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,670
Run!

427
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,040
Let's go. Hurry.

428
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:09,830
Hurry up.

429
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,430
Young Master Guo.

430
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,900
Young Master Guo.

431
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,910
Where are you going in such a hurry?

432
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,040
Li Lianhua.

433
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,180
Didn't you leave?

434
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,860
I-I did leave.

435
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,800
But on the way,

436
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,330
I didn't figure out a question.

437
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,390
So I came back to ask Young Master Guo.

438
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,600
The lady from Weiyuan Escort Agency

439
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,930
knew that the pomegranate dress

440
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,750
in Cailian Manor is an ominous thing.

441
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,800
So she hates wearing this wedding dress.

442
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,190
Then why did she suddenly come back

443
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,150
and wear this wedding dress when she died?

444
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,280
I don't understand.

445
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,700
Young Master Guo.

446
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,860
The same purple pomegranate skirt.

447
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,450
I found it in your room.

448
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:49,690
Can you explain it?

449
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,220
Young Master Guo,

450
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,880
If you're too shy to speak.

451
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,160
Let me speak for you.

452
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:05,720
I

453
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,980
asked the maid of the bride.

454
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,760
Her lady was born with slight colorblindness

455
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,820
and thin-skinned.

456
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,250
She wouldn't let others know
her natural flaws.

457
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,220
She only told her future husband about that,

458
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,060
which is you, Young Master Guo.

459
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,130
I heard from the servant that

460
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,980
Young Master Guo wanted to prepare

461
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,860
a new wedding dress for her.

462
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,740
However, this wedding dress

463
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,050
has never seen by anyone

464
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,650
except the maid of the bride.

465
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,900
Young Master Guo said

466
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,530
you will surprise everyone
on the wedding day.

467
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,390
But a few days before the wedding,

468
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:34,040
the bride suddenly lost her wedding shoes.

469
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,140
So she had to ask her maid to go back

470
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,400
to her parent's home to get another pair.

471
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,870
After the maid left,

472
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,250
you secretly replaced the wedding dress

473
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,650
with a brown and purple pomegranate dress.

474
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,540
The bride who can't distinguish colors

475
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,540
put on this brown pomegranate dress

476
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:14,970
when she was trying it on.

477
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,670
Why is this pair of red shoes found in your room

478
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,060
are exactly the same with that pair

479
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,370
the maid got back.

480
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,380
Because the so-called lost of the red shoes

481
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,900
is what you did on purpose.

482
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,770
You wanted to send away
the maid of the bride

483
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,970
so that she can't distinguish colors.

484
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:40,010
I thought I had deceived you.

485
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,590
I didn't expect you to come back

486
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,470
and found out all of this.

487
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,200
Not only this.

488
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:50,320
I guess the reason

489
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,140
why Young Master Guo did all this

490
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,600
is for Miss Lyurou, right?

491
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,940
Young Master Guo loves Miss Lyurou.

492
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,260
But Lord Guo insisted you

493
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,810
to marry the daughter
of Weiyuan Escort Agency.

494
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,900
But Young Master Guo, you dare not resist.

495
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,950
So you set up a trap to kill your bride.

496
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,310
Do you remember?

497
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,710
That day at Cuihua Restaurant,

498
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:18,040
Miss Lyurou pretended to be
unfamiliar with you.

499
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,970
But she knows your taste very well.

500
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:23,180
She switched the coriander on your desk quietly.

501
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,680
Am I right, Miss Lyurou?

502
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,070
Lyurou.

503
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,020
We always thought

504
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,940
those three people were killed by the same person.

505
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,650
After we figured out the first case,

506
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:43,960
we mistook the other two murders

507
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,700
that seems to be done in the same way

508
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,220
were all committed by Lord Guo.

509
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,680
Actually, this is also a misunderstanding.

510
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,360
Young Master Guo,

511
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,740
you did this on purpose, didn't you?

512
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,620
It's all my fault, Lyurou.

513
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,680
It's not his fault.

514
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,020
I forced him to marry me.

515
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,110
Arrest me if you want.

516
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,230
Please let him go.

517
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,290
Get up!

518
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:04,920
Lyurou.

519
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,420
I'll take the responsibility.

520
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,380
I did kill him.

521
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,730
It has nothing to do with Lyurou.

522
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,570
Why are you being lovey-dovey here?

523
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,570
The people you killed are innocent.

524
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,060
I killed the princess
of Weiyuan Escort Agency

525
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,910
not only because I love Lyurou,

526
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,570
but also because

527
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,310
I hate him, Guo Qian.

528
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,690
I hate everything he arranged for me,

529
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:28,820
and controlling me.

530
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,860
My father Guo Qian...

531
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:31,930
He likes to

532
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,330
put everything

533
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,650
under his control.

534
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,870
He can't tolerate others

535
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,260
to disobey him.

536
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,170
My mother

537
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,490
was forced to death by him.

538
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,060
And I...

539
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,010
And I was almost suffocated by him.

540
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:49,820
So,

541
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,780
I will never give in
to his control and oppression.

542
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,240
Never.

543
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,810
Darling Guo.

544
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:01,190
do you think

545
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,540
Madam Xu had an affair with Shi Hun?

546
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,200
In fact, Madam Xu

547
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,660
was tortured and abused by Guo Kun.

548
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,950
This was all seen by Shi Hun.

549
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,150
He wanted to save her.

550
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,390
But they failed

551
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,600
and killed by Guo Qian.

552
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,210
But it's good.

553
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,460
When I saw how Madam Xu
in the pomegranate dress

554
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,990
fell into the lotus pond
and drowned to death,

555
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,650
I found a good way

556
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,930
to kill.

557
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,340
A good way to kill.

558
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,890
So the mirror in the house

559
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,340
and the mirror stone outside

560
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,300
were also designed by you, right?

561
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,190
You also missed

562
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,180
the Shoushan Stone and stumbling block.

563
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,590
They were arranged by me on purpose.

564
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,890
I also found that Feng Shui master.

565
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,970
It's all Guo Qian's fault for being stupid.

566
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,900
He believes everything so easily.

567
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,270
Young Master Guo,

568
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,160
you killed your newlywed wife

569
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,040
just to get rid of your father's control.

570
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,030
But your father's second wife

571
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,030
has nothing to do with this.

572
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,780
Why did you kill her?

573
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,450
So what?

574
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,020
He forced my mother to die

575
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,080
and ruined my life.

576
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,460
Do you think I'll let him live a happy life?

577
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,660
I will not let him have

578
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,820
anything he wants.

579
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,880
Young Master Guo,

580
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,170
Your father already knew

581
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,620
everything you did.

582
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,980
He didn't turn you in

583
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,350
only because

584
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,410
he still want to protect his son.

585
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,370
Ridiculous.

586
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,500
Even if he turns me in,

587
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,980
he will still be punished.

588
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,480
He just planned the last step

589
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,710
that I can get him out.

590
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,050
But he never thought

591
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,580
I wanted him to die.

592
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,640
There are thousands of ways

593
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,860
to break free from the control
of a despicable person.

594
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,170
Why did you choose to become

595
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,510
a more despicable person?

596
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,640
If you want revenge,

597
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:59,900
why did you involve innocent people in this

598
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,900
to fill your hatred?

599
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,540
You haven't experienced my life

600
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,200
and my pain.

601
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:04,940
You have no right to lecture me.

602
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,620
I know

603
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,000
you want to find

604
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,960
what Shi Hun left back then.

605
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,260
Back then, Shi Hun

606
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:18,620
hid all his belongings

607
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,020
in a place, in order not to

608
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,610
expose himself as the remnant

609
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:22,810
of Jinyuan Alliance.

610
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:25,050
And only I know this place.

611
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:27,540
If you let me go,

612
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:29,220
I'll tell you.

613
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:30,820
Darling Guo,

614
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,100
I hate people threatening me the most in my life.

615
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,250
If you don't tell me,

616
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,140
I'll break your neck.

617
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:51,890
Okay.

618
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,730
As long as you let go of me,

619
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,140
I'll tell you where it is.

620
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,350
Let's go!

621
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,490
Stop!

622
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,510
Fabric of the Jinyuan Alliance.

623
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,130
This is the handwriting of Shi Hun.

624
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,630
Lion Soul hasn't recovered,

625
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,340
and the master's order
hasn't been implemented.

626
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,540
I dare not neglect it.

627
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:33,850
Therefore, I kept the body of Shan Gudao
in the herb coffin

628
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,150
to keep it intact.

629
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:39,580
It is hidden under the willow tree
of the south gate of Cailian Manor.

630
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:42,570
Senior.

631
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,940
I finally found you.

632
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:05,250
I told you,

633
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,000
no one can escape from me.

634
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,720
I tied those two up.

635
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,710
Li Lianhua, what are you doing?

636
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,030
Whose tomb is this?

637
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,540
Fang Duobing.

638
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,130
This

639
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,540
is the remains of your uncle Shan Gudan.

640
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:30,260
Actually, he is who we've been looking for.

641
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,060
Come.

642
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,300
Come and pay your respects to your uncle.

643
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,400
It's you.

644
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,530
Are the flowers pretty?

645
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,000
You want to kill me?

646
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,070
Are you willing to do that?

647
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,220
Besides,

648
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,110
you are no match for me.

649
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,790
What else do you want?

650
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,060
I've killed the master for you.

651
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,260
For the past ten years,

652
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,070
I've drawn the ground as a prison.

653
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,270
I have nothing now.

654
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,420
You still have one thing.

655
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,580
You have me.

656
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,950
Mr. Yun, long time no see.

657
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:04,830
Do you miss me?

658
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,840
Don't lie to yourself.

659
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,240
From ten years ago,

660
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:22,060
you had no resistance to me.

661
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:35,150
Looking at you now,

662
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:36,989
I feel sorry for you.

663
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:44,050
You have to live well for me.

664
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,870
I'm here to ask you for a favor.

665
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:56,560
What is it?

666
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:59,139
I want the maps of 188 prisons.

667
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:06,139
Di Feisheng is back.

668
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,020
Are you planning for him again?

669
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,020
Yes.

670
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:11,980
All Sects in the martial world

671
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,110
have your admirers.

672
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,080
I'm no different from them.

673
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:18,670
We are only tools for your ambition
of ruling the martial world.

674
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:23,900
Mr. Yun,

675
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,090
I trust you the most.

676
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:30,950
I'm not ruling the martial world for myself.

677
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,120
Ruling the martial world is boring.

678
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,230
But some people

679
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,840
are destined to rule the martial world.

680
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:44,940
Don’t worry.

681
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,900
When my great cause is achieved,

682
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:51,180
you will

683
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:54,140
have your place beside me.

684
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,580
I-I can't get all of them.

685
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:01,910
They will be wary of me.

686
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,320
Be patient.

687
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:07,810
Let's take our time.

688
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,960
You know my uncle?

689
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,270
We are old friends.

690
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,140
Your uncle once said

691
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,420
if he dies,

692
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,900
he wants to be burried in Yunyin Mountain
where he studied

693
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,560
I just want to fulfill
my old friend's last wish.

694
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,880
Go to Yunyin Mountain with me to bury him.

695
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,540
It's always good

696
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,370
to have

697
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,860
[Tomb of Shan Gudao]

698
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,170
Senior,

699
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:43,800
you

700
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,510
Soon,

701
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,290
I will come and accompany you.

702
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:00,470
Li Lianhua,

703
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,270
can you tell me

704
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:06,270
the past of my master and my uncle?

705
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,590
You can bury my uncle

706
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,180
by his master's tomb.

707
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,200
You must know their past.

708
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,540
Although they are my family and grandmaster,

709
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,200
but I can only hear their story

710
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,500
from the rumors,

711
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,010
I really don't know anything about it.

712
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:25,760
Tell me about it.

713
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:35,410
Shan Gudao was only a teenager back then.

714
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,800
He barely lived on the street.

715
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,750
But he found an four-year-old orphan.

716
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,380
Li Xiangyi,

717
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,100
you must be hungry.

718
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:51,640
Eat up.

719
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,030
You too.

720
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:57,630
I'm not hungry.

721
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:58,750
Eat up.

722
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,150
It's him. What are you doing?

723
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:07,980
Don't be afraid.

724
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,580
Beat him!

725
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,190
If Master Qi Mushan

726
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,280
didn't adopt them,

727
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:17,210
I wonder how long they can live.

728
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:20,870
My master must be grateful to uncle.

729
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:25,200
Li Xiangyi

730
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:28,050
should be grateful.

731
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,250
But he was born

732
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,100
rebellious

733
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:34,880
and always goes his own way.

734
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,390
Since he was a kid,

735
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,250
his senior has been treating him well.

736
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,580
But when he grew up,

737
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,470
he became more arrogant

738
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,390
and pissed his senior off,

739
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,750
which broke his heart.

740
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,220
Best in the martial world?

741
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,710
Master of the Sigu Sect?

742
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,690
He's just

743
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,030
a heartless person.

744
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,850
What are you talking about?

745
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,240
My master is not that kind of person.

746
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,230
Without him,

747
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,210
I would be

748
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,840
a cripple sitting on a chair.

749
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,260
When I was a kid, everyone laughed at me
and bullied me.

750
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,930
Only my master encouraged me
to practice martial arts.

751
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,260
He treated me like this,

752
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,240
how could he be cold to his senior?

753
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,640
Besides, everyone knows

754
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,290
he fought the Jinyuan Alliance

755
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:15,220
because of the death of Shan Gudao.

756
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,920
They should be very close.

757
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,500
Don't talk nonsense.

758
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,010
[Sigu Sect]

759
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,760
Today, Sigu Sect is established.

760
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,420
Red silk was lifted

761
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,840
to bring good luck.

762
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:38,530
Junior,

763
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,580
You're the master today now.

764
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,810
Why are you still acting like a child?

765
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:44,610
Senior, you're also the master.

766
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:46,460
From now on, we will

767
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,820
uphold the martial world together.

768
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,390
Good.

769
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:59,020
With me and the Sigu Sect,

770
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:03,150
there will be no evil in the martial world.

771
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:08,980
We will follow the master to the death!

772
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:11,880
All members of the Sigu Sect, listen up!

773
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,020
Destroy the Jinyuan Alliance with me!

774
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,780
Destroy the Jinyuan Alliance!

775
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,510
Destroy the Jinyuan Alliance!

776
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,190
Let's go.

777
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,490
Yes.

778
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,200
No, Senior.

779
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:24,630
Junior,

780
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:26,500
what do you mean?

781
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,420
The master's order is here.

782
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,500
Sigu Sect can't act rashly

783
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,260
without my order.

784
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,820
The Jinyuan Alliance has done many evils,

785
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,420
why can't we eliminate them?

786
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:42,760
One year ago,

787
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,930
Sigu Sect destroyed the cult in Mobei.

788
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,650
Our vitality is greatly damaged.

789
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:50,050
Now the Jinyuan Alliance is more powerful.

790
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,920
I've made a treaty of peace
with Di Feisheng.

791
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:54,500
We won't interfere with each other

792
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,960
or draw a war in five years.

793
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,900
The martial world has been
turbulent for too long.

794
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,630
It's rare to have peace for five years.

795
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,090
Why do you want to break it?

796
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,460
You signed such an important agreement

797
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,800
without telling me?

798
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,720
That's the best choice.

799
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:11,440
Fine.

800
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,200
I don't need our people to help me.

801
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,500
The royal court has agreed to help me.

802
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:20,090
Stamp your master's seal

803
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,810
[To Shan Gudao]

804
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,410
on this secret letter.

805
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,760
Tomorrow, the royal court
will send a great army

806
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,620
to wipe out the Jinyuan Alliance.

807
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:27,680
Senior,

808
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:30,140
are you confused?

809
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,340
What?

810
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,780
If Sigu Sect is controlled
by the royal court,

811
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:37,440
it's no different from
the government offices.

812
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,500
Don't forget that

813
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,450
when we founded Sigu Sect,

814
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,760
we wanted an independent place
in the martial world

815
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,240
with absolutely justice.

816
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:47,740
Senior,

817
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,880
don't forget your original intention.

818
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,180
You're the one who's forgotten, not me.

819
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:55,130
You said

820
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,980
to uphold the martial world with me.

821
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,960
Now the Jinyuan Alliance has done many evils,

822
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,710
but you acted like a coward

823
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:00,470
and ignored them.

824
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,980
And you even signed an agreement with them

825
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,580
and kept all of us in the dark.

826
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:05,080
It's settled.

827
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:06,920
No more discussion.

828
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:10,280
Xiangyi,

829
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,040
Sigu Sect was established by us together.

830
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,200
You're not the dictator of it.

831
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,540
As long as it's beneficial to Sigu Sect,

832
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,740
what's wrong with being a dictator?

833
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:25,990
Xiangyi,

834
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:28,900
do you think

835
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,170
what you said is always right

836
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:32,970
and the truth?

837
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,850
Do you think Sigu Sect can't be without you?

838
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:36,740
Yes.

839
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:43,870
It has been proved over the years.

840
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:45,900
Exactly.

841
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:51,030
Sigu Sect can exist without anyone,

842
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,830
but not Li Xiangyi,

843
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:55,570
it can't.
