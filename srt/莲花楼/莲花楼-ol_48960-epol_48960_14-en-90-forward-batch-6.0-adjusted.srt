Li Lianhua,

6
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:48,020
why don't you tell me

7
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,180
more about my master?

8
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,180
You said too little last time.

9
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:50,979
I want to know more.

10
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:52,370
Don't you think your body feels hot

11

and your chest feels tight?

12
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:54,850
No.

13
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,250
The key to Suzhou Kuai is silence.

14
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,259
Most importantly, talk less and be quiet.

15
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:01,910
If you talk, your blood will be circulated,

16
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,660
and boom! You'll explode like a firecracker.

17
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,860
Do what you will with that information.

I heard that the owner of Yuanbao Villa,

24

He has a lot of money.

25
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,010
Even someone like this has an incurable sickness

26
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,380
that needs the attention of a miracle physician.

27
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,780

Don't talk.

You're asking me where I went, right?

33

It's time to depart.

34
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,540
You may have

35

36
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,740
But it can only temporarily suppress the Gang Qi.

37
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,350
To eliminate all of Di Feisheng's internal power,

38
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,880
we need something extremely cold as a medium.

39
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,550
Currently, I can only think of

40
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,810
using the opal skull from Yuanbao Villa.

41
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:16,630
No need to reconsider.

Let's go to Yuanbao Villa.

44
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,430
Are you afraid that the owner of the villa won't lend it to you?

45
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,430
Not a problem.

46
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,380
Jin Mantang is offering a lot of money to hire a physician.

47
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,780

49

50
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,090
Are you afraid my medical skills will be exposed?

51
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:40,500
Yes?

52
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,000
Look, Fang Xiaobao.

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,160
You still don't know me well after all this time.

54

So you're afraid that Yuanbao Villa

63

is too close to Tianji Hall,

64

and they might take you back, right?

65

77
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,170
you've done so much for the Jinyuan Alliance.

78
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,170
Even if my Lord knows about the past,

79
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,940
he won't blame you.

80
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,390

just to make him happy.

82

If he doesn't care about the Jinyuan Alliance,

83
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,320
why should I care?

84

89

How can I tolerate having other women by his side?

But it doesn't matter.

99
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,560
I will give him the whole martial world.

100
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,930
By then,

101

Then, we will get the searing karmic fire.

00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,830
This is my assistant.

173
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,070
What a coincidence.

174
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,380
A few miracle physicians

175
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,310
happen to be in the villa right now.

176
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,340
You can have tea with them

177
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,310
and discuss medicine together.

178
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,770
Okay, thank you.

179
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,620
Please come in.

180
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,420
I often heard that Master Jin Mantang has many treasures.

181
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,300
He's always ranked top ten in the list of rich men.

182
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,820
Now that I'm here,

183
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,760
I can say that he lives up to his reputation.

184
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,690
You're too kind.

185
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,190
Stop!

186
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,680
Physician Guan.

187
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,750
His tongue is pale

188
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,980
and he suffers from vomiting and diarrhea.

189
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,200
It's clearly a case of spleen and stomach flu.

190
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,700
Let me give you some moxibustion.

191
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,700
You'll feel better in no time.

192
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,600
Physician Guan.

193
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,200
I'm really fine now.

194
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,810
You have been giving me moxibustion since yesterday.

195
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,290
I'm about to be cooked.

196
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,220
Usually, people beg me to treat them.

197
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,500
[The Elusive Physician - Gongyang Wumen]

198
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,710
But they have no chance.

199
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,020
I'm in a good mood today.

200
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,150
You look pale

201
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,590
and your breathing is weak.

202
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,540
I thought there must be air obstruction in your organs.

203
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,800
So I took the initiative to take your pulse from a distance.

204
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,440
I didn't expect your assistant to be so ignorant.

205
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,880
I see, you're the elusive physician,

206
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,460
senior Gongyang Wumen.

207
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,700
Excuse me for the unruly behaviour.

208
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,180
I'm Li Lianhua.

209
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,610
I was caught off guard just now.

210
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,470
Please forgive me.

211
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,020
Li Lianhua?

212
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,340
You are the legendary

213
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,060
physician who can revive the dead

214
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,520
and the owner of the Lotus Tower, Li Lianhua?

215
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,500
You look quite ordinary.

216
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,180
I just know a little about medicines.

217
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,540
This is Guan Hemeng, known as the

218
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,520
Swallow Needle in the martial world.

219
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,030
So you are Guan.

220
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:42,050
I've never seen a medical skill that could bring back the dead.

221
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:42,710
Li Lianhua.

222
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,160
Let's have a competition.

223
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,160
We'll see who's better at medicine.

224
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,410
We'll... treat him!

225
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,450
Where did the mute come from?

226
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,160
So rude.

227
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,350
Little mute.

228
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,990
Are you Physician Li's assistant?

229
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,210
He hasn't made a sound yet.

230
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,740
It's none of your business.

231
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,360
Why does a mute have so much to say?

232
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,190
I don't understand what you're gesturing.

233
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,350
Silence,

234
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,060
and grace.

235
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,250
Guan, don't be angry.

236
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,210
He is just my assistant.

237
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,370
He's new in the martial world and doesn't know the rules.

238
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,630
Don't take it to heart.

239
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,970
When I'm free,

240
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,760
I'll definitely come to consult you.

241
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,090
Physician Li is indeed gentle and polite.

242
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,250
But you little follower

243
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,470
needs some discipline.

244
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,460
You're right.

245
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,340
Don't mind him.

246
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,000
It doesn't matter.

247
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,710
This is the physician even the King of Hell fears,

248
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,890

[The ghost-feared Physician, Jian Lingxiao]

250
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,540
There's nothing wrong with your throat.

251
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,650
It's just that there's a wave

252
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,980
of Gang Qi currently suppressed in his body.

253
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,070
Since it's not an illness, it can't be cured.

254
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,400
But you should talk more

255
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,580
to help you get rid of some Gang Qi.

256
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,250
You old fox!

257
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:07,980

259
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,620
So he's not a mute.

260
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,060
What a pity.

261
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,150
I'll get even with you later.

262
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,130
It's such an honor to have so many miracle physicians

[Master of the Villa, Jin Mantang]

264

00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,230
Are you Jin Mantang?

266
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,340
Yes, I am.

267
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,130
I heard that you are seriously ill.

268
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,980
That's why you're recruiting famous physicians.

269
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,300
But looking at you now,

270
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,980
your voice is strong and clear,

271
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,350
and your face radiant and healthy.

272
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,210
It doesn't look like you're sick.

273
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,680
To be honest,

274
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,460
I invited you here

275
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,010
for another favor.

276
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,560
These are the letters I received

277
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:57,880
in the past month.

278
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,380
These letters all demand

279
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,190
that Master Jin surrender

280
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,020
all the assets of Yuanbao Villa.

281
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:05,880
Otherwise,

282
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,220
he will be killed.

283
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,610
Who sent these blackmail letters?

284
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:11,540
How outrageous.

285
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,330
Despite investigations, I have no clue.

286
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,040
Money is just a material possession.

287
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,440
To me,

288
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,420
it's not that important.

289
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,900
It's just that the family business was passed down by my ancestors.

290
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,960
How can I possibly surrender it

291
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,560
to those despicable people?

292
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,920
Now, my villa's security

293
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,180
has been reinforced.

294
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:33,280
It's not easy to break in.

295
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,270
But it's hard to guard against hidden arrows.

296
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,590
A servant died of poisoning recently.

297
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,470
As such, I can’t sleep or sleep well.

298
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,020
So you want us to come here

299
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,150
to keep watch of your daily life

300
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,300
and prevent any attempts at poisoning you.

301
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,160
And if something really happens,

302
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,500
there are so many great physicians here.

303
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,620
You can be at ease.

304
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,360
Right?

305
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,100
Exactly.

306
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,850
Who would have thought?

307
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,230
I'm a famous physician of the apricot forest.

308
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,470
But I was tricked here

309
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:09,020
to serve people to eat and sleep.

310
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,480
If you help me get through this,

311
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,910
I will reward you well.

312
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,830
You are really generous, Master Jin.

313
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,100
Looks like I didn't come here in vain.

314
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,380
Zongzheng Mingzhu?

315
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,010
Hello, you two.

316
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,280
How have you been?

317
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,490
Weren't you in prison?

318
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,360
I need to thank you.

319
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,590
If you hadn't meddled in Yu City

320
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,660
and framed me,

321
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,350
I'd still have been

322
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,650
an idle young master.

323
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,410
I would have never had the chance

324
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,020
to be the commander of the Supervision Bureau.

325
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,160
Everyone.

326
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:55,890
Don't panic.

327
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,650
Although I’m part of the martial world,

328
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,490
I once contributed to the court.

329
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,590
That's why I managed to get the help

330
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:06,120
of the Supervision Bureau and  Lord Zongzheng.

331
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,470
Arrest him!

332
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,000
Let's see who dares!

333
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,540
Who are you to arrest him?

334
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,660
Li Lianhua

335
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,390
is a con artist.

336
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,150
And murders happened everywhere he went.

337
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,880
He is very suspicious.

338
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,800
I think he's the one

339
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,800
blackmailing Master Jin.

340
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,430
Lord Zongzheng,

341
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,930
you're getting a little personal here.

342
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,470
I was always at the place of murder

343
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,690
because I was traveling with Detective Fang.

344
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,020
And I found the truth every time.

345
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,220
However,

346
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,180
the murderer took a turn

347
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,880
and cleared his name.

348
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,340
It's really interesting.

349
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:47,740
You...

350
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,690
The Supervision Bureau can only ask

351
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,690
about matters related to the court.

352
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,040
Li Lianhua is innocent.

353
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,340
He never gets involved with the court.

354
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,500
What does he have to do with the Supervision Bureau?

355
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,300
Don't you even care about the rule

356
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,430
set by the court and the martial world?

357
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:01,860
Okay.

358
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,610
I can't control Baichuan Court.

359
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,800
But this is Master Jin's villa.

360
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,300
Should we keep these

361
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,700
suspicious people here?

362
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,490
Master Jin.

363
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,740
Think carefully.

364
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:23,950
Forget it.

365
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,320
Stop arguing.

366
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,620
Fang Duobing.

367
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,650
The Supervision Bureau is deliberately against me.

368
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:30,850
Then I can only leave.

369
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,560
Although you, the young master of the Tianji Hall,

370
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,100
have some invincible mechanics,

371
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,180
it's all useless now.

372
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,060
Everyone.

373
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,000
See you.

374
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,070
Wait.

375
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,900
I think there must be some misunderstanding

376
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,860
between the two of you and Lord Zongzheng.

377
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,270
Since you are all my guests,

378
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,340
how can I neglect any of you?

379
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,090
Why don't you get along for now for my sake?

380
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,610
Harmony brings wealth, after all.

381
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,070
Actually, I've already prepared a banquet.

382
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,980
It's waiting for everyone to take a seat.

383
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,910
Lord Zongzheng,

384
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,100
what do you think?

385
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,349
[Yuanbao Villa]

386
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,619
Thank you for your hospitality.

387
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:20,980
You're welcome.

388
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,829
You said you wanted to talk to me.

389
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,579
Is it about setting up the mechanics?

390
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:26,240
Master Jin.

391
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,000
With my help,

392
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,220
I guarantee that not even a fly

393
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,460
can enter your room.

394
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,619
Outsiders can't harm you for sure.

395
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,830
Thank you, Young Master Fang.

396
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,830
It's my pleasure.

397
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,550
But I have a request.

398
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,040
Master Jin,

399
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,800
I want to borrow your opal skull.

400
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:45,610
What?

401
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,390
You want my opal skull?

402
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:50,680
This...

403
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:51,880
Master Jin.

404
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,060
Here's the thing.

405
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,440
We want to use the opal skull

406
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,040
for healing purposes.

407
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,790
It will be returned on the spot.

408
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,390
About borrowing...

409
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,360
Master Jin,

410
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,340
if it's not convenient,

411
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,620
we can leave now.

412
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,650
Goodbye.

413
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,010
Wait.

414
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,290
The opal skull is the treasure of my villa.

415
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,600
Since you want to borrow it,

416
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,360
you must show some sincerity.

417
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,220
If you can find the person

418
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,580
who intends to harm me,

419
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,380
borrowing the opal skull

420
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,120
will be no problem.

421
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,710
The mechanism is ready.

422
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,400
Master Jin.

423
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,470
This way.

424
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,460
This is the Thousand Bell Formation.

425
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,490
The only key to activating and deactivating

426
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,160
the formation is here in this room.

427
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,420
The formation has been activated.

428
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,180
As long as someone approaches this room,

429
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,240
they will be trapped by the sharp threads,

430
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,840
and the whole villa will be promptly informed.

431
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,100
This...

432
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,630
Someone broke into the formation so soon?

433
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,730
You are...

434
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,860
This is my goddaughter Zhiyu.

435
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,670
Godfather, I...

436
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,260
I was just passing by.

437
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,020
I didn't expect you to have guests here.

438
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,530
She is only 18

439
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,410
and rarely meets outsiders.

440
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,170
So, she's afraid of strangers.

441
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,570
Sorry for the confusion.

442
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,030
Go back now.

443
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,670
There is a formation here.

444
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,380
You can only enter with my permission from now on.

445
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,180
You may leave.

446
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,230
Let me untie you.

447
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,360
Your daughter is sick

448
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,320
and very weak.

449
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,690
She was born weak.

450
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,920
I've asked a physician to treat her.

451
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,450
I shan't bother you with it.

452
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,130
We'll talk about the opal skull after you have

453
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,530
captured the person who intends to harm me.

454
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:25,270
Master Jin.

455
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,940
He locked us out as soon as

456
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,930
I set up the formation for him.

457
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,400
It seems that I was too honest.

458
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,590
There are so many people guarding the Yuanbao Villa.

459
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,290
Now Zongzheng Mingzhu is here too.

460
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,090
If we want the opal skull,

461
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,870
we must help Jin Mantang with this matter.

462
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:51,710
Mr. Jian.

463
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,320
Gentlemen.

464
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,190
Mr. Jian.

465
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,030
So you live in this room.

466
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,780
I didn't expect

467
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,700
you to love flowers too.

468
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,050
I just like to use flowers as medicine.

469
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,380
You are also an expert in medicine.

470
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,860
You should know the value of these flowers.

471
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,190
Of course.

472
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,550
For example,

473
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,780
I often use this to relieve pain and bruises.

474
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,310
You mean the gelsemium?

475
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,410
The gelsemium is also called heartbreak grass.

476
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:25,670
How can it be consumed?

477
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,130
I brought it by accident

478
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,720
when I was picking coltsfoot.

479
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,250
I was about to throw it away.

480
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:32,730
I see.

481
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:36,920
All things in this world mutually reinforce and neutralize each other.

482
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,450
If I remembered correctly,

483
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,700
there should be a grass called

484
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:42,930
the smiling Guanyin.

485
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,440
Yes, that's right.

486
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,300
It can adjust the poison of the gelsemium

487
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,460
and maintain its medicinal value.

488
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,120
It works well after taking it.

489
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,370
Do you remember it?

490
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,090
I just remembered

491
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,420
we have something to do.

492
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:57,940
Mr. Jian,

493
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,860
we won't bother you any longer.

494
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,390
Go ahead.

495
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,770
Look at you.

496
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:08,900
You are quite bold.

497
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,530
You were boasting in front of an expert.

498
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,860
Aren't you afraid of being exposed?

499
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,320
I'm pretty thickskinned.

500
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,490
I'm not afraid.

501
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,900
You're full of nonsense.

502
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,680
Also, you lied and said I shouldn't make a sound.

503
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,150
So I pretended to be mute on our way here.

504
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,390
I didn't get even with you on that yet.

505
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,160
Silence is gold.

506
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,540
None of that excuse!

507
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,150
Don't think I can forgive you

508
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,400
just by getting the opal skull for me.

509
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,010
Listen.

510
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:29,870
Today, I...

511
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:34,260
I...

512
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,010

What did you do?

I told you to keep your voice down.

There are no other wounds.

605

It's the withered agave.

The poison of the withered agave

609
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,290
can cause nausea, suffocation,

and paralysis in the limbs.

611

But Dong Ling actually suffered a blunt injury to the back of his head

612
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,180
and died from excessive bleeding.

613
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,830
Could it be that Dong Ling was poisoned

614
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,220
and couldn't control his body,

615
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,280
so he hit the back of his head and died?

616
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,530
It seems so.

617
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:20,010
Was he the one who threatened Jin Mantang?

618
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,740
But...

619
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,700
Dong Ling the Jinling Sword had always been

620
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,160
a respectable figure in the martial world.

621
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,220
I've never heard of any conflict

622
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,220
between him and Jin Mantang either.

623
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,260
He doesn't look like a blackmailer.

624
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,080
Strange.

625
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:34,470
Did Dong Ling usually wrap himself up like this?

626
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,930
It's summer,

What's that?

632
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,150
It's a very rare disease.

633
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,010
The patient's skin

634
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,490
will gradually become like tree bark.

635
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,590
When the disease becomes severe,

636
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,050
the patient will be like a tree trunk

637
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,780
and develop root-like tumors.

638
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:06,970
The patient will look like a monster.

639
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:07,970
It's hard to cure.

640
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:10,260
The patient tends to die from pain.

The opal skull is missing!

00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,620
The opal skull is missing...

644
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,910
It seems that we found out why

645
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:34,140
Dong Ling came to the Villa.

646
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,550
Stop pretending.

647
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,160
Rumor has it that the opal skull can cure all diseases

648
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,570
and grant longevity.

649
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,730
It's hidden in this villa.

650
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,540
Everyone knows it.

651
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,470
I don't believe that the

652
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,090
famous physicians here

653
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,500
were never curious about the opal skull.

654
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,300
So Dong Ling came to borrow the opal skull

655
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,960
to cure his Tree Man Syndrome.

656
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,100
That's right.

657
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,840
Why don't you ask Housekeeper Jin?

658
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,470
Housekeeper Jin has never been in the martial world.

659
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,070
How did you recognize Dong Ling at first sight?

660
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:23,090
Yes.

661
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,100
I know him.

662
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,880
I could recognize him even if he turned into ashes.

663
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,230
Half a month ago,

664
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,790
Dong Ling came to see my master.

665
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,590
I listened to them from afar

666
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,140
and heard him asking for the opal skull.

667
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,320
What is an opal skull?

668
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,240
It's an extremely rare treasure.

669
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,300
I've only seen it a few times in my life.

670
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,820
How can he possibly have it?

671
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,110
Why don't we discuss it again?

672
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,510
-Cut the crap.
-No, no, no.

673
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:02,990
No.

674
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,410
Don't get me wrong.

675
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:05,620
What happened next?

676
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:06,770
A few days later,

677
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,630
Dong Ling took his Jinling Sword

678
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,490
and threatened us.

679
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,180
My poor master

680
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,120
had no choice.

681
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,540
So he hurt him with a sleeve arrow

682
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,080
and kicked him out.

683
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,550
Sleeve arrow?

684
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,280
That one just now?

685
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:27,740
Yes.

686
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:31,270
That's Master's self-defense weapon.

687
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:35,560
Then it's clear what happened.

688
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,300
Dong Ling failed to acquire the opal skull.

689
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:42,000
So he planned to steal it from the secret room.

690
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,930
But he was found out by Jin Mantang.

691
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:47,750
Dong Ling was highly skilled and strangled Jin Mantang to death.

692
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,680
While Jin Mantang was struggling,

693
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,040
he shot a poisoned sleeve arrow.

694
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,630
Both the witnesses and evidence are present.

695
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:58,620
The case is closed.

696
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,090
Guards.

697
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,710
Take the bodies out.

698
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:01,350
Yes.

699
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,080
Master.

700
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,370
From now on,

701
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,860
Yuanbao Villa will be handled by the Supervision Bureau.

702
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:24,340
Get rid of the rest of them.

703
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,610
This is not your home.

704
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,760
Why should I listen to you?

705
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,100
Master Jin asked for the court's help first.

706
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,500
It's only natural for the Supervision Bureau to handle this.

707
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,260
Take him away.

708
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:33,760
Wait.

709
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,110
No one here can leave.

710
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:40,950
Otherwise,

711
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,590
what will you do when the murderer escapes?

712
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,540
Dong Ling is dead.

713
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,690
Where else will we find the murderer?

714
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,150
Since it's a treasure robbery,

715
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,400
and both of them are dead,

716
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,100
let me ask you.

717
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,780
Where is the opal skull?

718
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,500
Don't forget.

719
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:00,260
The box was empty.

720
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,710
Did the content of the box

721
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,830
run away on its own?

722
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,300
Unless there is another explanation.

723
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,080
There was another person present.

724
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,230
The third person is the murderer.

725
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:22,239
The doors and windows are locked from the inside.

726
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,530
Young Master Fang's Thousand Bell Formation was active as well.

727
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,159
If there really were someone else,

728
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,560
how did he get out?

729
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:32,110
Commander Zongzheng is truly ahead of wisdom.

730
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,840
He won't understand that.

731
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,560
Let me translate it for you.

732
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,110
He's calling you stupid.

733
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:39,010
There are so many locked-room murders.

734
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:39,810
Don't forget.

735
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,860
The body of Yu Qiushuang that you innocently killed

736
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,460
was found in a place that didn't make sense too.

737
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,620
Don't be angry.

738
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,000
Besides,

739
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,100
don't you think something is strange?

740
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:51,610
What is it?

741
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:52,710
Shoes.

742
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,030
Shoes?

743
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,889
Jin Mantang's shoes.

744
00:34:58,219 --> 00:34:59,500
He only wore one shoe.

745
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,300
He must have dropped a shoe

746
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,910
in the midst of their fight.

747
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,600
What's so strange about that?

748
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,920
Jin Mantang

749
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,150
wore riding boots, not low-cut boots.

750
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,470
As you all know,

751
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,580
riding boots are hard to put on.

752
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,100
How could it fall from a fight?

753
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:17,820
Besides,

754
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,880
if Jin Mantang was strangled by Dong Ling,

755
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,990
he shot the sleeve arrow with his last breath,

756
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:26,370
and Dong Ling died from dodging the arrow,

757
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:29,170
that proves that both of them died at the same time.

758
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,730
I really want to ask you.

759
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,900
Who took off

760
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,260
Jin Mantang's other shoe?

761
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,260
Well...

762
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:41,630
I know.

763
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,820
There must be someone else

764
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,780
searching for the key to the secret room.

765
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,870
That's why he searched Jin Mantang's body.

766
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:48,670
That's right.

767
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,330
Housekeeper Jin.

768
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,550
May I ask,

769
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,160
when did your master

770
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:55,640
return to his room last night?

771
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,260
I remember

772
00:35:58,890 --> 00:35:59,970
it was at 7 p.m.

773
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,300
I sent Master back to his room to rest

774
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,000
and saw him activate the Thousand Bell Formation.

775
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:08,970
There was no one else in the room.

776
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:10,620
That’s strange.

777
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,420
I set the Thousand Bell Formation myself.

778
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,250
How did Dong Ling and this third person

779
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,580
go in and out of the room?

780
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:17,260
Look.

781
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:20,140
There are still many doubts to be addressed.

782
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:23,070
I'm afraid you need to find out more, Lord Zongzheng.

783
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,440
In this case,

784
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,570
we must find out the truth

785
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,060
to bring justice to the two victims.

786
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:38,340
[Yuanbao Villa]

787
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,590
Since there are still doubts,

788
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,170
let's talk about it.

789
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,330
I do have a question.

790
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,960
I heard that the owner of Lotus Tower

791
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,190
may have extraordinary medical skills,

792
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:01,620
but he never takes the initiative to treat patients.

793
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:05,750
As long as he has more than 50 taels of silver, he would never open business.

794
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,980
But why were you so eager to answer

795
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:12,140
the recruitment at the YuanBao Villa?

796
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,420
I happen to have less than 50 tales with me.

797
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,220
The Young Master Fang beside you

798
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:21,050
has erratic moments of muteness.

799
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,060
It's obviously caused by a fatal wave of Gang Qi.

800
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,460
I'm afraid you're also here

801
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,780
for the opal skull, just like Dong Ling.

802
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:33,670
Yes.

803
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,800
That's our intention.

804
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,310
But don't forget.

805
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,940
We refuted the silly theory

806
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,600
of the two killing each other.

807
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,750
Are we stupid enough to corner ourselves?

808
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,870
Who knows?

809
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,100
Maybe the two of you

810
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,540
hid the opal skull

811
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:50,590
somewhere in the villa after committing the crime.

812
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,010
Because I suddenly wanted to kick you out,

813
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,470
you found an excuse to stay

814
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,400
to retrieve the treasure later.

815
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,580
What you said

816
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,050
makes sense.

817
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,090
I

818
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:03,030
can't refute that.

819
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:03,910
Then, tell me

820
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:06,730
about your whereabouts last night.

821
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:07,750
Last night,

822
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,430
we were in our room

823
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:10,360
and never left.

824
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:12,110
We can testify for each other.

825
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,410
You two colluded with each other.

826
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,140
Your testimony doesn't count.

827
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,740
Besides, the bells outside Jin Mantang's room

828
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,530
were set by you.

829
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:22,390
If you wanted to go out,

830
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:25,010
the formation would naturally be silent.

831
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,470
You two are the most suspicious.

832
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:26,890
You...

833
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,260
Calm down.

834
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:30,490
Think about the Gang Qi.

835
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,490
I'm so angry.

836
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:34,420
Lord Zongzheng.

837
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,150
Speaking of suspicion,

838
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,960
what about yesterday?

839
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,500
Why did you avoid everyone

840
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:45,570
[Blessings and Prosperity]

841
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,660
and secretly met with Master Jin?

842
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,460
If I'm not mistaken,

843
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:45,710
you two

844
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,010
had a big conflict.

845
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,850
It's just some official matters.

846
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,370
What?

847
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,170
Do I have to explain to you?

848
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,770
No need.

849
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,570
However,

850
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,380
will you kill him

851
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,970
because of these official duties?

852
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:03,370
You...

853
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,230
Now that you mentioned it,

854
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,610
I remember something too.

855
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:11,820
Last night, I saw Physician Guan

856
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,620
sneaking out of his room with a bag in his hands.

857
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:16,450
I wonder what he was up to.

858
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:17,720
Me?

859
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,180
What's wrong with me going out?

860
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,880
If we're really talking about this,

861
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,700
I saw Mr. Gongyang

862
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:25,670
stalking Miss Zhiyu last night.

863
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:52,760
I just saw Miss Zhiyu leaving Housekeeper Jin's room

864
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,400
in the middle of the night.

865
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,840
I found it suspicious.

866
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,990
I just asked Zhiyu

867
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,640
to handle everyone's meals.

868
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,530
Mr. Jian.

869
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,170
You said you saw Guan going out in the middle of the night.

870
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,590
How did you know?

871
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,270
Were you just coincidentally

872
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:20,930
admiring the moon that night?

873
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:27,090
After listening for so long,

874
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,690
I finally understand.

875
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,170
Everyone here

876
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,950
has a little secret.

877
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,410
No use for pointless talking.

878
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:42,120
Since everyone is suspicious,

879
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,450
we'll just have to search the whole villa.

880
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:48,060
If the opal skull is found in one of your rooms,

881
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:50,430
the case will naturally be solved.

882
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:54,440
Yes.

883
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,530
Let's go somewhere else.

884
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:09,860
I think Zongzheng Mingzhu

885
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,230
is deliberately perfunctory

886
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,660
to close the case as soon as possible.

887
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,010
What is he trying to do?

888
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,660
Why does he have to get involved in the case of Yuanbao Villa?

889
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:19,460
He's certainly not here to investigate the case.

890
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,780
He is going to search the entire Yuanbao Villa.

891
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,700
Did he quarrel with Jin Mantang

892
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,900
because he wanted the opal skull as well?

893
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,180
Back in Yu City, I found that

894
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,120
the Jinyuan Alliance had something to do with him.

895
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,190
Could it be that the Jinyuan Alliance wants it?

896
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:35,340
But according to what you said,

897
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:36,830
would he be the murderer?

898
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,810
But with his intelligence,

899
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:41,100
he couldn't have entered my Thousand Bell Formation.

900
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:41,960
Give me the bag.

901
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,730
Otherwise, don't blame me for being rude.

902
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,360
Don't you dare!

903
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,970
I told you not to search!

904
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:49,770
What happened?

905
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:52,070
He won't let us search the bag.

906
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,220
Guan,

907
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:56,000
everyone in this villa has been searched.

908
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,620
Why can't you be searched?

909
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:58,960
If you are innocent,

910
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,870
just show it to others.

911
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:04,770
Guan,

912
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:07,250
can I have a look at this bag?

913
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:25,450
Everyone,

914
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:28,260
there's nothing hard in this bag.

915
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,660
You can rest assured now.

916
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,130
Let's go.

917
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:39,230
Li Lianhua.

918
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,710
Thank you so much.

919
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:41,800
You're welcome.

920
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:43,140
What's going on?

921
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:46,060
Why do you always side with him?

922
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,350
I'm helping you

923
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:49,970
so you won't be embarrassed.

924
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,780
Physician Li,

925
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:53,210
may I have a word with you?

926
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:56,650
Li Lianhua, may I have a word with you?

927
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:01,800
Let me show you something good.
