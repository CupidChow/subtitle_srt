YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Kissing myself thousands of times

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The most reluctant moment is that moment

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Live in the world, travel thousands of miles

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who doesn't wander around

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds and the moon on the edge of the world

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Live in the world, young youth

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The past is not drunk as a grudge

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The mortal world is like a dream

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Live in the world, travel thousands of miles

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Who doesn't wander around

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds and the moon on the edge of the world

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Live in the world, young youth

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The past is not drunk as a grudge

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The mortal world is like a dream

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Live in the world

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The past is not drunk as a grudge

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The mortal world is like a dream

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Live in the world, young youth

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The past is not drunk as a grudge

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The mortal world is like a dream

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The past is not drunk as a grudge

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The mortal world is like a dream

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The past is not drunk as a grudge

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The mortal world is like a dream

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The past is not drunk as a grudge

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The past is not drunk as a grudge

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The mortal world is like a dream

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The past is not drunk as a grudge

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The mortal world is like a dream

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The past is not drunk as a grudge

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Let's wait for the news for now

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Oh, the previous day, a case in Yucheng

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Met Di Feisheng

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I heard from Shishui

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
There was another person

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Li Lianhua

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Have you ever looked at this person's background?

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Li Lianhua

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Not good age, not good background

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Have a mysterious lotus tower

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The same work, medical skills are like gods

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
In the key of the case in Yucheng

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Made a lot of progress

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's just that this person is weak and timid

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I prefer to live in a group

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
There is no doubt in the world

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Nothing to worry about

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Old man

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You have a good view here

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Airy

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Is a good place

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Just climb the mountain every time

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Really tired

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Do you know

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I came this time

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I want to tell you a message

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
These ten years

59
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I have been looking for Shixiong

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But I didn't find the whereabouts of Shixiong

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But now

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I have found that Di Feisheng is still alive

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Follow him

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I can find Shixiong

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
By then

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I will bring Shixiong back

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
One buried on your left

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
One buried on your right

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Just like when I was young

70
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I was with you like that

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
When I was young

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You often taught me and Shixiong

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Take care of each other

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Ungrateful

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Unable to do

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I actually have no face at all

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Come to see you

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Except for coming here

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Where can I go

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Old man

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
When I find Shixiong

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
We don't go anywhere

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I will also be your student

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Not like when I was young

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Listen to your words

87
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I won't make you angry

88
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Correct

89
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I came here this time

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I still want to tell you something

91
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Shixiong

92
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
He has a nephew

93
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
He should be Shixiong's

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
A family member

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
This bad boy

96
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Good quality

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Indeed, I am like your fan

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Fiery

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
No one in the tomb

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
His love is hard to reach

101
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The heart is fast, I can't keep it

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's better to go freely like this

103
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Right

104
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
This friend

105
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Come and talk

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What's the matter

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You have been taking medicine for days

108
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
There is an unscrupulous trick

109
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
How do you know

110
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Because you are a shoe

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Not sick

112
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You are a high-end medicine

113
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Still know how to take shoes

114
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
This big shadow

115
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Is there anything strange

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
This is you

117
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I have been stuck in my hand recently

118
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I can't see it

119
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Something dirty on my hand recently

120
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
For example

121
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Dead person's miscalculation

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You

123
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You started early

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Cold hands and feet

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Black hair and blood

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
This should be a trick of evil spirits

127
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
If you go on like this

128
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Less than seven days

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Forget it

130
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I won't say it

131
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It depends on whether you want to live

132
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You can still live

133
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This is a god

134
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
No, a god

135
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Save me

136
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Save me

137
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You can also

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Need shoes and need speed

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You tell me about the Lan Dong area

140
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
This is a while ago

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I helped the big cow next door

142
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I have a golden flag

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Since then, my body is

144
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What golden flag

145
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Where did you get it

146
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
If you don't ask me to make it clear

147
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The ghost will be here

148
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I say I say

149
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Just a few days ago

150
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Seven sentences suddenly appeared on the mountain

151
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Headless body

152
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You are covered with gold and gold

153
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
My golden flag is from that seven

154
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Headless body

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
How big

156
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The boss said

157
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
These are all

158
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The treasure in the Fangji King's mansion a hundred years ago

159
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
God doctor

160
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I said it all

161
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You have to save me

162
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You have to save me, god doctor

163
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
understood

164
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Good system

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
This one looks like a high-end

166
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Actually a blood-sucking charm

167
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You stick it on your belly

168
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Close the window at night

169
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I will be cured tomorrow morning

170
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
God doctor

171
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm crazy or cold

172
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Both are good

173
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Go quickly

174
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Free

175
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Thank you god doctor

176
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Fangji King

177
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Putu Mountain

178
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Ask

179
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Not far from Putu Mountain in front

180
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Not far

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Then you help me point a way

182
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You find it yourself

183
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I have no time

184
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Where is the porridge outside the hospital

185
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's gone

186
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Eat porridge

187
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Come for you

188
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Thank you

189
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You slow down

190
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Sister, give me a bun

191
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Hey, this gentleman

192
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Our porridge is for the residents

193
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Your clothes are good material

194
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Obviously a rich family

195
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Still eating porridge here

196
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Hurry up

197
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
This

198
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Come on, this way

199
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Come on, the back

200
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Peking's roadside

201
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Isn't this the one

202
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
People who like to throw away the roadside

203
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Such a coincidence

204
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Who asked you

205
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Brother

206
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
We two meet

207
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
This meal is bad

208
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Just say goodbye

209
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Wait

210
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Of course you can

211
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You don't want to be with me

212
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I have a lot of disease

213
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I naturally won't force it

214
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
After all, we know each other

215
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
This meal must be eaten

216
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You go

217
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What to do

218
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm hungry

219
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm hungry too

220
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yes, it's a batch of dust

221
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yes yes yes

222
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I remember it's called a batch of dust

223
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Brother

224
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Have we met

225
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yes

226
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You mean this

227
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The beginning of the Puchu Mountain

228
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yes, it's Puchu Mountain

229
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
A few days ago

230
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Seven headless masters appeared in the mountains

231
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Not to mention

232
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
People who meet

233
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Look at it and move

234
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It is said that they are all thieves

235
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Want to hit something

236
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The idea of ​​a first-class grave

237
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Just died

238
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This first-class grave

239
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Silly

240
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm going

241
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Show you something

242
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:46,040
This is the

243
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,080
Finished

244
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,000
The 일이 split

245
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You say

246
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The spoonful of dust

247
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Is this sp deserve

248
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Haha

249
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Isn't this thing

250
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,360
What is yourwestern

251
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,000
You are still so stupid

252
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
How long earlier

253
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I said

254
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It would rain

255
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yes

256
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
The first subscriptions

257
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You already spent

258
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,160
I really don't want to see you again.

259
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,960
It's fine.

260
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,680
I'm a man of my word.

261
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,560
Take care.

262
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,600
Old man,

263
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,120
I want to ask you something.

264
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,640
Is there a black market

265
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,880
selling antique dolls nearby?

266
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,760
Ancient dolls?

267
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,000
Yes, in the mountains.

268
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,200
It's called Weizhuang.

269
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,760
Thank you.

270
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,560
Asking 우리는

271
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,720
to seek answers for this case.

272
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,240
It's a tea house area.

273
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,800
Why is there a bit of money here?

274
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,440
I'm here to shop.

275
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,520
Selling things?

276
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,160
In the dark,

277
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,360
I can still think about it.

278
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,680
The silver is the most valuable thing in the world.

279
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,120
You sold your building like this.

280
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,680
You...

281
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,520
Forget it.

282
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,400
I don't care.

283
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,640
Sijiazhaiyue, please forgive me.

284
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,280
I'm here for business.

285
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,080
According to the rules here,

286
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,080
the business fee for entry

287
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,320
must be 100 taels.

288
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,320
100 taels?

289
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,440
This man

290
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,920
doesn't do business for free, right?

291
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,000
I'll take care of the money

292
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,240
for the friend

293
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,400
who does business outside.

294
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,320
Look.

295
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,880
We're a team.

296
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,320
I can't just

297
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,920
watch you go out, right?

298
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,960
You're still kind.

299
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:02,880
Take it.

300
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,800
This is He Tianyu's

301
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,640
and our money, right?

302
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,520
Let's go.

303
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,280
Please.

304
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,480
You're too much.

305
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,360
How can you take my jade

306
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,480
to pay for your gold?

307
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,560
Think about it.

308
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,760
You only have

309
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,040
this jade pendant.

310
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,160
Anyway, you have to pay for it.

311
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,840
I don't need it if you pay for it.

312
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,760
It's more cost-effective

313
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,480
for two people to come in, right?

314
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,720
It makes sense.

315
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:32,760
Forget it.

316
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,440
I'll let you go this time.

317
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,800
Don't let me see you again.

318
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,200
Thank you.

319
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,200
Gloria, please.

320
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,440
Wow, this is nice.

321
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,720
How dare you have a meal with our Shihu Shuang Sha?

322
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,120
Zhang Qing Shi, why are you so arrogant?

323
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,360
Master Wei is here to attend the banquet.

324
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,960
He has to come here to eat.

325
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,280
I don't think you deserve it.

326
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,400
Qing, we are guests.

327
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,840
Let's not be angry.

328
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,320
Let's show Master Wei some respect.

329
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,720
Brother, Duan Hai is right.

330
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,760
Let's forget it.

331
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,800
Hey.

332
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,200
You look familiar.

333
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,680
Are you here to attend the banquet?

334
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,240
Yes.

335
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,200
I'd like to ask you

336
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,560
which way is the most popular?

337
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,560
Which way is the most popular?

338
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,920
The way to the pass is the most popular.

339
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,160
Stop.

340
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,040
You are all very handsome.

341
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,440
This friend

342
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,720
is also from the same house.

343
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,240
He is from the same family.

344
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,000
Everyone,

345
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,440
this young man

346
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,040
is just a man.

347
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,440
He is not very good at playing the flute and playing the zither.

348
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,640
Don't blame him.

349
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,120
What's the meat?

350
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,160
You are really good at it.

351
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,760
When can you eat meat?

352
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,200
Hey.

353
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,200
You are a few meters away.

354
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,800
Which way are you going?

355
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,040
I am 20 meters away.

356
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,160
I am going to the pass alone.

357
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,640
You are a veteran.

358
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,480
Since you are going to the pass alone,

359
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,920
may I ask if you have a bag on you?

360
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,760
How many characters are there on the bag?

361
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,880
Kang Jing Fan.

362
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,320
13 years ago,

363
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,080
the Emperor of Jin Nan

364
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,520
left these four characters

365
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,080
in front of the Ming House.

366
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,760
Greetings, Senior Su Sheng.

367
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,760
Senior.

368
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,080
I didn't expect Senior Su Sheng to leave the mountain.

369
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,480
I am Ding Yuan Zi.

370
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,760
I am Liu Jin.

371
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,760
I am Duan Hai.

372
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,760
I am Ni Mo.

373
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,760
I am Ge Pan.

374
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,960
I am Shan Mao.

375
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,120
We are brothers.

376
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,560
Zhang Qing Shi and Zhang Qing Hu.

377
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,760
We are brothers.

378
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,360
I have heard of your name long ago.

379
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,960
Gu Feng Xi.

380
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,560
Senior Su Sheng is just like you.

381
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,160
He is going to the pass alone.

382
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,560
Come and greet him.

383
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,760
I am not interested.

384
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,360
Senior.

385
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,360
Don't blame me.

386
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,160
This Gu is new here.

387
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,160
He doesn't know the rules.

388
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,360
Please forgive him.

389
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,160
It doesn't matter.

390
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,160
I am here to eat meat and not to be a friend.

391
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,560
Please be at your own will.

392
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,160
What do you mean by what you said just now?

393
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,560
It's a Korean painting.

394
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,560
It's a painting of Tufu Zi.

395
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,360
You are here.

396
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,560
You should know where this is.

397
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,960
Of course I know.

398
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,960
Wei Zhuang's courtyard is the ancient black room.

399
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,560
The courtyard is the stronghold of Tufu Zi.

400
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,760
Someone found the tomb

401
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,560
and came here to take the tomb.

402
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,960
I just don't understand

403
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,160
why they suddenly attacked me just now.

404
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,560
That's because you said that

405
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,960
the tomb was in the past.

406
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,960
I don't know why they attacked me just now.

407
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,160
I just don't understand why they attacked me just now.

408
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,960
That's because you said something wrong.

409
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,160
The few steps

410
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,560
are asking how many years have you been in the business.

411
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,960
Which path did you take?

412
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,960
Which faction do you belong to?

413
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,960
What?

414
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,960
The sky is the view of the sky.

415
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,360
The mountains are the view of the earth.

416
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,160
The ink is the ancient scrolls.

417
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,760
The flow is the time to check the clues.

418
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,160
The same dots, fire, and ink are all small factions.

419
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,760
You don't mention anything.

420
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,560
You just say that you went to the official path.

421
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,760
The official path means the government office.

422
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,160
You're against them.

423
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,560
Of course you have to be on guard.

424
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,560
What do you mean by the Duhu path?

425
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,560
The Duhu path is a halfway house.

426
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,960
There are no factions.

427
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,160
They are all in the palace.

428
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,560
And they all have lives on their bodies.

429
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,160
So, they are carrying you.

430
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,560
Does it mean that you have lives on your body?

431
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,760
You're smart.

432
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,160
I said that carrying a golden fan is to light up the poison.

433
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,960
So, they don't dare to come to disturb us?

434
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,360
13 years ago, the imperial guards of Jin Nan were robbed.

435
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,560
23 people were killed.

436
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,960
The bandits left their names in front of the hall.

437
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,160
They were left to guard the books and the emperor was angry.

438
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,760
They ordered to arrest the real murderer, but they didn't find him.

439
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,160
You're pretending to be a guard?

440
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,760
You're familiar with the court's scrolls.

441
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,160
That's right.

442
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,360
So, I pretend to be a famous person.

443
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,960
That's how I can get into Jin Nan.

444
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,360
You said you were going to visit the black market, but you came to the inner courtyard.

445
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,560
You're talking to the Duhu man so rudely.

446
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,560
More importantly,

447
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,560
the matter of the book keeping and the book keeping is a secret order from the court.

448
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,160
You actually know about it?

449
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,160
Li Lianhua, you must have a problem.

450
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,360
Don't point at me.

451
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,560
You're not a big and small person.

452
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,360
Do you know why

453
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,560
we still haven't found the book keeping and the book keeping?

454
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,760
Why?

455
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,360
Because he's dead.

456
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,760
I buried him myself.

457
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,360
He was born with a weak hand.

458
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,160
He was badly injured.

459
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,160
I felt pity for him.

460
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,560
So I kept him with me until he died.

461
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,160
So, in order to thank me,

462
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,560
he taught me the words of my father-in-law.

463
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,760
You're familiar with the scrolls in the court, aren't you?

464
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,360
You should know it very well.

465
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,560
The name of the person who was born with a weak hand is Qi Zhiyuan.

466
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,360
There's a birthmark on his forehead.

467
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,960
Right?

468
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,960
Then why did you run into that man?

469
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,360
Because some people are stupid.

470
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,760
Who are you talking about?

471
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,560
Because you're a fool.

472
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,160
I'm afraid you'll be exposed.

473
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,560
In the end, you were recognized as a meathead and even ran into the street.

474
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,760
Think about it.

475
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,160
I'm confused again. What is a meathead?

476
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,760
Others call you a meathead and a Taoist.

477
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,560
You even took money from them. You're considered a lost child.

478
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,360
Do you understand?

479
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,760
Qi Zhiyuan, you're here too.

480
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,360
Let's work together again.

481
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,760
Work together again? You're really good at calculating.

482
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,960
No need.

483
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,760
I'm now in charge of the name of the person who was born with a weak hand.

484
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,960
It's quite safe.

485
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,160
Didn't you say before

486
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,560
that you blamed me for leaving you and cutting your jade pendant?

487
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,760
You even said those words to keep me away from you.

488
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,160
I think you said it quite well and reasonably.

489
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,560
You don't know martial arts?

490
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,960
If there's a danger, I can protect you.

491
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,560
Thank you. No need. Goodbye.

492
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,360
I found out that the Shigu Brothers are related to the Seven-Striped City case.

493
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,960
I just saw on their sign

494
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,960
that there are also signs of the Fourteenth Tao of the Yellow Spring.

495
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,960
Oh, how does that have anything to do with me?

496
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,560
You have an identity account. Of course, you have to help me.

497
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,960
And we both entered together.

498
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,560
If I get caught, you won't be able to escape.

499
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,560
Good. You're so well-behaved.

500
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,960
You're quite good.

501
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,160
Li Lianhua, do you agree?

502
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,160
I'm just trying to make sure that you don't have an identity.

503
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,560
I have nothing to do with the case.

504
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,760
Cheng Jiang?

505
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,560
Thank you for your kindness.

506
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,360
I'm very grateful.

507
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,960
I've heard of the name of the scholar who was born with a weak hand.

508
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,760
I'm the owner of this manor.

509
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,960
I'm so glad to have you as my guest today.

510
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,760
I just came out for a short time.

511
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,760
I just came out to earn money.

512
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,760
Then you came at the right time today.

513
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,160
Everyone, I have a treasure here.

514
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,760
I want to ask you to take a look.

515
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,160
Penglai Jade Mountain Pavilion?

516
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,760
This is the burial place of King Fangji.

517
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,560
I think you should know

518
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,960
what I invited you to eat.

519
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,760
The big banquet that Master Wei held this time was really a first-class meal.

520
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,360
I think you've heard of

521
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,560
the case of the scholar who was born with a weak hand.

522
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,160
You all came here with a good reputation.

523
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,960
I must make sure that you all come back with a good reputation.

524
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,560
King Fangji was the eldest son of Emperor Xicheng 100 years ago.

525
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,360
He was the emperor's uncle.

526
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,760
He was the crown prince.

527
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,160
Later, he caused a big trouble and was killed by Emperor Xicheng.

528
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,160
The emperor's position was passed on to the current emperor's grandfather,

529
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,560
King Zong.

530
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,160
His tomb is called West Shrine.

531
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,960
The burial place is full of treasures.

532
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,360
People call it a first-class tomb.

533
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,960
King Fangji is very close to the martial arts world.

534
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,960
It is said that there are many treasures in this first-class tomb.

535
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,960
The martial arts are powerful and powerful.

536
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,360
For the past 100 years, many people have been looking for it.

537
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,760
But it all failed.

538
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,960
This tomb seems to have disappeared.

539
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,960
Do you all know why this first-class tomb disappeared?

540
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,160
This has something to do with the reason why King Fangji was assassinated.

541
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,360
Back then, the South India wasn't yet destroyed.

542
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,360
They sent a princess to our dynasty for a marriage.

543
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,160
She married the crown prince of King Fangji as his concubine.

544
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,560
King Fangji was so fascinated that he fell into a trance.

545
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,560
He wanted to force his father to abdicate.

546
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,960
Emperor Xicheng was so sad.

547
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,960
He ordered to kill them both.

548
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,360
He ordered that they shouldn't be buried in the imperial mausoleum.

549
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,160
He found a tomb made of wood from the South India bridge.

550
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,760
This first-class tomb was made by the South India.

551
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,960
The South India is known for its magic and magic.

552
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,160
No wonder they couldn't find it after 100 years.

553
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,360
But now, we're going to find it.

554
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,160
The body of the seven headless corpses of Mount Puchu

555
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,360
is the only treasure that King Fangji buried.

556
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,360
There's one more.

557
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:33,360
It's the jade map of this first-class tomb.

558
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,160
I didn't expect to see Wei Zhuang for so many years.

559
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,760
This first-class tomb is right in front of my house.

560
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,360
It's a blessing from the heavens.

561
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,160
I asked you all to come here to make this fortune.

562
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,760
Master Wei, the seven headless corpses brought their treasures out.

563
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,960
It means they're buried.

564
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,960
But why did they die in the wild and die?

565
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,960
This first-class tomb was made by the South India.

566
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,960
The mechanism is strange and powerful.

567
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,360
I guess they were killed by a thorn in the wood.

568
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,760
Then they were buried in the cave and were thrown out of the tomb.

569
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,560
It's a good thing for us.

570
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,960
All of you here are experts.

571
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,560
You won't repeat their mistakes.

572
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,960
If you're afraid, you can leave now.

573
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,160
I'll leave now, I'm going?

574
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,960
Yes.

575
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,360
Well, guys, what do you think?

576
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,960
What else do you think we need to make?

577
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,560
Brother, the Guan Yin Hammer we're looking for

578
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,080
is in the Yi Pin Ferry.

579
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,680
What should we do?

580
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,880
We're also looking for the Guan Yin Hammer.

581
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,680
Let's go into the tomb with them first.

582
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,680
Then, we won't leave any of them.

583
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,520
The King of Blaze

584
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,120
Master Wei is having a banquet at Cang Lu Court today.

585
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,600
I heard that Master Wei's Cang Lu Court is very auspicious.

586
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,520
It's not a bad thing to have a banquet here.

587
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,360
Everyone, I hope that we can make a fortune this time.

588
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,120
Okay, let's make a fortune.

589
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,360
Where are you coming from, little bastard?

590
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,160
Don't do anything.

591
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,960
This is a senior from my family.

592
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,360
Although he's young, he has a high background.

593
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,160
Everyone, let's go in.

594
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,360
Master Wei, you're having a banquet.

595
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,160
Why are you here to meddle in everything?

596
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,560
A coward is looking for a way out.

597
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,480
A meathead is fine too.

598
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,680
But now, a rude little bastard is coming.

599
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,280
The Wei family has always been a secret treasure.

600
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,480
It's not an exception to enter the Yi Pin Ferry.

601
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,080
If my elder doesn't have a place to go,

602
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,280
I won't let him go.

603
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,080
Everyone, don't worry.

604
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,680
Come on, don't ruin your teeth.

605
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,880
Let's have a drink.

606
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,680
This wine is not bad.

607
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,280
Good wine.

608
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,480
Come on, brother Gu, it's been a long time.

609
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,280
I was worried when you first entered the business a few years ago.

610
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:56,280
The disciple of the Deng Jia Qi Sect is also trying to make a fortune.

611
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,880
Later, you entered the business with your younger sister.

612
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,680
My heart is at ease.

613
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,480
What is the real thing in this life?

614
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,880
Heart.

615
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,080
Come on, let's drink.

616
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,080
Good wine.

617
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,880
Little Prince,

618
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,080
the Wei Sect Leader insisted on taking you.

619
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,880
Tell me what tricks you know.

620
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,480
In our business,

621
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,080
you're following us around.

622
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,080
You can't just eat in public.

623
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,280
Come on, come on.

624
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,680
Drink some wine and grow some hair.

625
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,480
That's what you call a man.

626
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,680
Get lost.

627
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,280
My hand!

628
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,280
Come on, take Ding Yuan Zi to pack up.

629
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,080
Slow down!

630
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,480
Little bastard, I'll teach you a lesson for your master.

631
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,680
Wait.

632
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,880
Brother Jing,

633
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,480
ask for a good chance.

634
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,480
Senior Su Ruo, what do you mean?

635
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,680
You're just fighting before you start working.

636
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,280
It's not a good sign.

637
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,080
You're not a good person.

638
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,680
You're not a good person.

639
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,080
You're not a good person.

640
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,080
Little brother,

641
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,880
why are you doing this?

642
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,480
We're here to make money.

643
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,080
We're here to make money.

644
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,080
Brother Qing Shi,

645
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,280
I know you're not used to it.

646
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,480
But my little elder is very skilled in martial arts.

647
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,480
He's the only one who can open the first-class entrance.

648
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,680
I've had it.

649
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,880
You should have it too.

650
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,680
How about this?

651
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,480
Let's go to the outside of the yard and start a new feast.

652
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,480
Brother Qing Shi and I will enjoy the moon

653
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,880
and drink together.

654
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,680
I've collected a few

655
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,480
ten-year-old Xifeng Lies.

656
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,880
I know Brother Qing Shi likes to make wine.

657
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,480
Don't miss it.

658
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,080
Everyone, let's go.

659
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,480
You said you were going to the river to watch the banquet.

660
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,080
You're leaving again?

661
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,280
I'm cold.

662
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,080
You suddenly hinted that I didn't want to drink

663
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,080
when we were at the banquet.

664
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,680
Why is that?

665
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,480
I just don't like drinking.

666
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,880
Forget it.

667
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,080
Since you're treating the kids,

668
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,880
I'll drink with you.

669
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,680
I'll drink with you.

670
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,480
I'll drink with you.

671
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,280
I'll drink with you.

672
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,280
I'll drink with you.

673
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,680
Since you're treating the kids,

674
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,680
I won't argue with you.

675
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,480
If that kid is really hit by Zhang Qi Shi,

676
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,680
he must be killed.

677
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,480
Yes.

678
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,480
If he's hit, he must be killed.

679
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,080
This Wu Tou case

680
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,680
can really find a copy of the missing 100 years ago.

681
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,480
It must be a shock to everyone.

682
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,680
It will shock the host of Baichuan Academy.

683
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,680
Come on.

684
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,480
Check it with me.

685
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,880
Are you really not interested?

686
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,280
Aren't you sleepy after I finish eating?

687
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,480
What are you doing?

688
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,880
You're helping me drink.

689
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,280
What do you mean by that?

690
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,480
Sleeping room.

691
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,680
The host of this house really likes to gamble.

692
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,680
He uses the dice to count the points as a room number.

693
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,480
Okay, go to sleep.

694
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,680
I have something to do.

695
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,280
Where are you going?

696
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,280
The 15 brothers of the Twin Sages

697
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,680
are holding the brand of the 14th Tao of the Imperial Fist.

698
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,680
I told them

699
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,080
to kill all the people in the whole family.

700
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,280
So I suspect that Qi Dao and Chen Shan are related to them.

701
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,480
I'll go back to them.

702
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,080
I'm leaving.

703
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,080
Brother!

704
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,680
Chang Qing is dead?

705
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,880
Chang Qing is dead?

706
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,480
His head is missing.

707
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,880
It's like the body of the seven giants in the mountain.

708
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,680
Chang Qing, what's going on?

709
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,280
I...

710
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,280
I didn't see anything.

711
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,080
I don't know.

712
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,680
How could you not see the murderer

713
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,080
when you slept in the same room?

714
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,880
Did you leave the room

715
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,280
and get into the room?

716
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,480
Impossible.

717
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,680
I just woke up.

718
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,680
It was right at the door.

719
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,680
No one could have come in. I didn't know.

720
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,080
But I don't know why

721
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,880
I turned around

722
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,880
and this is what happened.

723
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,080
The window was locked from the inside.

724
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,880
Killing and cutting the head is not something a connoisseur can do.

725
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,080
Moreover, the brothers of the Twin Sages who never left

726
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,880
didn't notice anything.

727
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,880
What kind of master is he?

728
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,480
Could it be that he's not a master?

729
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,080
It's a evil tree.

730
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,680
I heard that the first-class grave has an evil tree protecting the ghost.

731
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,080
If anyone is a little selfish,

732
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,680
they will be killed by the evil tree.

733
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,280
The seven giants in the mountain

734
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,880
lost their heads like this.

735
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,480
Now, Zhang Qing is also like this.

736
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,880
Could it be...

737
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,480
Could it be that it's our turn next?

738
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,880
Then this evil tree

739
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,280
is very humanistic.

740
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,080
Senior, what do you mean?

741
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,280
If it's really an evil tree,

742
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,280
it could be that it's in front of people

743
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,480
and it's been taken away by your brother.

744
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,880
It can also shock others

745
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,880
and make them afraid to take the first-class grave.

746
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,480
But now, Zhang Qing is too much

747
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,080
to see this cruel scene.

748
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,480
He knows too much about people.

749
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,680
It's urgent.

750
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,280
Let's see if there are any other entrances

751
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,480
in this room.

752
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,480
Did you go to check the body and soul of this body last night?

753
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,280
I've been looking for a chance to tell you.

754
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,680
I came out of the gate of Canglu Courtyard

755
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,480
to follow them.

756
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,880
I suddenly saw no one.

757
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,280
Why did you make a mistake?

758
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,080
I always thought that

759
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,680
they were the ones who made the Seven-Striped Mountain.

760
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,280
So I was extremely cautious and left.

761
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,280
I didn't expect that Zhang Qing is...

762
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,280
also a headless stone.

763
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,480
Could it really be some evil tree?

764
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,880
I don't care about the investigation.

765
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,480
I didn't expect you to do it.

766
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,680
That's good.

767
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,480
You guys come and check.

768
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,480
Look.

769
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,680
The air intake of this room has been broken.

770
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,880
If we enter the room from here,

771
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,280
we can avoid Zhang Qing from the door and kill people.

772
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,080
This hole is only a few feet wide.

773
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,680
How can we get in?

774
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,480
If it's a few feet wide,

775
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,280
we can't enter it.

776
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,280
You mean

777
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,280
the kid on the banquet?

778
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,080
This kid is very sinister.

779
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,280
Zhang Qing had a fight with him.

780
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,880
It's possible that he will take revenge.

781
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,280
Little Zazhou.

782
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,280
Little Zazhou, stop right there!

783
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,680
Did you kill my brother?

784
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,080
Who do you think you are?

785
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,880
You don't deserve to talk to me.

786
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,480
I'll crush your arm.

787
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,280
I'll see if you're good or not.

788
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,280
Wait.

789
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,680
Wait.

790
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,880
You want to take revenge on this kid?

791
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,680
I'm just here to tell you

792
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,480
that the murderer is someone else.

793
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,080
I received a secret letter

794
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,680
saying that there are detectives of Baichuan Courtyard among us.

795
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,880
They are good at both martial arts and martial arts.

796
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,280
If they work together, it will be hard to defeat them.

797
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,480
It must be Zhang Qing who killed him.

798
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,880
First, it can weaken our strength.

799
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,080
Second, it can make us suspect each other.

800
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,680
So Zhang Qing must be the murderer.

801
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,680
We've seen this group for years.

802
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,480
Some only know their names.

803
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,680
How can we find out that it's the detective of Baichuan Courtyard?

804
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,280
I already know who he is.

805
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,880
The murderer is Yang Qing from Baichuan.

806
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,880
Ge Pan, you are indeed from Baichuan Courtyard.

807
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,080
Guards, drag him out and kill him.

808
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,480
Wait.

809
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,280
Master Wei, there's a trick to this.

810
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,680
If the murderer is Ge Pan,

811
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,480
how could Zhang Qing be seen when he's killing?

812
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,680
His body is not as small as that.

813
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:52,280
Exactly. This little thing is the most suspicious.

814
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,880
Everyone, let me ask you.

815
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,280
I can guarantee for my little elder.

816
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,080
But who can guarantee for this detective of Baichuan Courtyard?

817
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,280
Even if he didn't kill anyone,

818
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,880
do you still want to keep him?

819
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,880
Since everyone has no objection,

820
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,080
let Ge Pan go.

821
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,880
I won't kill him.

822
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,280
You're so strong.

823
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,080
You're so nervous about Baichuan Courtyard.

824
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,880
Are you on the same level as him?

825
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,280
I...

826
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,480
Everyone, wait.

827
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,880
I wonder what you think of the student who is a student of Su Shou.

828
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,880
I don't think it's a good idea.

829
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,680
But the detective of Baichuan Courtyard is here.

830
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,480
There's no backup.

831
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,280
If there's a partner,

832
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,480
everyone will be in danger.

833
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,480
So my suggestion is

834
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,280
to keep him alive for one night.

835
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,880
If everyone finds out the truth tomorrow morning,

836
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,680
we'll be relieved.

837
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,280
Since Su Shou is a student,

838
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,480
I have no objection.

839
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,080
Brother Qing Hu, what about you?

840
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,480
Okay.

841
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,280
I'll wait for the good news from Su Shou.

842
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,880
Then it's hard for you.

843
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,280
Come on. Take him away.

844
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,880
Go.

845
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:37,280
This place is full of Baichuan Courtyard's spies.

846
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,080
Do you know this Ge Pan?

847
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:42,280
I'm not sure if I've ever been attacked by Baichuan Courtyard.

848
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,480
But this weapon is really ours.

849
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,680
So I have to save it.

850
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,480
Thank you for saving me.

851
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,080
Thank you.

852
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,480
I'm not helping you.

853
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,680
I'm afraid of death, Fang Zhao Xia.

854
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,280
We came in together.

855
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,480
If we fight,

856
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,280
he'll definitely involve me.

857
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,080
I've been thinking about it.

858
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,080
Either I'll help you or I'll help you.

859
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,080
I can only choose one of the two.

860
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,680
Take it.

861
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,680
You kicked me out?

862
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,680
What do you mean?

863
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,280
You haven't said...

864
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,480
Fine. I'll settle it later.

865
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,280
Except for the front door and the back wall,

866
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,280
there's no other entrance.

867
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,680
Did the kid do it?

868
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,880
Let me ask you.

869
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,880
If that kid wanted to crawl in from the back wall,

870
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,880
what would you do?

871
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,480
One, break the entrance.

872
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,880
Two, crawl in.

873
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,280
Three, kill him.

874
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,280
Take it.

875
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,080
The murderer's steps are different from yours.

876
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,880
There's blood on it?

877
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:11,280
First, knock on the brick, then crawl in to kill.

878
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,080
The blood won't stick to the brick.

879
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,280
Now there's blood on the brick.

880
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,680
It means the murderer killed the person first and then knocked on the brick.

881
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,680
So the murderer taught me to that kid.

882
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,480
What else?

883
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,080
But when it came to the Chen's case,

884
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,880
the murderer didn't leave any clues.

885
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,080
Instead, he's teaching me to someone else.

886
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,280
So as long as there's no headless body,

887
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,280
the murderer killed the person?

888
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,880
You mean,

889
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,280
maybe these two cases have nothing to do with each other?

890
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,880
I don't know if they're related.

891
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,880
I only know that Zhang Qing's blood

892
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,080
is a layer of blood that's been infiltrated.

893
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,480
It didn't come out of nowhere.

894
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,080
The blood splashed on one side,

895
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,280
but there's no sign of blood.

896
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,280
So the person died first,

897
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,280
and the head was cut off.

898
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,680
It's not because of the head.

899
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,680
But the person is dead.

900
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,280
Why would they cut off the head when they're about to kill?

901
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,080
The head is a very strange thing.

902
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,480
It reveals a lot of secrets.

903
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,280
Whether it's dead or alive, it's the same.

904
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,880
What do you mean?

905
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,880
Now,

906
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,880
we need to find out Zhang Qing's whereabouts first.

907
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,880
The murderer killed the person in front of him,

908
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,280
knocked on the wall, and then pressed the door back.

909
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,480
That means he must have entered from the front door.

910
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,680
But Zhang Qingwu lived in the same room.

911
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,880
He didn't see anything.

912
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,280
What if they didn't live in the same room?

913
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,680
Last night, the murderer wasrt on the rooftop.

914
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,240
He didn't kill Zhang Qingwu in there,

915
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,880
and this is Zhang Qingwu's bloodstain.

916
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,480
So this time, the murderer showed up at katant got up.

917
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,280
He threw an arrow,

918
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:48,180
and Golden Commander bricks on the dergenah and destroyed in fight.

919
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,680
These were the evidence from the Multipoint.

920
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,280
Even if I had known about it,

921
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,680
only I could know one thing.

922
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,680
Did I foget your name again in textbooks?

923
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,680
I want to change my life for a better life

924
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,680
People are too reckless

925
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:10,680
The long journey is short and the journey is long

926
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:17,680
Who doesn't want to give up the journey?

927
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,680
People are too reckless

928
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,680
The old days are too short

929
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,680
The new days are long

930
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,680
I want to change my life for a better life

931
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,680
People are too reckless

932
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:38,680
The long journey is short and the journey is long

933
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:45,680
Who doesn't want to give up the journey?

934
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,680
The Long Ballad
