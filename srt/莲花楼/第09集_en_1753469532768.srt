1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,120
I will drink to my heart's content

2
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,520
I will travel to the end of the world

3
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,040
I will live in the world

4
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,920
I will travel to the end of the world

5
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:21,240
I will live in the world

6
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,200
I will live in the world

7
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,400
I will drink to my heart's content

8
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,120
I will live in the world

9
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,800
I will live in the world

10
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,840
The Long Ballad

11
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,440
After so many years,

12
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,200
we haven't found the young master

13
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,800
who never gave up.

14
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,920
We haven't found him either.

15
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,640
Today,

16
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,640
I hope that all the martial arts people

17
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,960
will not forget the ideals of good and evil,

18
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,600
and the world will be peaceful.

19
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,800
I will live up to the wish of the Prime Minister.

20
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,280
Xiao Zi Jin

21
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,480
is getting more and more unrepentant.

22
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,560
Fourth, it's been ten years.

23
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,520
I thought that Xiao Wan was your woman.

24
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,760
Miss Qiao,

25
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,000
she only belongs to herself.

26
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,040
I am fortunate to be able to witness the young master's death

27
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,520
and see the day again.

28
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:56,920
and see the day again.

29
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,760
I have Chinese clothes.

30
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,160
My clothes belong to Madam Qiao.

31
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,480
Let's go.

32
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:12,680
Let's go.

33
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,560
Look at the sword.

34
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,000
Prime Minister Li used

35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,040
theç›´ sword

36
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:25,200
to lead the Attention-seeker

37
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,760
to battle in the martial world.

38
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:25,840
I heard that to win'th Miss Qiao, that's is to win'th Madam Qiao.

39
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:25,880
I heard that to win'th Madam Qiao to win'th Miss Qiao.

40
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,640
And ingredients

41
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,680
Go

42
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,640
Just wait

43
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,080
You'll have cameras

44
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,440
Let me see

45
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,920
Your perfect under the empty

46
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,920
I write thousands of letters and thousands of letters

47
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,920
The most reluctant moment is that moment

48
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,880
Live in the world

49
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,400
Half a mile of madness

50
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,640
Who has never wandered

51
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,760
Who is not the one who guards the scattered clouds

52
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,120
The end of the world is the moon

53
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,360
Live in the world

54
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,960
Youthful panic

55
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,080
The past is not drunk and the road is sad

56
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,800
A dreamy journey in the world

57
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,800
The world is looking forward

58
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,280
It is said that there are not many people who are in the field of politics

59
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,440
Just to see that red silk

60
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,080
Today you two have learned something

61
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,120
It's just that the young master is too much

62
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,640
Yes, you are so arrogant

63
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,640
What attitude are you two

64
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,960
This is the height that you two can't base

65
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,640
I think you are just jealous

66
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,280
If you want to be happy

67
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,360
Can come to the stage to compete

68
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,640
One stop inside

69
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,560
As long as there is no lower body

70
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,720
Whoever picks the last silk

71
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,200
You can see the world in person

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,280
What is this

73
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,240
Eat

74
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,360
Eat

75
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,560
Eat

76
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,360
Must be me

77
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,440
It's really lively

78
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,680
The master does not like loneliness

79
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,080
This time should be happy

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,840
I have known you for so long

81
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,400
What is the name of the knife you carry

82
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,160
knife

83
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,680
knife

84
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,960
No name

85
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,880
Knife is the name of the knife

86
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,880
Take so many fancy names

87
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,880
Finally, it fell into the hands of others

88
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,800
You count

89
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,840
Still not taking back your sword

90
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,560
Whose knife

91
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,200
This Li Xiangyi has died for ten years

92
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,200
Lose to me so relaxed

93
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,960
Six pieces

94
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,360
Stun

95
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,560
Here

96
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,440
Sharpen

97
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,080
Give me

98
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,960
Lotus

99
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,880
Why did you come up

100
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,240
Obviously, this mask

101
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,800
It's against Master law

102
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
let alone making sure the stone parties don't break

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,580
Everyone is free to

104
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,680
his

105
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,320
If moisten the honeyduin

106
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,320
Select the fest thing

107
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,240
My name is Li.

108
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,320
Li?

109
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,600
What's your name?

110
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,960
Li Lianhua.

111
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,960
You're Doctor Li.

112
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,080
I've heard a lot about you.

113
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,000
So today,

114
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,600
you're the one who has the chance

115
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,000
to test Shao Shijian.

116
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,480
But I'm not good at testing.

117
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,040
You're all wrong!

118
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,240
You're all wrong!

119
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,600
Stop it! Stop it!

120
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,400
What's wrong with you?

121
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,360
You're all wrong!

122
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,720
You're all wrong!

123
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,640
You're all wrong!

124
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,560
Everyone!

125
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,200
It's what Hero Xiao said.

126
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,600
You can believe what he said.

127
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,720
Why don't you believe it?

128
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,720
You're all people

129
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,800
who are in love with each other.

130
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,720
Don't be so stubborn.

131
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,400
Right?

132
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,120
Mr. Fang is right.

133
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,880
It's fate that

134
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,400
Doctor Li and Hero Xiao are in love.

135
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,200
Doctor Li,

136
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,600
test the sword.

137
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,480
Go, go.

138
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,480
Go.

139
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,440
expedition

140
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,440
so, you have to kill 7 of them.

141
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,720
You dare to destroy the master?

142
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
Everyone,

143
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,720
there's something to say.

144
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,720
There must be a misunderstanding.

145
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,720
What's wrong with this sword?

146
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,720
This sword is fake.

147
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,720
It's fake?

148
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,720
It's fake?

149
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,720
Where is it?

150
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,720
It's definitely not fake.

151
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,720
Why do you say it's fake?

152
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,720
This sword

153
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,720
is really like the real thing.

154
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,720
Even the carving on the sword

155
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,720
is perfect.

156
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,720
But I heard that

157
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,720
Li Xiangyin got this sword when she was 15 years old.

158
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,720
The sword has been kept for five years.

159
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,720
But there's no

160
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,720
any damage on this sword.

161
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
It's really strange.

162
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,720
There's no damage at all.

163
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,720
Here, look.

164
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,720
That year, Xiangyin fought with Wu You,

165
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,720
and in order to save Wu You's life,

166
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,720
she used the sword to resist Wu You's killing move.

167
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,720
But this sword has no damage.

168
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,720
It's fake.

169
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,720
This is not the stone I found.

170
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,720
I was so anxious that the sword was broken.

171
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,720
It's fake?

172
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,720
Look.

173
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,720
Three days ago,

174
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,720
Qiao Nvxia and Xiao Daxia

175
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,720
took the Shaoshi Sword

176
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,720
and stored it here.

177
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,720
The sword is strictly controlled.

178
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,720
These days,

179
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,720
no one has entered or left this place.

180
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,720
Before the sword awarding ceremony,

181
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,720
Shi Shui and I

182
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,720
took the sword out.

183
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,720
No one should have the chance

184
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,720
to take it out.

185
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,720
But I'm sure that

186
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,720
the sword is not stolen.

187
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,720
I'm sure that

188
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,720
the sword is not stolen.

189
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,720
But I'm sure that

190
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,720
anyone can

191
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,720
take this sword out.

192
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,720
Look.

193
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
There seems to be a problem here.

194
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,720
Good guy.

195
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,720
Why is there a tunnel here?

196
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,720
Who is it?

197
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,720
When was it dug?

198
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,720
The tunnel is not known.

199
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,720
Do you want to go down and have a look?

200
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,720
A Min,

201
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,720
the air in the tunnel is not good.

202
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
Don't worry about your inheritance.

203
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,720
Wait up there.

204
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,720
No.

205
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,720
I worked hard to find the Shaoshi Sword.

206
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,720
I can't rest assured if I wait.

207
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,720
Let's go.

208
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,720
It's been half a month since the last time.

209
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,720
But the Shaoshi Sword

210
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,720
was sent to the secret place

211
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,720
of the Sword House

212
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,720
three days ago.

213
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,720
Did someone know about it?

214
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,720
Half a month ago.

215
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,720
I wrote a letter to the Chief of the House of the Seventh.

216
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,720
I made sure that the sword

217
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,720
was stored in the secret place of the Sword House.

218
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,720
Not many people

219
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,720
can contact us.

220
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,720
It seems that

221
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,720
we have to find it from the people around us.

222
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,720
This tunnel is long enough.

223
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,720
There are obvious divisions here.

224
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,720
The part we just walked through

225
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,720
is the new one.

226
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,720
There are some times when we go this way.

227
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,720
At least, it's been ten years.

228
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,720
So someone dug a path

229
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,720
to the sword room

230
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,720
on the old tunnel.

231
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,720
Ten years ago,

232
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,720
the Baichuan Courtyard was the branch of the Four Gu Sect.

233
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,720
We often lived here.

234
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
There is also such a long tunnel.

235
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,720
Did you know?

236
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,720
This tunnel...

237
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,720
A'Ming,

238
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,720
are you feeling unwell?

239
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,720
Li Lianhua,

240
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,720
come and have a look.

241
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,720
Excuse me.

242
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,720
He's dead.

243
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,720
He was injured by a knife.

244
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,720
He's been dead for two hours.

245
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,720
A'Rou.

246
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,720
A'Rou.

247
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,720
A'Rou.

248
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,720
A'Rou.

249
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,720
A'Rou.

250
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,720
This is my maid, A'Rou.

251
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
No wonder I couldn't find her since today.

252
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,720
Did she know

253
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,720
that the sword in the room is a secret room?

254
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,720
She has been with me all the time.

255
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,720
She was the one who sent the message

256
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,720
to the new king of the Ji Yuan Sect.

257
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,720
The wound is thin and weak.

258
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,720
It seems that the body

259
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,720
was left by the young master.

260
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,720
There are two types of blood on this place.

261
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,720
The blood is not messy.

262
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,720
There was no fight between the two.

263
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,720
They are relatively strong.

264
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,720
A'Rou was killed by the enemy.

265
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,720
It should be A'Rou

266
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,720
who conspired with someone

267
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,720
to steal the sword

268
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,720
but was killed by the conspired person.

269
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,720
This is a man

270
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
in the first sight.

271
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,720
You guessed it right.

272
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,720
In this way,

273
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720
it should be hidden in the Pudu Temple.

274
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,720
It's a coincidence.

275
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,720
The monks of the Pudu Temple

276
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,720
all wear this kind of self-made grass shoes.

277
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,720
There is no such thing outside.

278
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,720
Half a month ago,

279
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,720
a new cook came to the Pudu Temple.

280
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,720
Half a month ago?

281
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,720
It's so coincidental.

282
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,720
Yes, it's so coincidental.

283
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,720
There is a crack on the wall.

284
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,720
It seems to be connected to the outside world.

285
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
The Pudu Temple

286
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,720
When the old Na Jingren reminded the scout,

287
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,720
that Jin people have lost their way.

288
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,320
I didn't expect

289
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,680
that he is such a poor and evil man.

290
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,320
The Pudu Temple and the Baichuan Courtyard are in harmony.

291
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,760
We can find the thief.

292
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,280
I hope so.

293
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,240
Amitabha.

294
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:04,960
Miss Qiao,

295
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,760
do you recognize the handwriting on it?

296
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,760
It's A'Rou's handwriting.

297
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,160
Wolf is obsessed with this sword.

298
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,160
He is ashamed of my lady.

299
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,280
He doesn't want to be oppressed by wolf.

300
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,480
He wants to marry a wolf

301
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,760
and return the sword to him.

302
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,960
It's not easy to find.

303
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,240
It seems that Miss A'Rou

304
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,880
was deceived by love.

305
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,840
She wanted to exchange the sword

306
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,360
and make the lost wolf

307
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,040
look for her.

308
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,040
But she didn't expect

309
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,200
that the wolf would kill people

310
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,680
to escape.

311
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:37,920
Yes.

312
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,920
A'Rou is confused.

313
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,920
He gave up his life for nothing.

314
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,320
Then we should

315
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,000
ask Hero Xiao and Master Fang

316
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,840
to lead us to the underground passage

317
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,280
and bring the lady here.

318
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:54,880
No problem.

319
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,000
Miss Qiao,

320
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,320
why don't you go to my room first

321
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,160
and have some tea?

322
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,480
Lady Li, let's go.

323
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,200
Please.

324
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,480
So you knew Mr. Li long ago.

325
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,440
Yes.

326
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,960
It doesn't matter if we knew each other long ago.

327
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,560
We can meet each other everywhere in our life.

328
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,400
I'm afraid that we won't know each other

329
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,000
when we meet again.

330
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,840
What do you mean?

331
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,000
Have we met

332
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,840
before, Mr. Li?

333
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,000
Of course not.

334
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,480
Master Fang

335
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,120
is so used to

336
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,280
talking about the two things in life.

337
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,120
But I don't believe

338
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,000
in the law of the world.

339
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,000
It's my choice.

340
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,000
As the saying goes,

341
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,400
fate is in your hands.

342
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,200
The day before yesterday,

343
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,400
you can't avoid it.

344
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,440
Master Li should have a lot of words

345
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,680
to say to Miss Qiao

346
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,640
before she leaves.

347
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,000
Why are you only talking to me?

348
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:37,320
I don't care about the

349
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,320
idle talk.

350
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,160
What do you want to tell me?

351
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,560
It's like this.

352
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,320
I used to live in this Putu Temple

353
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,480
for a while.

354
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,240
I met a little fan.

355
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,520
His name is Huiyuan.

356
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,080
Later, I found out

357
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,840
that he joined the Golden Abyss Alliance.

358
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,680
His name is Shi Hun.

359
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,600
Shi Hun?

360
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,280
I've heard of his name.

361
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,920
I'll find out for you.

362
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,520
Thank you, Miss Qiao.

363
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,920
I'll go get some water.

364
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,280
It can't be them.

365
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,160
Miss Qiao.

366
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,840
Miss Qiao.

367
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,320
What's wrong, Miss Qiao?

368
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,280
They should be out now.

369
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,400
I'll go check

370
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,120
what Mr. Li said.

371
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,200
I'll tell him when I find out.

372
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,360
When did you start

373
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,680
to be so mean to women?

374
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,240
Why didn't you tell him who you are?

375
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,480
Or do you think you're

376
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,000
no better than your old self?

377
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,120
Chief Di.

378
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,160
When did you become

379
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,960
so nosy?

380
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,600
I just think

381
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,200
you're so self-willed

382
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,200
and fresh.

383
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,640
Don't be so messy

384
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,960
and get involved in our work.

385
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,080
Chief Li.

386
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,160
I have nothing to do with

387
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,480
other people's affairs.

388
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,120
We'll leave as soon as

389
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,480
we get the news of Shi Hun.

390
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,480
Li Lianhua.

391
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,760
How's it going?

392
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,960
Did Mr. Xiao and Miss Qiao

393
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,920
return to the Banchen Court?

394
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,760
Yes, they did.

395
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,640
But Qiao Lianxia said

396
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,560
she saw a figure outside the city.

397
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,720
So she went after them.

398
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,800
When we went after them,

399
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,960
Qiao Lianxia and the figure were gone.

400
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,240
Everyone was looking for them.

401
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,880
Okay, let's split up.

402
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,200
Li Lianhua.

403
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,320
This Li Lianhua

404
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,880
is really nervous about Qiao Lianxia.

405
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,640
Unfortunately, she's going to fall into the trap.

406
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,480
Shi Shui.

407
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,840
Xiao Yunchun.

408
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,080
Why are you here?

409
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,520
You're so sneaky.

410
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,080
Shi Shui, don't get me wrong.

411
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,120
I was going to

412
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,560
attend the award ceremony.

413
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,160
But I was delayed on my way here.

414
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,160
When I got here,

415
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,600
I heard that I lost my sword.

416
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,920
So the Supervise came here

417
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,040
to see a joke?

418
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,280
No, no, no.

419
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,520
I didn't mean that.

420
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,560
Is it a matter of losing your sword now?

421
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,200
You lost your man too.

422
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,360
You lost your man.

423
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,360
You lost your man.

424
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,360
You lost your man.

425
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,360
You lost your man.

426
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,360
You lost your man.

427
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,800
You even lost your man now.

428
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,960
Shi Shui.

429
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,960
Shi Shui.

430
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,280
Looking for someone?

431
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,520
Do you know where she is?

432
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,760
I saw her chasing after a monk.

433
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,960
But she was stolen by the Supervise.

434
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,440
It seems that you're looking for

435
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,960
the fake monk who stole the sword.

436
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,440
You're so clumsy.

437
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,360
Where did she take her?

438
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,240
I can see the murderous intent

439
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,200
in your eyes.

440
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,640
You're so gratifying.

441
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,560
Li Xiangyi is still alive.

442
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,120
Li Weisheng,

443
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,520
you'd better not joke with me.

444
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,200
Where are you, Qiao An?

445
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,520
Shen A'Rou told you

446
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,560
that the Supervise can trigger my inheritance.

447
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,800
You even used it to deal with me.

448
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,600
She just said nothing to you.

449
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,080
She forced me to do it.

450
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,000
I told you.

451
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,480
I'm not not returning the stone.

452
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,280
I just want to keep her by my side

453
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,200
for a few more days.

454
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,400
In this world,

455
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,320
who can't be the best sword

456
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,960
in the world?

457
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,560
You killed A'Rou

458
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,520
and you're so weak.

459
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,080
You're even willing to kill yourself.

460
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:25,800
Enough!

461
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,280
You've sealed the mountain.

462
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,720
You trapped me here.

463
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,760
I can't get away.

464
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,560
I can only tie you up.

465
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,240
If you're too weak, I'll give you a hand.

466
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,600
Congratulations?)

467
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,120
Take a seat.

468
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:58,640
Qiao,

469
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,480
are you alright?

470
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,880
Mr. Li,

471
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,160
why are you here?

472
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,560
Everyone

473
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,760
is looking for you elside.

474
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,280
But I happened to meet you.

475
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,760
So I just

476
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,920
met a surprise trick.

477
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,480
Let me untie you.

478
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,760
Mr. Lin risked his life to save me.

479
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,040
I'm dead.

480
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,480
I'm dead.

481
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,120
Don't be so polite.

482
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,720
This person is really too shameless.

483
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,800
What is this good thing?

484
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,120
I can't even look at it.

485
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,680
A bracelet.

486
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,040
This green jade bracelet is a heirloom from the Xiao family.

487
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,600
It's a pair of jade carvings that I got from the Po Jun Sword.

488
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,680
Oh, so you're a future wife.

489
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,240
What? You're in love?

490
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,800
I was just being poked.

491
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,680
I was afraid I'd get poked.

492
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,320
Luckily, I'm fine.

493
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,920
Miss Qiao, it seems you really like this jade bracelet.

494
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,320
Let's get out of here.

495
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,920
Xiao Qing.

496
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,720
The incense has gone.

497
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,520
The Four Gu Sects suffered a great loss.

498
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,520
Why don't we just disband the Four Gu Sects today?

499
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,720
You want to disband the Four Gu Sects?

500
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,120
The two sect leaders are gone.

501
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,720
The people have also disbanded.

502
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,920
Why force them to stay?

503
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,120
Xiao Qing.

504
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,520
Xiao Qing.

505
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,120
Xiao Qing.

506
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,520
What's wrong?

507
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,720
I feel like...

508
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,920
Xiang Yi is back.

509
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,520
I regret it.

510
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,520
I shouldn't have written that letter to her.

511
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,720
You wrote her a letter a month ago.

512
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,720
She's such a proud person.

513
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,920
I said I wanted to leave her.

514
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,120
But I'm too tired.

515
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,720
I'm too tired chasing after her.

516
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,120
A-Mian is loved by the King.

517
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,320
He's accompanied by his companions.

518
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,720
He will always be with them.

519
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,320
He's known to be a great man.

520
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,320
He made A-Mian proud and proud.

521
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,320
He made A-Mian panic.

522
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,320
The King loves the martial arts world.

523
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,120
He loves the high level of martial arts.

524
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,120
A-Mian can only follow behind the King.

525
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,120
He's too tired.

526
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,120
He's always with the King.

527
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,320
He can only follow behind the King.

528
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,520
The King is like a sun.

529
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,920
He's so bright and bright.

530
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:15,520
But he can always be the sun.

531
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,120
A-Mian is too tired.

532
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,720
The King can't be with the King.

533
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,120
He can't love the King like before.

534
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,320
He's too tired to be with the King.

535
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,320
The King is so brave.

536
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,320
He's so powerful.

537
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,120
The world is peaceful.

538
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,120
I have nothing to worry about.

539
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,120
I'll live my life as A-Mian wishes.

540
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,120
Li Xiangyi, Li Xiangyi.

541
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,120
You're always respected by everyone.

542
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,120
But you've become a burden to others.

543
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,120
I'm sorry.

544
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,120
I'm sorry.

545
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:29,120
Miss Qiao, I think the intersection of Pudu Temple and Baichun Garden is too far.

546
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,120
Let's hurry up.

547
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,520
Miss Qiao, I heard from Mr. Xiao that you have a fever.

548
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,320
Why don't you sit down and rest?

549
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,120
Slowly.

550
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,320
A-Mian, how are you?

551
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,920
I'm fine.

552
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,320
Xiangyi.

553
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,320
Xiangyi, you're here.

554
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,320
I know you hate me.

555
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,920
Miss Qiao, don't think too much.

556
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,720
I'll send you back first.

557
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:50,920
No.

558
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,520
I'm sorry.

559
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,720
I'm sorry.

560
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,720
I'm sorry.

561
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,720
I'm sorry.

562
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,720
I'm sorry.

563
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,920
I'm sorry.

564
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,120
I'm sorry.

565
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,320
I'm sorry.

566
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,520
I'm sorry.

567
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,720
I'm sorry.

568
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,520
I don't want to leave.

569
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,520
I don't want to go back.

570
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,520
Xiang Yin, don't go.

571
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,320
Xiang Yin, do you remember this place?

572
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,520
At that time, you didn't say a word

573
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,920
and ran away with some fox.

574
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,120
I was worried and angry

575
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,720
and told you not to appear in front of me.

576
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,320
So I came to pick you up on this road.

577
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,320
At that time, I always wanted to make you happy.

578
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,120
But you always blamed me for not understanding you.

579
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,320
And I

580
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,920
had only thought about the Four Ancient Gates

581
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,120
but also ignored your feelings.

582
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,120
You...

583
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,720
How did you understand it so late?

584
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,120
It's too late, Xiang Yin.

585
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,520
I can't find you.

586
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,720
I can't find you.

587
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,920
I can't wait for you either.

588
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,320
What should I do?

589
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,120
What should I do?

590
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,720
A Min.

591
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,920
Forget it.

592
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,320
Have a happy life.

593
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,320
You always persuade me like this.

594
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,320
But I'm waiting for you

595
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,520
and I'm the only one who thinks you're still alive.

596
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,320
Maybe...

597
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,920
Maybe you'll come back alive.

598
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,720
I'm sorry.

599
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,720
I...

600
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,520
I've let my love down.

601
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,720
I'm sorry.

602
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,520
I'm sorry.

603
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,520
I love you so much.

604
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,320
Let me...

605
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,720
Let me go.

606
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,240
I can find it.

607
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,000
I've searched everywhere.

608
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,800
No one is here.

609
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,320
Han Min must have been caught by the thief.

610
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,640
He might have gone down the mountain.

611
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,840
I'll go down the mountain to chase him.

612
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,040
You hurry up and inform the people of Baichuanyuan

613
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:53,840
to go down the mountain to chase him.

614
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,480
Okay.

615
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,360
Fei?

616
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,120
Why are you here too?

617
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,680
Let me ask you.

618
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,040
Have you seen Miss Qiao?

619
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,840
It has nothing to do with me.

620
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,440
Wait.

621
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,080
Miss Qiao has nothing to do with you.

622
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,560
Have you seen Li Lianhua?

623
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,320
She said she was going to find someone,

624
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,240
but she was gone.

625
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,680
Did something happen?

626
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,800
You two have always been friends.

627
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,440
You have to care about where she went.

628
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,080
She told you that we have always been friends.

629
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,120
Interesting.

630
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,080
Explain yourself.

631
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,440
You're weird.

632
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,280
Xiang Yi.

633
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,280
Xiang Yi.

634
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,960
Xiang Yi.

635
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Miss Qiao.

636
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,560
Miss Qiao.

637
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,480
Are you okay?

638
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,480
I'm fine.

639
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,480
I'm fine.

640
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,480
I'm fine.

641
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,480
I'm fine.

642
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,480
I'm fine.

643
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,480
I'm fine.

644
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,600
I'm fine.

645
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,600
I'm fine.

646
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,600
I'm fine.

647
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,600
I'm fine.

648
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,600
I'm fine.

649
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,600
I'm fine.

650
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,520
When you were sick,

651
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,360
you were crying in your dream.

652
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,240
I have a pill.

653
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:45,800
You...

654
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,040
This sachet

655
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,440
is what I found

656
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,600
on the beach

657
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,000
when I was doing my medical work in the East Sea.

658
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,680
Is there only

659
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,160
this sachet that you found?

660
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,360
At that time,

661
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,000
many people died on the beach.

662
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,760
This sachet

663
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,880
was what I found

664
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,680
in one of the bodies.

665
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,760
What's wrong, Miss Qiao?

666
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,360
What did you see?

667
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,480
What did you see

668
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,600
when you saw him?

669
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,560
I don't remember it clearly.

670
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,520
But I remember that

671
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,240
he was about twenty years old.

672
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,960
I can't see his face clearly.

673
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,280
There seems to be a

674
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,840
Buddha's string on his wrist.

675
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,640
I made that for him.

676
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,240
So, this is a friend of Miss Qiao's.

677
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,760
I could only

678
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,240
go back to ask for help.

679
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,960
But I didn't expect that

680
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,240
when I came back,

681
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,680
he was already taken away by the waves.

682
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,080
Now that I think about it,

683
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,240
I'm really sorry.

684
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,400
Don't say it.

685
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,420
When was the

686
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,400
time you found him?

687
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,680
Then when?

688
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,680
In aaps,

689
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,920
I think there's ten years

690
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,320
before you were able to find it.

691
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,320
If you count it like this,

692
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,320
it's probably been ten years.

693
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,320
I'm sorry, A'Ming.

694
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,320
Even though you're sad,

695
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,320
I can't help but look at you.

696
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,320
I can see that

697
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,320
she's been loyal to you.

698
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,320
Don't say it.

699
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,320
You should also love her.

700
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,320
Don't make it hard for yourself.

701
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,320
You must be happy in the future.

702
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,320
Miss Qiao,

703
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,320
I'll take you back.

704
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,320
Stop!

705
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,320
Don't touch her!

706
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,320
What is Master Xiao doing?

707
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,320
He's trying to harm A'Ming.

708
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,320
It's his duty.

709
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,320
If anything happens to A'Ming,

710
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,320
I'll kill him.

711
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,320
You hurt people without asking why.

712
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,320
You're still from the Four Gu Sect.

713
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,320
Four Gu Sect has been separated for ten years.

714
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,320
How can you say that?

715
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,320
I'm taking this thief away with me.

716
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,320
Master Xiao,

717
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,320
you're too much.

718
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,320
Bai Chuan will at least

719
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,320
give us a good chance.

720
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,320
If you dare to bully my friends,

721
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,320
don't blame me for being shameless.

722
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,320
Master Xiao, don't misunderstand.

723
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,320
I just happened to meet Miss Qiao.

724
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,320
I was taken into the tunnel

725
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,320
and then I followed her.

726
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,320
You dare to make up a story about saving A'Ming.

727
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,320
You deserve it.

728
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,320
Si Jin, stop!

729
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,320
I won't bother you anymore.

730
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,320
I'll take A'Ming back.

731
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,320
A'Ming, come.

732
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,320
What's wrong with Xiao Zi Jing?

733
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,320
The Young Hall Leader of Tian Ji Hall is indeed powerful.

734
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,320
But you and the current hero,

735
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,320
Si Po Li,

736
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,320
how can you get into Bai Chuan?

737
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,320
I just can't stand

738
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,320
his attitude of bullying people.

739
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,320
I don't care about him.

740
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,320
How are you?

741
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,320
I'm fine.

742
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,320
Miss Qiao is here.

743
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,320
Brother,

744
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,320
how's Miss Qiao?

745
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,320
The inflammation is spreading.

746
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,320
Fortunately, she took medicine from Doctor Li

747
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,320
and is now okay.

748
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,320
Did Miss Qiao

749
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,320
say anything else?

750
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,320
Why would Doctor Li

751
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,320
dare to save her?

752
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,320
Miss Qiao,

753
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,320
don't you think

754
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,320
Doctor Li seems familiar to her?

755
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,320
Bi Qiu,

756
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,320
what is it you want to ask?

757
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,600
What do you want to ask?

758
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,280
Don't you think

759
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,800
the appearance of the lotus

760
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,640
is similar to that of the master?

761
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,440
The poison of tea

762
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,320
is not only to take the antidote in time,

763
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,240
but also

764
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,920
to make fun of the golden needle.

765
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,920
These years,

766
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,240
there are fewer liars who pretend to be the master.

767
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,600
If the poison is cured,

768
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,200
why don't they tell us

769
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,240
that it's boring?

770
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,560
Besides this poison over empire,

771
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,040
should the poisonnap yelling call Mexico?

772
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,760
I think

773
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,720
we should narrator

774
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:09,800
her power

775
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,200
with afterÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾Ðµ.

776
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,800
Yes, Bi Qiu.

777
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,160
I think

778
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,200
her age, capacity, and martial arts

779
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,200
don't look like that of the master.

780
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,160
It's only the appearance of the lotus that's sweetheart,

781
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,720
but those look different.

782
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,960
Brother, I think

783
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,360
I should try again.

784
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,880
It's my fault for being muddled.

785
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,520
and you were driven crazy.

786
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,920
You didn't know it,

787
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,360
but you still poisoned her.

788
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,480
You've done it for a hundred times.

789
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,480
Enough.

790
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,120
Don't mention the past.

791
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,560
We four know that she was poisoned by the tea.

792
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,880
Don't spread it out.

793
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,240
She did mean to hurt you.

794
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,760
But she was poisoned by the witch's magic.

795
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,360
These years, she's been in the martial arts world.

796
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,720
She almost saw people who looked like her.

797
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,240
She went to visit her.

798
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,120
I'll never forgive her for what she did.

799
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,960
This...

800
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,240
Doctor Li.

801
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,000
You're the masters of the house?

802
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,560
You're weak.

803
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,560
Don't get up.

804
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,080
I'm sorry.

805
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,080
Thanks to you,

806
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,840
we could find the stone.

807
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,080
I brought it here today

808
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,880
to let you see it.

809
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,360
Please.

810
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,240
You're really good at joking.

811
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,560
I'm not qualified to be the sword master.

812
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,520
You're too serious.

813
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,800
Try it.

814
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,920
It's okay.

815
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,120
I'll try it.

816
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,400
I hope this is...

817
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,440
Please.

818
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,840
My cap.

819
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,480
Please keep it, Master.

820
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,760
It's heavy.

821
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,120
We didn't consider it carefully.

822
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,200
Doctor Li is weak.

823
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,280
He can't hold this sword.

824
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:13,960
It's a good sword.

825
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,600
Doctor Li,

826
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,000
I have a question.

827
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,680
Why don't you show your true face?

828
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,440
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

829
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,960
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

830
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,960
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

831
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,960
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

832
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,960
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

Life is too hasty.

872
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,960
Can't wait for the old heaven.

873
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,960
There will be a new day.

874
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,960
Change a god's wish.

875
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,960
Life is too hasty.

876
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,960
The blue mountains and waves are so beautiful.

877
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,960
Who doesn't want to let go of their old life?

878
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,960
Let's go.

879
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,960
