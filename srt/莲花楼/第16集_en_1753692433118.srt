00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Kissing

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
After four thousand times

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Thousands of times

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The most reluctant moment is that moment

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
On the earth

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A thousand miles of madness

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who never wanders

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Who doesn't know the distance between the stars and the moon

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
On the earth

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Youthful madness

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
A thousand times not drunk as in sorrow

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
A journey into the dream

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
On the earth

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
A thousand miles of madness

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Who never wanders

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Who doesn't know the distance between the stars and the moon

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
On the earth

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
A thousand times not drunk as in sorrow

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
A journey into the dream

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
On the earth

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The End

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
In order to cover up his own identity

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He has been hiding in Yuan Bao Villa for so many years

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
He actually put on such a cold hand

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Skin and flesh flow repeatedly

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
He just scratched it repeatedly

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I actually endured these pains

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
In the end, it didn't work

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What's going on

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Human syndrome

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
In fact, it is a family disease of the Jin clan in Yuan Bao Villa

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
My wife is the stepmother of the Golden Pagoda

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So I know this

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Since Donglin Golden Pagoda also has this rare disease

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That means they are also the descendants of the Jin family

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Are you telling the truth?

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The old owner of Yuan Bao Villa died of human syndrome

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You can find the old servant who grew up in the village

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Just ask

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
This Golden Pagoda must have escaped from the Bolan people

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
After using

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But found that there was no effect on my own human syndrome

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So it will go crazy

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
How would he know

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Golden Pagoda usually uses the Bolan people

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Also with

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The blood that was raised from the medicine factory

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The Bolan people were taken away by the Golden Pagoda

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It turned out that it was the gold butler

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
In order to cure his illness

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The community did all this

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
In the end, because the Bolan people

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Can't cure his human syndrome

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Desperate in the heart

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So I chose to commit suicide

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I don't think so

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Commander Qi Bing

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Didn't find the Bolan people

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's right that you didn't find it

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What does brother Li mean?

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Brother Yang

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You can send someone to the room of Golden Pagoda

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Check it out

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
See if you miss anything for the day

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Commander Bing

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Deputy Commander

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
There is not much else

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Just in my memory

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
A small flower pot is missing

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Flower pot

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So that's it

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But that flower pot

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I searched before

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
There is nothing hidden inside

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
There is nothing in this flower pot

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That means this

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Bolan people's head

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Is this flower pot

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I don't know

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What is this

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Flower pot

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
what

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This flower pot is much bigger than this box

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
How can it be put in

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Who told you

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
This box must be put

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Is the Bolan people's head

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Who of us

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Have seen the Bolan people's head

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Everyone has never seen this

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
How do you know

94
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What does it look like to put his box

95
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Golden Pagoda actually has fake things

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Donglin was tricked into the secret room

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That means

98
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
He hid the real Bolan people's head

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Already hidden

100
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
When we first entered the secret room

101
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The steward

102
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
On purpose gave us

103
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
A misguided guide

104
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
He opened the empty box

105
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Tell us the Bolan people's head is missing

106
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Bolan people's head

107
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Bolan people's head is missing

108
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Then everyone went to find it

109
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Can put in the head of this box

110
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And the real Bolan people's head

111
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Is this flower pot

112
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I just don't know

113
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I don't know

114
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I just don't know

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I just don't know

116
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I just don't know

117
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I just don't know

118
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm afraid this once in a while

119
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:56,580
A

120
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,220
房財

121
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,380
Wen Wen Amen

122
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,340
Wen Wen

123
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,180
Wen Wen

124
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,900
Wen Wen

125
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,180
Wen Wen

126
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,980
Wen Wen

127
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,180
Wen Wen

128
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,780
Wen Wen

129
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,940
why his hands are stretched out?

130
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,300
There is only one rope mark

131
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,060
on this beam.

132
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,860
If a person really committed suicide,

133
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,180
he would struggle because of the pain

134
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,340
and leave traces of many holes

135
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,540
on the beam.

136
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,140
And there is not only one

137
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,260
trace of Mingxi.

138
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,300
So,

139
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,020
is this N另外

140
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,100
committed suicide?

141
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,740
DD Kungyang,

142
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,820
do you know

143
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,820
your token name?

144
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,700
Em.

145
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,220
A little hit

146
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,060
is not enough

147
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,140
to make a strong man

148
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:08,820
completely lose his Ninja complex

149
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,700
and get pass the room.

150
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,260
You want to slander me?

151
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,260
You're still stubborn.

152
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,260
The biggest pharmacy in the town is the Jishi Hall.

153
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,260
Jin Changbao will go to Jin Mantang to get the medicine.

154
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,260
But in the past two years,

155
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,260
he has been taking two doses of medicine every time.

156
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,260
It means that he has been recovering from illness in the past two years.

157
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,260
Because he was worried that he would be exposed to Jin Mantang's identity,

158
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,260
so he carefully dug his own skin

159
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,260
so that he didn't show any signs of dandruff.

160
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,260
I'm afraid that he's not a good person.

161
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,260
But he was tortured by his illness all the time.

162
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,260
He wanted to solve this problem.

163
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,260
Don't misunderstand.

164
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,260
At this time, Donglin came to Jin Mantang

165
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,260
to get the medicine.

166
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,260
He found that Jin Mantang

167
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,260
locked Donglin in the secret room

168
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,260
to starve Donglin to death.

169
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,260
Hurry up.

170
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,260
Don't play tricks on me.

171
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,260
You're so stupid.

172
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,260
You're so stupid.

173
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,260
Don't play tricks on me.

174
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,260
I told you to give it to you.

175
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,260
What else do you want?

176
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,260
I don't want to be a headman.

177
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,260
I'll put it there.

178
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,260
It's there.

179
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,260
You want to run away?

180
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,260
Jin Mantang, let me out.

181
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,260
Jin Mantang.

182
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,260
At this time,

183
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,260
someone gave him an idea to kill people with a knife.

184
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,260
Jin Changbao did not follow the plan.

185
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,260
He successfully solved Jin Mantang and Donglin.

186
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,260
And in the absence of any clues,

187
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,260
he took away the head of the person who hid in his room.

188
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,260
If I guess it right,

189
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,260
this person is your father.

190
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,260
Gongyang Wu Men.

191
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,260
Li Lianhua.

192
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,260
Gongyang Senior is highly respected.

193
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,260
Don't talk nonsense.

194
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,260
The reason why I'm so sure

195
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,260
is because of the evidence.

196
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,260
г

197
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,260
This is a western medicine recipe

198
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,260
the Jin Mantang is using recently.

199
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,260
I got it from the medicine store

200
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,260
I took from it.

201
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,260
This recipe and the medicine recipe of the old days

202
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,260
the Western medicine is different.

203
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,260
There is an extra Russian.

204
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,260
Russianpezcine will speed up

205
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,260
the mut pair eventually.

206
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,260
This way,

207
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,260
we can before Kim Man Tang

208
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,260
more frequent use the head of the people in Boran.

209
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,260
and insert to the distance gold Changbao has the most opportunities to use.

210
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,500
And the time of the medicine was 17 days ago.

211
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,900
Donglin went to find Jin Mantang.

212
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,340
He locked Jin Mantang in the room.

213
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:46,260
And he was the one who brought the senior to the town.

214
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,780
Nonsense.

215
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,620
When did I come to this town?

216
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,260
How can you know?

217
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,780
It's not difficult.

218
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,380
For me,

219
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,540
I just went to the rat's den to check my father's name.

220
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,700
I found the foreign man Lu Yin.

221
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,460
How can you still argue with him?

222
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,340
Jin Mantang

223
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,700
And the unexpected discovery.

224
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,940
The letter to Jin Mantang

225
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,860
is exactly the same as the handwriting on the prescription.

226
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,380
Senior Gongyang,

227
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,940
did you not expect that

228
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,300
someone would check this prescription

229
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,700
and ignore his own handwriting?

230
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,740
I know.

231
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,300
You and Jin Changbao are a good match.

232
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,060
So you created the appearance of someone who wanted to kill Jin Mantang.

233
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,420
And you took his treasure

234
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,980
just to make him

235
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,460
save his life and become famous.

236
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,100
The purpose is to make you enter Yuanbao Villa

237
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,420
with a clear mind.

238
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,100
So what?

239
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,180
As a man of good character,

240
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,180
I have been curious about

241
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,140
the capable and capable Bolan people

242
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,660
who have been rumored for a long time.

243
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,340
How can you say that

244
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,020
I killed Jin Changbao

245
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,980
when you entered the villa?

246
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,260
He didn't say that

247
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,740
you killed him.

248
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,780
He...

249
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,500
I didn't expect that he would be so stubborn.

250
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,900
Senior Gongyang.

251
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,380
It seems that I can only give you another evidence.

252
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,940
Senior,

253
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,340
sorry for the inconvenience.

254
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,140
Jin Changbao agreed to cooperate with Senior Gongyang.

255
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,380
But he didn't trust you completely.

256
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,260
He must have proposed to let Senior Gongyang

257
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,220
treat him.

258
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,940
So he traded the Bolan head for it.

259
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,180
Senior Gongyang is also suffering from this.

260
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,460
That day, you followed Miss Zhiyu.

261
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,500
But you didn't expect that

262
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,500
you really found out the secret of Zhiyu's blood.

263
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,860
So Gongyang Wumen

264
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,380
exchanged Zhiyu's blood and Jin Changbao's.

265
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,820
He took the Bolan head from the driver

266
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,260
and killed him.

267
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,380
Unfortunately,

268
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,620
Senior

269
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,860
didn't take the blood of Zhiyu.

270
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,340
So you used your blood to cheat Jin Changbao.

271
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,460
Poor Jin Changbao

272
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,140
thought that he got the blood of Bolan head

273
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,340
and Zhiyu.

274
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,540
His condition would be better.

275
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,380
But it didn't work at all.

276
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,260
That's why he was so mad.

277
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,540
Then you took this opportunity

278
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,980
to kill him.

279
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,460
Nonsense.

280
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,460
You just hurt him.

281
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,180
Why do you say so many stories?

282
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,860
Okay.

283
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,900
I really prepared the third evidence.

284
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,020
Wait.

285
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,140
You said Gongyang Wumen killed Jin Changbao.

286
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,820
We searched his body.

287
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,380
But we didn't find out his identity.

288
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,260
We checked him but we didn't find any poison.

289
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,140
If he didn't commit suicide,

290
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,140
how did he die?

291
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,820
I heard that Senior Gongyang Wumen

292
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,420
had 68 needles.

293
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,740
The needle went back to the spring with the temple guard.

294
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,380
There are 57 needles in this needle box.

295
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,540
There are 10 needles on Jin Changbao's head.

296
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,540
One more.

297
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,780
It's here.

298
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,180
You are the murderer.

299
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,660
Gongyang Wumen.

300
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,220
Commander.

301
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,060
Deputy Commander.

302
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,700
We found the poison in Gongyang Wumen's bag.

303
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,820
In Gongyang Wumen's room,

304
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,020
we found the same flower petals in Jin Mantang's room.

305
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,020
It was really a human head after he woke up.

306
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,020
This is the human head of Bolan.

307
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,260
Leave us.

308
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,260
Yes.

309
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,220
Since we caught the murderer,

310
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,260
we have found the human head of Bolan.

311
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,660
I will take the witness and evidence back to the Supervisory Department.

312
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,260
Wait.

313
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,540
Deputy Commander.

314
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,700
You forgot that

315
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,100
the imperial court has the rules of martial arts.

316
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,540
This is the Jianghu matter.

317
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,300
We should deal with it in the Supervisory Department.

318
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,660
It's not your Supervisory Department's responsibility.

319
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,940
I will take care of it.

320
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,780
So what?

321
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,700
The rules should be changed.

322
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,220
Today, I will show you

323
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,740
the power of Supervisory Department.

324
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,140
Put the witness and evidence back.

325
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,660
Who dares to touch my people?

326
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,140
Piao Yun Chun, you...

327
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,940
As the Deputy Supervisor of Supervisory Department,

328
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,620
I order you to leave the Yuan Bao Villa immediately.

329
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,780
The rest of the members

330
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,340
will be handled by the Banchuan Court.

331
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,940
Don't forget that I am the Supervisor.

332
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,700
You are all Supervisory Department's elite.

333
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,380
You have worked with me for many years.

334
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,740
You should know the duty and rules of Supervisory Department.

335
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,100
Deputy Supervisor Yang is right.

336
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,140
According to the law,

337
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,980
we have no right to intervene in this matter.

338
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,820
How dare you disobey my order?

339
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,180
If you still don't stop,

340
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,380
I will have to arrest the Yuzi Tianlong Order.

341
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,540
If you don't stop,

342
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,460
I will have to arrest the Yuzi Tianlong Order.

343
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,260
You have violated Supervisory Department's principle

344
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,420
and become the barrier.

345
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,020
Do you want me to do it here

346
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,380
or take you back to the capital?

347
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,740
Okay.

348
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,020
Supervisory Department finally has some courage.

349
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,100
Take it.

350
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,500
From now on,

351
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,660
you are officially a member of our Banchuan Court.

352
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,580
In the future,

353
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,540
you can't be bullied by Supervisory Department.

354
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,820
Thank you, Supervisor.

355
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,900
I didn't expect you to receive a letter so soon.

356
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:55,940
Come on.

357
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,020
Did you see it?

358
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,780
You should stop interfering in our Banchuan Court.

359
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,860
I am not as good as you.

360
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,460
But you shouldn't be arrogant.

361
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,580
The Great Sage is rising in the martial arts world

362
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,980
and is close to the court.

363
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,660
Sooner or later,

364
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,500
I will take your Banchuan Court as my own.

365
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,180
You won't be satisfied for long.

366
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,900
I've got this.

367
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:25,980
Mrs. Chi,

368
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,520
you are in trouble.

369
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,620
This treasure box and Gongy Bronze洋 FA were from the Banchuan Court.

370
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,500
Master Shi.

371
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,380
Mr. Yang,

372
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,580
I have an incurable human Physician right handed by Jewel.

373
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,180
Those Persians can only cure their diseases.

374
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,980
Please look over my disease

375
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,700
for several years.

376
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,140
If I'm able to cure it,

377
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,180
please let me know quickly.

378
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,500
for the sake of my family.

379
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,620
I borrowed the head of Bolan

380
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,220
to save my son's life.

381
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,140
Mr. Jian,

382
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,860
I heard that the head of Bolan

383
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,620
is a congenital disease.

384
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,340
It takes a long time to produce blood.

385
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,340
It's not good.

386
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,500
Mr. Jian,

387
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,780
do you really want to do this?

388
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,460
Mr. Jian, please get up.

389
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,620
I remember that in the palace,

390
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,340
I heard an old imperial doctor remind me

391
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,900
that he has been suffering from congenital disease for half a lifetime.

392
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,740
He wants to get what he wants.

393
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,420
Although he can't cure it,

394
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,380
he can control the condition.

395
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,420
He doesn't have the need to risk his life.

396
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,860
I can recommend him to you.

397
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,340
Great Khan is generous.

398
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,260
I have nothing to return.

399
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,460
Please accept my bow.

400
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,100
No need.

401
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:20,940
No need.

402
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,380
Wait.

403
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,100
During the illness,

404
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,540
he will get Mr. Jian,

405
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,420
who is easily controlled.

406
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,140
I don't want to lose him.

407
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,180
But,

408
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,620
we just made his memories come back.

409
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,500
Mr. Jian,

410
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,780
this is nothing behind you.

411
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,220
What?

412
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,180
He finally appeared.

413
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,960
I built the barrier

414
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,260
for him to cross over into.

415
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,420
Mr. Lin,

416
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,900
you have a reason to be here.

417
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,260
You can control the possessed element by yourself.

418
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:17,940
You can know...

419
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,540
It's so wonderful.

420
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,100
It must be the reason why it's called the Blue Human Head.

421
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,140
It's a good thing.

422
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,860
This Blue Human Head

423
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,940
is really powerful.

424
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,820
You're a treasure,

425
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,460
but you killed so many people.

426
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,660
Do you know if it's saving or harming people?

427
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,020
Put it down.

428
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,660
Come on.

429
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,180
What's this?

430
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,260
This thing is not simple.

431
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,260
Jin Mantang actually put it

432
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,260
and the Blue Human Head together.

433
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,420
It looks like a South Indian tattoo.

434
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,020
In the first grade,

435
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,260
it seemed to have such a tattoo.

436
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,140
I can't remember it clearly.

437
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,580
Before the South Indian came to the country,

438
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,860
they did make friends with the Central Plains.

439
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,180
They even had a marriage.

440
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,700
Jin Mantang also has

441
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,260
a hobby of collecting T-shirts.

442
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,740
Maybe he just

443
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,660
collected the treasure

444
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,700
that came back from the South India.

445
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,260
Forget it.

446
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,700
It doesn't matter what kind of treasure it is.

447
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,100
It's not worth anything.

448
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,180
Put it back.

449
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:32,940
I've put it down.

450
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,140
Be careful.

451
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:37,660
Come on.

452
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:44,900
Come on.

453
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,620
The moon is so beautiful tonight.

454
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,460
What are you going to do next?

455
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,740
It seems that

456
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,940
your words have nothing to do with it.

457
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,980
Stop nagging.

458
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,260
I studied

459
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,180
at the Imperial College of the Imperial College of the Imperial Family.

460
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,260
My literature is very good.

461
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,460
I just want to ask you.

462
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,420
Since I also picked up the piano,

463
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,980
I also got the shape brand.

464
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,020
How about you and I

465
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,140
go through the martial arts world together?

466
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,420
No.

467
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,460
Why?

468
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:12,700
My martial arts

469
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,620
and your brain

470
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,220
will definitely make the world famous.

471
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,060
What about after that?

472
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:16,980
After that,

473
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:18,420
we can become

474
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,500
the heroes of the world

475
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,260
and help the world to maintain justice.

476
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,140
That's great.

477
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,500
What about after that?

478
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:25,940
After that,

479
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,780
we can be the heroes

480
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,740
and become a legend.

481
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,980
That's the most decent end

482
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,140
of being a hero.

483
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,660
What else?

484
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,100
What else?

485
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,260
Let's go to the sun

486
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,220
and fish.

487
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,620
Don't mention the comfort.

488
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,780
Then,

489
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,980
I'm just like this now.

490
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,500
Why do I have to wait until after that?

491
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,820
How can it be the same?

492
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,300
At least, you have to go to the peak of the martial arts world

493
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,980
and go to the highest place of the martial arts world.

494
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,180
I've been to that high place.

495
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,780
It's boring.

496
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,100
You're talking nonsense.

497
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,140
The highest place you've been to

498
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,300
is the second-level building of the Mount Ling Sect.

499
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,180
Tell me.

500
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,460
Or where do you want to go?

501
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,660
I can accompany you.

502
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,580
Where do I want to go?

503
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:21,780
Where?

504
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,540
I want to go to the hair salon.

505
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,260
You don't have to follow me here.

506
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,260
Take it.

507
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,220
Hurry up.

508
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,060
Slow down.

509
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,180
This martial arts is really bad.

510
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,940
I'll teach you a good lesson next time.

511
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,620
Where should I go with the money?

512
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:08,900
There's no password here.

513
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,140
Don't be self-fan Mustang start

514
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,060
or you won't get through.

515
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,860
I don't know how to use privacy or the heater.

516
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,420
What,

517
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,300
but you can do it.

518
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,020
Can I do it?

519
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,140
Of course.

520
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,100
Hurry up and go.

521
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,220
Leave it here.

522
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,580
It depends on your ability.

523
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,500
It's quite cold up here.

524
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,260
Why hasn't he come back yet?

525
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,260
Did he run away again?

526
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:28,840
Be strong,

527
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,740
and make sure you don't get hurt.

528
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,040
Hurry and leave!

529
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,140
This...

530
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,200
Hurry!

531
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,400
Who is this brave man Bai Yi?

532
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,260
Darn!

533
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,900
Where is Li Lianhua?

534
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,860
Hey, let's see.

535
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,500
Wake up.

536
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,380
Why am I here?

537
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,340
I shouldn't have come to the wrong room.

538
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,980
What wrong room?

539
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,060
You had WFD, didn't you?

540
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,460
What are you talking about?

541
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,980
The Pearl of Zongzheng just appeared.

542
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,980
I wanted to steal it away.

543
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,780
Luckily, a hero of Bai Yi appeared

544
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,580
and saved her.

545
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,380
Bai...

546
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,100
What?

547
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,820
That hero of Bai Yi

548
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,300
must be a master of the world.

549
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,140
He could use a branch as a sword

550
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,340
and beat the Pearl of Zongzheng with one move.

551
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,060
You don't know that sword.

552
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:45,980
It's so fast.

553
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,540
It can't see the truth.

554
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,020
When the sword is in his hand,

555
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,500
it's like a snake.

556
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,420
When the sword comes out,

557
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,860
it's like a mountain.

558
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,180
Except my master, Li Xiangyi,

559
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,940
I've never seen such a powerful person.

560
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:57,940
You're so...

561
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,940
so powerful.

562
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,420
You don't know martial arts.

563
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,540
Why do I tell you this?

564
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,420
Let's see if I lost something.

565
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,540
Why did I lose the ice?

566
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,620
Why did you lose the ice?

567
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,060
The Pearl of Zongzheng was taken away?

568
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,100
No wonder.

569
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,460
It turns out that the Pearl of Zongzheng

570
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,220
has always wanted

571
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,700
not the head of the Bolan people,

572
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,020
but the ice.

573
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,580
What's the use of the ice?

574
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,740
Is it worth its great effort?

575
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,660
I don't know about that.

576
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,380
I'll explain it to them.

577
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:18,780
Come.

578
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,300
Take this.

579
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,060
Why did you� for pushing him into the treasure hut

580
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,260
in the middle of the night?

581
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,860
What's wrong?

582
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,220
The Pearl of Zongzheng

583
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,560
took away an ice plate.

584
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,480
Nanyin?

585
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,260
Do you guys have the taste of getting Dialogue?

586
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,600
This...

587
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,520
This...

588
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,160
This is Double Pay.

589
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,560
Double Pay?

590
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,860
What is it about?

591
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,400
I heard it from my grandfather.

592
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,320
I heard about the Heart Mist and there was Five Nights at the Dream Hotel.

593
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,800
This is a kind of

594
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,480
hunting.

595
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,280
They picked the most common white garden

596
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,560
and carefully raised it to an adult.

597
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,960
Then they pulled the skin of the white garden

598
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,960
and made it into a bone.

599
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,960
They also used its bones to make a bone stick.

600
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,360
They said that the bones

601
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,520
that were made like this

602
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,560
could only hurt their spirit.

603
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,680
Is this ancient man so cruel?

604
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,200
So the scent

605
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,960
was triggered by the bones.

606
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,280
This smell

607
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,800
is the same as the previous one

608
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,160
that was used by Miss Zhiyu.

609
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,120
That's right.

610
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,680
It's this smell.

611
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,800
Why is there such a scent?

612
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,920
I heard from Miss Zhiyu before

613
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,160
that this kind of incense can

614
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,280
bury the pain

615
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,680
and bring joy.

616
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,760
I was wondering

617
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,520
that there was such a thing in the world.

618
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,480
Look, there's more here.

619
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,600
I smelled this scent

620
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,600
in the room of the Golden Gate Hall before.

621
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,400
I felt very familiar with it.

622
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,720
I always thought that it was

623
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,440
the scent of Miss Zhiyu.

624
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,280
I didn't expect that

625
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,000
I smelled this scent

626
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,360
a long time ago.

627
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,200
Senior's body

628
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,800
was the scent of this body.

629
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,360
The scent of this body

630
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,000
that Senior left behind

631
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
was this scent.

632
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,440
Yu Lianhua, what are you thinking?

633
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,600
I just feel very suspicious.

634
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,520
This Nan Ying has disappeared for nearly a hundred years.

635
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,560
Why did the Golden Gate Hall

636
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,000
collect so much

637
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,040
Nan Ying's items?

638
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,880
And this ID card

639
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,880
is also very rare in the Central Plains.

640
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,400
Could it be

641
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,040
that her ancestor was Nan Ying?

642
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,880
When I saw the Red Mountain Wood,

643
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,160
I felt strange.

644
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,000
The Golden Gate Hall

645
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,680
was supposed to be a wood business.

646
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,240
How could it be a rich country?

647
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,600
It's almost like our Tianji Mountain Village.

648
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,440
There must be something wrong with it.

649
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,440
We need to report to Bai Chuan Yuan

650
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,440
and have them investigate this matter.

651
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,880
Miss Su,

652
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,080
I have another task

653
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,080
to ask you for help.

654
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:27,960
Go ahead.

655
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,080
The lost ID card is Nan Ying.

656
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,120
Miss Su has been following the book

657
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,160
of the ten thousand people since she was a child.

658
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,000
Could you help me

659
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,640
to find out what Nan Ying means?

660
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,800
This is simple.

661
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,880
But if I help you this time,

662
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,360
what will you give me in return?

663
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,960
You said that

664
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,320
to make Li Lian Hua

665
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,320
marry you.

666
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,240
That's right.

667
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:51,760
Don't offend me.

668
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,920
But

669
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,920
I wanted Li Lian Hua

670
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,440
to make a meal for me.

671
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,440
That's easy to say.

672
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,320
Jin Yuan Sect

673
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,720
By your death,

674
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,280
why does your body

675
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,040
smell like the scent of Nan Ying's bones?

676
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,960
The reward

677
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,960
is prominent.

678
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,640
Shan Gu Dao was killed because of his sword or hairs left under hisNext lord

679
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,400
was the only person in his third lord

680
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,760
a person during the search for wings.

681
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,040
He made a mistake.

682
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,880
I punished him to pay for his right hand for a month.

683
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,040
Even if he did,

684
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,560
it should be left-handed.

685
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,080
There's no way he would have killed your senior brother with his right hand.

686
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,880
Could it be that Senior Brother's death

687
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,920
wasn't really done by the Golden Thread Embroidery?

688
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,320
Yu!

689
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,160
Sect Leader!

690
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,720
What's wrong?

691
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,600
The second sect leader was surrounded by the third king of the Golden Thread Embroidery in Yangsha Valley.

692
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,400
The danger is still there.

693
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,520
Sect Leader, hurry and save the second sect leader!

694
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,120
Get up!

695
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,320
We'll follow the second sect leader out to do our work.

696
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,800
We'll make a fuss about the third king of the Golden Thread Embroidery taking advantage of us.

697
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,240
We won't be able to hold our ground.

698
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,640
The second sect leader will immediately send someone to report to us.

699
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,800
We'll follow the second sect leader to fight with our blood.

700
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,440
In the end, in order to protect our subordinates,

701
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,240
the second sect leader led the third king away on his own.

702
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,760
When we arrived,

703
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,960
the second sect leader...

704
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,640
the second sect leader was already dead.

705
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,440
The sword on his body was from the King of Yan's order.

706
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,560
If we had known this earlier,

707
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,360
we wouldn't have dared to ally with them.

708
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,480
The Golden Thread Embroidery has been deceiving us too much.

709
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,400
Do we still have to endure it like this?

710
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,720
Blood will be shed.

711
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,680
Blood will be shed!

712
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,320
If the Earth and the Sky are not connected,

713
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,600
then it's not only related to Senior Brother's death,

714
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,200
but also to the lives of the 58 brothers of the Fourth Sect.

715
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,280
No.

716
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,720
I must continue investigating.

717
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,680
I will never let Senior Brother and the 58 brothers

718
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,280
die without a clear reason.

719
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,640
Li Lianhua!

720
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,240
Thank you for the delicious food. It's delicious.

721
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,040
But my grandfather sent a letter yesterday

722
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,640
saying that he wants me to go back.

723
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,560
Don't worry. I will definitely help you investigate

724
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,480
the matter that you have entrusted to me.

725
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,800
Thank you then.

726
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,600
Goodbye.

727
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,920
You're leaving?

728
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,920
You're not going to see me off?

729
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,520
I have the guts to be a hand in hand with the Golden Thread Embroidery and the Fourth Sect.

730
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,120
I'm afraid that I won't be able to stand on my feet behind this matter.

731
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,320
I will be living and dying in this life.

732
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,120
I can't let this rascal be involved with me again.

733
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,920
Moreover, if I continue to act rashly,

734
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:49,520
I will be able to step out of my position sooner or later.

735
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,520
Li Lianhua,

736
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,920
how are you thinking about the matter that I told you last night?

737
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,920
I can go anywhere.

738
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,120
I'm talking to you. What are you thinking about?

739
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,520
I'm calculating how long it will take for a hundred stars

740
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,120
to send the signal to this Tianji Mountain.

741
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,320
What stars?

742
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,720
The stars that your aunt gave her.

743
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,720
Who gave her the signal?

744
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,120
Li Lianhua, just jokingly saying it three times is enough.

745
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,720
Do you really think that I won't be angry?

746
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,120
I'm used to being alone.

747
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,120
I don't want to be too close to someone.

748
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,720
This Lotus Tower isn't big either.

749
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,320
It can only accommodate one person.

750
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,120
If there's one more person, it's a problem.

751
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,920
Moreover, I already told you

752
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,320
that I'm not interested in Chang'an at all.

753
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,520
If it wasn't for Shan Budang's sake,

754
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,720
I owe him a favor.

755
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,520
I wouldn't have helped you.

756
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,520
Now that your piano has been broken,

757
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,320
we can only go our separate ways.

758
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,520
You're not interested in Chang'an?

759
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,520
Then why did you let Su Xiaowong help you find out the ice?

760
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,320
No.

761
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,520
Do you think that there's a danger in there

762
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,920
and you don't want me to participate?

763
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,920
Young Master Fang,

764
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,120
in the martial arts world, people rely on themselves.

765
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,320
I'm not the one who's always behind me.

766
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,920
You also said that

767
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,920
I was the one who helped you solve all your problems.

768
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,720
If you don't want to be a useless young master,

769
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,120
you have to learn to walk on your own.

770
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,120
Good for you.

771
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,320
You're always looking at me like that.

772
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,120
We're not on the same page.

773
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,120
We're not on the same path.

774
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,320
You're so different from the others.

775
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,720
I, Fang Duo Bin, have never thought of becoming your trouble.

776
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,920
If that's the case,

777
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,320
then I, a useless young master,

778
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,320
don't need to bother you.

779
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,120
Goodbye.

780
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,920
I'll beat you to a pulp if I'm here!

781
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,320
Then ...

782
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:20,940
Yes.

783
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:26,840
Families deserve their people to be family.

784
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,420
Stop!

785
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,660
You Modern velvet included.

786
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:42,060
They're after you even more than the people I love.

787
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,120
You know when they ask how you feel?

788
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,200
After being infected by such disease,

789
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,420
you didn't dare to talk about pregnancy.

790
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,420
Hello.

791
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,620
Xiao Yi, where are you?

792
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,620
Why are you tying me up here?

793
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,020
Xiao Yi!

794
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,020
Li Lian Hua.

795
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,420
We'll meet again in the mountains and rivers.

796
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,420
I'll be your dog if I'm here.

797
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,820
Mr. Li.

798
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,620
Thank you for helping me

799
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,620
take down this young master of the family.

800
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,620
May I ask you

801
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,620
to come to Tianji Villa

802
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,820
so that I can be treated with good feelings?

803
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,220
You don't have to be so polite.

804
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,820
We're so close.

805
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,820
Why are you so polite?

806
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,020
Just call me Xiao Feng.

807
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,020
Miss Xiao Feng,

808
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,020
I have a question.

809
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,420
Is it convenient to ask?

810
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,220
Xiao Feng is a man of his word.

811
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,420
The ancient sects have been passed down from generation to generation.

812
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,220
Are you the godfather of the disease?

813
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,820
How do you know?

814
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,420
Mr. Li, what's the word?

815
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,820
Is it a word that means

816
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,220
I'm a man of my word?

817
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,220
Are you joking with Xiao Feng?

818
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:53,020
Mr. Li, your words are so interesting.

819
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,020
Miss Hua,

820
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,620
I have some other things to do.

821
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,020
I won't bother you.

822
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,620
By the way,

823
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,220
Mr. Li doesn't have a place to stay.

824
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,220
Miss Qiao An Min has to take Tianji Hall

825
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,820
to transfer her wedding invitation to Mr. Li.

826
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,020
I just got there.

827
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,620
I'll leave then.

828
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,620
Xiao Yi, what's wrong with you?

829
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,420
How can you tie me up with the public security guards?

830
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,420
I'm afraid you'll run away.

831
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,220
Why would I run away? I'll just go back with you.

832
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,620
Don't move.

833
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,220
Mr. Shi, I'm relieved to have you escort me.

834
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,020
Sister Shi, what a coincidence.

835
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:30,820
Don't mind it.

836
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,020
The elders in our family

837
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,020
like to be so nice to the younger generation.

838
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,220
That's right.

839
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,620
The young master is uneducated and unworthy.

840
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,820
The child is ungrateful and unbehaved.

841
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:41,820
He's trapped.

842
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,020
I'll see where he runs to.

843
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,620
You're making a scene like me.

844
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,420
I'm trapped

845
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,020
to go back to eat, drink and be a young master.

846
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,420
You're different.

847
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,820
You'll be locked up in the 188th prison.

848
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,020
The prison is for the most vicious people in history.

849
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,620
Enjoy yourself.

850
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,620
Mr. Fang,

851
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,020
your birth mother, He Xiao Lan,

852
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,620
almost died when she was pregnant with you.

853
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,020
But I'll come to save you.

854
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:14,420
You have to repay me for saving your life.

855
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,020
What a joke.

856
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,820
What are you talking about?

857
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,020
He Xiao Lan is my second aunt.

858
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:20,820
You know that?

859
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,420
I've checked with Mr. He and Mr. Fang.

860
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,020
They're not related.

861
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,820
Mr. Fang is old.

862
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,420
He and Miss He are pregnant.

863
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,820
They'll be together for ten days.

864
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:34,820
If you want to know your real identity,

865
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,820
you have to save me first.

866
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,820
Don't talk nonsense.

867
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,020
Fine.

868
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,820
Since Mr. Fang doesn't want to save me,

869
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,820
I'll do it myself.

870
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,420
What are you talking about?

871
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,420
Take her away.

872
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,620
Master, it's late.

873
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,220
I'll take my young master back.

874
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,420
See you.

875
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,220
Master,

876
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,620
the Guoyang Wu Gate has been robbed.

877
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,420
Who is it?

878
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,820
Yan Jia Che, the late emperor.

879
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,420
Late emperor?

880
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,420
It's Prince Jing Yu.

881
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,620
Thank you for saving me.

882
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,620
What a waste.

883
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,820
You still want to save her?

884
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,220
She's not good at martial arts.

885
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,220
But she's a good hand at curing diseases and poisons.

886
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,620
It'll work.

887
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,020
It's a busy day.

888
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,220
She's really invincible.

889
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,220
She's very tough.

890
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,420
Of course.

891
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:59,220
But it's just that the price is too expensive.

892
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,020
It's just one or two.

893
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,220
Don't worry, Qiao.

894
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,420
I've almost emptied the jade city's treasure house.

895
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,220
I'll prepare the materials one by one.

896
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,820
If you want to build a few,

897
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,020
it's not a problem.

898
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,420
By then, you'll be able to kill all the people.

899
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,420
What kind of seven-door sects and the hundred-spear graces

900
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,420
can be used to fight against the Golden Abyss Alliance?

901
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,420
You did a good job.

902
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,220
Where's Luo Mo Tian Bin?

903
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,420
By the way,

904
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,620
is Li Xiang Yi dead or not?

905
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,820
What do you mean?

906
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,420
I met someone in Yuan Bao Villa.

907
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,820
He used one of Xiang Yi's eunuchs.

908
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,420
You told me about it.

909
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:50,020
He's a lowly man.

910
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,420
What kind of person is he?

911
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,820
He's a masked man.

912
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,020
But I'm sure it's the same trick.

913
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,820
And he's very skilled.

914
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,420
He only uses a few swords

915
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,620
to make me lose all my power.

916
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,420
But his internal force seems to be a little weak.

917
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,220
That's why I got the time to escape.

918
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,220
Who else in this world

919
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,220
can use Xiang Yi's eunuch to this extent?

920
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,620
Impossible.

921
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,420
He's already dead.

922
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,220
The poison of Bicha is the poison of the world.

923
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,420
How can he let Li Tao Sheng die?

924
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,620
There's no such thing as a certain death.

925
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,220
The enemy is alive.

926
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,820
Why can't Li Xiang Yi be lucky once?

927
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,020
If that's the case,

928
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:33,820
I'll make him die again.

929
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,420
You hate him so much?

930
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:40,620
There's no man in this world who doesn't look at me.

931
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,220
Except for the one I've been following,

932
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,820
it's Li Xiang Yi.

933
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,820
The girl from the Wind Spirit Sword Sect

934
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,220
always came to me to provoke me.

935
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:55,020
I've been trying to stop her from being afraid.

936
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,420
She saw her teachers and sisters

937
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:00,020
being burned into ashes in front of me.

938
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,820
It's all her doing.

939
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,220
Who knew that Li Xiang Yi would come to stop me?

940
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,220
I'm so sorry for her.

941
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,220
She still won't let me go.

942
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:13,220
She looks at me like she's looking at a dead person.

943
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:18,020
If it wasn't for you,

944
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,820
I would have died

945
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:22,020
under the sword of Xiang Yi.

946
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,820
Although you saved me,

947
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:29,820
you blamed me for it.

948
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:33,420
I'll send the whole thing

949
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:37,220
to Li Xiang Yi.

950
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:40,020
How can I not hate her?

951
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,820
Xiang Yi's eunuch.

952
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:51,420
Do you think it's Li Xiang Yi?

953
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,820
So what?

954
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:56,820
Li Xiang Yi was your only opponent before.

955
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,820
Now you know she might be alive.

956
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,220
Aren't you curious?

957
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,620
It's my own business.

958
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,020
You don't have to guess.

959
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,220
I didn't mean that.

960
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,020
How about I kill her

961
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,820
and cook you a dish of wine?

962
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,620
So that you won't be hurt

963
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:12,220
by her for all those years.

964
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:18,020
I only obey your orders

965
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,220
and obey your orders.

966
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,820
I'm sorry.

967
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,020
I'll serve you to change your clothes.

968
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,620
I don't need you to serve me.

969
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,420
I'll do what you should do.

970
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,420
I want to serve you.

971
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:37,420
That's why...

972
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,820
I don't need you to serve me.

973
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,620
If you don't understand,

974
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,220
let others take care of your business.

975
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,820
Yes.

976
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,420
I'm sorry.

977
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:31,820
I'm sorry.

978
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:33,220
I'm sorry.

979
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,020
I'm sorry.

980
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,820
I'm sorry.

981
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,620
I'm sorry.

982
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,620
I'm sorry.

983
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,620
I'm sorry.

984
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,620
I'm sorry.

985
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,620
I'm sorry.

986
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,620
I'm sorry.

987
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,620
I'm sorry.

988
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:52,620
I'm sorry.

989
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:54,620
I'm sorry.

990
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,620
I'm sorry.

991
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,820
I'm sorry.

992
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:00,620
I'm sorry.

993
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,220
I'm sorry.

994
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:04,220
I'm sorry.

995
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:05,820
I'm sorry.

996
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,620
I'm sorry.

997
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:09,220
I'm sorry.

998
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,820
I'm sorry.

999
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,620
I'm sorry.

1000
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:14,620
I'm sorry.

1001
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,620

1002
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,620
I'm sorry.

1003
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:20,620
I'm sorry.

1004
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,620
I'm sorry.

1005
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,620
I'm sorry.

1006
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,620
I'm sorry.

1007
