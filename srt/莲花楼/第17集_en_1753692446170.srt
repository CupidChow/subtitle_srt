00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Kissing myself thousands of times

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The most reluctant moment is that moment

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Right on the earth, thousands of miles of wind and waves

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who doesn't wander?

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds and the vastness of the moon?

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Right on the earth, the youthful youthfulness

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
A thousand times, I won't fall into the sorrow

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I will go to the end of the world as I dreamt

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Right on the earth, thousands of miles of wind and waves

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Who doesn't wander?

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds and the vastness of the moon?

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Right on the earth, the youthful youthfulness

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
A thousand times, I won't fall into the sorrow

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I will go to the end of the world as I dreamt

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Sit down

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Hmm?

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Boss

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I knew you liked this

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But this lotus flower is with you

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
That's enough

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's getting late

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I need to find out

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Who killed Senior Brother?

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It seems

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I still have to go back to the Four Gu Sect

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Could it be that Honorable Superior already knew that Li Xiangyi was still alive?

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Maybe he has already seen Li Xiangyi

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Why is he so surprised?

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
If it's true

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Why did he hide all these from me?

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
He still doesn't believe me

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Did anyone who went to check Yuan Bao Villa find anything suspicious?

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
There is a mysterious owner of Lotus Flower Pavilion, Li Lianhua

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This person's identity is unknown

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We can't find out the source

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
He looks a bit like Li Xiangyi

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
But he was once a fan before

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Honorable Superior had a photo with him

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You mean

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Honorable Superior didn't kill him?

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
This Li Lianhua has something to do with Li Xiangyi?

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Then I'll send someone to catch him

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And let the Saintess know

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Don't worry

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Don't alert the snake

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It will be more troublesome in the future

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
On the seventh day of the next month

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Xiao Ziqing and Qiao Wanmian got married in the Four Gu Sect

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Back then, Li Xiangyi

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
loved Qiao Wanmian so much

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
If he were alive

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
he wouldn't have left

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'll try to stop him

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Gongyang Wu Men

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
He praised the poison of the Heart-stirring Sea

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's better to be so useful

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Go

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Hide, keep hiding

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Let me see

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
what you've learned outside

62
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You're good

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You've used the thousand-knife array

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
that's so miserable on your own son

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I can't make it today

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Just forget it

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I will never marry the Princess

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You're good

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You're so cruel

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Am I not your biological son?

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You brat

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Why are you so anxious?

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Isn't it really not your birth?

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You brat

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You really owe me a lesson

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
If you have a bad brain

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
just blow the wind on your head

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
and wake up

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Young Master, be careful

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The reaction is so big

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Is there really a problem?

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Xiao Bao suspects his own identity

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It shouldn't be

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Not many people know about the matter of the second sister and the thousand-knife array

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Could it be that Gongyang Wu Men?

87
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
This is the Lu house of Yuan family

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Or Li...

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Who?

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Who else?

91
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You're so sneaky

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Get out of here

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Get in here

94
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Good

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You've passed the thousand-knife array so quickly

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You're so capable

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Good

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Tell me what you want

99
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'll tell you

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I heard everything

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm just talking nonsense with your aunt

102
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's not worth listening to

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I want to ask you

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What is the relationship between my second aunt and the thousand-knife array?

105
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm just asking

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Your second aunt

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
She and the thousand-knife array

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
They're just friends

109
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
They had a child

110
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Gongyang Wu Men told me

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He said

112
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Show you and my father

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I've seen it

114
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You

115
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You don't have a child

116
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You're so stupid

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You're so stupid

118
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You're so stupid

119
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What do you mean you don't have a child?

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Where did you come from?

121
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You're your parents' child

122
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
There's no wall that doesn't break through the wind

123
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's not a great secret

124
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Why don't you tell me?

125
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Mom

126
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I just want to know the truth

127
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Shan Gu is not my uncle, right?

128
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He

129
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
He and my second aunt

130
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Are my biological parents?

131
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Xiaobao

132
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Your mother

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Didn't want you to know this

134
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Your mother was just 18

135
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
She just wanted to break into the martial arts world

136
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You're really like her

137
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But the martial arts world is a mess

138
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's also the most chaotic world

139
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's easier to lose yourself

140
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Don't mess with people

141
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What do you mean mess with people?

142
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
If it weren't for me, you wouldn't be here

143
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I can solve these problems myself

144
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's up to you

145
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You're so bad at martial arts

146
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Don't mess with people in the future

147
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Be careful to get yourself involved

148
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You make it clear

149
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Don't look down on people

150
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That was the time when she and Shanggu were fighting

151
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
She was so stupid

152
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
She was so stupid

153
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
She was so stupid

154
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That was the time when she and Shanggu were fighting

155
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Your mother was so proud

156
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
She was following behind Shanggu

157
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
They went to the north and south together

158
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
They went through a lot of things

159
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Later, she was the only one who wanted to break into the martial arts world

160
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Shanggu was the only one in her heart

161
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But Shanggu

162
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
She only had the martial arts world in her heart

163
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
She only wanted to make a name for herself

164
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Your mother was hurt and was forbidden from the world

165
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Your mother was hurt

166
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
She was pregnant and returned to Tianji Villa

167
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
She was seriously injured when she was pregnant with you

168
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You were not pregnant and gave birth

169
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But your mother

170
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Your mother didn't have a cancer

171
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,520
Just because there is inside their soul...

172
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:53,260
I couldn't see clearly how the trees in the

173
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,340
oud home

174
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:58,140
I entrusted you to my sister and brother-in-law

175
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,140
hoping that you could grow up safely

176
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,540
and live a normal life without being involved in the martial arts world.

177
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,940
That's why I didn't enter the martial arts world.

178
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,340
That's right.

179
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,740
But later, Shang Gu Dao knew about your existence.

180
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,140
He came to Tianji Villa

181
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,940
to take you with him.

182
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,340
But you were still young and weak.

183
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,740
How could you follow him to the martial arts world?

184
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,740
Your father and I would never do that.

185
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,140
Xiaobao,

186
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,140
I brought you up with my own hands.

187
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,940
You're my own son.

188
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,140
How could I let others take you away?

189
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,540
I respect your mother's wish.

190
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,940
I don't recognize you.

191
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,540
I'm just telling you that he's my long-lost brother.

192
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,740
Just let him be your uncle.

193
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,540
Besides, Shang Gu Dao

194
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,140
is a successful man in the martial arts world.

195
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,540
He can't be a husband or a father.

196
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,740
What's so good about those people in the martial arts world?

197
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:05,140
They're all kind and kind.

198
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,140
Fang Xiaobao, don't be like that.

199
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:07,940
Do you hear me?

200
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,540
How can I?

201
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,940
Xiaobao is a kind and kind child.

202
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,140
Sister, you're a good teacher.

203
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,740
Don't you know that he's the most sensible and filial?

204
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,140
Mother,

205
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,340
these are all old things.

206
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,540
I just want to make it clear

207
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,740
and stop being confused.

208
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,540
In my heart,

209
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,540
you and my father are my closest relatives.

210
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,340
This will never change.

211
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,940
It's good that you know it.

212
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,940
Your father and mother are gone.

213
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,140
You're the kind of person I am.

214
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,740
I don't love you, so who else do I love?

215
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,140
All right, let's get to the point.

216
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,340
Let's not talk about it anymore.

217
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,140
Don't mention it again.

218
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:00,940
Do you hear me?

219
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,940
Besides, you little brat.

220
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,340
Don't pretend to be pitiful and play with your temper

221
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,340
while you're at it.

222
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,740
I know, Mother.

223
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,540
Are you still thinking about breaking into the martial arts world?

224
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,340
Well...

225
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,940
Listen,

226
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,340
I've opened all the doors outside Tianji Manor.

227
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,340
If you want to sneak out, there's no door.

228
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:29,540
Just stay at home and be a good son-in-law.

229
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,540
That's the best.

230
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,540
Mother,

231
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,140
mind your sister.

232
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,340
You're the one who should mind her.

233
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,740
It's beautiful.

234
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,740
I only thought you were a relative I've never met before.

235
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,740
I never thought about exploring your past.

236
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,540
I should know

237
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,540
what you look like,

238
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,940
what you like,

239
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,140
and what you hate.

240
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,740
If I break away from your home,

241
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,540
I could get enough from your Netherlands.

242
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,740
In fact,

243
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,540
I'll go to your home.

244
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,420
I'll go if I can.

245
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,340
I'm wide awake now.

246
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,340
Really?

247
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,340
See?

248
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,140
I told you to stay at home.

249
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,140
Matthew.

250
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,620
He drew all these?

251
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,100
He likes to draw something

252
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,740
or something he likes.

253
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,140
Have you seen this?

254
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,060
It's probably what your mother

255
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,700
saw somewhere in the West.

256
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:36,980
I can't understand it.

257
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,900
I've seen this ice sheet before.

258
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,940
Jingyuan Alliance wants it.

259
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,300
But where did my mother see it?

260
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,580
It's definitely not from the Tianqi Hall.

261
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,140
But these rings

262
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,700
look like they correspond to locks.

263
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:52,940
Locks?

264
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,860
You mean

265
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,900
this ice sheet is actually a key?

266
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,780
It looks like a key to a certain organ.

267
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,460
But it's not a Chinese-style skill.

268
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,220
I get it.

269
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,140
What do you get?

270
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,380
I get it, aunt.

271
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,980
Aunt, you don't have to understand.

272
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,500
Li Lianhua doesn't understand.

273
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,060
I've seen it before.

274
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,780
What is the shape of the Baichuan Courtyard?

275
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,860
Show some respect to the Divine Doctor Li.

276
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,140
Back then,

277
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,140
when Qiao Wanmian died in Li Xiangyi's death,

278
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,260
he didn't want to leave.

279
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,060
Xiao Zijin didn't want to disobey his will.

280
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,980
He hoped that he could slowly get out of the old situation.

281
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,620
So, he built a wooden god

282
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,580
and a wooden manor.

283
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,860
He stayed here with him.

284
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,180
Anyway,

285
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,620
this is the old place of the Four Gu Sect.

286
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,420
Xiao Zijin wanted to marry Qiao Wanmian

287
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,500
and get married here.

288
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,820
It's ridiculous.

289
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,900
Li Xiangyi has been dead for ten years.

290
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,260
The Four Gu Sect has been gone for a long time.

291
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,500
Time flies.

292
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,820
What kind of family and friends

293
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,180
are you going to look forward to?

294
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,940
The Four Gu Sect is not an ordinary sect.

295
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,460
Li Xiangyi is a righteous soul.

296
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,820
I didn't mean to destroy the wedding.

297
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,620
But if the Four Gu Sect's old friends

298
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,460
are allowed to be separated by the Four Gu Sect,

299
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,300
they should erase Li Xiangyi's past.

300
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,780
I'm the first one who doesn't want to do that.

301
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,860
That's right.

302
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,620
Now the world is in chaos.

303
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,060
But it's still a worry.

304
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,300
In order to pursue martial arts,

305
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,940
the Four Gu Sect's popularity

306
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,580
shouldn't be forgotten at this time.

307
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,580
Have you heard that

308
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,340
the evil Di Feisheng of Golden Moon Alliance

309
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,260
has recovered his old wounds and is in danger everywhere?

310
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,900
He's like a hundred-thousand-year-old war book.

311
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,500
You guys say,

312
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,060
will Golden Moon Alliance come to challenge

313
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,780
the wedding of Qiao Qiao?

314
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,020
Your old wounds

315
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,420
are not a big problem.

316
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,100
I prescribed you a medicine for your illness.

317
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,180
You should be able to

318
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,060
open the book I gave you.

319
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,140
Ten thousand.

320
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,940
You dare to ask for ten thousand

321
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,020
just because you wrote a stupid prescription?

322
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,580
It's easy to earn money.

323
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,500
What a coincidence.

324
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,980
This kind of thing that is fooling people

325
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,460
is not worth a penny, brother.

326
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,820
I'm giving you a warning.

327
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,700
Don't be fooled again.

328
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,900
What are you doing?

329
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,020
Hurry up and get the money.

330
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,780
Everyone, come and have a look.

331
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,660
Come and have a look.

332
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,820
Come and have a look.

333
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:25,740
Come on.

334
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,620
Come and have a look.

335
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,460
Come and have a look.

336
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,540
This person

337
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,420
is wearing the name of a divine doctor.

338
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,580
Actually, he has no intention of being a doctor.

339
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,020
He doesn't care about lies.

340
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,260
He didn't discuss with you.

341
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,260
Who believes that he has a disease?

342
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:40,700
Everyone,

343
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,860
look at this person's face carefully.

344
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,500
And this sign.

345
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,460
Tell your friends around you

346
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,060
not to be fooled again

347
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,220
and give this liar money.

348
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,140
Did you hear that?

349
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,780
The holy temple of Lai Fu Zi and Xie Bai Pei

350
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,980
is a good prescription.

351
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,860
My brother, Guan He Meng, is famous.

352
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,380
He is also a little famous in the martial arts world.

353
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,460
He is called

354
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,060
the Divine Doctor of the Ruyan.

355
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,820
The good prescription he said

356
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,980
is definitely not bad.

357
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,020
Everyone,

358
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,780
the master of Lotus Tower, Li Shen Yi,

359
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,260
is not a liar.

360
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:21,900
Young Master,

361
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,620
you are making up stories to fool others.

362
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,020
You are going to ruin your reputation.

363
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,340
Look.

364
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,860
Another liar.

365
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,620
Miss Su,

366
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,140
last time you called the holy name of the Ruyan

367
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:34,860
Fu You Ren.

368
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,340
This time,

369
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,460
is it true?

370
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,340
Then try my real friend.

371
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,540
I will show you.

372
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,660
I was just kidding.

373
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,900
Why are you taking it seriously?

374
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,660
The holy name of the Ruyan, Jiu Yang.

375
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,100
Look.

376
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,940
He ran away so quickly.

377
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,300
What would you like to order?

378
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,180
Brother Li,

379
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,740
you can order whatever you want to eat today.

380
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,340
I will treat you.

381
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:10,900
Shopkeeper.

382
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,540
Young Master.

383
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,860
When I booked this inn,

384
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,900
what did I tell you?

385
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,260
Young Master, you said

386
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,860
all the guests in this inn

387
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,580
can eat

388
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,860
at your inn.

389
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,220
I just want to emphasize one point.

390
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,740
There is a clothes-hanging bag

391
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,140
with a blue cloth bag on the waist.

392
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,860
There is a person called Li Lian Hua.

393
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:26,900
You are not allowed to enter the inn.

394
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,300
Not allowed.

395
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,180
Is the guest...

396
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,020
I am the guest

397
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,340
who is not allowed to enter the inn.

398
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,700
What are you waiting for?

399
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,580
Clean the table.

400
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,660
No, Fang Duo Bin.

401
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,540
What do you mean?

402
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,940
How did Brother Li offend you?

403
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,620
Besides,

404
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,940
you are so old-fashioned.

405
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,820
What do you mean?

406
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,340
Wrong.

407
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,740
I am not old and I don't want to die.

408
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,420
I don't want to be old-fashioned with your Brother Li.

409
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,100
It's your Brother Li's problem.

410
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,500
Fang Xiao Bao.

411
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,380
How can you talk to Mr. Li?

412
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,260
Mr. Li.

413
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,740
Our child is not sensible.

414
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,060
Don't blame him.

415
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,220
Aunt.

416
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,580
Why are you here?

417
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,340
Manager.

418
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,060
Prepare the best guest room and food for Mr. Li.

419
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,580
Okay, okay.

420
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,020
I'll go now.

421
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,660
Aunt.

422
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,180
Why are you helping him?

423
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,420
He is unreasonable.

424
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:23,940
On the contrary,

425
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,180
You...

426
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:26,940
Stop talking.

427
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,620
Go with me.

428
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:28,940
Where?

429
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:29,820
Go.

430
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,940
Wait for me, Li Lian Hua.

431
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,140
Go.

432
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:33,820
Brother Li.

433
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,420
I have found out the English

434
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,620
you asked me to check last time.

435
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,460
Otherwise,

436
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,220
there are many people here.

437
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,140
Let's go out and have a walk.

438
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,340
Wait.

439
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,180
Mr. Li.

440
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,900
I have a question.

441
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,060
I have a patient.

442
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,580
He is addicted to the disease.

443
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,300
He says he is getting more and more beautiful.

444
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,580
His economy is getting worse.

445
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,860
He can't sleep at night.

446
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,460
He is very crazy about killing people with a knife.

447
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,700
I have been using the medicine for days.

448
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,020
I have been studying with silver needles.

449
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,140
But I haven't seen the effect for a long time.

450
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,700
If the patient is a martial arts master

451
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,900
and has weak inner strength,

452
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,020
have you tried to take the fresh tiger palm

453
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,500
and treat it with a nail?

454
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,060
I have tried.

455
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,940
Tiger palm is a poison.

456
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,180
It can't be easily taken without a nail.

457
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,700
It is only a matter of inner strength.

458
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,060
It is killing people

459
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:17,980
with a poison.

460
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,140
It is just a poison.

461
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,180
If you want to be sober,

462
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,340
you can take a poison.

463
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,780
If you are not strong enough,

464
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,700
I suggest

465
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,900
you can soak it in the medicine before using it.

466
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,780
Although tiger palm is poisonous,

467
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,740
it can delay

468
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,620
or shorten the time of the stroke.

469
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,660
It can cure diseases and save people.

470
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,140
If you are not sure,

471
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,060
you can't take it lightly.

472
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,580
How can you guarantee that

473
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,860
the patient will not be poisoned

474
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,860
and die from the poison?

475
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,900
Of course I can't.

476
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,220
You are killing people.

477
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,460
Brother Guan,

478
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,700
as long as someone

479
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,780
uses the inner strength of the index finger to cure the poison,

480
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,980
there will be no danger of life.

481
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,700
How many people in the world have this kind of power?

482
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,820
The index finger's inner strength

483
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,060
is not limited to Yangzhou Man.

484
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,220
How can he

485
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,420
let Li Xiangyi come back to life?

486
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,460
This method of trying poison with life

487
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,940
is so cruel and vicious.

488
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,340
You are still speaking for him?

489
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,820
I must think it over,

490
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,340
right?

491
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,780
I will take it into consideration for myous Jean.

492
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,220
It's a goodway.

493
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,020
Think about it.

494
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,060
General Xiang and Lord Niu

495
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,060
are involved in peace families.

496
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,660
Why should I?

497
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,460
Miss Xiao is really dull.

498
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,300
Let's wear跟大家

499
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,780
the Golden Phoenix Spare Pearl crown

500
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,460
which primarily interested in marriage.

501
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,500
and never moved after she was married.

502
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,260
I really take stock for Her Ladyship.

503
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,620
Has my миллиenne heart

504
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,940
always been

505
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,980
st characterized by Butterflies?

506
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,100
I blabbergasted.

507
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,540
Hero Xiao has always

508
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,260
hemmedax with you.

509
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,500
He once said that

510
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,500
a miss is worth

511
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,220
life and death.

512
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,980
Why did I tell him to die for me?

513
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,540
It golting hatred.

514
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:10,460
All those who abandoned a sword and died easily.

515
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,460
Brother Li.

516
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,460
Brother Li.

517
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,460
It's really you.

518
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,460
Why are you wearing a mask?

519
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,460
I have a lot of good sons in the world.

520
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,460
I'm not afraid to wear this mask.

521
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,460
I see.

522
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,460
I see.

523
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,460
The rest of the people who came to Mu Min Villa these days are all from the Jianghu.

524
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:40,460
Be careful not to get the old news.

525
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,460
Yes.

526
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,460
I heard that the scenery of Mu Min Villa is very beautiful.

527
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,460
I want to go there and experience it.

528
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,460
I don't know if I can go in.

529
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,460
Why didn't Brother Li come to ask me?

530
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,460
I'm going to visit Sister Qiao.

531
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,460
You know Miss Qiao?

532
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,460
Brother Guan and Hero Xiao are close.

533
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,460
They took me to Xiao Qing to play and met Sister Qiao.

534
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,460
At that time,

535
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,460
He waited ten years to confirm the news that Li Xiangyi was dead.

536
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,460
And he met a doctor for him.

537
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,460
Ten years.

538
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,460
Such a long time.

539
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:22,460
Hero Xiao is so affectionate to be with Sister Qiao.

540
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,460
Now it's really not easy to get the right fruit.

541
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,460
It's not easy.

542
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,460
The dead are dead.

543
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:34,460
The living should cherish their present life.

544
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,460
By the way,

545
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,460
You said you had found the South English.

546
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,460
I was about to give you a chance.

547
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,460
I almost forgot.

548
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,460
Look.

549
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,460
This is what the South English means.

550
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,460
The area of the dye is like a trap.

551
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,460
Is there any Chuchu here?

552
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,460
Grandpa said so.

553
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,460
It's a pity that there are so few records about the South English.

554
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,460
He hasn't found the source and Chuchu.

555
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,460
But...

556
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,460
Look at this.

557
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,460
He found the mark you drew.

558
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,460
This mark is called the broken eye.

559
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,460
It's said to be a kind of evil mark of the South English.

560
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,460
This mark represents revenge and devour.

561
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,460
Grandpa said it's the same as the Chinese script.

562
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,460
He's looking for this direction.

563
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,460
Revenge and devour.

564
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,460
What does the South English want to do?

565
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,460
The South English and the South English.

566
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,460
What does it have to do with the Chuchu?

567
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,460
Sister Qiao.

568
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,460
Sister Qiao.

569
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,460
Sister Qiao.

570
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,460
Sister Qiao.

571
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,460
Sister Qiao.

572
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,460
Xiaoyou, Mr. Li.

573
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,460
What brings you here?

574
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,460
I'm here to celebrate Sister Qiao's birthday.

575
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,460
Mr. Li is here too.

576
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,460
I...

577
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:16,460
So Mr. Li is the man you love?

578
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,460
Mr. Li is a nice guy.

579
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,460
Nice guy?

580
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,460
Of course I'm a nice guy.

581
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,460
It's rare to know each other.

582
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,460
Congratulations, Miss Qiao.

583
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,460
I brought some candy as a gift.

584
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,460
I'll take it as a gift.

585
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,460
Thank you, sir.

586
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,460
You're considerate.

587
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,460
I've heard the scenery here is nice.

588
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,460
May I take a walk around the manor?

589
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,460
Please do.

590
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,460
Just leave Xiaoyou with me.

591
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,460
Sister Qiao.

592
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,460
Brother Li is not good at color and interplay.

593
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,460
Don't blame him.

594
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,460
The candy is not very expensive.

595
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,460
But he prepared it with all his heart.

596
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,460
You're so eager to protect him.

597
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,460
Actually, he gave me candy

598
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:27,460
and made me feel very close.

599
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,460
The moon is on the roof,

600
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,460
the clouds are clear.

601
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,460
The old love and hate are both near and far.

602
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,460
How many heroes and heroes

603
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:01,460
can win the love and hate of the trees in their lifetime?

604
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,460
I want a cup of Xiaoyou,

605
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,460
the most suitable one.

606
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,460
I want to drink it with my old friend.

607
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:16,460
But I'm just drifting away from the place I like.

608
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,460
I want a cup of lotus,

609
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,460
the most suitable one.

610
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,460
I want to drink it with my old friend.

611
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,460
Sir.

612
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,460
Miss Qiao is outside.

613
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,460
Tell me.

614
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,460
When will you marry her?

615
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,460
Today is her 18th birthday.

616
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,460
You're just urging her to marry you.

617
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,460
It's not too early.

618
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,460
It's not early.

619
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,460
If someone is 18,

620
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,460
they'll be married.

621
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,460
Sir.

622
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,460
No matter how good she is,

623
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,460
she has to marry sooner or later.

624
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,460
Why don't we get married earlier?

625
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,460
We're in a hurry to eat candy, right?

626
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,460
That's right.

627
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,460
That's right.

628
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,460
Don't worry.

629
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,460
The day A Min gets married,

630
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,460
your candy will be in stock.

631
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,460
Of course,

632
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:04,460
the sweetest candy is for A Min.

633
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,460
Did you hear that?

634
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,460
The master has made arrangements.

635
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,460
We wish the master a happy marriage.

636
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,460
And a son.

637
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,460
Come on, let's drink.

638
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:20,460
Lian Hua's heart is full of tender words

639
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:24,460
You're a small heart

640
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,460
Now you have a heart of sand

641
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,460
Why don't you Because I love you

642
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,740
Our meeting

643
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,820
is still the same.

644
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,000
Well?

645
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,500
Moreover,

646
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,540
a girl called a awake characteristics

647
00:30:53,540 --> 00:31:10,140
of the

648
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:14,080
Time King

649
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,500
Consider it as a token of his life,

650
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,580
Feng Xi.

651
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,380
I'm back.

652
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,740
What is it?

653
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,420
Why are you here?

654
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:34,780
That's me.

655
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,380
My uncle's house.

656
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,780
Why am I here?

657
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,740
And you.

658
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:39,840
Why do you

659
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,820
enter my master's room these days?

660
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,700
Stop lying.

661
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,980
A rare opportunity.

662
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,260
the scenery of the Four Grooming Gate.

663
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,700
After seeing it,

664
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,340
there's nothing different.

665
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,140
Let's go.

666
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,220
You've always been

667
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,460
not interested in Jiangwu.

668
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,500
How can you be interested

669
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,780
in the Four Grooming Gate?

670
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,580
It's a rare opportunity.

671
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,940
It's a chance.

672
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,780
You can't do that.

673
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,620
It's strange that you came

674
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,580
to Qiao Anmian's wedding.

675
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:04,740
You said you wanted to

676
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,620
find the sea bone in Shanggu Dao's hospital.

677
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,580
But you knew

678
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,300
the ten-year-old Di Feisheng who disappeared.

679
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,740
Now you sneakily come here.

680
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,220
This is your real destination.

681
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,300
Li Lianhua,

682
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,740
what do you want?

683
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,500
Can you say something honest?

684
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,020
You're trying to set the case on fire, aren't you?

685
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:21,900
I'm not interested

686
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,540
in playing a game with you and your kid.

687
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,860
There must be some conspiracy

688
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,260
about the One-Taste Powder

689
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,660
and the ice-sweeping of the stolen.

690
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,260
Shanggu Dao's death

691
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,700
is also involved.

692
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,100
Don't think

693
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,340
you're the only one who can think of these things.

694
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,780
What do you know?

695
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,900
I know you definitely don't know

696
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,100
that the important thing is not those symbols

697
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,060
but the ice-sweeping itself.

698
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,420
You don't know what it is, do you?

699
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,700
Let's make a bet

700
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,460
and see who finds out

701
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,780
the truth behind the Golden Pond first.

702
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,140
When did I say

703
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,220
I wanted to check these?

704
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,860
Stop talking nonsense.

705
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:07,540
You...

706
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,100
You're just a kid.

707
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,700
Don't show your cards

708
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,380
to others so easily.

709
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,420
You're trying to remember.

710
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,060
Li Linghua,

711
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,380
come back with me.

712
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,460
You're a coward.

713
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,260
Xiaoyong,

714
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,860
can you please

715
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,340
confirm for me

716
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,340
that this incense

717
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,900
is the same as the one

718
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:32,900
in the Yuanbao Villa?

719
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,900
This cangxiang...

720
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:35,900
Don't worry.

721
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,660
I can't say

722
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,900
where the cangxiang came from now.

723
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,020
But

724
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,900
there's no evil intention.

725
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,540
I believe you, Brother Li.

726
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,420
After I go down the mountain,

727
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,700
I'll send a letter to my grandpa.

728
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,740
Thank you.

729
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,660
But I have one more thing

730
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,780
to ask you.

731
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,140
I heard that men have

732
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,060
something as big as a thumb and ice-sweeping.

733
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,380
It's said

734
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,500
that it's related to the writing of the symbol

735
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,620
of evil spirits.

736
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,180
I wonder if you've heard of it.

737
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,820
I'll ask my grandpa.

738
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,180
After the meeting tomorrow,

739
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,180
Brother Li,

740
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,660
why don't you stay

741
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,580
for a few more days?

742
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,700
We can go around the beautiful scenery

743
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,300
and wait for your news.

744
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:19,980
Okay.

745
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,060
It's a wedding night.

746
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,900
Everything should be smooth.

747
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:38,820
Congratulations.

748
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,100
Please.

749
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,060
Congratulations.

750
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:41,500
Thank you.

751
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,180
Congratulations.

752
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:05,860
Mr. Xiao,

753
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,060
congratulations.

754
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,700
You're still here.

755
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,380
Congratulations.

756
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,500
Please come in.

757
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,380
Brother Li.

758
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,340
Xiaoyu,

759
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,460
look there.

760
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:23,940
Li Lianhua.

761
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,900
How's Brother Li doing?

762
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,140
He's doing great.

763
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,140
He refused to be your boyfriend

764
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,180
yesterday.

765
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,340
Now he's with Miss Su.

766
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,300
He's not afraid of

767
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,180
the third beauty of Wulin.

768
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:35,980
He's so good-looking.

769
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,820
Exactly.

770
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,140
He's so ungrateful.

771
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,140
You'd better teach him a lesson.

772
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,500
I'll be ungrateful

773
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,460
if I don't get Li Lianhua.

774
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,060
Why is he here?

775
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,100
Do you know him, Brother Li?

776
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:45,820
Li Shengyi,

777
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,060
last night,

778
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,860
I asked Mr. Guan Yue to join us.

779
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,100
Mr. He has already had a rest.

780
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,860
Why don't you sit next to me

781
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,860
and make up for the wine you owe?

782
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:58,980
Miss He,

783
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,980
I'm not a good drinker.

784
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,460
If I get drunk

785
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,140
at this wedding,

786
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,260
I'll be in a bad mood.

787
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,180
Brother Li said

788
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,100
you don't have to force yourself.

789
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,580
Brother Li,

790
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,980
you'd better sit next to me.

791
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,260
It's not your turn to talk.

792
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,380
I said it.

793
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,180
Say it.

794
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,500
I said he'd sit next to me.

795
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,500
He's supposed to sit next to me.

796
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,300
The bride is here.

797
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,740
Here they are.

798
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,340
You're too drunk.

799
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,620
The bride just offered to giant cups.

800
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:55,020
화려야,

801
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,500
and bring some wine.

802
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,300
Ami,

803
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,820
you'd better behave.

804
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,220
Please have a drink.

805
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,620
Please have a drink.

806
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,020
Here, Brother Ji.

807
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,220
Happy New Year.

808
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,420
Thank you for coming.

809
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,820
I'll drink to you first.

810
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,620
Congratulations.

811
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,220
Brother Ji, sit.

812
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,620
Brother Bai.

813
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,820
Little brother,

814
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,820
we've been together for years, and we finally got to meet.

815
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,020
Congratulations.

816
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,820
Brother Bai, you know that

817
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,620
Bai Chuan Academy is a home to Wan Mian.

818
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,820
It's a home. You're her family.

819
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,420
I don't care what others think.

820
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:43,020
It's enough to get blessings from family.

821
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,620
Little brother,

822
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,620
you and Miss Qiao are a perfect match.

823
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,220
You've already killed so many people.

824
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,620
Look at the day of the wedding.

825
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,220
They're all here to celebrate for you.

826
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,220
You're a light drinker.

827
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,420
Drink less.

828
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,820
A drunk person doesn't drink.

829
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,220
Come on.

830
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,220
Right. Right. Right.

831
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,020
Sit, Brother Bai.

832
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:01,820
Sit. Sit.

833
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,020
Come on.

834
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,020
Miss Shi Shui.

835
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,020
Look at this.

836
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,420
I've always been a little angry.

837
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,020
The wedding wine is still so fresh.

838
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,220
Miss Shi Shui has always been a good person to you.

839
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,220
She doesn't mind.

840
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,020
It's okay.

841
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,620
But Wan Mian and I

842
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:27,020
don't have anything that's not good for you.

843
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,620
Today, it's even more satisfying.

844
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,420
Please.

845
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,020
Let's eat.

846
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:37,820
Come on.

847
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,220
Sit down.

848
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,620
Congratulations to Hero Xiao and Miss Qiao on getting married.

849
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,020
Well,

850
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,220
when Wan Mian wrote the invitation,

851
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,620
he especially told me

852
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:57,020
to invite Doctor Li to thank you

853
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,820
for bringing me the solid information about Xiang Yi.

854
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,620
I'm also very lucky.

855
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:02,820
This...

856
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,620
Hero Xiao,

857
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,620
today is the day of your wedding with Miss Qiao.

858
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,420
You still have no connection with Gu.

859
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,420
You should be happy and happy.

860
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,820
Congratulations.

861
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,620
Hero Xiao,

862
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,820
you're being too honest.

863
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,420
What do you mean by being happy?

864
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,020
If Xiang Yi can come back alive,

865
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,620
what will you do?

866
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,020
Don't blame me, Hero Xiao.

867
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,620
I'm drunk and talkative.

868
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,620
I wish Hero Xiao and Miss Qiao

869
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,220
a happy wedding and a happy marriage.

870
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,220
It's okay.

871
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,220
Let's be happy.

872
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,420
Sit down.

873
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,220
Come on.

874
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,020
Fang Xiao Bao,

875
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,820
I know you care about Li Xiang Yi.

876
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,020
You can't tolerate other people.

877
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,020
But I know you care about me.

878
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,020
I'll do my best to help you.

879
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,020
I'm not a fool.

880
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,020
I'm a good person.

881
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,420
I know you care about Li Xiang Yi.

882
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,620
You can't tolerate other people.

883
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,020
But it's a wedding.

884
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,420
Why are you drinking here?

885
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,220
Xiang Yi's family

886
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,620
should rely on her own ability.

887
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:07,820
I think you're

888
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,620
full of evil spirit.

889
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,020
Or you can go outside

890
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,020
and fight on the stage.

891
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,020
Don't drink here.

892
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:13,620
Fine.

893
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,620
I don't care if I don't drink.

894
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,220
Be careful, Hou Yao.

895
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,420
You're lucky.

896
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,620
The wind will turn.

897
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,220
Good.

898
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,220
Good.

899
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,620
Good.

900
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,620
Good.

901
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,620
Good.

902
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,620
The imperial guards are here.

903
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,220
Tell Xiao Si Jing to come here.

904
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,420
Who's sending the sound?

905
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,620
It's fine.

906
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,420
It seems that you gave Yang Zhou Man to him.

907
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,020
If you had given him ten years ago,

908
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:38,820
he would have used his inner power

909
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,620
to cure your poison and save your life.

910
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,620
But now Yang Zhou Man

911
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,820
is only worried about himself.

912
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,820
You're not here just to test Fang Dong Bin.

913
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,820
What are you going to do?

914
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,220
I just checked.

915
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,220
The imperial guards are here.

916
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,220
Why are you here?

917
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:59,220
The first imperial guard of 188 cells is here.

918
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,020
The king of Yan is also here.

919
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,620
I'm here to take him away.

920
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,220
You can't find the imperial guard.

921
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,020
You will help me find him.

922
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,420
I don't care what kind of feelings you have for Qiao Wan Min.

923
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,020
I won't kill women.

924
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,420
I won't have any concerns

925
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,420
about killing Xiao Si Jing.

926
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,820
I'll take you there.

927
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,020
Okay.

928
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,900
I gotta go now.

929
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,260
Miss Qiao.

930
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,180
Uncle can make you some wine.

931
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,020
Here.

932
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:21,540
Am I really your uncle?

933
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,620
I was meant to be with you.

934
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,620
I'm still a child, I'm still a child

935
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:30,620
I'm still a child, I'm still a child

936
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:33,620
I'm still a child, I'm still a child

937
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:36,620
I'm still a child, I'm still a child
