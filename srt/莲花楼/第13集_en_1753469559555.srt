00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Ask

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
After four thousand times

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Thousands of times

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The most reluctant

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Is that moment

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
On the earth

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A thousand miles of wind and waves

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who doesn't wander

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
On the edge of the cliff

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
On the earth

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Youthful and crazy

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Never drunk like sorrow

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The world is as one

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Like a dream

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
On the earth

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
A thousand miles of wind and waves

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Who doesn't wander

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
On the edge of the cliff

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
On the earth

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Youthful and crazy

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Never drunk like sorrow

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
the shifts of time,

26
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,500
living in our dreams

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:51,340
and trailer

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Xiangyi,

29
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,600
do you want me

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,600
What you said is always right.

31
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,520
It's all true.

32
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,440
You're the only one who can't be in the Four Gu Sect.

33
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,440
Yes.

34
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,360
I've proven it all these years.

35
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,520
That's exactly it.

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,640
No one can be in the Four Gu Sect.

37
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,520
Not even Li Xiangyi.

38
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,280
No one can.

39
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,360
Good.

40
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,920
This is a must-have item

41
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,720
for me.

42
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,640
You're very good for me.

43
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,560
I finally said this.

44
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,200
We grew up together.

45
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,760
I always gave you

46
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,200
all the food I had persons and

47
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,200
the best sword even if I felt homesick.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,040
I thought

49
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,800
you're more important to me

50
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,720
than me.

51
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,840
You're not enough for dog bones.

52
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,920
I quit my job.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,820
The most reluctant is

54
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,380
that moment

55
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,780
Hope you can help me

56
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,540
Here

57
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:53,900
Who is she?

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Senior Brother.

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Senior Brother.

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Senior Brother.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Senior Brother!

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Sect Leader,

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I have brought people to be attacked by the Golden Thread Embroidery.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Senior Brother's body

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
was also taken away.

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,320
The

67
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:30,800
Demon King's

68
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:30,920
God's

69
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,000
Qi.

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Four Sects,

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
listen to my order!

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
From today on,

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I will fight against the Golden Thread Embroidery

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
without any regret!

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Li Lian Hua!

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What are you doing?

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I've been talking nonsense

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and I don't know how to explain it.

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I really can't hide anything from you.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Of course.

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Their relationship is very good.

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'll spare your life today.

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Don't make any more rumors next time.

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's time to go.

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
This Fei knows my uncle.

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Then he should know Li Xiang Yi.

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This Fei is not familiar with Li Xiang Yi.

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You don't have to ask him.

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I don't care about others.

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But I have to fight against Fei.

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
His martial arts are so bad

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
and he's so arrogant.

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
There must be something wrong.

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Let's go to the Bai Chuan Court together.

95
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Why are we going to the Bai Chuan Court?

96
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Plus the Cai Lian Sect,

97
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I've already solved three big cases.

98
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's time to go to the Bai Chuan Court

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
to change the formation of the formation.

100
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Then, when Young Master Fang becomes a detective,

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Bai Chuan Court will be the partner.

102
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Congratulations.

103
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Congratulations.

104
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Congratulations.

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
My partner was you before.

106
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And you will be my partner in the future.

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
How about this?

108
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
We'll learn the ancient culture and art of the dead.

109
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
We'll find out the truth about the world.

110
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
We'll be able to prove the truth.

111
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Let's go.

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So much money.

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Li Lian Hua,

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
are you getting rich or having a fever?

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm about to move.

116
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
If I don't get ready,

117
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm afraid I'll starve to death on the road.

118
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Go and buy some dry food.

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
No need.

120
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Okay, no need.

121
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Then I can just buy some food.

122
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
A man's iron bow and a chicken's feather

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
is indeed not fair.

124
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'll go to the market to buy it.

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
By the way,

126
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
keep an eye on Fei.

127
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Come back and check on him.

128
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I bought a lot of fresh vegetables.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Li Lian Hua.

130
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I have to leave with Fei for 40 years.

131
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
He kept a high position in the capital.

132
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's not a good time to say goodbye.

133
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You old fox.

134
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm not an old fox.

135
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm not a rascal.

136
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
This is a piece of advice.

137
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Don't be angry.

138
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
When Su Su leaves this place,

139
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
she'll be blamed.

140
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
There's a ghost in my heart.

141
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
There's no ghost in my heart.

142
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Please go to the garden to talk about it.

143
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'll light the incense.

144
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
A small fish will come to catch you.

145
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Go.

146
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Go.

147
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Li Lian Hua,

148
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm not going back to the heaven with you.

149
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Hurry up.

150
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Leader Di,

151
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
have you emptied the medicine shops nearby?

152
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Let's start.

153
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This training is not good.

154
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm afraid I can't go back.

155
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm afraid I can't go back.

156
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
This training

157
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
requires the knowledge of Yin Zhen to be taught.

158
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Leader Di,

159
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
please do the work.

160
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'll do the work.

161
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Li Xiang Yi,

162
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
don't talk to me about martial arts.

163
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's been ten years.

164
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You've been very strong.

165
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Don't worry.

166
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I won't talk to you.

167
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
That's better.

168
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,560
R.I.P

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
This saying

170
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I can tell you.

171
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Move your soul for seven days and forty-nine days.

172
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It can create webs with poison and cure yourself.

173
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Remember this seven days and forty-nine days.

174
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I can't be a little less.

175
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Hey, did you hear that?

176
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Chief Di, did you hear that?

177
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Chief Di?

178
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's better to wait for the right time.

179
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Chief Di ordered me to keep Chief Li.

180
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
He said I can leave now.

181
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Bad news.

182
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Your chief has been poisoned and is in a coma.

183
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Go and check.

184
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Chief Di, you're back.

185
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You've been wearing a lot of clothes these past 49 days.

186
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Where are you going?

187
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
We're even.

188
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm going to say goodbye.

189
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I promised not to expose your identity.

190
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
But do you think you can just push the world around like a waste?

191
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You're too naive.

192
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Chief Di,

193
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm going to tell you something.

194
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm going to tell you something.

195
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm going to tell you something.

196
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm going to tell you something.

197
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Chief Di,

198
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
why are you forcing me?

199
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I just want you to live.

200
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Fight me again.

201
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Greetings, Chief.

202
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yao Mo,

203
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I want him to regain his inner power.

204
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Chief,

205
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
he's seriously injured.

206
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's not easy to treat him.

207
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's not easy?

208
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Or is it impossible?

209
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
No, no.

210
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Chief asked him to recover.

211
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'll do my best.

212
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Please come with me.

213
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Let's go.

214
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Let's go.

215
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Let's go.

216
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Let's go.

217
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Chief,

218
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
this medicine is a sacred deer.

219
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I use hundreds of herbs

220
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
to make it last for over ten years.

221
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Ordinary people can laugh at a cup of wine.

222
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
But if you drink too much,

223
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
you'll be buried in a pit and won't be able to live.

224
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Drink that.

225
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Please.

226
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
With his injury,

227
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
one cup might not be enough.

228
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Continue.

229
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Drink.

230
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's too bitter.

231
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
This...

232
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Feed him.

233
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yes.

234
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Please.

235
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Thank you.

236
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's exciting.

237
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Chief,

238
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
he's so weak and weak.

239
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
He's weak in his inner power.

240
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
If he's weak in his inner power,

241
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
even three cups of wine won't help.

242
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
If he's weak in his inner power,

243
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'll force my inner power into his body

244
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
and make it work.

245
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Chief.

246
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Chief,

247
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
he'll die if he doesn't.

248
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Chief.

249
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I told you.

250
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But I can't do this.

251
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Chief Tian,

252
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
you're so great.

253
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Think of another way.

254
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Think of another way.

255
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Then,

256
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
the spirit snake cave can be a test.

257
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Spirit snake cave.

258
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Chief,

259
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
these Donghai spirit glue

260
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
has been used for many years.

261
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's popular among westerners.

262
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's good for the damage of the seven seas.

263
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Change his blood

264
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
to make it work.

265
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Let's try it.

266
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The poison of Bicha.

267
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Chief,

268
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
he's suffering from Bicha.

269
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Useless.

270
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Chief, please calm down.

271
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You want him to regain his inner power.

272
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
There's another way to fight against Bicha.

273
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Say it.

274
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
The net spring flower.

275
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Net spring flower?

276
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
The herb of the herb is made of steel.

277
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It can help me break through the eighth layer of the Bichang.

278
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
But his inner power is not strong.

279
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
How to deal with it?

280
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Chief,

281
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
net spring flower is divided into Yin and Yang.

282
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Herb and the herb are both martial arts.

283
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yin herb is the most poisonous herb in the world.

284
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Even if the herb is poisonous,

285
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
it can also be used for decades.

286
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
But after a few days,

287
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
the herb will be more and more dangerous.

288
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It will cut off all the organs.

289
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
There will be no more painful death in the world.

290
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I don't want him to live forever.

291
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I just want him to live until he fights me again.

292
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Let's go.

293
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I want the net spring flower.

294
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Yes, sir.

295
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
What are you laughing at?

296
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Chief Di,

297
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
don't waste your time.

298
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's all empty.

299
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Even if you find the net spring flower,

300
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
you can force me to eat it.

301
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
But you can't force me to do it.

302
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
When I lie in front of you,

303
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
waiting for death in the sun,

304
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
watching you in a hurry,

305
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I think it's interesting.

306
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm not afraid of you.

307
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm not anxious.

308
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I think it's interesting.

309
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Li Xiangyi, Li Xiangyi.

310
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Don't you want to know

311
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
how your senior died?

312
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
The third king of the Golden Plains Alliance killed my senior.

313
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Chief Di still wants to deny it.

314
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
The Golden Plains Alliance's training manual is very clear.

315
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
The left hand of the Shankudao was stabbed and killed by the sword.

316
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The third king only had the sword of the King of Yan.

317
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
He made a mistake.

318
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I punished him to take the right hand for a month.

319
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Even if he did it, it should be the left hand.

320
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's impossible to kill your senior with the right hand.

321
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Ten years ago, you and I agreed to fight for five years.

322
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
After that, your senior was killed.

323
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
The Golden Plains Alliance and the Four Gu Men

324
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
started a big war.

325
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
In the end, both sides fell into the river.

326
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
But the one who has the power behind it is not you and me.

327
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
If you really want to avenge the dead

328
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
of the Four Gu Men,

329
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
avenge your senior,

330
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I can help you find out the truth behind it.

331
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
As long as you agree,

332
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
fight with me again.

333
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Avenge?

334
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
If you really want to avenge,

335
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
you should find Li Xiangyin.

336
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Because she was selfish

337
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
and killed everyone.

338
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
She deserved to die.

339
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
She really died.

340
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
All the grudges

341
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
are gone with Li Xiangyin ten years ago.

342
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Chief Di,

343
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Li Lian Huang

344
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
won't fight with you now.

345
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I understand.

346
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You are now

347
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
alive and dead.

348
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I can't easily persuade you.

349
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Okay.

350
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'll help you.

351
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
If you don't agree,

352
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'll kill the son of Shan Gu Dao.

353
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Chief Di,

354
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
stop joking.

355
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
My senior

356
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
didn't even get married.

357
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
How can he have a son?

358
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
18 years ago,

359
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
the second lady of Tianji Hall, He Xiaolan,

360
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
had a love affair with Shan Gu Dao.

361
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
This is the letter he wrote to Shan Gu Dao.

362
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I don't love the military world.

363
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I only love the scenery along the way

364
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
and not my family.

365
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
My heart is like a benefactor.

366
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's lonely.

367
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I can't leave my home.

368
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I should break up with you.

369
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Break up with my love.

370
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I've betrayed you.

371
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Xiaolan.

372
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Though you broke up,

373
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
you still love me.

374
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I am sorry.

375
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I am sorry.

376
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I am sorry.

377
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,920
Xiao Lan.

378
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,720
Although they broke up,

379
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,200
he left his baby in his belly.

380
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,640
A few months later,

381
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,920
Tianji Hall claimed that he died of illness.

382
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,760
But the late Tianji Hall's Hall Leader, He Xiaohui,

383
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,080
the Minister of Revenue, Fang Zhe Shi,

384
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,400
passed away this year.

385
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,520
This child is called Feng Doubin.

386
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,960
You're so smart.

387
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,920
You should have guessed it.

388
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,320
Feng Doubin is not Shan Gu Dao's nephew.

389
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,160
He's his son.

390
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,760
Li Xiangyi.

391
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,080
If you don't promise me,

392
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,800
I'll let Shan Gu Dao's son's only blood

393
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,520
die in front of you.

394
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,400
Here.

395
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,040
Here.

396
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,040
Here.

397
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,880
Manager.

398
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,280
Sir.

399
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,600
Serve me the most expensive dishes.

400
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,640
Okay, sir.

401
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,960
Waiter, take good care of him.

402
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,920
Li Lianhua.

403
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,600
I treat you as a friend,

404
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,240
but you take the unknown A'Fei to do something.

405
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,760
What do you think I am?

406
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,000
This is Lianhua.

407
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,360
Sir.

408
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,760
This is the best lotus leaf in our restaurant.

409
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,840
Every dish is made of lotus.

410
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,200
It's fragrant and delicious.

411
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,240
Look at this dish.

412
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,520
It's lotus every step.

413
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,040
This dish is called snake silk lotus.

414
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,760
This dish is even more delicious.

415
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,080
This is called lotus flower and red lotus.

416
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,080
Lotus flower and red lotus.

417
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,480
Sir.

418
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,520
These dishes are all made of jade.

419
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,240
They're very expensive.

420
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,320
What are you shouting about?

421
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,880
How much can you get with these dishes?

422
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,080
I'll just pay you.

423
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Is this expensive?

424
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,240
Look at your clothes.

425
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,840
How dare you come here for a meal?

426
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,240
Why don't you ask around?

427
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,600
What am I?

428
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,800
Isn't it just a little money?

429
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,880
Get out of here.

430
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,680
Get out of here.

431
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,440
That's all your fault.

432
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,480
Go as far as you can.

433
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,920
Who is this?

434
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,640
This is Lianhua.

435
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,000
I have no conscience.

436
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,440
I can't even afford to pay more.

437
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,880
I can't even live in the restaurant.

438
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,440
I can't even afford to pay more.

439
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,000
I can't even afford to live in the restaurant.

440
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,360
I can't even afford to pay more.

441
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,600
I can't even afford to pay more.

442
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,800
That's not it.

443
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,400
Let me take it to you.

444
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:39,400
I want to catch the

445
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,400
So, she's lying to Li Lianhua.

446
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,120
Li Lianhua is in danger.

447
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,440
She's dead or alive. It's none of my business.

448
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,160
Have you seen a man with a terrible face,

449
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,800
with a terrible face and a sharp mouth,

450
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,120
and a man with a building?

451
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,120
No, no, no.

452
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,480
Hey, brother.

453
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,760
Have you seen a building

454
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,600
with a carriage?

455
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,800
A building?

456
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,160
It seems to be over there.

457
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,280
Thank you.

458
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,000
Li Lianhua.

459
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,880
Li Lianhua.

460
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,880
Where is Li Lianhua?

461
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:32,920
She went with me.

462
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,240
What do you mean?

463
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,280
I've checked.

464
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,800
You're not a member of the South Sea Sect.

465
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,000
Who are you?

466
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,520
Besides, where is Li Lianhua?

467
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,520
If you don't go,

468
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:41,840
I'll shoot you.

469
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,320
What?

470
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,760
I told you once when we were in the Lotus Robe House.

471
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,960
I'll shoot you.

472
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,480
You've been hiding your martial arts.

473
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,560
You're a liar.

474
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,000
Let me teach you a lesson.

475
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,600
You're talented enough to force me to retreat.

476
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,880
I can't let you go.

477
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,240
I'll kill you.

478
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,440
I'll kill you.

479
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,720
I'll kill you.

480
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,720
I'll kill you.

481
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,720
I'll kill you.

482
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,720
I'll kill you.

483
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,720
I'll kill you.

484
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,200
I'll give you ten years.

485
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,800
You'll be a master.

486
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,640
What a pity.

487
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,720
Li Lianhua.

488
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,440
What's wrong with you?

489
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,440
Did A'Fei do this?

490
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,240
It's none of your business.

491
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,360
Leave now.

492
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,080
You came to save her in such a state.

493
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,600
It seems you really care about this kid.

494
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,640
You dare to come at me?

495
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,760
I can't.

496
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,720
That was not a stupid move.

497
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,120
I've already put some piano keys in your body.

498
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,160
Li Lianhua,

499
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,840
if you don't want her to die,

500
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,680
I'll give you half a month to think about it.

501
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,240
Promise me.

502
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,320
You...

503
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,080
Fang Xiao Ma,

504
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,360
how are you?

505
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,760
I'm fine.

506
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,880
I'm just a little bit dizzy.

507
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,840
The piano keys of the Diwei Mountain are very powerful.

508
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,560
I can only suppress it temporarily with Yangzhou Man.

509
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,600
It's not a long-term plan.

510
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Diwei Mountain

511
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,120
My Di family only raises killers, not flying cranes.

512
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,400
Today, the two people who died are

513
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,320
Di A'Man and Di Feisheng.

514
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,320
After today,

515
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,360
you two can only live once.

516
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,240
The two of you can only live once.

517
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,240
If you don't want her to live,

518
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,600
you'll die for her.

519
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,560
You're Di Feisheng, right?

520
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,360
The people of the Di family

521
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,280
can never kill their master.

522
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,600
You'd better be a good boy

523
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,800
and be the killer of the Di family.

524
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,000
Don't think about resisting.

525
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,200
Your life

526
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,000
will never change.

527
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,320
Run away.

528
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,960
You'll be

529
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,920
my Di family's slave for the rest of your life.

530
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,320
Why?

531
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,600
Why was it said by the master?

532
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,160
If I take the Guanyin Pillar,

533
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,120
I can only destroy my power.

534
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,120
If I tear up,

535
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,920
I can only restore my power.

536
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,520
But I can't break through

537
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,120
the eighth floor of the Beifeng Pavilion.

538
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,160
Can't I

539
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,040
take revenge in my life?

540
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,520
Master, are you in a bad mood?

541
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,040
This is my place of cultivation.

542
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,040
Why?

543
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,640
Master,

544
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,480
I have good news for you.

545
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,000
You've been looking for the whereabouts of

546
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,960
the King of Yan and the four villages, right?

547
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,560
I sent someone

548
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,520
to find the map of the 188th Lao.

549
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,120
There's the whereabouts of the King of Yan.

550
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,240
For the sake of my loyalty,

551
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,000
please forgive me this time.

552
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,840
Is it really your loyalty?

553
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,200
Then tell me,

554
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,040
what's the poison of Li Xiangyi's tea?

555
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,000
Why did you...

556
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,600
It doesn't matter how I know.

557
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,560
What matters is that in these ten years,

558
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,440
you made me feel that I won the battle of Donghai.

559
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,320
What matters is that in these ten years,

560
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,600
you made me a ignorant person.

561
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,440
Then Li Xiangyi is not dead.

562
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,400
In this life and this world,

563
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,680
I only wish that you can be the number one in the world.

564
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,280
Do I need to use the poison to dominate the world?

565
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,800
I wanted to kill Li Xiangyi in secret

566
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,600
to solve your heart's problem.

567
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,520
But Li Xiangyi didn't know about it,

568
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,880
so he came to fight the wind.

569
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,000
I know my mistake.

570
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,200
I waited for you for ten years in the Golden Thread Embroidery.

571
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,440
I finally waited for you to come back.

572
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,680
Please punish me.

573
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,800
I'll take it.

574
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,880
I'll do my best.

575
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,200
Don't think that you can use ten years of hard work

576
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,800
to change the wrong person.

577
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,520
I don't care if the Golden Thread Embroidery is dead or alive.

578
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,360
From today on,

579
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,080
you don't have to investigate the Thunder Fire.

580
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,880
I'll change to Wu Yan to investigate it.

581
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,000
If the investigation is related to you,

582
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,280
I'll kill you.

583
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,600
Mr. Wang is sick again.

584
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,040
His parts are lost again.

585
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,920
Are you hungry?

586
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,400
Eat it.

587
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,280
I want these.

588
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,360
My favoriteift Soldier 입住拉 relieved islands.

589
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,960
No taken.

590
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,200
I want this.

591
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,600
Noatory goddess,

592
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:51,960
Zhao Keyu.

593
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,280
Eat

594
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,560
Eat slowly

595
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,440
What were you holding in your stomach?

596
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,760
I'm hungry

597
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,320
Eat slowly, don't choke

598
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,400
I'll feed

599
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,040
I won't eat, you eat

600
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,040
Then why are you staring at me?

601
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,660
It's nothing

602
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,880
Did you follow your mother?

603
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,600
I'm sorry.

604
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,440
Why do you have to

605
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,720
keep asking me these questions?

606
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,320
Our housekeeper said

607
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,160
I look like my aunt.

608
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,440
But when I was born,

609
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,720
my aunt was dead.

610
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,600
You don't see your uncle often.

611
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,880
When you were little,

612
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,240
did he look up to you?

613
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,800
My uncle is the second-class of the Si Gu Sect.

614
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,040
He's usually very busy.

615
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,480
He doesn't have time to care about me.

616
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,200
Besides,

617
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,000
my mother seems to hate him.

618
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,640
She doesn't allow me to be close to him.

619
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,600
Why do you suddenly

620
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,720
ask about my family?

621
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,760
Nothing.

622
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,720
I just asked casually.

623
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,080
Do you want to eat your buns?

624
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,280
Then I'll ask you again.

625
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,800
You have to answer me honestly.

626
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,720
Who is that Fei?

627
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,280
Why is he so good at martial arts?

628
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,520
Now,

629
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,200
I won't hide it from you.

630
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,360
He is Di Fei Sheng.

631
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:54,800
Di...

632
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,240
Di Fei Sheng?

633
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,680
The demon of the Qingyuan Alliance, Di Fei Sheng?

634
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,520
This...

635
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,600
Do you know that

636
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,840
he caused my master to fall in love

637
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,840
and die?

638
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,680
How can you be with

639
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,120
such a demon?

640
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,640
He asked me to promise him to save a person.

641
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,760
Save a person?

642
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,840
Your martial arts can deceive people.

643
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,040
But not save people.

644
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,440
In this world,

645
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,440
there are some people

646
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,280
who only have me to save.

647
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,920
It's a pity

648
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,080
that I don't want to save them.

649
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,280
So you left me behind

650
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,200
because you were afraid that Di Fei Sheng would deal with me.

651
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,040
But you were caught

652
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,280
and got hurt all over your body.

653
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,320
Li Lian Hua,

654
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,800
I don't accept your love.

655
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,640
We should share trouble

656
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,520
when we make a promise.

657
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,240
Even if the opponent is Di Fei Sheng.

658
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,800
Wang Zhao Xia,

659
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,360
I know you are good.

660
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,040
I was wrong this time.

661
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,360
Thank you.

662
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,960
You are a good man.

663
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,040
By the way,

664
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,800
don't forget

665
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,200
the person that Di Fei Sheng asked you to save.

666
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,560
The person he wants to save

667
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,040
is definitely not a good person.

668
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,520
He is not a good person.

669
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,080
I won't save him.

670
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,120
It's more important to save you now.

671
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,360
Di Fei Sheng

672
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,360
is in your body

673
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,440
and is stuck in the piano.

674
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Why is it troublesome?

675
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:11,760
It doesn't matter.

676
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,280
I have a high talent.

677
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,920
I just felt a little uncomfortable.

678
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,600
Look at me now.

679
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,760
Nothing happened.

680
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,680
I don't have much internal strength.

681
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,800
I can't play the piano well.

682
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,080
But if the piano

683
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,280
extends to the sun,

684
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,080
we will be in a dilemma.

685
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,160
That's the only way.

686
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,000
You are awake.

687
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,040
Come on.

688
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,560
Get up and drink some hot water.

689
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,760
Why am I dizzy again?

690
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,080
You are hit by the piano.

691
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,600
You are just dizzy.

692
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,760
I didn't expect you to be so heavy.

693
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,320
It's so tiring

694
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,400
to move you back to Lotus Pavilion.

695
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,040
You can practice

696
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,920
this skill on the table.

697
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,480
Practice it well.

698
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,600
What is this?

699
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,160
Is it a paper?

700
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:42,960
It's a paper.

701
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,320
This is the ancestral skill.

702
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,800
You just got angry before.

703
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,320
It's the one that

704
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,400
was used to suppress you.

705
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,960
You should learn it well.

706
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,800
Don't bother me in the future.

707
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,360
Ancestral skill?

708
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,480
The ink is not dry yet.

709
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,800
You just drew it, right?

710
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,160
The ancestral skill

711
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,960
is of course to be passed down.

712
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,240
So I drew it for you.

713
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,520
Let you understand it well.

714
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,560
Learn it well.

715
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,480
Do you understand?

716
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,960
You can't practice martial arts.

717
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,160
You can't practice it.

718
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,880
What if the piano is not cured?

719
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,880
If you practice it, you will be a demon.

720
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,800
You will not be able to learn it.

721
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,640
I won't practice it.

722
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,480
I won't practice it.

723
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,560
Do you know why

724
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,360
Di Feisheng

725
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,720
asked me to save people?

726
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,640
It's because of this skill.

727
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,440
You don't believe me.

728
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,840
You can doubt me.

729
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,600
But Di Feisheng's eyes

730
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,080
can't be wrong.

731
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,400
You don't want it?

732
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,040
Fine.

733
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,840
Give it to me.

734
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:37,680
Give it to me.

735
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,760
I'm telling you, Fang Xiaobao.

736
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,280
You are still a detective.

737
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,880
You are just a stupid

738
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,320
idiot.

739
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:45,840
You are a fool.

740
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,640
You are still a detective.

741
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,360
I'm telling you.

742
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,400
You can't think about it.

743
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,880
Why did Di Feisheng

744
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,440
ask you to threaten me to save people?

745
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,720
If your piano

746
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,920
is getting worse,

747
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,000
you will be punished by his evil plan.

748
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,960
You still have to obey him.

749
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,960
What will you do then?

750
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,160
That demon

751
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:00,960
keeps killing people.

752
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,800
Keep doing evil things.

753
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,080
Can you be a good man?

754
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:03,600
Will you practice it?

755
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,280
Fine.

756
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,160
Just practice it.

757
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:05,920
You can't let the demon

758
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,360
succeed by talking so much.

759
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,960
Then you remember it well.

760
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:09,840
What if he...

761
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,120
I...

762
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,000
I practice

763
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,920
the magic of walking on fire,

764
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,600
the white ink on the mouth,

765
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,640
the magic of the lock and the master's sword.

766
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,080
I can call him a doctor.

767
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:16,960
Don't worry.

768
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,440
I will find you

769
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,760
all the expensive medicines.

770
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,520
Practice it well.

771
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,280
I will die.

772
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,040
Come on.

773
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,560
After all, you taught Li Xiangyi

774
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,640
the master for so many years.

775
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,600
This Yangzhou Manxin

776
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,560
will pass on to you.

777
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,080
It's also a promise

778
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,720
he made to you.

779
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,960
The Demon King

780
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,960
Episode 16

781
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,240
What are you doing?

782
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,000
It's already late at night.

783
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:31,960
Li Lianhua,

784
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,400
where did you get

785
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,240
that magic?

786
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,600
I told you

787
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,480
it was inherited.

788
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,280
It's impossible.

789
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:38,920
That magic is

790
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,360
profound, mysterious, and wonderful.

791
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,120
Even the star of the Heaven's

792
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:42,560
Sky Hall

793
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,520
can't be compared with it.

794
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,600
If it's really inherited,

795
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,840
then your family

796
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,920
must have a lot of masters.

797
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,160
Tell me quickly.

798
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,480
Where did you get it?

799
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,600
Let go of my hand.

800
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,000
It's not a rule.

801
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,160
Fine.

802
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,200
There was a year

803
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,880
when I went up the mountain to pick herbs.

804
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,080
I accidentally fell into the cliff.

805
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,400
Suddenly,

806
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,800
at this cave,

807
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,600
a fairy mother appeared.

808
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,520
She told me to

809
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,920
think it over three times

810
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,360
and then pass on

811
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,280
this magic to me.

812
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,320
Then I thought about it again.

813
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,320
It turns out

814
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,680
this is the fairyland

815
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,680
in the fairyland.

816
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:21,760
How can there be such a good thing

817
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,000
about picking a cake?

818
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,360
Didn't I tell you?

819
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,360
It's all fairyland.

820
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,480
Then tell me.

821
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,720
What's the name

822
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,440
of your magic?

823
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,120
It's amazing.

824
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,360
It's similar to the name of Yangzhou Manxin,

825
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,360
Su Zhou Kuai.

826
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,360
I believe you.

827
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,120
I'm not talking about you.

828
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:38,800
You want me to say that

829
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,800
but you don't believe me.

830
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,240
Then explain to me.

831
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,360
Why did I, a doctor

832
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,360
who sells high-quality medicine,

833
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,600
get a master's skill?

834
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,000
If I wasn't born to be a bad dancer,

835
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,680
I would have been a hero.

836
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,760
It's a pity that

837
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,080
I can only be a wandering doctor

838
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,720
in the martial arts world

839
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,120
if I don't die.

840
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,120
I'm going to be a master soon.

841
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,120
All right.

842
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,440
I owe you this time.

843
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,640
It's okay if you don't know martial arts.

844
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,320
It's the same for me.

845
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,680
After I go out,

846
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,480
I'll take care of you.

847
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,680
I'll protect you.

848
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,200
Just call me if you need anything.

849
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,520
That's the most important thing.

850
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,480
When I got this new law,

851
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,120
I got three headshots.

852
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,080
So you have to get three headshots with me

853
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,880
so that I can be at peace.

854
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,880
You're dreaming.

855
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,080
I only bow to my master

856
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,560
except for my parents.

857
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,960
Who are you?

858
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,280
What kind of Su Zhou Kui are you?

859
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,120
You're definitely not as good as my master, Yang Zhong Man.

860
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,120
You should practice it yourself.

861
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,080
Li Zhen Hua,

862
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,120
why don't you tell me

863
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,120
my master's story?

864
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,200
You said too little last time.

865
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:46,960
I can't hear enough.

866
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,480
Don't you think your body is hot

867
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,520
and your chest is stuffy?

868
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:50,920
No.

869
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,240
The key to Su Zhou Kui

870
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,360
is a mirror.

871
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,120
The most important thing is to talk less and be quiet.

872
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,880
If you talk, you'll be in a bad mood

873
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,600
and you'll be like a bubble.

874
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,200
You can do it yourself.

875
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,280
The world is too fast.

876
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,480
Can't wait for the old heaven.

877
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,680
The rain is long.

878
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,640
Let's make a wish.

879
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,480
The world is too fast.

880
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:48,680
The love is so deep.

881
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:55,760
Who doesn't want to part?

882
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,760
The world is too fast.

883
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,560
Can't wait for the old heaven.

884
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,160
The rain is long.

885
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,160
Let's make a wish.

886
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,160
The world is too fast.

887
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:15,560
The love is so deep.

888
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:21,560
Who doesn't want to part?

889
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:33,360
The love is so deep.
