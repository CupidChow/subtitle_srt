00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,620
I've heard people on the verge of death always see ghosts.

00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,580
I'll help you remember.

6

Are you crazy?

7
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:27,680
It wasn't a ghost.

8
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,340
It was that fake miracle physician, Li Lianhua.

9
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,480
Li Lianhua is the Medicine Demon of the Jinyuan Alliance.

He was the one who killed Happy.

He... He must have killed

12

the Second Young Miss of Yu City too.

13
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,330

Don't you also suspect that fake miracle physician?

Didn't you also say he did it?

If he is innocent,

30
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,120
he would have been framed.

I'm really sorry.

You should be sorry towards

the innocent lives you took.

101

Madam Yu said your guards are your slaves,

and their lives are for you to take.

103

But the owner of Lotus Tower is not from Yu City.

104
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:09,670
He is also

105
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,409
the renowned and well-respected Physician Li.

106
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:12,340
Are you going to

107
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,909
kill him without considering the law too?

108
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,780
Young Hero Fang knows how to flatter me.

109
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,260
You’re famous.

110
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,340
It'd be a waste not to use it.

111
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,400
But it doesn't mean you're innocent.

112
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,100
Tianji Hall has never participated in disputes of the martial arts world,

113
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,020
but Young Hero Fang is quite nosy.

114
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,140
But

115
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,020
I'm just handling family matters.

116
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,460
I don't want to make an enemy of you.

117
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,660
Since it was a misunderstanding,

118
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,580
I'll ask someone to prepare a carriage

119
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,320
to send Young Master Fang and this physician

120
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,170

please just send my maid back

124

I don't plan to leave.

125
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,480
What do you mean?

126
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,140
In terms of personal affairs,

127
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,660
my servant was killed.

128
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,080
I must find the person who killed him.

129
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,480
In terms of official affairs,

130
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,270

and catch the murderer.

134
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:08,659
So,

135
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,670
before we find out the truth,

136
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,650
please don’t hurt anyone else.

137
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,880
When did I allow you to investigate the case?

138
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,900
Young Master Fang,

139
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,659
don’t push your luck.

140
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,790
No matter how remote Yu City is,

141
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,020
you must follow the legal code of the Great Xi.

142
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,300
What do you think?

143
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,430
Brother Zongzheng.

144
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:33,780
Sister Hongzhu.

145
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,580
Detectives from Baichuan Court indeed have the right to intervene.

146
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,030
Madam Yu.

147
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,140
Since you don't believe your sister was killed by an evil spirit,

148
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,470
do you just want to kill and vent your anger

149
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,380
rather than find out the truth?

150
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,380
Killing the innocent will only cover up the truth.

151
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,980
The murderer who killed your sister

152
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,300
could escape.

153
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,200
Are you really okay with that?

154
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,660
I have no patience.

155
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,680
I will only give you one day

156
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,010
to find out the truth of my sister's death.

157
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,900
If you can’t find out the truth within one day,

158
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,190
please leave Yu City immediately.

159
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,550
I will bury everyone here with Shuang.

160
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,460
It's not up to anyone to judge

Young Hero Fang is really unpredictable.

164
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,210
You said I killed someone,

165
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,370
but now you're saving me.

166
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,540
I've only temporarily ruled you out as a suspect.

167
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,140
I was afraid you'd be wrongly executed by Yu Hongzhu.

168
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:37,660
Really?

169
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:39,960
You ruled me out so quickly?

170
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,580
As you said,

171
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,910
the body of Yu Qiushuang was indeed destroyed by the fire.

172
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,060
If you really did it,

173
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,620
you didn't have to give me any leads.

174
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,400
But even if you were not the murderer at Mount Xiaomian,

175
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,270
you might still be the Medicine Demon.

176
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,860
Young Hero Fang is really smart.

177
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,590
Since I’m no longer a suspect,

178
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,580
I'll take my leave.

179
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,100
Wait.

180
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,419
If we don't solve this case,

181
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,220
those people in prison will die.

182
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,690
You have to stay to investigate the case with me.

183
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:12,770
I have to stay?

184
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:14,730
Young Hero Fang.

185
00:09:15,049 --> 00:09:17,020
You agreed to solve the case,

186
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,310
not me.

187
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,800
Why should I stay?

188
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,690
Besides, I hate getting involved

189
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,250
in the martial arts world's affairs.

190
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,250
If you dare to run,

191
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,020
I will dare to incite Madam Yu

192
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,550
to hunt you down

193
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,320
and find everything there is on you, old fox.

194
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,180
Also,

195
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,370
look at this.

196
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,500
I didn’t expect your dog to be so loyal to you.

197
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,580
He followed you all the way to Yu City from Xiaomian Inn.

198
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,240
What a pity,

199
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,410
I found him first.

200
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,080
Let me tell you.

201
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,160
I'm really not the Medicine Demon.

202
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,160
Fox Spirit is just an ordinary dog.

203
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,780
It's too bad that its owner is heartless and wants to abandon it.

204
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,440
Do you think

205
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,340
I should stew or braise it?

206
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,100
It should taste good either way.

207
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,100
Why are you picking on a dog?

208
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,500
I'm not a detective.

209
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,300
Why are you clinging onto me?

210
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,620
Aren't you a miracle physician?

211
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,220
If you can save Yu Qiushuang,

212
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,720
the case will be solved.

213
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,110
I can't revive the dead.

214
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,600
Then be my coroner.

215
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,500
You are so cunning,

216
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,720
you will be useful at something.

217
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,680
You'll let me go once you find out the truth, right?

218
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,220
Second Young Miss's body was originally placed in the hall

219
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,880
while waiting for Madam to come back.

220
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,280
I don't know why a fire suddenly started and burned half of it.

221
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,380
Madam couldn't bear to look at it anymore,

222
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,580
so she put it in the Ice Room.

223
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,900
Please look at it carefully.

224
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,740
Thank you.

225
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,440
That's it?

226
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,580
You want to be a detective when you can't even stand this?

227
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,460
Just go home.

228
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,870
What's wrong with something as minor as this?

229
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,420
Is there a problem?

230
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,630
The smell is so strong.

231
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,230
Is it because the body was burned?

232
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,620
Burnt fat doesn't smell like this.

233
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,570
What's strange is

234
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,040
it's only been a day.

235
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,710
The body rotted so quickly.

236
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,480
The meridians on her neck are intact.

237
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,170
There's no pressure or damage.

238
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,050
She wasn't strangled by the ghost's hands.

239
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,320
Happy was strangled to death,

240
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,490
but Yu Qiushuang was different.

241
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,020
See?

242
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,610
There's a blood clot.

243
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,970
Her abdomen was injured.

244
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,900
Looks like this ghost struck hard.

245
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,170
The blood clot hasn't dissipated after so long.

246
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:56,380
It seems that

247
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,200
Yu Qiushuang has long been dead.

248
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,340
There is another cause of death that is hard to detect.

249
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,760
See?

250
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,140
The second spot

251
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,810
has a golden needle that went straight through the heart.

252
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:19,670
Golden needle?

253
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,500
A golden needle and a palm strike...

254
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,890
Aren't these two wounds contradictory?

255
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,990
You're smart.

256
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,860
Palm strikes are close combat.

257
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,660
Needles attack from a distance.

258
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,980
If she'd been struck, why attack her with a needle after she'd run away?

259
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,840
If she was killed from a distance,

260
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,460
there was no need to strike her again.

261
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,600
It's very contradictory.

262
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,490
Also, don't you think it's too aggressive?

263
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:48,810
Indeed.

264
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,990
I've heard Yu Qiushuang's martial arts skills were only average.

265
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,990
With her ability,

266
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,170
there was no need to kill her twice, and so aggressively.

267
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,360
The murderer killed Happy

268
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,670
to make Yu Qiushuang being killed by a ghost

269
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,070
look more believable.

270
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,530
If Yu Hongzhu hadn't come back in time,

271
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,150
the cause of Yu Qiushuang's death

272
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,150
would have been pushed to the ghost.

273
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,460
Happy died unjustly.

274
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,990
If there was a ghost,

275
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,050
it was someone pretending to be a ghost.

276
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,610
As long as we find the murderer,

277
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,620
we can seek justice for Happy.

278
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,570
It wasn't a ghost?

279
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,780
The only ones in Xiaomian Inn who had inner skills and could use secret weapons

280
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,440
were Yun Jiao and the escorts.

281
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,910
I think they colluded

282
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,160
to kill Shuang.

283
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,820
Madam Yu, it's too early to come to a conclusion.

284
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,970
We’ve checked all the rooms

285
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,250
in the inn.

286
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,640
Young Miss Yu's window couldn't be opened because

287
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,720
it got sealed shut by tree sap from years of ill maintenance.

288
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,980
There was no secret passage

289
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,930
that can lead into the room either.

290
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,160
And there were guards outside the room at all times.

291
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,640
So

292
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,580
whether it was Miss Yun Jiao

293
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,530
or the escorts,

294
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:49,850
they had no way

295
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,730
of transferring Young Miss Yu to another place.

296
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:52,920
That makes no sense.

297
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,030
How could a person disappear

298
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,340
from her room

299
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,240
and die somewhere else?

300
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,930
Master Yu's analysis makes sense.

301
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,810
May I ask

302
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,460
why Second Young Miss Yu ran away from home?

303
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,090
When did she leave?

304
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,460
She disappeared a few days before the Ghost Festival.

305
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,180
I didn't see her in the morning.

306
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,580
Her maid, Qingling, said

307
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,280
she was depressed that day

308
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,380
and wanted to go out alone.

309
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,860
She didn't want anyone to follow her.

310
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,720
But she didn't come back at night.

311
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,620
Yes.

312
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,900
My sister's face was bitten by poisonous insects

313
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,310
and was left with a scar.

314
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,220
We thought we could cure the scar

315
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,470
before the wedding,

316
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,550
but we couldn't.

317
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,550
That's why she was depressed

318
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,770
and ran away.

319
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,120
It was my fault for not realizing how she was feeling.

320
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,320
We sent people to search for her all day,

321
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,780
but we got the news that she had been murdered.

322
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,220
Take a look at this.

323
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,340
Do you recognize this?

324
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,610
This golden needle

325
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,420
was found in Second Young Miss's heart.

326
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,190
This needle can kill people?

327
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,620
This is... the Soul Snatching Needle?

328
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,750
How did it get out?

329
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,870
Madam Yu, do you know where this needle came from?

330
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:24,980
The assassin, Jia Si,

331
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,030
was paid a lot of money to take my father's life.

332
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,490
He was killed by my father.

333
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:32,460
The Soul Snatching Needle fell into my father's hands

334
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,060
and was placed in the Armory.

335
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,590
It's been ten years.

336
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,640
No one has touched it.

337
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,360
Bring me the Armory's records.

338
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:49,580
Madam,

339
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,880
I've checked.

340
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,340
The Soul Snatching Needle,

341
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,060
including the device and twenty golden needles,

342
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,880
has been missing since six months ago.

343
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,540
Who took it?

344
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,610
It was...

345
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,090
Second Young Miss.

346
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,940
You may leave.

347
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:07,470
Yes.

348
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,140
Qiushuang has never entered the Armory.

349
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,340
Yun Jiao must have

350
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,020
asked Qiushuang to borrow it.

351
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,180
She loiters around Yu City all the time,

352
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,440
saying Qiushuang's like a sister to her.

353
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,870
Did she really think I didn't know

354
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,470
why she was sneaking around?

355
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,940
Yun Jiao must have killed Shuang.

356
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,080
Madam Yu,

357
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,390
why do you say that?

358
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:37,870
If Shuang doesn't die,

359
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,680
how can Yun Jiao get what she wants?

360
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,560
Young Hero Fang,

361
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,160
I think the case is closed.

362
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,000
Write the concluding report.

363
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,320
The Yun family won't be able to keep this girl alive.

364
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,700
I'll make her suffer

365
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:56,810
like Shuang did.

366
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,750
I'll burn her alive!

367
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,640
Let's go.

368
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:09,250
[Light clouds cover the moon]

369
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,050
I knew it.

370
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,610
It was you who killed Shuang'er.

371
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,700
If you don't confess,

372
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,110
I have thousands of ways to make you suffer.

373
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,420
Tell me the truth.

374
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:22,900
Stop!

375
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:24,630
Madam Yu!

376
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,000
Are you going to torture her?

377
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,700
Look at her acting crazy.

378
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,410
If I don't torture her, how can I make her talk?

379
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:45,710
Ever since Miss Yun Jiao got traumatized at Xiaomian Inn,

380
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,990
she has been dazed.

381
00:17:47,329 --> 00:17:48,880
If you want to ask her a question,

382
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,540
I'm afraid she can't respond.

383
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:54,930
Physician Li can even revive the dead.

384
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,660
Surely madness is not an issue.

385
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,060
Physician Li,

386
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,760
do something.

387
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,260
Young Hero Fang,

388
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,170
you’re so funny.

389
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,510
Young Hero Fang said Master Li is a renowned miracle physician.

390
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,290
Good.

391
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,410
I also want to see how your medical skills are.

392
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,890
Whether she's really mad or not, she can be cured, right?

393
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,090
Of course.

394
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,750
If he can't cure her,

395
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,290
you can hang him up again

396
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,130
and roast him.

397
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,740
I won't plead for him.

398
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:34,260
Then I'll give it a try.

399
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,490
Don’t play tricks.

400
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,190
Didn’t Young Hero Fang ask me to show my real skills?

401
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:28,980
Be careful.

402
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,190
You care about her quite a bit.

403
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:37,700
Sister Hongzhu.

404
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,140
I...

405
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,340
Looks like Miss Yun is seriously ill.

406
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,620
You can't cure her?

407
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,580
That's not it.

408
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,460
Then why don't you hurry up?

409
00:19:58,910 --> 00:19:59,910
I just need

410
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,590
to find some herbs in Yu City.

411
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,920
There is medicine in Yu City?

412
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,070
I think there must be.

413
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,390
We'll just need to find them.

414
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,440
Hurry up.

415
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,650
This Yu Hongzhu is really overbearing.

416
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,780
If she didn't kill those guards,

417
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,180
we would have witnesses.

418
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,750
Miss, come out.

419
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,540
Miss.

420
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,500
That bowl of porridge...

421
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,070
Miss Yun Jiao is not from Yu City,

422
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,520
but you've taken good care of her.

423
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,780
May I ask

424
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:59,210
why your Madam doesn't like Miss Yun Jiao?

425
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,100
Don't be afraid.

426
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,580
We're asking because

427
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,840
we want to find the murderer.

428
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,590
Don't you want to?

429
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,020
At first,

430
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,980
my Madam was nice to Miss Yun.

431
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,000
But once, Miss Yun secretly wrote a love poem

432
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,970
and got caught by Madam.

433
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:22,240
Madam tore the love poem apart on the spot.

434
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,880
Miss Yun's face was so red,

435
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,740
it was like she was going to bleed.

436
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,790
Since then,

437
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,230
Madam stopped liking Miss Yun.

438
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,270
What was in that poem?

439
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:38,510
I remember two sentences were,

440
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,020
"The pearl in my heart is hard to undo,

441
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:46,290
Flying flowers and willow catkins make me miss you."

442
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,350
Pearl?

443
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,620
Miss Yun Jiao has a pearl on her heart?

444
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,700
He's Yu Qiushuang's fiance.

445
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,580
No wonder Madam is angry with her.

446
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,640
But didn't Second Young Miss notice?

447
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:00,730
No.

448
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,500
Second Young Miss and Miss Yun are close.

449
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,660
A few days ago,

450
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,620
Second Young Miss specially picked

451
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,080
a piece of warm jade for her

452
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,170
as a birthday gift.

453
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,830
Thank you.

[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

455

Are you looking for herbs to cure Yun Jiao?

456
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:37,120
What do you think I’m doing?

457
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,450
You look so careless.

458
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,080
You must be thinking about clues.

459
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,150
You're wrong.

460
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,520
I'm looking for herbs.

461
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:50,360
Excuse me.

Where are we?

464
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,620
These are Madam's quarters.

465
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,160
The osmanthus flowers here are blooming very well.

466
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,320
Madam

467
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,360
likes osmanthus.

468
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,090
In Yu City,

469
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,610
only her quarters have osmanthus flowers.

470
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,450
Thank you.

471
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,600
What are you looking for?

472
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,540
Come and have a look.

473
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,170
Red mud.

474
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:36,790
Petals.

475
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:41,840
I've seen these on the soles of Yu Qiushuang's shoes.

476
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,670
This red mud is red pottery clay.

477
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,650
These flowers are osmanthus flowers.

478
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:50,890
I don't think these two things are common in the north.

479
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,000
Do you remember the weather at Xiaomian Inn?

480
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,080
It was raining.

481
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,570
If there were mud and flowers from Yu City

482
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,890
on her shoes,

483
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,940
they would have been washed away by the rain.

484
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:05,100
Then why had they been preserved?

485
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,300
There's only one possibility.

486
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:08,490
She died here.

487
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,240
She died in Yu City.

488
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,310
But first,

489
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,780
if she really died in Yu City,

490
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,750
how did she appear at Xiaomian Inn?

491
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:18,650
Besides, she looked like

492
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:20,280
she had just died.

493
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:21,790
Second,

494
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:22,900
in Yu City,

495
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,260
there are so many martial arts experts around.

496
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,620
Who could have killed her

497
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,020
without anyone knowing?

498
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,170
Once you figure out these two things,

499
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,080
we'll know.

500
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:35,330
No.

501
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:36,790
One more thing.

502
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,490
When we were at Xiaomian Inn,

503
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,010
we saw Yu Qiushuang enter the inn

504
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,050
with our own eyes.

505
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,740
Are you sure it was Yu Qiushuang?

506
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,350
What do you mean?

507
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,760
Qingling said it just now.

508
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,470
There was a scar on her face

509
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,930
that she didn't want seen by others.

510
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,570
Do you remember that night,

511
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:03,160
when Yu Qiushuang came in, her head was held up while she made a fuss,

512
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,990
as if she was afraid others won't notice

513
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,390
she had a scar on her face?

514
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:09,220
You mean someone pretended to be Yu Qiushuang?

515
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:10,910
Think about it.

516
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,110
This woman

517
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,730
showed up at Yu City and Xiaomian Inn

518
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,090
at the same time.

519
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:17,970
Yun Jiao.

520
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,990
She's acting crazy too.

521
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,620
She must be involved.

522
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,400
Not bad.

523
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,180
You could see she was pretending to be crazy too.

524
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,630
You waved a needle so dramatically

525
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:27,760
in front of her eyes.

526
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,590
Even a lunatic would hide.

527
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,710
She must have been pretending.

528
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,400
But she was close with Yu Qiushuang.

529
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,480
Why would she harm her?

530
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,910
Is it really related to Zongzheng Mingzhu?

531
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:41,870
It's simple.

532
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,790
We'll know after we cure Yun Jiao's madness.

533
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,670
Madam Yu,

534
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,820
we've found the herbs for Yun Jiao.

535
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,820
These herbs

536
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:00,960
need to be boiled into soup

537
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,220
and dried into a paste.

538
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,060
She'll recover after taking it.

539
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,520
These small weeds?

540
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,260
Physician Li,

541
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,650
are you kidding me?

542
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,240
How can I fool Madam Yu?

543
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,380
I promise she will be cured.

544
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:17,590
I've checked.

545
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:21,360
Yun Jiao is the only person who has been in contact with Qiushuang recently.

546
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,900
It'll be good if you cure her.

547
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,630
If you don't,

548
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,840
I'll make her talk no matter what.

549
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:26,490
Guards.

550
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:28,370
Boil Physician Li's herbs.

551
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,410
Madam, wait.

552
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,320
To be honest,

553
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,510
my herbs are a bit special.

554
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,460
After they have been dried into a paste,

555
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,880
I need to make a special primer

556
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,150
for it to be effective.

557
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,640
Why didn't you tell me just now?

558
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,670
When will the primer be ready?

559
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:48,420
Madam Yu agreed to give us until tomorrow

560
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,400
to solve the case.

561
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,330
It's just right.

562
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,940
Didn't you say that Yun Jiao will be cured today?

563
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,970
Why did you change it to tomorrow?

564
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,230
Too straightforward.

565
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:58,840
What?

566
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,630
I didn't sleep well last night.

567
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,450
I need to rest.

568
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,120
The issue hasn't been solved yet.

569
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,120
How can you sleep?

570
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:07,950
Young Hero Fang.

571
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,590
Solving the case is important,

572
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,520
but your health is more important.

573
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:12,840
You know

574
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,110
I cherish my life.

575
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:14,880
Look at you.

576
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,350
You have dark eye circles

577
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,360
and a heaty liver.

578
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,740
You'll get sick if you're too tense.

579
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,340
You may leave.

580
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,320
You're always like this.

581
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,770
You can always keep a distance.

582
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:25,490
But I can't.

583
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,020
When I close my eyes,

584
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,290
I can only think of

585
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,350
what happened in Xiaomian Inn.

586
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,080
The murderer set everything up a long time ago.

587
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,740
Xiaomian Inn was just a stage.

588
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,630
It made us watch

589
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,620
a ghost kill a person as if it were a game.

590
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,930
But the people that have gotten involved are innocent.

591
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:38,570
Happy...

592
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:43,680
Have a drink.

593
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,360
If you hadn't insisted

594
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,050
on taking him on an adventure,

595
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:53,890
or

596
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,690
if you had kept him under your nose

597
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:56,550
and kept an eye on him,

598
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,880
he would have been fine.

599
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:00,300
Is that what you think?

600
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,060
No matter what,

601
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,090
I failed to take good care of Happy.

602
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,820
When people are young,

603
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,360
they are at their most energetic.

604
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,130
You always think

605
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:17,330
it is your responsibility to protect the world.

606
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:18,410
And you always feel

607
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,020
you can protect everyone around you.

608
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,740
But the truth is

609
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,430
many things

610
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,690
are not as simple as we think

611
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,970
and are out of our control.

612
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,030
Your servant's misfortune

613
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,550
made you very upset.

614
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,250
But you don't have to

615
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,640
blame yourself for everything.

616
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:43,970
People

617
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,560
must learn to forgive themselves.

618
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:48,880
Here.

619
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,340
Have some tea.

620
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:56,130
Are you comforting me?

621
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,650
Didn't you say that everyone in the Jinyuan Alliance

622
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:58,850
are evil and vicious?

623
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,760
Why are you so kind?

624
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,390
I told you.

625
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,350
You misunderstood me from the beginning.

626
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,550
But I still think it's wrong.

627
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,340
If Yu Qiushuang really died in Yu City,

628
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,410
she has been dead for more than seven days.

629
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:18,140
Why was the body still bleeding

630
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,180
when we saw her?

631
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:24,920
Try it.

632
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,760
Fresh frozen watermelon.

633
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,780
You're still in the mood to eat melon?

634
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,220
The secrets are all inside.

635
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:30,600
Se...

636
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,320
Secrets?

637
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,230
Try it.

638
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,970
It's only been a while.

639
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,100
Why has it gone bad?

640
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:48,600
The rotten body.

641
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,130
You're quick.

642
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:53,000
Frozen watermelon always goes bad faster.

643
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,960
No wonder Yu Qiushuang's body

644
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,980
was fine at Xiaomian Inn,

645
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,760
but rotted as soon as we arrived in Yu City.

646
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,110
It turns out she was put into the envoy box together with ice cubes.

647
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:02,850
The ice cubes

648
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,350
should have been made of blood.

649
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,710
I'm afraid blood was frozen

650
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:13,530
so that it could melt into blood

651
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,510
and create the illusion that Yu Qiushuang had just died.

652
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,530
It's so detailed.

653
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,970
No wonder it was burnt.

654
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,330
It can't be hidden.

655
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,240
This is just the first mystery.

656
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,850
Think about it.

657
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,990
If Yu Qiushuang died in Yu City,

658
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:28,240
why would she appear at Xiaoyan Inn?

659
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,130
Because from the beginning,

660
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,970
Yu Qiushuang was in the box.

661
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,510
Let's go.

662
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,930
Xiaomian Inn.

663
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,660
I need to go to the kitchen.

664
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,510
Why?

665
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,300
I think better in the kitchen.

666
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,870
The blood footprints that day are still here.

667
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,170
Come.

668
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,520
Come and have a look.

669
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,540
I'll show you blood footprints too.

670
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,380
Excuse me.

671
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,330
What's going on?

672
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:58,100
Paste made from red twilight grass is colorless.

673
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,760
But once it encounters water,

674
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,130
it will turn red.

675
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,020
Isn't this the herb

676
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,440
you wanted to use to treat Yun Jiao that day?

677
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,370
Yes.

678
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,190
Red twilight grass

679
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,720
grows in the yard in Yu City.

680
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,810
She picked it, made it into a paste, and painted it into ghost footprints.

681
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:33,060
Of course she'd recognize it.

682
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,360
After she sees the medicine,

683
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,370
she'll recover naturally.

684
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,600
What about the green ghost?

685
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,670
Everyone in the inn saw it that day.

686
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,220
Fireflies?

687
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,900
She sealed fireflies in the window.

688
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,380
But how did she turn

689
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,860
Yun Jiao into Yu Qiushuang

690
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,940
right under everyone's noses?

691
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:26,340
Smell it.

692
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,210
Hemp?

693
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,490
The water here

694
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,470
is mixed with hemp

695
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,790
to make people tipsy.

696
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,230
It's easier for Yun Jiao to make the swap

697
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,750
when people can't see properly.

698
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,070
What are you looking at?

699
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,000
Don't look at me!

700
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,020
After she puts down the veil,

701
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,720
everything will be fine.

702
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:56,220
Yun Jiao put a lot of effort into it.

703
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:56,980
Unfortunately, we didn't come here

704
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,880
to find evidence of Yun Jiao's crime.

705
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,480
Then what?

706
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:01,920
To prove Yun Jiao's innocence.

707
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:07,840
Here.

708
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,870
It's the same as the golden needle that killed Yu Qiushuang.

709
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,930
But this jade is...

710
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,290
It's the jade Qingling said

711
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:22,350
Yu Qiushuang gave to Yun Jiao.

712
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,460
Someone wants to kill her.

713
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,540
It's such an elaborate show.

714
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,650
Yun Jiao couldn't have done it alone.

715
00:35:12,909 --> 00:35:14,690
It hasn't been destroyed yet.

716
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:22,389
Shadow puppet?

717
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,600
This case

718
00:35:23,969 --> 00:35:26,199
reminds me of a small sect.

719
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:28,409
The Pu family of Hujiang.

720
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,860
Over ten years ago,

721
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:33,800
the Pu family of Hujiang were renowned

722
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,280
for their shadow puppetry.

723
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,480
But unexpectedly,

724
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:38,950
they were destroyed overnight

725
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:41,660
due to gambling debts.

726
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,320
After that, they disappeared.

727
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,860
The silk strings are very thin.

728
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:52,410
It seems that as long as the person who holds the strings is skilled,

729
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:55,410
they can manipulate the puppet from outside the room.

730
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:56,750
That's right.

731
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,750
Yu Qiushuang died in Yu City,

732
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,460
but her body was sealed into the escort box together with blood ice

733
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,980
and sent to the escort agency.

734
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,540
The murderer then bribed Cheng Yunhe,

735
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,390
claiming it was the body of a prisoner.

736
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,460
Cheng Yunhe didn’t want to be exposed,

737
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,510
so he wouldn’t check the boxes one by one.

738
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,990
So Yu Qiushuang's body

739
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,430
was transported to Xiaomian Inn.

740
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,050
Yun Jiao brought the guards there under the guise of searching for Yu Qiushuang

741
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,820
so she could move in one day early

742
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,550
and set everything up at night.

743
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,890
The next evening,

744
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:28,360
she came in as Yu Qiushuang

745
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,110
and used shadow puppetry to fabricate a conversation between the two of them.

746
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,540
The guards in the distance

747
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:36,000
would only think their Second Young Miss had really returned.

748
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,910
The escort boxes were airtight since they were made of cold iron,

749
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:40,860
so the blood ice melted after exactly six days.

750
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,800
When the goods were carried into the inn,

751
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,460
blood seeped out of the boxes.

752
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,420
Once someone approached, they would notice something was off.

753
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,240
At that time, Yun Jiao took off her disguise

754
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,010
and went down to take a bath alone.

755
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,400
When blood seeped down,

756
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,710
she pointed everyone to the second floor

757
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:57,280
so the guards would find Second Young Miss missing.

758
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,680
The bloodied escort boxes would be opened.

759
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,720
Yu Qiushuang's body would thus be revealed.

760
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,080
This show of a ghost killing a person

761
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,140
would be complete.

762
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,350
This show needed

763
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:10,550
someone else killed as a lead-in.

764
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:14,110
But unexpectedly, Happy happened to be on the second floor.

765
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:16,940
He was very unlucky.

766
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,050
Yun Jiao was on the first floor,

767
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,280
so it was the person hiding in the shadows who killed Happy.

768
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,440
The person who could make Yun Jiao play so many tricks

769
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,240
and pretend to be crazy...

770
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:32,590
is Zongzheng Mingzhu.

771
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,870
Yun Jiao went this far,

772
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,980
but she didn't expect that

773
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,370
the murderer wants to kill her too.

774
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,860
What are we waiting for?

775
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,720
For the murderer to strike again.

776
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,280
Before we set off,

777
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,310
didn't you set up a trap

778
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,400
in Yun Jiao's room?

779
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,140
You know that too?

780
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,330
You're really cunning.

781
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,280
Now,

782
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:58,070
we can only wait for the murderer to get caught

783
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,950
to solve my last question.

784
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,000
What question?

785
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,800
That needle and that palm.

786
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:06,350
Why did the murderer kill Yu Qiushuang twice?

787
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,420
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

788
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,150
Turn around and show your face.

789
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:45,820
It's me.

790
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,570
Master Yu?

791
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,600
What are you doing?

792
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,550
You want to kill Yun Jiao.

793
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,880
You're the one who killed Yu Qiushuang?

794
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,440
I was just worried about her condition,

795
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,640
so I came to visit her.

796
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,390
Yun Jiao has been crazy for two days,

797
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,740
but you came here only now.

798
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:09,540
You're afraid she might say something wrong, right?

799
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,800
Watch your language.

800
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,760
Don't forget our statuses.

801
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,640
What's happening in the middle of the night?

802
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,160
Madam.

803
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,840
Young Master Fang.

804
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,240
What are you doing?

805
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,290
It's a misunderstanding.

806
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:27,200
Why are you here?

807
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:29,410
Madam Yu, you came at the right time.

808
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:33,070
The murderer who killed Second Young Miss is right in front of you.

809
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:33,880
What?

810
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,270
Wasn't it Yun Jiao?

811
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,110
Yun Jiao

812
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,430
was just trying to help Castellan.

813
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:48,300
Yun Jiao helped Yu Mulan?

814
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Castellan Yu

815
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,580
has a close relationship with Miss Yun Jiao.

816
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,120
Miss Yun once wrote a poem,

817
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,140
but got found out by Madam Yu.

818
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,760
"The pearl on my heart cannot be untied,

819
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,290
flying flowers and willow catkins make me miss you.""

820
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,740
Wasn't this poem for...

821
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:06,270
Wasn't this poem for Young Master Zongzheng?

822
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:10,130
Pearl can have many meanings,

823
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,570
I don't dare to monopolize all of them.

824
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,500
I'd like to hear your explanation.

825
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,270
The "flying flowers and willow catkins"

826
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:17,150
are what Miss Yun really loves.

827
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,740
It's related to

828
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,780
the dandelion pendant on her wrist.

829
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,100
The Pu family of Hujiang has the dandelion as their family emblem.

830
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,440
It seems that Master Pu is very loyal to the Pu family

831
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,020
even after marrying into Yu City.

832
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:46,210
So you're the one she likes.

833
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:47,930
Pu Mulan.

834
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,340
You played me like a fool.

835
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,670
You haven't let go of the Pu family.

836
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:57,660
The Pu family earned a lot of money

837
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,920
through shadow puppetry in those years.

838
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:01,400
Unfortunately,

839
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:03,010
the late master was a gambler.

840
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:05,340
The Pu family wanted to revamp themselves

841
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,990
to gain a good reputation.

842
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:24,620
Thank you, Miss.

843
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,120
Madam, this shadow puppet

844
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,970
was found at Xiaomian Inn.

845
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:33,120
The murderer wanted to use shadow puppetry

846
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,260
to create the impression that a ghost was the murderer.

847
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,850
And the other shadow puppet

848
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:39,850
was found in Master Yu's study.

849
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:44,190
The Pu family has a unique skill called the "Thousand Transformations of Fire"

850
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,700
which allows the puppeteer to control their strings from afar.

851
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,220
Wouldn't using your ancestors' prized skill to commit murder

852
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,450
make them unrestful?

853
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,200
You just dug up my past

854
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:59,030
to frame me.

855
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,860
I have no grudge against her.

856
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,140
Why should I kill her?

857
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,530
Fine.

858
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:06,360
Even if I killed her,

859
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,860
I could have ditched the body far away.

860
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,330
Why would I go to all this trouble

861
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,460
to expose her body?

862
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:16,730
Of course you had a reason.

863
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,680
Pu Mulan.

864
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,690
You were born with a predilection for gambling

865
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:21,020
because of your father.

866
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,780
He lost all his assets,

867
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:25,070
so you could only marry into Yu City.

868
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,500
Unfortunately,

869
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:29,310
you are a gambler.

870
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:30,930
In order to avoid Madam Yu,

871
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:33,480
you could only repay your debt by faking the accounts

872
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,140
while guarding the jade mine.

873
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:38,440
Unfortunately, Yu Qiushuang holds half of Yu City's property.

874
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,770
According to the rules,

875
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,180
if Yu Qiushuang goes missing,

876
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,860
the mines are still hers.

877
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,710
Only by proving that she's dead

878
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:46,570
can Madam Yu inherit everything.

879
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:47,940
Pu Mulan.

880
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:50,250
Only you

881
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,910
have the chance to fake the accounts to repay your debts.

882
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:55,960
Yu City is famous.

883
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:58,290
Maybe it's too rich.

884
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,780
Pu Mulan,

885
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,070
am I right?

886
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,760
You’re slandering me!

887
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,200
Young Master Fang.

888
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:15,900
The Fang family has banks everywhere.

889
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:16,950
I asked around

890
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:19,790
and it was easy to find this gambler's accounts.

891
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:21,970
Pu Mulan.

892
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:23,400
I'm afraid you owe money

893
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:27,450
to all the gambling dens within a hundred li radius from here.

894
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:31,720
Pu Mulan,

895
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,080
you traitor!

896
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,640
I thought you had corrected those bad habits

897
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,370
after marrying into my family.

898
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,260
I didn't expect you would

899
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,170
kill my sister for money.

900
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,220
Madam,

901
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:47,630
how can you believe these two swindlers?

902
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,760
I didn't.

903
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:49,470
You didn't?

904
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:52,900
Castellan Yu really didn't leave anything to chance.

905
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,190
You knew that as long as we investigated Second Young Miss Yu's body

906
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:56,750
and talked to the guards that were present,

907
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:58,680
we would definitely find the loophole.

908
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,480
So, you burned the body at night.

909
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:01,890
But you never thought

910
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,050
Madam Yu would come back early

911
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,230
to rescue the body before it had been burned completely.

912
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,580
Unfortunately, Madam Yu,

913
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,580
you were angry

914
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,120
and killed all the guards.

915
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,520
They never had a chance to speak.

916
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:15,830
Your disregard for the guards' lives

917
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:18,910
was exactly what the murderer wanted.
