4
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:39,660
Let's go.

5
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,950
What's on your mind?

6
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,350
Since no one went out all night,

7
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,300
the murderer and the body

8
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,900
might not have left.

9
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,470
Li.

10
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:19,820
Li.

11
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,780
Why is there such a big red candle here?

12
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,960
These are all instructed by the Second Sect Master.

13
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,570
She likes luxurious things.

14
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,370
She likes lively moods.

15
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,740
She also wanted the bridal chamber to be lit up

16
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,700
by candlelight for three days and three nights.

17
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,100
So she specially ordered these big red candles.

18
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,440
There are some more in the cabinet.

19
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,440
Here, have a look.

20
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,030
It's all gone.

21
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,760
They're all burned up.

22
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,030
It's only been one night since the wedding.

23
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,430
How did they burn so fast?

24
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,360
Look at this.

25
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,120
There's something inside.

26
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,360
What are these?

27
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,980
These are fragments of the red jade bed.

28
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:08,940
A few years ago,

29
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,810
my mother got some fine raw red jade.

30
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,030
She made our beds with them.

31
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,700
It's warm in the winter and cool in the summer. It's very useful.

32
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,980
Red jade bed?

33
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,079
This is not red jade.

34
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,380
It's wax.

35
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,900
The red candles in the cabinet disappeared.

36
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,650
The red candles on the candlestick are of varying lengths.

37
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,440
Looks like someone broke the bed

38
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,870
and melted the red candles in the room

39
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,829
to cover it up.

40
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,880
Looks like

41
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,079
the broken red jade fragments

42
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,900
were probably scattered

43
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,720
in every corner of the room.

44
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,220
If I'm not mistaken,

45
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:56,720
the body

46
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,290
is under the red jade bed.

47
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,050
Why is it a female body?

48
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,430
Judging from her hairstyle,

49
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,430
she should be a maid of the Tianji Mountain Manor.

50
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,390
This seems to be Er Yue.

51
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,649
Er Yue?

52
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,829
Why don't I know her?

53
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,780
She only came recently.

54
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,550
Young Master, you haven't been home.

55
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,390
It's natural that you don't know her.

56
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,720
She only came recently?

57
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,120
On her back.

58
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,220
There's a strangling mark on her neck.

59
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,750
Her neck bone is broken too.

60
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,030
It's a fatal injury.

61
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,310
Such a thin strangling mark.

62
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,180
That means the murder tool

63
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,150
must be tough and fatal.

64
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,330
But there is no such thing

65
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,350
in this room or the entire manor.

66
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,220
This is the murder weapon.

67
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,730
Looks like this woman came prepared.

68
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,000
The murderer

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,790
killed her with her own item.

70
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,780
I'm afraid she wanted to kill someone,

71
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,310
but she was killed instead.

72
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,100
But originally,

73
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,020
only the Second Sect Master and Wei Qingchou were here.

74
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,150
Unless, last night,

75
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,140
someone escaped your sight and barged in.

76
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,180
Otherwise, the other possibility is that

77
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,520
the groom is not dead.

78
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,200
He plotted all this.

79
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,950
He deliberately embroidered the same pattern

80
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,210
on the murderer's back

81
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,909
and pretended to be dead.

82
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,100
Then, he ran away.

83
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,140
That's right.

84
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,260
Look.

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,460
There's a wine stain here.

86
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,720
Why is there a wine stain here?

87
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,510
Did someone spill it here on purpose?

88
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,230
That means

89
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,080
Wei Qingchou knew something was wrong with the wine.

90
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,830
But he never pointed it out.

91
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,830
It's likely that the wine

92
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,420
was poisoned by Er Yue herself.

93
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,710
She sneaked into the bridal chamber with her

94
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,640
hidden weapon and intended to kill Wei Qingchou.

95
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,530
But unexpectedly,

96
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,700
she was killed by Wei Qingchou instead.

97
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,210
But I kept guard outside the entire time.

98
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,820
How did Er Yue get in?

99
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,430
If I'm not mistaken,

100
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,680
the wedding night is full of rites.

101
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,460
So a lot of people were moving in and out.

102
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,700
Maybe this Er Yue

103
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,400
came in to decorate the room and never left.

104
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,460
Er Yue hid in the room,

105
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,110
drugged the wine,

106
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,420
and waited for the chance to attack Wei Qingchou.

107
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,180
But when Wei Qingchou returned to the room,

108
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,280
he noticed something wrong

109
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,690
and decided to play along.

110
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,580
He pretended to be drunk, went to bed,

111
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,780
and waited for the chance to kill Er Yue.

112
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,240
I was thinking about this.

113
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,700
If someone had knocked into the dressing table during the fight,

114
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,460
shouldn't the dressing table and mirror rack

115
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,060
both topple with the mirror?

116
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:22,250
Why did the first two remain untouched

117
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,040
while the mirror alone fell down?

118
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,400
You mean

119
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,160
Wei Qingchou used this mirror

120
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,500
to kill Er Yue?

121
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,550
After Wei Qingchou took Miss He to bed,

122
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,880
he pretended to use the mirror to tidy up his appearance.

123
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,270
Er Yue thought Wei Qingchou

124
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,980
was already drugged by the wine,

125
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,440
so she prepared to strike.

126
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,040
But Wei Qingchou had long noticed

127
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,780
Er Yue's every move.

128
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,770
So this mirror

129
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:15,410
is evidence of Wei Qingchou killing Er Yue.

130
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,430
But...

131
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,290
But what?

132
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,350
The mark on the neck

133
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,280
is very clear.

134
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,460
It's obviously a fatal move.

135
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,150
It proves that the murderer

136
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,770
is not bad at martial arts.

137
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,580
Zhan.

138
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,380
Are you sure Wei Qingchou is bad at martial arts?

139
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,539
I once tested his skills.

140
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,460
His moves were clumsy

141
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,390
and cowardly.

142
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,380
His inner power was weak too.

143
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,440
He admitted defeat

144
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,770
within two to three moves.

145
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:43,970
That's strange then.

146
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,370
Who is Wei Qingchou?

147
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,060
Why did Er Yue want to kill him?

148
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,600
Also,

149
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:49,820
how did he

150
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,480
avoid Zhan's surveillance and escape the room?

151
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,420
Er Yue's headpiece

152
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,270
seems to be different from yours.

153
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,540
I think I've seen the shape carved

154
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,720
on the silver plate of the headpiece before.

155
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:16,950
This pattern

156
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,090
is the same as the pattern on Xing Ziru's jade pendant.

157
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,010
Is she Xing Ziru's spy?

158
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,330
Did they use this pattern to identify each other?

159
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:24,830
Oh no.

160
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,710
Er Yue was also here for the Rama Heavenly Ice.

161
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,340
Let's go check on Xing Ziru.

162
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,210
Let's go.

163
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,980
Young Master.

164
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,180
Xing Ziru is missing.

165
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,120
What happened?

166
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,220
Didn't I ask you to keep an eye on him?

167
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,320
It's our fault.

168
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,530
We had someone keeping an eye on Xing Ziru at first.

169
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,530
But the incident in the bridal chamber

170
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,460
attracted many people in the manor.

171
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,170
Xing Ziru took the chance to sneak into the crowd

172
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,030
and disappeared.

173
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,710
What about the Rama Heavenly Ice?

174
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,170
Guardian Zhan is guarding the secret warehouse.

175
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:54,890
It is safe.

176
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,100
But not long before Xing Ziru went missing,

177
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,460
he did wander outside the secret storehouse for a while.

178
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,720
He disappeared later.

179
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,420
The entrance to the villa is still sealed.

180
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,960
He can't escape from the villa.

181
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,690
Take some men to search around.

182
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,610
Yes.

183
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:07,460
Let's go.

184
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,350
Since Er Yue

185
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,420
was the link between Wei Qingchou

186
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,820
and Xing Ziru,

187
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,510
let's see if she left anything behind.

188
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,260
This was Er Yue's bed.

189
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,970
[Book of 300 Poems]

190
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:00,690
Book of 300 Poems?

191
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,220
Oh, right.

192
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,580
Er Yue often

193
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,910
sat alone in the corner reading this book.

194
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,750
She had the mood to read when she was here to kill someone.

195
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,390
That's similar to Xing Ziru's and his mood for chess.

196
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:17,720
Take a look.

197
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,150
Which poem is this?

198
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,520
Are you kidding me?

199
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,220
This is not the Book of 300 Poems.

200
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,570
[Carefree and Innocent Pastime Collection]

201
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,520
Carefree and Innocent Pastime Collection.

202
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,150
Look.

203
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,390
Xing Ziru

204
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,410
set up the chess pieces according to this book.

205
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,030
Er Yue also had a copy of this book.

206
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,100
This can't be a coincidence, can it?

207
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,560
The picture of the Four Immortals of Chengdu.

208
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,520
I knew it.

209
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,470
What do you mean?

210
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,340
Look.

211
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,890
The text on the right page

212
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,330
of every chess array in this book

213
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,260
has exactly 19 rows and 19 columns.

214
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,090
It's exactly the same as the number of lines on the chessboard.

215
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,090
You mean,

216
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,980
the position of each word

217
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,510
corresponds to an intersection on the board?

218
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,130
If I'm not mistaken,

219
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,790
every piece in the chess array

220
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,520
represents a corresponding character.

221
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,980
The picture of the Four Immortals of Chengdu

222
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,780
that Xing Ziru displayed

223
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,110
has two more chess pieces than usual.

224
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,590
The same goes for the other three arrays.

225
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,060
Pretty much every array has two to three extra pieces.

226
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,160
The corresponding words of these extra pieces

227
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,480
will form the message Xing Ziru wanted to send out.

228
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,460
Xing Ziru's Shangqing array

229
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,320
has an extra white piece

230
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,600
in the third column of the seventh row.

231
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,820
The word in the third column of the seventh row

232
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,480
is "Bride".

233
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,670
There's also an extra black piece.

234
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,550
This one corresponds to "Groom".

235
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,100
Bridegroom.

236
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,340
[Bridegroom. Rama Heavenly Ice. Another in the secret warehouse. Change of plan.]

237

Bridegroom.

238
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:17,990
Rama Heavenly Ice.

239
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,850
Another in the secret warehouse.

240
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,780
Change of plan.

241
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,420
"Another in the secret warehouse" should refer to

242
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,200
the Rama Heavenly Ice displayed by my mother.

243
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,600
As for the Bridegroom...

244
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,120
Is the missing Rama Heavenly Ice

245
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,040
in Wei Qingchou's possession?

246
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,240
Xing Ziru is missing.

247
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,290
Could it be that he knows where Wei Qingchou is?

248
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,050
Maybe.

249
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,250
When he heard that something had happened in the Manor,

250
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,580
he probably knew

251
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,940
that Er Yue had an accident.

252
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,330
If we can find out

253
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,660
how Wei Qingchou left the bridal chamber,

254
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,630
we can follow the clues to find his whereabouts.

255
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,190
Li, the group of you

256
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,040
had been on standby outside.

257
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,020
Then who found out about the incident today?

258
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,300
We came in together.

259
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,220
According to the rules, this morning,

260
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,980
the eight of us bridesmaids were supposed to

261
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,580
bring the basin in for the couple to groom themselves.

262
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,640
But after knocking at the door,

263
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,370
no one answered for a long time.

264
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,420
We were afraid of a delay,

265
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,530
so we decided to enter the room ourselves.

266
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,370
Then, we saw the mess on the floor

267
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,970
and a bloody bed.

268
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,220
And then?

269
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,700
I was scared at the beginning.

270
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,250
I saw everyone run out,

271
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,610
so I followed them.

272
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,460
Me too.

273
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,460
Me too.

274
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,060
Who ran out first?

275
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,180
Who called for help?

276
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,950
It wasn't me.

277
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,340
It wasn't me.

278
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:52,980
Not me either.

279
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,060
I was so scared,

280
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,220
I could only focus on running.

281
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,150
I didn't have time to call for help.

282
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,640
I think you were in front of me.

283
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,640
You shouted, didn't you?

284
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,480
I didn't.

285
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,180
Neither did I.

286
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,110
This is strange.

287
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,470
None of us ran out first?

288
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,100
None of us yelled for help either.

289
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,410
But I definitely heard it.

290
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:07,890
Indeed.

291
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:08,940
I heard it too.

292
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,360
A woman called for help.

293
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,810
That's why I rushed here.

294
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,920
Since none of you ran out first,

295
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,060
and none of you yelled for help,

296
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,220
that means

297
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,190
a ninth person called for help.

298
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:21,700
A ninth person?

299
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,980
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

300
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,320
There's no ninth person here.

301
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,070
You mean Wei Qingchou

302
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,420
disguised himself as a maid,

303
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,350
mixed into the group, and escaped?

304
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,030
Exactly.

305
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,180
Since Er Yue can make use of the crowd

306
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:35,880
to sneak in,

307
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,620
why can't Wei Qingchou

308
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,730
use the same method to sneak out?

309
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,930
This explains why

310
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,460
Er Yue's outer clothing is missing.

311
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,870
If we were talking about a woman,

312
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,220
that's completely possible.

313
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,620
But Wei Qingchou is a man.

314
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,640
No matter how good his disguise was,

315
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,000
he couldn't possibly have changed his voice.

316
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,430
Maybe the groom

317
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,800
is a woman.

318
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,600
Li Lianhua.

319
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,340
Can you stop fooling around?

320
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,620
Fang Xiaobao, did you forget?

321
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,620
You couldn't recognize Su Xiaoyong

322
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,300
when she disguised herself as a man.

323
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:08,720
I...

324
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,820
I wasn't looking clearly back then.

325
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:13,510
Besides,

326
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,390
there are so many people here.

327
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,180
Can't any of us tell the difference between a man and a woman?

328
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,980
Besides, my aunt and Wei Qingchou

329
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,290
spent so much time together.

330
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,980
How could she not have noticed?

331
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,460
I just figured it out.

332
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:24,860
Brother Zhan,

333
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,060
you said Wei Qingchou's martial arts skills

334
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,990
were clumsy and cowardly.

335
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,460
Did you notice that

336
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,180
he was constantly shielding his Shenque acupoint

337
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,910
and didn't dare to fight freely

338
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,750
during the spar?

339
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,100
How did you know?

340
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,460
That's it.

341
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,160
Have you heard of

342
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,880
a unique martial arts skill

343
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,600
called the Dragon Phoenix Shift?

344
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,940
The Dragon Phoenix Shift?

345
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,690
Rumour has it that

346
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,910
this magical skill can temporarily change one's gender.

347
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,560
In actual fact, it can only change

348
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,140
one's appearance and voice.

349
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,610
Still, it's hard for ordinary people to tell the difference.

350
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,380
But it's a hard skill to master.

351
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,780
That's why few people in the martial world know it.

352
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,510
I know someone who does.

353
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:12,849
Liangyi Fairy.

354
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:19,410
Liangyi Fairy was the wife of Four-faced Qingzun,

355
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:22,240
one of the three masters of the Jinyuan Alliance.

356
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,839
I heard she had completely mastered the Dragon Phoenix Shift.

357
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,040
Four-faced Qingzun?

358
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,630
Didn't we find out in the Girls' Mansion that

359
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,890
Four-faced Qingzun was

360
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,560
one of the four descendants of Nanyin?

361
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,360
That's right.

362
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,550
Maybe

363
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,500
this is the real reason why Liangyi Fairy

364
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,570
also wanted the Rama Heavenly Ice.

365
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,270
Sect Master.

366
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,230
I've got the kitchen ledger for you.

367
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:45,890
Thank you.

368
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,590
Since Wei Qingchou came,

369
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,690
eels have been included

370
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,220
on the daily menu.

371
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,020
The chef said Wei Qingchou told him himself.

372
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,420
He said he was weak and

373
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,640
needed to replenish blood every day.

374
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,190
It's not for replenishing his blood.

375
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,120
But he did need it

376
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,730
to maintain the Dragon Phoenix Shift.

377
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,130
What does it have to do with that?

378
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,380
All eels

379
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,050
are born female.

380
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,540
After laying eggs,

381
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,220
they turn male instead.

382
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,780
So eating the eels

383
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,870
can maintain the stability of the Dragon Phoenix Shift.

384
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,200
Is the Shenque acupoint

385
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,600
the weakness for dispelling this skill?

386
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:38,630
Yes.

387
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,120
So, Wei Qingchou...

388
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:41,850
No.

389
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,450
I should call her Liangyi Fairy.

390
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,430
When you fought her,

391
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,570
her moves were clumsy and cowardly.

392
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,190
But when she killed Er Yue,

393
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,360
she didn't have to hide her gender.

394
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,620
So she killed her with one move.

395
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,460
According to your analysis,

396
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,450
after killing Er Yue,

397
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,600
Liangyi Fairy turned back to her female self.

398
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,690
[Liangyi Fairy]

399
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,300
Madam?

400
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:35,550
Master?

401
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:48,680
Blood!

402
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,580
Help!

403
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,360
Somebody!

404
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,320
There's blood!

405
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,460
Liangyi Fairy realized that they knew

406
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,740
the Rama Heavenly Ice was in her hand.

407
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,400
So she pretended to be killed,

408
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,290
cut off the skin on Er Yue's back,

409
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,480
embroidered the same tattoo she had on it,

410
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,880
and finally hid the body.

411
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,060
This way, she made her secret escape.

412
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:05,660
So,

413
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,720
Wei Qingchou was really Liangyi Fairy in disguise?

414
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:09,980
That's how

415
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,660
he managed to escape

416
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,260
under Guardian Zhan's nose.

417
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,380
My poor silly sister.

418
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,030
Currently, the Rama Heavenly Ice

419
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,890
must still be with Liangyi Fairy.

420
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:23,190
The Dragon Phoenix Shift consumes a lot of inner power.

421
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,590
Liangyi Fairy must be extremely weak right now.

422
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,290
So we must

423
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,870
find her before Xing Ziru does.

424
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,340
Exhausted, you say?

425
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,120
Mother,

426
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,890
do you remember the ice fire hot spring in the back mountain?

427
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,210
Did Liangyi Fairy visit that place

428
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,650
during the time she was here?

429
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:39,290
Yes.

430
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,120
Why didn't I think of that?

431
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,460
The hot spring balances Yin and Yang perfectly.

432
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,980
It must be a good place to help people restore their power.

433
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,160
With your aunt's personality,

434
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,270
she must have taken Wei Qingchou there

435
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,210
when she saw that

436
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,700
he was heavily injured.

437
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,610
I believe the Liangyi Fairy

438
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,220
is there right now.

439
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,030
This Liangyi Fairy.

440
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,160
How dare she lie to me!

441
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,620
Just wait till I catch her.

442
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,140
It’s really her.

443
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,220
Give me the Rama Heavenly Ice

444
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,530
and I'll spare your life.

445
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,330
Dream on!

446
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,310
How dare you

447
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,660
make a scene in Tianji Hall's territory?

448
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,260
Xiaofeng!

449
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,380
I'll deal with you later.

450
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,310
Second Sect Master.

451
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,420
Do you still intend

452
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,450
to protect this husband of yours?

453
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:42,890
So what if I do?

454
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,400
We had a wedding together.

455
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,870
Her matters are my matters.

456
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:46,840
And I'm the only one

457
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,170
who can decide her fate.

458
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,260
That'll depend on your ability.

459
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,030
Be careful!

460
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,310
I was drugged.

461
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,280
I haven't fully recovered.

462
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,060
If you dare,

463
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,260
we'll fight again

464
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,820
when I fully regain my martial arts skills.

465
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:22,640
Good.

466
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,330
You can leave with me.

467
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,140
Once we leave this place,

468
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,010
I'll have plenty of time to wait for your recovery.

469
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:37,950
Yunfei!

470
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,050
Aunt!

471
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,350
Are you okay?

472
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,310
Are you okay?

473
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,280
I'm fine.

474
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,120
How dare you ask?

475
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,860
Why didn't you come to save me?

476
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,220
If it weren't for Yunfei,

477
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,060
I would have been

478
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,220
abducted by Xing Ziru

479
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,420
to be his trophy wife.

480
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,250
Thank goodness Zhan is here then.

481
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,120
Let's meet up with Li Lianhua.

482
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:15,560
[Tianji Mountain Manor]

483
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:20,640
[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

484
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,590
Li Lianhua.

485
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,130
How is she?

486
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,610
Her true force is exhausted.

487
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:37,300
I'm afraid

488
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,790
there's nothing we can do.

489
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,200
It doesn't matter.

490
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,380
I've done

491
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,360
what I was requested to do.

492
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,580
Is this matter you speak of,

493
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,320
related to the Rama Heavenly Ice?

494
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,990
So the Rama Heavenly Ice

495
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,500
is really with you.

496
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,340
Master He.

497
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,280
Master He.

498
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:13,420
Mr. Pi helped us a lot.

499
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,220
Before he died,

500
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,600
he told me to give you

501
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,060
the Rama Heavenly Ice.

502
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,120
Before he died?

503
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,300
So Senior Pi...

504
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,540
After he left Tianji Hall,

505
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,430
he was ambushed

506
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,380
and lost function in both legs.

507
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,310
He was saved by Fo, Bi, Bai, and Shi of Baichuan Court.

508
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,890
So he decided

509
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,620
to help Baichuan Court

510
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,860
guard the 188th prison,

511
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,020
the Dragon King's Coffin.

512
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,500
Since then, he never entered the martial world again.

513
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,450
No wonder

514
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,630
he disappeared for the past years.

515
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,660
My husband and I

516
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,260
were trapped in the Dragon King's Coffin for years.

517
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,590
He was injured when he was still alive,

518
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,640
and Mr. Pi helped him several times.

519
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,590
I don't know how

520
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:08,890
the Jinyuan Alliance found the location of the Dragon King's Coffin.

521
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,150
They came to attack us.

522
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,860
In order to protect the Dragon King's Coffin,

523
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:16,730
Mr. Pi

524
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:20,830
died in battle.

525
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:32,670
Jiao Liqiao ventured into the 188 prisons several times

526
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:36,030
to find the Four-faced Qingzun

527
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,180
and take away his Rama Heavenly Ice.

528
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,050
That's right.

529
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,860
Unfortunately, 10 years ago,

530
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:47,220
my husband noticed that Jiao Liqiao

531
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,060
secretly coveted the Rama Heavenly Ice.

532
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,460
He had also started to distrust the Jinyuan Alliance.

533
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,570
So before he died,

534
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:59,670
he gave the Rama Heavenly Ice to Mr. Pi.

535
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,940
When the Dragon King's Coffin was broken into,

536
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,260
Mr. Pi knew this item was dangerous,

537
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,500
but he couldn't destroy it.

538
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:11,790
So he asked me to take Rama Heavenly Ice

539
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:15,290
to Tianji Mountain Manor

540
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,590
and pass it to Master He.

541
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,350
In that case,

542
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,720
why did you lie to me?

543
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,650
Xiaofeng.

544
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,840
I didn't mean to lie to you.

545
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,260
Unfortunately,

546
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,200
after I got out of the 188th prison,

547
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,160
I've been hunted by Jiao Liqiao's henchmen.

548
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,880
In order to conceal myself,

549
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,110
I had to turn myself into a man

550
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,420
using the Dragon Phoenix Shift.

551
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:47,860
But

552
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,920
I was badly injured.

553
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:51,420
So, I fainted

554
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,290
on the roadside that day.

555
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,550
Then,

556
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,990
I saved you and brought you back to Tianji Mountain Manor.

557
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:02,380
But Master He was not home.

558
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,340
Mr. Pi asked me to

559
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,910
hand it to you personally.

560
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,980
I dared not give it to anyone else.

561
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,150
Meanwhile,

562
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,990
Xiaofeng proposed to marry me.

563
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,380
I thought,

564
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,430
Master He would surely return

565
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,030
for Xiaofeng's marriage.

566
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,200
So

567
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,370
I agreed.

568
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,790
Xiaofeng.

569
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:30,580
I'm sorry.

570
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,130
I used you.

571
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,500
So,

572
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,330
you were the one who mixed the

573
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,560
Rama Heavenly Ice among the wedding gifts?

574
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,490
I didn't want to expose my identity

575
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,750
and be noticed by Jiao Liqiao's people,

576
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,250
which would certainly result in trouble.

577
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,180
That's why I came up with this plan.

578
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,430
I planned to leave

579
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,540
the day before the wedding,

580
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:57,020
just after Master He had received the Rama Heavenly Ice.

581
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,060
Unexpectedly,

582
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,780
I saw someone

583
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:04,320
using a flying skill from the Jinyuan Alliance.

584
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,550
At that time, I knew that

585
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,460
Jiao Liqiao's people may not have recognized me,

586
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,190
but they'd followed me to Tianji Mountain Manor.

587
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,860
As expected, I saw

588
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,220
a man in black looking for something from room to room.

589
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,460
I thought a spy must have mixed into the manor

590
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,560
and compromised its safety.

591
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,220
So I had to take the Rama Heavenly Ice away first.

592
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,880
When you entered the bridal chamber last night,

593
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,520
you noticed someone had already sneaked in

594
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,550
and tampered with your wine.

595
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,180
You found that someone was stalking you.

596
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:44,800
So,

597
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,380
you killed the assassin.

598
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,020
That's right.

599
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,780
But Er Yue

600
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,330
was not the man in black I saw that day.

601
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:57,620
The enemy was in hiding,

602
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,000
while I was in the open.

603
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,260
I wanted to

604
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,730
resolve the crisis here.

605
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,530
So I played along.

606
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,870
It was an urgent matter.

607
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,590
I didn't have time to explain to everyone.

608
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,580
So I hid the body

609
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,680
to complete my plan.

610
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,620
What a fool.

611
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:19,980
What made you think

612
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,650
you can complete all the plans

613
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,790
and get out of here unharmed?

614
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:27,160
Since I planned to use myself as bait,

615
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,040
I'd never thought of leaving unscathed.

616
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:33,210
You don't have the Rama Heavenly Ice.

617
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:36,470
It was hidden somewhere else.

618
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,260
It's in Xiaofeng's sachet.

619
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,180
I've done

620
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,630
what Mr. Pi asked.

621
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,180
What about the skin with the tattoo?

622
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:58,950
Do you

623
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,680
have something to tell us?

624
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,940
The pattern on the skin

625
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,230
was embroidered on my back by my husband.

626
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,860
It recorded

627
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,780
the way to exterminate the Karmic Bug.

628
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,640
Unfortunately,

629
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,570
I don't know what it means.

630
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,630
I knew

631
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,400
my days were numbered.

632
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,660
So I embroidered the pattern

633
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,390
on Er Yue's back

634
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,840
and kept it in the room.

635
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,440
Remember.

636
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,490
The remains are buried in bliss.

637
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:45,220
Ascend towards Yujing.

638
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,370
Xiaofeng.

639
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:55,430
I hope

640
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,340
you won't blame me.

641
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,060
I, Liangyi,

642
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,900
did not let my savior down.

643
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,140
I did not

644
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,250
let my husband down either.

645
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,620
I...

646
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,510
Have no regrets.

647
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,100
No regrets...

648
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,610
She was a person of chivalry and loyalty.

649
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,020
Oh no.

650
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,380
An enemy is attacking.

651
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,580
We'll go check it out.

652
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:04,120
Do you think the likes of you can stop me?

653
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,590
After so many years,

654
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,440
the Tianji Mountain Manor is still so overconfident.

655
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,430
Who is speaking with such arrogance?

656
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,050
Shan Gudao.

657
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,000
It's you.

658
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,680
Master He.

659
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,200
Long time no see.

660
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:27,260
Who wants to see you?

661
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,380
The earlier you die, the better.

662
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,580
If it weren't for you,

663
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,780
my sister wouldn't have lost her life.

664
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,450
I can't die.

665
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,900
If I die,

666
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,510
how can I repay you

667
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,580
for raising my son?

668
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:41,210
Enough.

669
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,020
What do you want

670
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,140
today?

671
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,320
What?

672
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,360
After so many years,

673
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,050
is this how you were taught

674
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,060
to talk to your father?

675
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,980
Last time, you pretended to be righteous and convinced me to go with you.

676
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,640
Today, you came here with an army.

677
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,500
Since you are so stubborn,

678
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,240
I don't have to spare any consideration

679
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:04,210
for you anymore.

680
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,660
You don't have to get involved in the adults' matter.

681
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,370
Go in first.

682
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:14,880
No need.

683
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,490
I should face my own matters

684
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,940
myself.

685
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,110
Regardless of whom,

686
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,400
if he dares to harm the world and the martial world,

687
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:26,020
I will fight him

688
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:27,730
to the end.

689
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,550
My son

690
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:31,630
has spent too much time with you.

691
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,460
He's starting to sound like you back in the day.

692
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,640
Don't you think so,

693
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:38,880
Xiangyi?

694
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,910
Xiangyi?

695
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:49,680
It's him?

696
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,170
This...

697
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:51,310
Really?

698
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,700
Are you really Li Xiangyi?

699
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:55,340
I knew it.

700
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,160
Li Xiangyi wouldn't have died so easily.

701
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:57,960
This is great.

702
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:26,920
Senior.

703
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,679
Long time no see.

704
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,960
You're still so weak.

705
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,050
I guess

706
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,550
you're here for the Rama Heavenly Ice, right?

707
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,250
Junior.

708
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:45,120
I see you still like playing these cheap tricks.

709
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,650
Looks like you haven't improved much either.

710
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,770
But you are still my junior.

711
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:51,330
You know exactly

712
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,270
what I want.

713
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,340
Don't worry.

714
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,430
I won't give you the Rama Heavenly Ice.

715
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,190
That's not up to you.

716
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,070
Look at these Xianri Sedans

717
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,580
and the martial arts masters around me.

718
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:08,150
They're itching for a good fight.

719
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,170
Demon Monk!

720
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,350
[Demon Monk]

721
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,700
The Demon Monk,

722
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,960
the third-strongest martial artist on the ranking list.

723
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,780
Give me the Rama Heavenly Ice,

724
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,940
and I will spare your lives.

725
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,330
Senior,

726
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,350
did you forget about me?

727
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,910
Do you think you are still the same Li Xiangyi?

728
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,950
Your remaining strength is so meager,

729
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,220
it's not worth mentioning.

730
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:50,860
Really?

731
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,760
Then why do you need so many helpers?

732
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:57,660
You need their help to get the Rama Heavenly Ice today.

733
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,290
Oh, Shan Gudao.

734
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,110
You're still a weakling.

735
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,670
Fine.

736
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,410
I'll exchange 10 moves with you instead.

737
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,400
If you can defeat me,

738
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,390
I'll leave here with my men.

739
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,960
If you lose to me,

740
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,720
I'll not only take the Rama Heavenly Ice,

741
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:26,340
but also your life.

742
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,470
Deal.

743
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,000
Li Lianhua.

744
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,040
You can't go.

745
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,360
Come at me instead!

746
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,030
Don't worry.

747
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,540
He has never defeated me before.

748
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,420
Please be okay.

749
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,370
I remember Master and Madam

750
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,620
always wanted us to compete in the past.

751
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,760
It's been more than ten years.

752
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,840
I haven't witnessed your strength

753
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,350
in a long while, Senior.

754
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:03,410
Then,

755
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,380
I'll give you a good demonstration today.

756
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,040
Ten moves.

757
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,880
I could only hold on for ten moves.

758
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,410
I must win within ten moves.

759
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:54,750
Senior.

760
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,260
I won again.

761
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,410
Looks like you've changed.

762
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,420
After ten years,

763
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:35,490
you've improved a lot.

764
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,820
It's all thanks to Master

765
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:43,180
and his generous teaching before he died.

766
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:45,260
What did you say?

767
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,460
What?

768
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,200
You don't believe me?

769
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,340
My move just now

770
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:55,470
can only be executed by using

771
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,280
Master's unique inner power.

772
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,510
Are you surprised?

773
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,180
What did you do to Master?

774
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,620
I just told him

775
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,650
about your life and death situation

776
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:12,250
at the East Sea, against the Jinyuan Alliance.

777
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,740
Unfortunately, Master

778
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:17,220
was at a critical moment in his meditation training.

779
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,940
When he heard that his favorite disciple

780
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:21,820
was in trouble,

781
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,790
he became anxious

782
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,820
and lost control of his inner power.

783
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,640
It backfired on him and fatally injured him.

784
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,990
You're really despicable.

785
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,030
Master loved you so much.

786
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,070
After knowing you were in trouble,

787
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:40,940
he disregarded his injuries

788
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,940
and transferred all his powers to me

789
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,340
so that I could save you

790
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,560
in his stead.

791
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,450
But he

792
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,850
was spent and died a pathetic death.

793
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,210
Master fell for your lies

794
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,850
because he wanted to save me.

795
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:10,050
Why?

796
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,060
Master

797
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,570
saved our lives.

798
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,050
We're indebted to Master and Madam.

799
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:27,350
Why didn't you let Master go?

800
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,470
It's all because of you!

801
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,250
I...

802
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,040
Because of your arrogance

803
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:38,290
and self-righteousness back then!

804
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:58,800
Ten years!

805
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:02,690
Ten years later, you finally lost to me!

806
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:05,190
You still lost to me!

807
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,110
Master.

808
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,560
You're indeed indebted to Master.

809
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:18,770
But I'm not.

810
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:20,550
Master never had me

811
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,110
in his heart.

812
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,160
Even when he died, he was thinking about you.

813
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,840
Did he ever think about me?

814
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:28,940
He asked me to go to the East Sea to save you.

815
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,730
Did he ever consider my safety?

816
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:34,090
Once a teacher, forever a father.

817
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,280
I treated him as my family.

818
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,330
I practiced hard every day

819
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:41,470
just to beat you and prove myself to him.

820
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,930
But Master had only ever scolded me.

821
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,450
Did he ever consider my feelings?

822
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,770
Now, I have his entire life's worth of power.

823
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:01,290
It's what I deserved.

824
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,790
You're a traitor and a murderer.

825
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:10,800
I must avenge Master!

826
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:53,270
You...

827
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:57,690
Yangzhouman is truly amazing.

828
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,720
Even when poisoned by the Bicha Poison,

829
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,030
he managed to survive

830
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,880
for ten years thanks to it.

831
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:06,350
And you've mustered such strong inner power just now.

832
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,400
I underestimated you.

833
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,320
But so what?

834
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:11,510
Don't forget.

835
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,050
Only the Styx Flower can

836
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,740
cure the poison in your body.

837
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:15,810
Without it,

838
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,200
no one can save you.

839
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:19,040
Think about it.

840
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,060
How long can you live?

841
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,200
Didn't you tell me

842
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,890
your poison has been cured?

843
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:27,560
Stop nagging and dragging.

844
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,360
I'm losing interest in killing you.

845
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,160
Fang Duobing.

846
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,170
I’ll give you one last chance.

847
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:34,030
Give me the Rama Heavenly Ice.

848
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:35,680
Stop wasting my time.

849
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,550
Stop dreaming!

850
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:37,870
Fine.

851
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,600
Then don't blame me for being ruthless.

852
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:53,130
Charge!

853
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,050
His power has increased. Be careful.

854
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,190
Don't worry.

855
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:22,990
I won't die.

856
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,520
Be careful.
