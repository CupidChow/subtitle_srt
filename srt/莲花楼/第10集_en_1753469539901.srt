1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
There's not much time

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
But there's still a lot of longing

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Ask yourself thousands of times

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Thousands of times

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The most reluctant moment is that moment

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Live in the city

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
A thousand miles of wind and waves

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Who doesn't wander

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Who doesn't know

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The faraway land that is scattered

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Forgive

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Live in the world

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Youthful and wild

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The sword is not drunk like sorrow

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's go to the dream

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Live in the world

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
A thousand miles of wind and waves

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Who doesn't wander

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Who doesn't know

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The faraway land that is scattered

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Forgive

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Live in the world

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Youthful and wild

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The sword is not drunk like sorrow

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Let's go to the dream

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Live in the world

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This is Li Chenyi

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I always have a small question

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Why don't you always show your true face?

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Director Bai, it's actually like this

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I am a wandering doctor

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
No place to stay

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's my duty to save the wounded

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Besides, I saved a good person

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This bad guy wants to kill me

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I saved the bad guy

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This good guy is not very willing

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Now there are so many people at this sword award ceremony

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
There are also a lot of enemies

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's not too much to wear this mask

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Li Chenyi, but why do I always feel

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It seems to have seen you somewhere

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Have seen

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's right

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Did you see my brother?

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Your brother

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You really saw my brother

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Sorry, Director Yun

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That's right

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I do have a brother with a child

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
My mother's name is Li Lianpeng

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
One is called Li Lianhua

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Li Lianpeng

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Lianpeng is the brother

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I am a brother

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Just a brother

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We have been poor since childhood

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
My brother was born not long ago

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I was taken away by an old man

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Made him a chair

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Since then

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I have never seen him again

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But I also heard

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Brother Lianpeng is very powerful

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So in this world

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
There are people who look like me

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Li Lianpeng

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I never lie

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But Li Chenyi

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You have a poor family

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That lotus house

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The house structure is strange

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Beautiful and priceless

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Where did you come from?

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I saw the beach that year

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
A very bad ship came to the beach

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It floated on the sea without anyone asking

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I picked up these pieces of wood

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Pingcheng came to the lotus house

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You can go to the beach

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Ask fishermen

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I definitely didn't steal it

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Li Chenyi

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What are you talking about?

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
This is just a random question

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Pingcheng

87
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Pingcheng

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I was reckless just now

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I think Li Chenyi

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I haven't eaten anything since last night

91
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This is what I specially sent people

92
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Peanuts bought from the most Jianglou

93
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Li Chenyi, try it

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Thank you, Master Yunyuan

95
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Little brother, you and me

96
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'll wait for me to drink

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
If the peanut porridge is cold

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But it's a good intention to let me down

99
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Let's drink while it's hot

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Then I won't be polite

101
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Just smell it

102
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's good to see

103
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Why is there peanut in this soup?

104
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Why not?

105
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
There will be an allergic symptom when you eat this

106
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
This

107
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
This is allergic again

108
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Let's go

109
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Since you're hit by the toxic hand

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
There is no poison to embarrass you from now on

111
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Li Chenyi

112
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,000
You still need to rest

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Then we won't disturb you

114
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I ate a lot too

115
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Thank you

116
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Then I won't go

117
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
go

118
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,320
Li Lianhua is my enemy.

119
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,680
You're not clinging on?

120
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,920
Will you kill me or give me a recommitment

121
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,560
that I shouldn't have told Xiuying?

122
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,920
We met before.

123
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,160
I will absolutely kill you exactly

124
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,600
It's a shame.

125
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,000
It's a shame indeed.

126
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,760
Did this person have a reason to harm her?

127
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,840
That woman said

128
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,640
she didn't want Prime Minister Li to appear in the Eastern Sea.

129
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,080
She didn't allow Di Feisheng to die in the hands of others.

130
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,880
But the martial arts of the sect is unimaginable.

131
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,760
If I don't use the most severe poison,

132
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,880
how can I stop her?

133
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,800
I thought

134
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,040
I just need to stop her for a while.

135
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,800
I have the antidote in my hand anyway.

136
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,440
It's okay.

137
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,920
But it's not like that.

138
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,560
The antidote is fake.

139
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,200
All this

140
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,000
is because I'm stupid and ridiculous.

141
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,160
Even if I didn't mean to harm her,

142
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,040
I did do harm to her.

143
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,160
If you're the sect leader,

144
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,800
you must hate me.

145
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,360
If I were her,

146
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,880
I would hate you.

147
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,960
But think about it.

148
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,720
You said she was dead.

149
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,400
How could the dead

150
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,000
hate you?

151
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,600
Besides,

152
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,600
all the grudges have been gone.

153
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,880
It's become the past.

154
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,200
I think

155
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,480
you've forgotten it.

156
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,480
You really should forget it.

157
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,080
How is it?

158
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,880
If it's the past,

159
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,480
it's not like that at all.

160
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,160
It's really not her.

161
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,760
Mr. Li.

162
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,960
Miss Qiao.

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,760
Mr. Li asked me to check the whereabouts of the soul.

164
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,280
I found some clues.

165
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,880
When we let him go ten years ago,

166
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,000
he wrote a letter of thanksgiving.

167
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,000
It's from the Snow Jade Formation,

168
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,120
the Lotus Manor.

169
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,720
But it was ten years ago.

170
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,200
It's not easy to get some subtle clues

171
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,640
in the vast sea of people.

172
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,800
Thank you, Miss Qiao.

173
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,640
You're welcome.

174
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,800
Actually, I have

175
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,520
something else to tell you.

176
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,120
Go ahead, Miss Qiao.

177
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,280
The sachet from yesterday.

178
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,160
I'll forget it if you don't tell me.

179
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,720
Master Xiao took you away yesterday.

180
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,200
So I took it away.

181
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,600
This is what you have.

182
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,800
I should return it to you.

183
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,480
Miss Qiao.

184
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,760
I made this sachet

185
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,080
for him myself.

186
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,360
It's been ten years.

187
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,600
I've been waiting for this thought

188
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,960
for ten years.

189
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,440
I have long thought

190
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,040
even if it won't come back,

191
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,520
it will be the answer.

192
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,520
The truth is that

193
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,840
I was open-hearted

194
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,940
to find the same person

195
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,000
for a long time.

196
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,500
But,

197
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,120
If I really hear that he is related to the dead car,

198
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,760
I'd rather...

199
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,920
I'd rather...

200
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,640
Miss Qiang,

201
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,440
you don't have to be too sad

202
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,360
after you've killed him.

203
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,840
Mr. Li,

204
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:15,920
I...

205
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,360
I once had a moment

206
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,640
when I had some absurd thoughts.

207
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,440
It's just that I can't accept reality

208
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,880
and I'm just lying to myself.

209
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,640
Now,

210
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,080
I should wake up.

211
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,680
This is the p recently created.

212
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,640
Leave it.

213
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,760
The ten years of waiting

214
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,960
are no longer comfortable.

215
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,360
When I lacrim上 demais,

216
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,800
The waiting for him

217
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,600
has ended

218
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,600
Since she is an old friend

219
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,920
let her stay in the Gu family

220
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,440
Miss Qiao

221
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,920
you should go to the capital with peace of mind

222
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,920
Mr. Li

223
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,560
Thank you

224
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,480
Miss Qiao

225
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,440
Why is Miss Qiao here?

226
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,360
I remind you

227
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,760
Miss Qiao is a wise person

228
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,160
Don't be distracted

229
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,960
I heard from the young master of the courtyard

230
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,840
that all the members of the courtyard have been here

231
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,520
You didn't come just now

232
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,200
This chief

233
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,400
Do you know what he brought me?

234
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,520
Shao Shijian

235
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,720
Shao Shijian

236
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,680
You have known him

237
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,920
Of course

238
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,640
To be honest

239
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,240
I saved Miss Qiao in the underground

240
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,920
They thanked me for her

241
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,000
and let me see it

242
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,520
and let me touch it

243
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,760
Let me tell you

244
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,520
This sword is really heavy

245
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,840
It hurts my hand

246
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,360
I can't hold it for a while

247
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,520
You are so lucky

248
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,000
I didn't touch it

249
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,040
Look

250
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,520
It's the hand of the tree

251
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,400
You are so stupid

252
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,840
You are so unlucky

253
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,640
You have finished your medicine

254
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,000
I have told the monk

255
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,320
I will check your condition later

256
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,800
Thank you

257
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,480
Do you think

258
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,840
you still have much time

259
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,240
not worth tasting it?

260
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,080
I kept reminding you

261
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,720
it's only because you have

262
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,440
the round Yangzhou policing

263
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,920
that's why

264
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,440
you can use it

265
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,600
to boostulinear

266
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,080
but you didn't listen

267
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,720
You should know

268
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,880
blood stasis gum disease

269
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,080
affects brains

270
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,320
A smart man like you

271
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,360
doesn't know

272
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,960
Don't have the clod astringency

273
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,040
Alright

274
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,480
If you're so smart,

275
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,960
and suddenly become a lunatic,

276
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,160
I...

277
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,040
I'll be very uncomfortable.

278
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,040
You have to get used to it.

279
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,200
Old Monk, stop it.

280
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,560
If you keep talking like this,

281
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,600
I'll get a headache.

282
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,120
I can't hear you clearly.

283
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,360
Don't interrupt me.

284
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,960
If you keep being so impulsive,

285
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,680
you'll be in trouble for half a year.

286
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,600
Half a year is fine.

287
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,960
But the situation before

288
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,800
can't make me die in a sudden.

289
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,480
Can't I die in a sudden

290
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,760
or can't I get through this?

291
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,880
Old Monk,

292
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,200
don't talk nonsense.

293
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,800
Now, A Min is the only clue

294
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,520
I can find about Senior Brother.

295
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,000
I care about them.

296
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,880
People die and souls return to heaven.

297
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,120
Where is the body of the good master?

298
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,120
Why are you so persistent?

299
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,560
Why don't you come back?

300
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,800
You've seen Yun Bi Qiu.

301
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,200
I know you don't care

302
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,560
about the trick he used to be fooled by Jiao Li Qiao

303
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,040
and the poison he used to make you drink.

304
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,280
Poison?

305
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,560
I won!

306
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,600
Ten years ago,

307
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,280
Di Fei Sheng wanted to fight with you.

308
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,680
But he never thought

309
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,520
he would be the one

310
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,240
who got poisoned in the end.

311
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,640
Since you don't care

312
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,680
about him helping Di Fei Sheng to frame you,

313
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,000
why don't you come back?

314
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,400
You don't want to talk about it.

315
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,840
I'll talk about it for you.

316
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,480
You always think

317
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,040
you're doing this on your own

318
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,560
to promote the Golden Fist Alliance.

319
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,720
In the end, the 48 heroes of the Four Gu-Demons

320
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,960
died miserably.

321
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,560
The Four Gu-Demons are now divided into four.

322
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,120
You can't forgive others.

323
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,600
You can't forgive yourself.

324
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,320
Are you done?

325
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,360
Let me finish.

326
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,800
Old monk,

327
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,080
when did you become an old monk?

328
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,000
I just think

329
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,640
it's too tiring to be a Li Xiang Yi.

330
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,800
Isn't it good to be a Li Lian Hua?

331
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,040
I can drink tea with you.

332
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,080
Stop it.

333
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,240
At this hour,

334
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,720
you should give the little monk a lesson.

335
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,920
Why are you still sitting here?

336
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,800
Otherwise,

337
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,920
these little monks will go to heaven.

338
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,120
Go, go, go.

339
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,240
Go.

340
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,800
Li Xiang Yi.

341
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Li Xiang Yi.

342
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,920
What are you doing?

343
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,560
Ten years ago, you lost to me because you were poisoned.

344
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,560
Let me tell you.

345
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,160
You're a good climber.

346
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,560
It's not a good habit.

347
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,680
You didn't know anything kept this going.

348
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,040
You humiliated me.

349
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,040
loved and petered,

350
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,640
Your past is gone.

351
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:57,760
It's not important who is

352
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,480
back from the dead.

353
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,080
It's important.

354
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,880
It's important!

355
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,160
I thought you were a fierce opponent.

356
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,880
You made me a joke.

357
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,760
Lord Ding.

358
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,600
It's been so long.

359
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,720
You pretend you didn't hear it.

360
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,760
Do you believe me?

361
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:15,800
No.

362
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,920
I want to have another match with you.

363
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,720
I want to have another match with you.

364
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,200
I can't have another match with you.

365
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,440
You should know it.

366
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,480
You heard it even you heard the sound of the gun.

367
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,040
Now,

368
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,000
the poison has entered my bone marrow.

369
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,400
There's only one percent left.

370
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,080
How about

371
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,600
you see the new sword dance ranking?

372
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,040
Feng Tu Sansheng and Tie Ruo are pretty good.

373
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,200
You go to them.

374
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,080
In my life,

375
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,680
there's only one opponent.

376
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,520
It's Li Xiangyin.

377
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,200
There's only one wish in this life.

378
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,760
To win her.

379
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,880
I'm sorry.

380
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,160
I can't help you.

381
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,720
Now,

382
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,480
you're the best in the world.

383
00:17:59,480 --> 00:17:59,960
It's used.

384
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,120
Now,

385
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,880
I'll make you agree to this martial arts competition.

386
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,640
I, Di Feisheng, don't need you to Lean Doubts.

387
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,400
It is just an invalid poison.

388
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,960
I have to find a way to cure you.

389
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,080
I heard the lid tests

390
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,760
will make this poison.

391
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,880
No one can cure it.

392
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,800
Besides,

393
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,640
the god of sorcery can't cure me

394
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,320
after ten years of receiving

395
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,400
theend,

396
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,600
but they can't.

397
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,400
It doesn't mean I can't.

398
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,880
The law of nature is the final decision.

399
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,360
It's simple.

400
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,080
If you help me find my senior's remains,

401
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,560
I'll change it.

402
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,720
Otherwise, everything will be in vain.

403
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
Your senior

404
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,560
Shan Gu Dao's remains

405
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,920
have long been a piece of yellow soil.

406
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,640
Even if it becomes a piece of yellow soil,

407
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,560
as far as you and I are concerned,

408
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,560
as long as you have it,

409
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,320
I'll change it with you.

410
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,520
You don't have it,

411
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,240
neither do I.

412
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,720
You're really not afraid of death?

413
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,200
Ten years ago, I was already a dead man.

414
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,760
Then I killed Qiao An Nian.

415
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,920
He's strong and weak.

416
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,280
He's also more powerful.

417
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,760
Then I'll sweep the Banchuan Courtyard.

418
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,240
Sweeping the whole world

419
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,360
has nothing to do with me.

420
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,480
Let go of your claws.

421
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,080
You don't know that he's not in good health?

422
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,160
He doesn't even want to die.

423
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,080
What do you care?

424
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,360
Listen carefully.

425
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,040
I don't care what you two have.

426
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,720
A gentleman doesn't do anything.

427
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,280
If you keep doing this, I'll be rude to you.

428
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,480
I'm not going to let you go.

429
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
I'm not going to let you go.

430
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,240
I don't believe that you really don't care about anything.

431
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,880
Qiao Li Qing.

432
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,920
I say,

433
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,200
what's going on between you and Fei?

434
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,240
It's just a small misunderstanding.

435
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:49,960
Make up.

436
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,440
Continue making up.

437
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,200
I want to see what small misunderstanding

438
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,840
you have.

439
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,280
I almost killed you.

440
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,360
If you continue talking,

441
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,720
I'm going to be dizzy.

442
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,000
Enough.

443
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,520
I just want to remind you

444
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,080
that Fei may not have high martial arts

445
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,640
but he's very good at it.

446
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,960
You can't keep such a person by your side.

447
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,760
Maybe one day,

448
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,960
when I'm not by your side,

449
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,080
he'll really kill you.

450
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:17,840
Come on.

451
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,200
Pour me some water.

452
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,240
My hand is tired.

453
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,160
Think about it.

454
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,960
Fei is a weirdo.

455
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,920
But

456
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,600
he won't let me die.

457
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,840
You saw it just now.

458
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,080
He's crazy and crazy.

459
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,600
His brain is a little bit abnormal.

460
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,000
Besides,

461
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
you're still here.

462
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,680
By the way,

463
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,120
I asked you to check the necklace

464
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,400
at Baishan Music yesterday.

465
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,840
Did you find anything?

466
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,960
You don't tell me about your

467
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,480
everyday awkwardness.

468
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,000
You've made me do a lot of things.

469
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,080
This Cai Lian Zhuang

470
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,440
really has a death case.

471
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,880
A wedding dress killing.

472
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,800
In the past ten years,

473
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,600
Cai Lian Zhuang

474
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,800
has done three happy things.

475
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,280
Three brides died.

476
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,000
The strange thing is

477
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,800
that it's been several years since the middle.

478
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,000
But when the three brides died,

479
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
they all wore the same wedding dress.

480
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,600
It's said that

481
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,600
the origin of this wedding dress is unknown.

482
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,080
It's full of grudges.

483
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,640
Everyone who wears it

484
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,000
will be in trouble.

485
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,720
It's terrible.

486
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,920
In all these years,

487
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,200
we haven't found any clues

488
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,400
about the murderer in three cases.

489
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,040
There are still more than 100 cases.

490
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,440
Maybe

491
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,800
the wedding dress really caused trouble.

492
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,040
I just saw it.

493
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,440
I just saw the aunt.

494
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,840
The last time she was killed

495
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,440
was a few days ago.

496
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,960
The killer was the bride of

497
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,640
the young master of Cai Lian Zhuang.

498
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,240
I haven't asked you yet.

499
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,040
Why did you suddenly ask me

500
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,640
to investigate the case of Cai Lian Zhuang?

501
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,640
I'm looking for someone.

502
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,840
This person is famous for his soul.

503
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,040
As long as I find him,

504
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,040
I can find another

505
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,440
friend of mine.

506
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,440
And his last news

507
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,040
was Cai Lian Zhuang ten years ago.

508
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,440
Ten years ago?

509
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,240
Your friend

510
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,640
appeared in Cai Lian Zhuang ten years ago.

511
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,040
And the first case of Cai Lian Zhuang

512
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,440
was also ten years ago.

513
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,440
It's so coincidental.

514
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,440
Is there any connection?

515
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,640
You're right.

516
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,040
There is a great possibility

517
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,040
that three cases in a row.

518
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,440
Don't worry.

519
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,040
You still have to go to Cai Lian Zhuang.

520
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,840
Don't be so mean.

521
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,440
You just want to

522
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,440
get someone to help you.

523
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,840
I didn't have time to waste.

524
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,440
I finally have

525
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,840
a clue about the murderer.

526
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,840
I have to find him.

527
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,440
Okay.

528
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,040
But I found the body.

529
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,240
I'll help you ask

530
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,640
where the body is.

531
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,840
What do you mean?

532
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,840
Because this body

533
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,840
belongs to the Golden Moon Alliance.

534
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,840
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

535
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,840
So are you going or not?

536
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,240
No.

537
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:04,840
By the way,

538
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,520
I bought some

539
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,040
herbs for the body.

540
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,840
Take it to nourish your body.

541
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,040
Wait.

542
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,840
Mr. Fang,

543
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,840
you have no idea about this.

544
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,840
How can you afford to buy this?

545
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,440
Yours?

546
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,840
Mine?

547
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,440
Where did you find it?

548
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,840
Your drawer,

549
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,240
cabinet and bedhead.

550
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:31,840
By the way,

551
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,840
don't you like to hide

552
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,840
something under the rice cooker?

553
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,840
Don't you hide your wife's books

554
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,840
in these places?

555
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:41,840
You can do it.

556
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,440
You can do it.

557
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,240
How can you do it now?

558
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,840
You lost all your money.

559
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:48,840
What can I do?

560
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:49,840
Wait.

561
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,840
You just hide this little money?

562
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,440
What else?

563
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,240
I...

564
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,240
Smile.

565
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,640
Do you want to see it?

566
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,440
Sisters,

567
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,440
come on.

568
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,840
It's time to sell.

569
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,040
Fresh vegetables.

570
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,440
Come and have a look.

571
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,040
This is good.

572
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,640
This is good.

573
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,040
Yes.

574
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,040
It's fresh.

575
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,640
Listen to me.

576
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,040
This vegetable

577
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,240
was dug out from the ground.

578
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,240
It's very fresh.

579
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,040
Listen to me.

580
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,240
The most important thing is

581
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,240
to buy these vegetables.

582
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,840
This young man will deliver them to you.

583
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,240
Deliver them to me?

584
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:43,840
Really?

585
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,240
You...

586
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:44,840
Really?

587
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,440
That's great.

588
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,040
Give it to me.

589
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,840
Take your time.

590
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,840
Take your time.

591
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,440
Take your time.

592
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:49,840
Three pieces.

593
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:50,840
Great.

594
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,040
Take your time.

595
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,440
Mr. Li, why are you leaving?

596
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,840
This is the most important money.

597
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,440
Why do you want me alone?

598
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,440
Everyone has it.

599
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,240
Greetings, Master.

600
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,040
I want to know

601
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,240
how to detoxify the poison of Bicha.

602
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,440
Yes.

603
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,440
And

604
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,240
the young master of Tianqi Hall is sick.

605
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,440
It might be useful for me

606
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,440
to visit his grave.

607
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,040
Don't make a fuss about these things.

608
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,240
I'm not a man who can't be bothered by these things.

609
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,240
I'll do it right now.

610
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,240
Why are you here?

611
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,240
Who was that man?

612
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,640
Stop.

613
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,040
It's good that Li Lianhua is not here.

614
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,440
I have something to ask you.

615
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,840
Why did you hit him today?

616
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,640
Don't talk.

617
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,040
I know you're not Iron Man.

618
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,240
So I want to ask you.

619
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,640
What's your purpose

620
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,640
to get close to us?

621
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,440
What do you think

622
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,240
is worth getting close to me?

623
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,040
You...

624
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,440
You really came for Li Lianhua.

625
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,240
Or do you want to come for me?

626
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,640
Forget it.

627
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,440
I don't care about

628
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,440
a man with poor martial arts like you.

629
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,840
I'm not close to you.

630
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,640
I'll do whatever I say.

631
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,840
I'll make you fight me again.

632
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,640
The last whereabouts of the lost soul

633
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,840
will appear in the silk factory.

634
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,040
I'll go with you.

635
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,640
When you find the body of the Shanku knife,

636
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,440
don't forget your promise.

637
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,040
You're really a coward.

638
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,440
Li Lianhua.

639
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,640
I'll tell you a secret.

640
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,640
This Fei

641
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,040
secretly went to see someone yesterday.

642
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,640
I even went after him.

643
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,640
It's a pity that he ran away.

644
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,440
But what I'm sure of is

645
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,840
that he must have something to hide from us.

646
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,240
This Fei

647
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,840
has a very unusual background.

648
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,040
Don't worry.

649
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,640
I've known him for more than ten years.

650
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,840
I know him very well.

651
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,840
I'm sure he's a good man.

652
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,440
I'm sure he's a good man.

653
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,040
I'm sure he's a good man.

654
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,840
You've known him for more than ten years?

655
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,240
Isn't that a one-sided relationship?

656
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:18,840
Yes.

657
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,840
I don't know much about him,

658
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,840
but I know him well.

659
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,040
I'm looking at the sky.

660
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,240
It's going to rain soon.

661
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,440
Let's get up early.

662
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,040
Don't change the subject.

663
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,240
Tell me quickly.

664
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,040
This Fei

665
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,040
is not normal at first sight.

666
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,640
Right?

667
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,040
His temper is not very good.

668
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,640
This person

669
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,040
is a fool.

670
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,040
So his knowledge is very short.

671
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,840
You don't have to be interested.

672
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,240
But his only specialty

673
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,840
is his incredible kung fu.

674
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,240
So you'd better not bother him.

675
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,640
His incredible kung fu?

676
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,040
Can you be more careful

677
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,040
when you're talking nonsense?

678
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,640
Anyway, I've already said it.

679
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,840
You can't believe it or not.

680
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,640
Wait.

681
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,040
You've known him for more than ten years.

682
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,240
You know each other?

683
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,440
In fact, I know nothing about him.

684
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,040
That's not good.

685
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,240
After all, you all rely on me now.

686
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,440
I have to know my subordinates well.

687
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,640
In other words, I ask you now.

688
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,240
Where are you from?

689
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,440
What kind of people do you have?

690
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,840
What are your hobbies?

691
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,840
I've told you everything.

692
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,040
I have a brother named Li Lian Peng.

693
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,440
He's from Lotus Mountain, Lotus Town, and Lotus Village.

694
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,440
He ran away with his fiancee.

695
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,440
I don't have any ambitions.

696
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,240
My only hobby is

697
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,840
drinking tea, fishing,

698
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,440
and growing flowers.

699
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,440
You're a big head.

700
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,440
You're asking me.

701
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,840
You don't believe me.

702
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,840
Kids nowadays are troublesome.

703
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,960
Go.

704
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,240
What is happy?

705
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,560
It's just that you like Unun.

706
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,280
Everyone wants to have more fun at Lotus Village.

707
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,440
I know that now.

708
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,040
What's wrong with you?

709
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,240
Why are you jook?

710
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,240
Wait.

711
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,040
What's wrong with you?

712
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,440
So good!

713
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,840
Is it good?

714
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,640
You only speak when you're is villagers.

715
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,040
What else should I do?

716
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,240
Go to reflects feelings

717
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,760
I didn't steal it.

718
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:37,380
I didn't 8th Young Master Jingjian's

719
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,180
It's not important to make a fuss about it.

720
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,100
You've made progress.

721
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,740
The servants of Cailian Village

722
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,420
are very polite.

723
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,220
The rules of Cailian Village

724
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:06,220
are not to be misled by the order of the master.

725
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,420
The etiquette of the master is not to be misled by the order of the master.

726
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,380
My mother's surname is Jiang.

727
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,020
She is the housekeeper here.

728
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,780
If you have any questions,

729
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,460
just tell me.

730
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:16,780
Old man,

731
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,500
lotus has many colors.

732
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,260
I've never seen

733
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,300
any color of Cailian Village.

734
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,700
I don't know what kind of color it is.

735
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,460
To be honest,

736
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,100
our master loves lotus.

737
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,700
He carefully developed a set of secret secrets of growing lotus

738
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,900
to raise such precious Cailian.

739
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,220
The master named this lotus

740
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,580
as the Flowing Jade Pill.

741
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,340
I see.

742
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,900
Our Cailian Village

743
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,140
is also famous for its Flowing Jade Pill.

744
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,500
Therefore, the master

745
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,140
received a lot of respect from officials and nobles.

746
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,020
So, this lotus

747
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,220
is very precious to our Cailian Village.

748
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,260
I know my mistake.

749
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,300
Please spare my life.

750
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,500
Please spare my life.

751
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,620
I really know my mistake.

752
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,620
Please spare my life.

753
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,460
How many times have I told you?

754
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,100
Please spare my life.

755
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,380
Even if you are a noble,

756
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,260
you can't use such filthy waste

757
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,380
as the Flowing Jade Pill.

758
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,500
You are much more ruthless than me.

759
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,900
You should be punished severely.

760
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:12,980
Stop.

761
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,580
Who are you?

762
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,420
I'm a detective from Baichuan Courtyard.

763
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,340
The Cailian Village is famous for its far-reaching beauty.

764
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,220
I'm a maid.

765
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,340
I'm so good at it.

766
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,700
It's not good to be known.

767
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:24,900
Coming.

768
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,740
I wonder if you are some boys from Baichuan Courtyard.

769
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,020
arse.

770
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:41,540
Please.

771
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,220
Please.

772
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,940
Our master is so casual.

773
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,500
I don't know how you came by.

774
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,780
Master Gu.

775
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,700
I guess you are still

776
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,660
in the prime time?

777
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,300
Because she is the daughter of the head of the security escort,

778
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,140
she is a member of the Jianghu family.

779
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,140
So the Bai Chuan Garden has been checked before.

780
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,260
It was an accident. It has been solved.

781
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:05,620
If the file of the Bai Chuan Garden is correct,

782
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,180
it should be the third bride

783
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,420
of Cai Lian Zhuang in recent years.

784
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,940
This is all in the past.

785
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,140
In the past, the government office

786
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,860
also sent people to check it.

787
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,420
The accident was accidentally dropped.

788
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,180
I, Cai Lian Zhuang, never practice martial arts.

789
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,140
I am not from the Jianghu family.

790
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,740
These small matters of the people

791
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,780
don't need to bother you.

792
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,380
Then my little brother,

793
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,380
besides being a detective of the Bai Chuan Garden,

794
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,100
he is also the son of the prime minister,

795
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,500
the head of the security escort.

796
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,820
He has always been very interested in the case.

797
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,900
Fang Dongbin,

798
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,140
show your sword to the owner.

799
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,260
don't think you are the best.

800
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,260
Just show us his sword.

801
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:08,940
Son,

802
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,100
where is he?

803
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:22,540
Ten years ago, I married Xu Xian.

804
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,820
I didn't expect that on the night of the wedding,

805
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,700
my bride died of drowning.

806
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,700
Seven years ago, I married Xu Xian again.

807
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,740
But the same tragedy happened.

808
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:37,700
So I decided to not marry again.

809
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,820
I never thought that after so many years,

810
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:44,820
my whole child would also have the same tragedy.

811
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:50,540
Our Guo family really doesn't know what they've done.

812
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,100
I heard that these three brides

813
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,820
are all wearing the same wedding dress.

814
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:59,900
Uncle Jiang, you've been in Cailian Village for some time,

815
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,740
have you experienced this?

816
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,860
They are all wearing the same dress.

817
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,740
The 16 clans of the dragon sect

818
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,700
are all dying in the pond.

819
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,180
I saw it with my own eyes.

820
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,620
There must be something wrong with that wedding dress.

821
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,540
There must be something wrong with it.

822
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,020
Shut up!

823
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,220
Dad.

824
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:21,420
Everyone in the town loves to chew the snake's roots

825
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,020
and spread the goose.

826
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,620
So it's not convenient for the funeral to be held.

827
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,620
I think that you don't believe in the saying that wedding dress kills people.

828
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,820
It's just that after so many years,

829
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,220
why are these three brides

830
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,820
still wearing the same wedding dress?

831
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,420
My ancestors are from the Zhao clan.

832
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,220
My ancestors are from the Zhao clan.

833
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,620
These 16 clans of the wedding dress

834
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,020
are treasures passed down from our ancestors.

835
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,820
Every generation of our descendants must inherit them.

836
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:54,420
I'm not interested in how people died.

837
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:57,220
I just want to know where the corpse was.

838
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,420
Corpse?

839
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,420
What corpse?

840
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,020
There are six fingers on the right hand.

841
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,620
The body was burned and injured,

842
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,220
so it looks ugly.

843
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,220
If I say so,

844
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,220
do you have any impression?

845
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,220
I don't think so.

846
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,420
I've never seen anyone with six fingers.

847
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:20,420
Why are you asking this?

848
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,020
You really don't know?

849
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,420
You'd better think it through.

850
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,820
Go to bed early.

851
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,320
It's urgent!

852
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,820
I have a lot of important business to attend to.

853
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,420
Remember,

854
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,420
that incident

855
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,420
is going to happen

856
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,820
every other day.

857
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,420
So,

858
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,820
the larvae needs to grow exists without fear.

859
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,820
Why paintings?

860
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,820
And if we know who the real blooded man is,

861
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:07,620
then he is obviously a paintingIt couldn't work.

862
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,220
Yes.

863
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,020
People maneens,

864
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,740
Where are you going?

865
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,060
Uncle! Uncle!

866
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,020
Uncle!

867
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,140
Don't make a scene, Uncle!

868
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,540
Second Brother!

869
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,540
I told you to keep an eye on Uncle.

870
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,620
You still came here.

871
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,820
I have a guest.

872
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,020
I'm sorry, Father.

873
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,020
It's my fault.

874
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,420
I'll take the punishment later.

875
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,260
You want to keep an eye on Uncle.

876
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,620
Why did you let him come here

877
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,620
and take the guest?

878
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,260
I'm sorry.

879
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,260
This is Guo Kun, the emperor of the She.

880
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,860
He's been suffering from a strange disease since he was a child.

881
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,140
He's a little crazy.

882
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,140
This is Guo, the son of the whole family.

883
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,620
Please forgive me.

884
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,780
This is Guo, the son of the whole family.

885
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,060
He's been suffering from a strange disease since he was a child.

886
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,060
He's a little crazy.

887
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,420
I'm sorry.

888
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,780
This is Guo, the son of the whole family.

889
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,980
Guo, Guo, Guo, Guo!

890
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,020
He lost.

891
00:36:59,020 --> 00:36:59,740
Take him away.

892
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,660
Take him away.

893
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,140
Uncle.

894
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,500
You can't run away.

895
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,060
You can't run away.

896
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,500
When my brother was sick,

897
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,700
I was the only one who could stop him.

898
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,900
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

899
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,300
You're welcome.

900
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,260
I have a request.

901
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,340
I heard that the lotus is famous in Cailian Village.

902
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,580
Can we go to the village

903
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:23,260
to pick some lotus?

904
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,180
Okay.

905
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,660
Please go ahead.

906
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,940
Be careful, sir.

907
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,220
The owner has bought a lot of gold on his way back.

908
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,940
Don't touch it.

909
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:50,140
The owner of the village

910
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,180
suddenly came out.

911
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:55,020
And the young master who looks a little bit weak.

912
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,540
And the housekeeper who looks so mysterious.

913
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,500
Why do they all look strange?

914
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,020
These three women

915
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,740
married into Guo's family before and after.

916
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,580
They're not friends.

917
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:08,340
But they all died in this Cailian Village.

918
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,140
What a coincidence.

919
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,900
So this Cailian Village

920
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,220
must have some secrets.

921
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,300
I'm here to find the corpse.

922
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,540
I'm not here to investigate.

923
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,980
I don't want to hear your analysis.

924
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,820
Fei.

925
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,220
Why are you so anxious?

926
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,500
I didn't finish my words just now.

927
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,700
You're just busy interrupting.

928
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,940
He just wants to ask

929
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,380
some of the past of the corpse.

930
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,940
Wait.

931
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,860
What are you talking about?

932
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:29,540
What else is

933
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,260
the past that I don't know?

934
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,820
When you find the corpse,

935
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,700
you will know.

936
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,180
Let's go.

937
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,580
Please wait.

938
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,860
This is the best place.

939
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,380
Thank you.

940
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,340
This is a good place.

941
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,500
Such a big pond.

942
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,420
Maybe we can fish here.

943
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,180
It's no use being anxious now.

944
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,220
If the owner of the house is trying to hide something,

945
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,180
you will be confused.

946
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,580
You will be shocked.

947
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,980
Why don't you check

948
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,020
the case of Cailian Village

949
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,900
and find out what happened ten years ago?

950
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,580
Maybe

951
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,740
there will be new clues.

952
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:20,220
You still want me to help you with the investigation.

953
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,340
It's simple.

954
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,340
I'll go and get Guo Qian

955
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,020
to test him.

956
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:24,780
Fei.

957
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,660
Don't mess around, okay?

958
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,100
Fang Dongbian.

959
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:26,540
Don't chase me.

960
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,020
Just go.

961
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,300
He has no experience in investigating.

962
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,380
He is violent.

963
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,100
If the PD comes up

964
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:31,740
and does something to him,

965
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,140
then...

966
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:32,580
No.

967
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,300
Don't worry.

968
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,300
He's a man.

969
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,700
Li Lianhua.

970
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,460
I'm getting more and more curious.

971
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,500
Do you trust him that much?

972
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,500
What trust?

973
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,620
Oh.

974
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,340
The deceased

975
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,300
hasn't been buried yet.

976
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,180
Why don't you go to the cemetery

977
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,060
and burn incense for him?

978
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:49,500
Let's go.

979
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,700
You...

980
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,300
It's been seven days since he was arrested.

981
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,180
It's only been three days.

982
00:39:59,180 --> 00:39:59,780
Cailian Village

983
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,420
is not very sad

984
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,420
for the young lady who just died.

985
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,020
Look.

986
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:09,780
The belly is swollen.

987
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,940
There's water inside.

988
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,500
It looks like it's drowning.

989
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,740
The body is swollen.

990
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,340
The body is pale red.

991
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,740
It looks like it's soaked in water

992
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,780
after drowning.

993
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,700
It looks like the body

994
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,500
is slowly appearing.

995
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,300
There's a lot of blood on his neck.

996
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,500
Fei, what are you doing?

997
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,700
Young Master Guo.

998
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,500
The death of the late Madam

999
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,700
is still suspicious.

1000
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,740
We still want to check

1001
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,140
the justice of the deceased.

1002
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,340
The justice of the deceased

1003
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,380
has been checked.

1004
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,420
The deceased has been tested.

1005
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:43,140
Don't disturb the peace of the deceased anymore.

1006
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:43,940
Young Master Guo,

1007
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,260
to be honest,

1008
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,300
Madam Zun had a dream about me a few days ago.

1009
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,300
She cried and slept in the smoke area.

1010
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,420
She couldn't sleep.

1011
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,100
That's why we came to Cailian Village.

1012
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:51,900
A dream?

1013
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,700
This is the owner of Lotus Tower.

1014
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,580
He's called Li Shanyi.

1015
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,940
He has the ability to control spirits.

1016
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,460
His dream is very accurate.

1017
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,780
Even so,

1018
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,700
I should report to my father first

1019
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,460
and ask him to approve it.

1020
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,420
Young Master Guo is very afraid of you.

1021
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:11,060
It's a natural thing to obey your father's order.

1022
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,380
Young Master Guo,

1023
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,020
since the case has been opened,

1024
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,900
I'll ask you for forgiveness

1025
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,820
if I offend you later.

1026
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,340
If you really blame me,

1027
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,780
I'll take the responsibility.

1028
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,380
The body is not only skin-worn.

1029
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,260
His hand is broken.

1030
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:31,500
His neck is also badly injured.

1031
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,340
We've never fought with him.

1032
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,380
The people who came to the yard

1033
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,420
have checked it.

1034
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,620
They said that the bride was soaked

1035
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,820
and was struggling to get hurt.

1036
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,980
I don't think anyone has ever beaten her.

1037
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,420
But Young Master Guo,

1038
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,780
what happened before the bride died?

1039
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,340
Nothing special.

1040
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,660
After dinner,

1041
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,300
Su Su went back to her room alone

1042
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,500
and said she wanted to try on the wedding dress again.

1043
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,780
An Wen!

1044
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,060
After the bride went back to her room,

1045
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,900
did no one know what happened?

1046
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,340
I'm sorry.

1047
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,340
I'm sorry.

1048
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,340
I'm sorry.

1049
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,340
I'm sorry.

1050
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,340
I'm sorry.

1051
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,340
I'm sorry.

1052
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,340
I'm sorry.

1053
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,340
I'm sorry.

1054
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,340
I'm sorry.

1055
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,340
I'm sorry.

1056
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,340
I'm sorry.

1057
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,340
I'm sorry.

1058
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,340
I'm sorry.

1059
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,340
I'm sorry.

1060
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,340
I'm sorry.

1061
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,340
I'm sorry.

1062
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,340
I'm sorry.

1063
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,340
I'm sorry.

1064
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,340
I'm sorry.

1065
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,340
I'm sorry.

1066
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,340
I'm sorry.

1067
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,340
I'm sorry.

1068
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,340
I'm sorry.

1069
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,340
I'm sorry.

1070
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,340
I'm sorry.

1071
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,340
I'm sorry.

1072
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,340
I'm sorry.

1073
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,340
I'm sorry.

1074
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,340
I'm sorry.

1075
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,340
I'm sorry.

1076
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,340
I'm sorry.

1077
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,340
I'm sorry.

1078
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,340
I'm sorry.

1079
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,340
I'm sorry.

1080
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,340
I'm sorry.

1081
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,340
I'm sorry.

1082
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,340
I'm sorry.

1083
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,340
I'm sorry.

1084
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,340
I'm sorry.

1085
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,340
I'm sorry.

1086
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,340
I'm sorry.

1087
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,340
I'm sorry.

1088
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,340
I'm sorry.

1089
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,340
I'm sorry.

1090
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:18,340
I'm sorry.

1091
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,340
I'm sorry.

1092
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,340
I'm sorry.

1093
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,340
I'm sorry.

1094
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,340
I'm sorry.

1095
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,340
I'm sorry.

1096
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,340
I'm sorry.

1097
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,340
I'm sorry.

1098
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:26,340
I'm sorry.

1099
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,340
I'm sorry.

1100
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,340
I'm sorry.

1101
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,340
I'm sorry.

1102
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,340
I'm sorry.

1103
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:31,340
I'm sorry.

1104
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,340
I'm sorry.

1105
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,340
I'm sorry.

1106
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:34,340
I'm sorry.

1107
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,340
I'm sorry.

1108
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,340
I'm sorry.

1109
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:37,340
I'm sorry.

1110
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,340
I'm sorry.

1111
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:39,340
I'm sorry.

1112
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:40,340
I'm sorry.

1113
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,340
I'm sorry.

1114
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:42,340
I'm sorry.

1115
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:43,340
I'm sorry.

1116
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,340
I'm sorry.

1117
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:45,340
I'm sorry.

1118
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,340
I'm sorry.

1119
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,340
I'm sorry.

1120
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,340
I'm sorry.

1121
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:49,340
I'm sorry.

1122
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,340
I'm sorry.

1123
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,340
I'm sorry.

1124
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,340
I'm sorry.

1125
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,340
I'm sorry.

1126
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,340
I'm sorry.

1127
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,340
I'm sorry.

1128
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,340
I'm sorry.

1129
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,340
I'm sorry.

1130
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,340
I'm sorry.

1131
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:59,340
I'm sorry.

1132
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:00,340
I'm sorry.
