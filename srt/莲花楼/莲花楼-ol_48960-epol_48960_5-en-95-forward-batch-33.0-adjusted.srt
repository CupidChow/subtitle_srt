[Episode 5]

4
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,539
You know that if we examine Young Miss Qiushuang's body,

5
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:14,180
and ask the guards presented at the scene,

6
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,060
we would definitely spot the flaws.

7
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,860
So, you burned the body at night.

8
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:19,280
But you never expected

9
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,539
that Madam Yu would come back early

10
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:24,110
to retrieve the body that hadn’t been completely burned.

11
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,310
What a pity, Madam Yu.

12
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,900
You were burning with anger,

13
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,560
and you killed all the guards.

14
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,180
So that they will never have a chance to speak.

15
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,610
You didn't care about the guards' lives, and that's

16
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,320
what made you fell into the murderer's trap.

17
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,789
You're so shrewd and deep.

18
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:00,950
Miss Yun,

19
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,260
you're still infatuated with Master Yu.

20
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,900
But he was going to kill you tonight.

21
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,780
Such a person

22
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,990
doesn’t deserve your defence.

23
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,180
At Xiaomian Inn,

24
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,560
that Soul-snatching Needle

25
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,250
was also stopped by the jade gifted by

26
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,510
Young Miss Qiushuang.

27
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,550
She's been protecting you.

28
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,460
You should give her justice.

29
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,470
Yes.

30
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,880
I was wrong.

31
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,820
It’s my fault.

32
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,680
He wanted the Soul-snatching Needle

33
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,490
to find out the secret inside back then.

34
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,020
So I secretly gave it to him.

35
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,960
I never thought that...

36
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,220
Yu Mulan.

37
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,500
You should

38
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,820
admit all the things you did.

39
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,410
You're not good at martial arts. Be careful.

40
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,840
It's Air-slashing Smack.

41
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,470
I want to avenge Qiushuang.

42
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,440
Fang Duobing.

43
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:16,970
Stop her!

44
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,600
What are you doing?

45
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,950
If Madam Yu wants to avenge your sister,

46
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,460
I'm afraid you need to wait in line.

47
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,390
What do you mean?

48
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,720
Madam Yu, don't forget

49
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,170
that Young Miss Qiushuang was severely injured before she died.

50
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,700
We've been wondering how the wound is caused.

51
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,020
Our question is solved

52
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,550
when I saw Young Master Zongzheng's move just now.

53
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,900
Young Master Zongzheng.

54
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,920
This skill can shatter

55
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,340
one's internal organs without hurting the skin.

56
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,470
It must be Air-slashing Smack, right?

57
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,680
I've been curious about it too.

58
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,860
Yu Mulan has the Soul-snatching Needle

59
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,270
that can kill Yu Qiushuang on the spot.

60
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,640
So what's the need to give her a smack?

61
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,100
Now that I think about it,

62
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,730
all my doubts are cleared.

63
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,800
She was killed twice

64
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,850
because the two moves came from two different people.

65
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,100
Young Master Zongzheng,

66
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,850
you hit that Air-slashing Smack, right?

67
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,540
I can do that.

68
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,409
But why would I kill her?

69
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:34,530
Why?

70
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,370
Because you have an affair with Madam Yu,

71
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,240
and Young Miss Qiushuang ran into it.

72
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,420
You are scented with

73
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,780
the osmanthus fragrance in Madam Yu's bedroom.

74
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,020
Meanwhile, Master Yu who has been sleeping in the guest room for years

75
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,080
has no scent on him.

76
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,980
In the moment of heat,

77
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,070
Madam Yu has been very protective of you just now.

78
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,570
All these years,

79
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,670
you never slept with me

80
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,480
or looked at me.

81
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:12,790
It turns out...

82
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,040
I'm not pure,

83
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,950
but you're no better.

84
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,000
Shut up!

85
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,370
It's you.

86
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,330
Did you really kill Qiushuang?

87
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,140
I...

88
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,990
I hit her,

89
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,020
but I didn't mean it.

90
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,720
I met Hongzhu outside that day

91
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,060
because I wanted to cut ties with her.

92
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,280
But Hongzhu was so angry,

93
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,540
I couldn't just leave.

94
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,420
So I chased her to her bedroom to comfort her.

95
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,340
Hongzhu's temperament is fiery, like fire.

96
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,140
I had been persuading her for a long time

97
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,470
to calm down so that she could listen to me.

98
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,540
But then I suddenly heard a noise outside the window.

99
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,400
We can't let anyone know about us.

100
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,960
So I hit outside the window in a panic.

101
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,170
Later when I looked out the window,

102
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,300
I didn't see anyone.

103
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,020
I didn't know it was Qiushuang.

104
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,970
So it was you who killed your sister.

105
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:30,940
It's Karma.

106
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,780
We were all part of it.

107
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,400
She shouldn't have died.

108
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,130
It was us.

109
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,870
It was we who killed her.

110
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,670
I didn't dare to save her.

111
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,929
And I didnn't dare to admit it.

112
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,500
I've been

113
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,140
playing innocent with you and shirking

114
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:14,870
my responsibilities, saying that it was the ghost that killed her.

115
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,730
It's me!

116
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,720
It's me.

117
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,210
After Qiushuang was hit,

118
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,650
she had nowhere to go in Yucheng.

119
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,260
She could only come to me,

120
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,360
her best friend.

121
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,420
Qiushuang.

122
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,800
But she saw me meeting Yu Mulan in private.

123
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,860
Don't get me wrong.

124
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,100
It's not what you think.

125
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,300
She was badly injured.

126
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,780
How desperate must she have been at that time?

127
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,270
But Yu Mulan,

128
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,330
you're worried that it might be exposed.

129
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,710
So you killed her again.

130
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,390
In order to survive,

131
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,060
I could only play dumb even though I know

132
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,780
that you wanted to kill me.

133
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,400
Try it.

134
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,390
Thank you.

135
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,100
It'll keep you safe.

136
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,680
I didn't deserve to be her friend.

137
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,470
I didn't deserve to be her best friend.

138
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,180
I didn't deserve it.

139
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:33,920
Poor thing.

140
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,880
None of the people she loved loved her.

141
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,430
And none of them wanted to leave her alive.

142
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,640
It's my fault.

143
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,950
I shouldn't have...

144
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:19,940
You told me there was no one outside.

145
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,000
It was my illusion.

146
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,820
Why didn't you tell me

147
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,350
that she had been killed by your Air-slashing Smack?

148
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,150
Calm down.

149
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:34,790
She had been following us from the back of the mountain.

150
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,350
What else could I do?

151
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,820
We talked a lot that day.

152
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,700
There's something that can be told.

153
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,160
and something that can't.

154
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,310
Otherwise,

155
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,780
did you want her to spread the words?

156
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:52,390
I did this for you.

157
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,520
Shut up, Zongzheng Mingzhu.

158
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,860
You've done all these

159
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,700
cold-hearted, treacherous things.

160
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,580
You don't have

161
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,210
to pretend to be soulful now.

162
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,280
Young Master Fang.

163
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,240
Mr. Li.

164
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,350
Thank you for your concern.

165
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,410
Guards!

166
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,990
Lock Yu Mulan and Yun Jiao in prison.

167
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:10,710
Yes.

168
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,510
Prepare the carriage.

169
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,690
Send Young Master Fang, Mr. Li

170
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,840
and everyone in the inn out of town.

171
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,300
Wait.

172

Madam Yu, I don't think you should send us off like this.

173
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,180
Why did you put them in prison?

174
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,070
What about Zongzheng Mingzhu?

175
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,800
What do you plan to do with him?

176
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,500
This is my family matter.

177
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,420
I’ll take care of it.

178
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,610
This is a criminal case.

179
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:44,700
According to the law,

180
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,140
the case should be processed by Baichuan Academy.

181
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,370
He works in the court,

182
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,490
so he should be judged by the Public Prosecutor's Office.

183
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,620
Besides, Madam Yu killed the innocent

184
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,640

185
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,660
You are also guilty.

186
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,640
What's wrong with killing my own guards?

187
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,420
This is the rewarding record of the guards of Yucheng.

188
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,950
These guards have been rewarded repeatedly.

189

the private guards who have been rewarded three times

191
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,360
shall not be judged as house slaves.

192
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,680
Of course you are guilty

193
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,000
and should be punished.

194
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,460
Besides, you have to compensate the families of these guards.

195
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,640
Do you want to seek justice

196
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,350
for these guards?

197
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,930
They didn't deserve to die.

198

00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,390
Where is my senior, Shan Gudao's body?

343
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:47,780
Di Feisheng.

344
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,450
Di Feisheng.

345
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,940
How do you know his name?

346
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,530
Do you know him?

347
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:06,730
I was in daze just now.

348
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,270
I think I heard someone calling his name.

349
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:14,030
Be careful.

350
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,840
Do you know that the guy we ran into

351
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,540
just now is Di Feisheng, the final boss of the Jinyuan Alliance?

352
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,350
You,

353
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,060
you are really lucky.

354
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,760
The forest was full of miasma.

355
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,990
How did you get in?

356
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,080
I went to find my dog.

357
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:32,520
And suddenly, it exploded.

358
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,510
Luckily you were there.

359
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,960
Who would have thought that

360
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,220
the final boss had been hiding in such a remote place.

361
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,810
I heard that inside the cave,

362
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,430
there are all kinds of drugs that increase internal power.

363
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,770
During the battle at the East Sea,

364
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,300
he must have been severely injured back then.

365
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,760
That's why he practiced in seclusion there.

366
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:49,820
It's a pity

367
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,430
that I didn't see his face clearly.

368
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:53,800
If he's not dead,

369
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,750
there will be a storm coming in the wide world.

370
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:01,320
Since Di Feisheng is not dead,

371
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,200
Li Xiangyi must be alive, right?

372
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,300
He must be alive, right?

373
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,630
Are you out of your mind?

374
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,200
I knew

375
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,550
he must be alive.

376
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,940
He will come back for sure.

377
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,870
He's delayed by something for now.

378
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:14,670
And,

379
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:15,990
by the way,

380
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:17,780
I misunderstood you

381
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:20,340
about what happened last time.

382
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,480
So,

383
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,880
my suspicion of being the Drug Demon is cleared?

384
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,860
I was eager to catch the thief.

385
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:28,780
I'm sorry.

386
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:30,790
How do you want me to apologize to you?

387
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:31,870
Just tell me.

388
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,350
Nothing.

389
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,230
I'm just hungry.

390
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,250
That's it?

391
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,000
Fine.

392
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:37,900
I'll prepare it for you.

393
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,560
Wait for me.

394
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,130
Di Feisheng.

395
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,670
Since you are still alive,

396
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,440
I need to

397
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,260
ask you something and make it clear.

398
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,400
I was not able to catch up.

399
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,860
But it must be Di Feisheng.

400
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,270
The one beside him is Jiao Liqiao.

401
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,200
I can't be wrong.

402
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,320
I've investigated Yu Hongzhu.

403
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,490
She was one of the 12 Phoenixes of the Jinyuan Alliance.

404
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,100
When the Jinyuan Alliance was destroyed, she escaped

405
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,500
and returned to Yucheng.

406
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,050
If that's the case,

407
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:13,370
all these years, Jiao Liqiao has been secretly manipulating the remnants

408
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:15,900
of the Jinyuan Alliance to create chaos everywhere.

409
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,300
Di Feisheng must be the one behind all this.

410
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,860
Yu Hongzhu bit her tongue off and kept silent.

411
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,110
Zongzheng Mingzhu was arrested by the Public Prosecutor's Office.

412
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:25,380
It'll be hard to interrogate him since he's in the court.

413
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,580
We have no idea where Di Feisheng is now.

414
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,450
If Di Feisheng is still alive,

415
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,220
then our Head...

416
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,620
Xiangyi is different from Di Feisheng.

417
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,500
If he is still alive,

418
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,960
why wouldn't he come back?

419
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,820
Meaningless speculations hurt the most.

420
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,750
Don't mention it again.

421
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:07,370
Wanwan.

422
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,070
Zijin.

423
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,270
We should go back.

424
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,630
Okay, let's go.

425
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,680
You're daydreaming in broad daylight.

426
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,050
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

427
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:47,260
How dare you covet the No.1 beauty in martial arts, Qiao Wanwan?

428
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,650
You have to ask for permission from Xiao Zijin's Alkaid first.

429
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:51,850
Stop guessing,

430
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,240
and don't make jokes.

431
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:55,560
I'm just curious.

432
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,060
They've never been to Baichuan Academy.

433
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,270
Why are they here?

434
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,010
After all, they're old friends with Sigu Sect.

435
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,870
Since they're here and have heard

436
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,860
about the reappearance of the final boss, Di Feisheng,

437
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,160
of course they would show concern.

438
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,960
Fang Xiaobao!

439
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,840
She's already here?

440
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,930
Li'er must have exposed herself.

441
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:14,930
Brother, help me block it.

442
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,530
I'll give you the food later.

443
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,220
It's strange.

444
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,550
I heard his voice just now.

445
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,630
Who are you?

446
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,060
I'm Li Lianhua.

447
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,470
Li Lianhua?

448
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,300
[He Xiaofeng of Tianji Manor]

449
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:33,630
So you're the rumored owner of Lotus House?

450
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,150
You are the doctor who can miraculously

451
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,750
bring the dying back to life?

452
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,780
Doctor, I feel dizzy.

453
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,290
I feel dizzy.

454
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,640
Take a look for me.

455
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,100
Miss.

456
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,110
Doctor Li,

457
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,540
although you aren't as handsome as I thought,

458
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,300
but your chic temperament

459
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,650
gets my heart beating faster.

460
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:53,930
I've always admired

461
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,020
someone with extraordinary talent.

462
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,650
But you haven't treated me yet.

463
00:28:59,370 --> 00:28:59,900
Miss,

464
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,430
you look rosy,

465
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,880
and your voice is loud like a bell.

466
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,770
You're fine.

467
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,630
That's good.

468
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,350
Maybe I ran after

469
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,690
my nephew too fast,

470
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,570
so I felt dizzy.

471
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,120
Doctor Li, have you seen him?

472
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:15,900
Oh, I forgot to introduce myself.

473
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,440
I am

474
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,620
He Xiaofeng, the younger sister of He Xiaohui,

475
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,020
the owner of Tianji Hall.

476
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,460
My nephew

477
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,810
is Fang Duobing.

478
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,840
His nickname is Xiaobao.

479
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,800
He's only a few years younger than me.

480
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,860
He's very naughty.

481
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,290
How dared he reject the marriage granted by His Majesty

482
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:28,470
and run away from home?

483
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,560
I'm so worried about him as his auntie.

484
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,910
I see.

485
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,160
Miss He,

486
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,220
Mr. Fang said goodbye to me just now.

487
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,930
He said he’s going to the North to broaden his horizons.

488
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:38,570
Miss He,

489
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,160
it's not too late for you to chase him now.

490
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:47,880
Doctor,

491
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,070
this is my special Phoenix Smoke.

492
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,080
If you want to see me,

493
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,220
you can burn this smoke and I'll find you.

494
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,500
See you, Doctor Li.

495
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:09,120
[Long Live the Foreworld]

496
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,590
Welcome back, Head.

497
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:47,780
Welcome back, Head!

498
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,180
[Long Live the Foreworld]

499
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:51,580
Welcome back, Head.

500
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:54,700
Get up.

501
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,320
This is a new place.

502
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,080
My Lord.

503
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,450
Ten years ago, with you in charge,

504
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,110
the Jinyuan Alliance dominated the world of martial arts.

505
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,440
and made everyone obey.

506
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,820
But since you retreated,

507
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:18,230
those so-called righteous rogues took the chance to attack,

508
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:20,970
so we had to give up the old headquarters.

509
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,640
Fortunately, the wise Saintess

510
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,590
led us to find this treasured land.

511
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,900
We rebuilt the headquarters.

512
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,100
And we've been waiting for your return.

513
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,690
I dare not take credit.

514
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,090
We worked hard in the past 10 years,

515
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,020
only to prepare for the return of my Lord

516
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,080
to take over Jinyuan Alliance again.

517
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,580
And I finally got what I wanted today.

518
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,310
It's such a great honor.

519
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,740
I, Ding Yun, the Wind and Thunder Emissary,

520
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,500
present the map of the Jinyuan Alliance's new headquarters.

521
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,210
I, Wan Renshan, the Star and Moon Emissary,

522
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:52,000
present the name list of the Jinyuan Alliance.

523
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,530
Please have a look, my Lord.

524
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,440
So it was you two.

525
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,480
My Lord,

526
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:15,480
I don’t know what they did wrong

527
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:16,810
and offended you.

528
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,740
In the battle of the Eastern Sea ten years ago,

529
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,660
we used thundering fire bombs to trap the Sigu Sect.

530
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,940
Do you know about this?

531
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,130
Of course I know.

532
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,430
Those thundering fire bombs not only blew up the Sigu Sect.

533
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,790
but also the arsenal of our headquarters.

534
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:36,580
Countless casualties.

535
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,580
They were in charge of our firearms.

536
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:42,080
Should we kill them or not?

537
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,330
Of course, we should.

538
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,610
I was negligent,

539
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,120
and I let them live for ten more years.

540
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,120
I've been in seclusion for ten years.

541
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,190
I keep thinking about the past.

542
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,550
Something is fishy.

543
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,960
I hate betrayal the most.

544
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,660
If I find out who betrayed me,

545
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,520
you will end up

546
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,820
like these two corpses here.

547
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,650
Good kill, my Lord.

548
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,770
If anyone is unfaithful to you,

549
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,170
I will not forgive him.

550
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,500
Today is the big day of your return.

551
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,380
take them as a celebration for you.

552
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,620
My Lord,

553
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,930
This is the decree of Jinyuan Alliance.

554
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,380
I've been protecting it with my life all these years.

555
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,710
It has always been safe.

556
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,980
I'm returning it to you today.

557
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,260
Congratulations my Lord on retrieving the decree.

558
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:08,110
Jinyuan Alliance will dominate the wide world soon.

559
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,270
My Lord,

560
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:16,440
I have something to report.

561
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,600
Yu Hongzhu let down her guard

562
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,740
when you retreated to Yucheng.

563
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,870
If not because of Saintess,

564
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,070
you would've been interrupted.

565
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,820
Yu Hongzhu has been arrested by Baichuan Academy.

566
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,910
Please give the order

567
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,460
to get rid of Yu Hongzhu immediately,

568
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:35,740
so that there won't be any trouble.

569
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,540
I also have something to report.

570
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,230
[Jinyuan Alliance, Granny Blood]

571
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,780
You need to tell the world about your return, Lord.

572
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,820
First, let justice be frightened.

573
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:45,350
Second, let the former subordinates return.

574
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:46,710
Boring.

575
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:47,690
My Lord,

576
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:51,230
I also sent someone to get a new Book of 10,000.

577
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,800
All the latest rankings are on it.

578
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,400
Please have a look.

579
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,210
I have another good news.

580
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:02,170
Go ahead.

581
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,330
I've found the whereabouts of the elixir that you've been

582
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:09,139
searching for since 10 years ago, which can help improve your

583
00:35:09,139 --> 00:35:10,409
martial arts skills.

584
00:35:15,429 --> 00:35:16,000
Here.

585
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,020
Well done.

586
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:23,650
Well done.

587
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,300
This is what I should do.

588
00:35:28,219 --> 00:35:30,420
What else can I do for you?

589
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:38,400
You've been running the Jinyuan Alliance well for the past 10 years.

590
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,210
From now on,

591
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,570
the affairs of the alliance will be handled by Saintess.

592
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,880
Thank you, my Lord.

593
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,550
With you here,

594
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,080
I can rest assured.

595
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,030
I will help you to be the top in the world of martial arts,

596
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,960
and rule the world.

597
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:41,280
My Lord,

598
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,580
I've been waiting for you for 10 years.

599
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,070
All my efforts are not in vain.

600
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:11,710
Lord.

601
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,300
You were there just now.

602
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:14,850
Why do you only show up now?

603
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,350
I dare not disturb you

604
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,270
on the Enthronement Ceremony.

605
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,570
Stop talking nonsense.

606
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,050
You and the three kings already know

607
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:25,110
what I have truly cared about for 30 years.

608
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,380
My Lord only cares about being the peak of martial arts.

609
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,040
You have no care about others.

610
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,530
You are my personal guard.

611
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,060
Together with King Bai of Fire,

612
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,200
Four-faced Qingzun and King Xunming of Yama,

613
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,220
you all are just below me in the alliance.

614
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,820
Where are they now?

615
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:43,850
Find it out for me.

616
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,670
The four of you risked your lives with me

617
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,360
to build the Jinyuan Alliance.

618
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,220
No matter what,

619
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,780
they can't be locked in prison.

620
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,430
Yes, Lord.

621
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,030
You killed Wan Renshan and Ding Yun

622
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,490
with bursts of air.

623
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,280
In my opinion, you have now regained

624
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:03,720
60% of your power from 10 years ago.

625
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:05,920
Only 60%?

626
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,590
It seems that he really

627
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,250
left me a lot of trouble.

628
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,000
He is the only person

629
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,930
that can have my Lord keep him in mind.

630
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:20,010
We fought on the sea 10 years ago.

631
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:21,470
I won by half a move,

632
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,310
but he died.

633
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,060
I have no rival in the world anymore.

634
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,910
There are many new masters on the Book of 10,000

635
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,170
given by the Saintess.

636
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,420
The first one is Buddhist San Sheng from East Japan.

637
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,640
The second one is Yang Yunchun with the Royal Dragon.

638
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,030
And the third one is the Demon Monk of Blood Realm.

639
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:41,160
The three of them must be quite strong.

640
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,680
If you want to have fun,

641
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,910
I can search for their whereabouts.

642
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,480
After Li Xiangyi,

643
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,550
I have no rival in the world.

644
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,870
The map of Guanyin's Tears?

645
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:05,990
That's right.

646
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,790
Congratulations, Lord.

647
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:08,720
Guanyin's Tears

648
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:10,300
are the elixirs made by the Bodhisattva Herbal Lord

649
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,850
with his lifelong effort back in 100 years ago.

650
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,190
It only had three back then.

651
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,870
The first one was seized by the swordsman to save

652
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:16,920
his eldest son, whose heartbeat has stopped for 3 days.

653
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,600
The second one was taken by Qiu Wuya

654
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,450
and his power was drastically increased.

655
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:21,090
He had been the head in the martial arts world for over 10 years.

656
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,150
Now, with this map,

657
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:23,810
we can find the third one.

658
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:25,250
If you get this elixir,

659
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,210
it's no doubt that you will regain your power.

660
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:27,740
And maybe

661
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:30,330
we can even break through the seventh level of the Windy Poplar

662
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:33,330
and reach the eighth level, where no one has ever been.

663
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,770
Of course, I need to get Guanyin's Tear.

664
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:38,170
Unfortunately,

665
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,430
I've lost all my power.

666
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,660
Who can I fight with?

667
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,050
Granny Blood,

668
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,500
keep an eye on the Lord.

669
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,320
By then,

670
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,770
he'll be eager to find the elixir.

671
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:53,130
Yes.

672
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,320
My Lord.

673
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:08,140
From now on, you'll be the only one by Qiao's side.

674
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,780
And you can only

675
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:14,500
have me by your side, too.

676
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,500
When we parted back then,

677
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,600
I told you that it's hard to be solved.

678
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,850
And you only have ten years left.

679
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:25,760
Now,

680
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,250
it's only one year left.

681
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,430
Have you settled it now?

682
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:32,700
Why don't you go back to meet your old friends in the Sigu Sect,

683
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,100
and find the way together to save yourself?

684
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:36,900
A monk doesn't lie.

685
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,480
Almsgiver Li, you're still young,

686
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,870
don't let the King of Hell take advantage of you.

687
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:42,600
Di Feisheng.

688
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,510
Where are you?

689
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,690
Look at you.

690
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,730
You disappeared in a blink of an eye

691
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:53,290
when I was hiding from my auntie.

692
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:54,380
Luckily, I'm smart.

693
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,180
I know you would sneak back here.

694
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,650
What were you burning just now?

695
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:02,710
It doesn't matter.

696
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:04,920
It's not important.

697
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,700
Did something happen to you?

698
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,960
Tell me if anything happens.

699
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,960
This young master will protect you.

700
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,320
You ran away from home to escape the marriage.

701
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,580
Your source of finance is cut off, and you braved the elements.

702
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,310
And you're in dire straits now.

703
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:19,120
They even brought back

704
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,240
the servant around you, right?

705
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,700
You have nowhere to go.

706
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,370
Are you

707
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,070
going to stay here forever?

708
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:27,580
I...

709
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,050
You can't say that.

710
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,550
We should help each other.

711
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,480
We went through thick and thin together.

712
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,410
We are brothers for life.

713
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:39,520
We all need friends

714
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,070
to survive in the wide world.

715
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,680
I'm not into the wide world and I don't make friends either.

716
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,080
You...

717
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,380
You look

718
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,180
easy-going and nice to talk to

719
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,040
on the outside,

720
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:50,440
as if you have no temper.

721
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,450
But, in fact, you're so cold

722
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,400
and you're not close to anyone.

723
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,440
This is not good.

724
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,540
You're always alone.

725
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,750
You don't even have friends to eat and drink with.

726
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,750
This is so boring.

727
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:06,230
Who says it's for you?

728
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:11,570
The hawthorn tastes good today.

729
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:15,470
Not bad.

730
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,290
Try drying the hawthorn next time,

731
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:20,350
then boiling it with sugar and dried tangerine peel.

732
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:21,350
It must be better.

733
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:23,300
You have a good taste.

734
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:24,320
Of course.

735
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,380
My reputation as the capital's food critic

736
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,910
does not come from nothing.

737
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:28,580
How is it?

738
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:29,730
Do you

739
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,530
need someone like me at Lotus House?

740
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:32,900
A handsome partner

741
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,550
that can eat and fight.

742
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:36,870
Isn't it great to explore the wide world together?

743
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:37,440
Stop.

744
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,160
I made it clear

745
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,920
about solving cases together.

746
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,330
I don't understand.

747
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:44,990
Do you really want to get into Baichuan Academy?

748
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:46,340
Of course.

749
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,280
The Sigu Sect is gone.

750
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,900
My master is missing too.

751
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,960
But I can't forget my promise to him.

752
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,380
Furthermore, the final boss, Di Feisheng,

753
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,190
is still alive.

754
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:56,450
I have to teach him a lesson for my master.

755
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,100
We can't always

756
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,650
live up to the expectations of others.

757
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:05,190
Maybe Li Xiangyi

758
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,540
has never expected so much from you.

759
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,980
You know what, you are a nice person,

760
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,510
but you always rain on my parade.

761
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:12,630
I told you a lot of things.

762
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,080
And I treat you as a friend from the bottom of my heart.

763
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:14,480
You...

764
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,070
How could you...

765
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,500
Tranquilizing incense.

766
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:30,410
Sleep well.

767
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:36,230
Li Xiangyi doesn't remember anything,

768
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:37,680
and he won't go back.

769
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:40,830
Don't be too serious.

770
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:42,680
Silly boy.

771
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:04,120
Where's the carriage?

772
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,670
Li Lianhua.

773
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,650
You left me at the roadside again!
