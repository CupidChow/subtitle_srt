[Episode 16]

4
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,229
To cover up his Tree Man Syndrome,

5
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,229
he hid in the Yuanbao Villa for so many years.

6
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,539
How could he do this to himself?

7
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,009
The sarcoma kept growing,

8
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,180
and he kept scraping it away.

9
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,950
I can't believe that he endured the pain

10
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,370
but still failed.

11
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:10,990
What's going on?

12
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,470
The Tree Man Syndrome is actually a hereditary disease

13
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,400
in the Jin family in Yuanbao Villa.

14
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,540
My dead wife

15
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,470
is the half-sister of Jin Mantang.

16
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,580
That's why she knows about this.

17
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,350
Since Dong Ling and Jin Changbao

18
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,410
also suffer from such a rare disease,

19
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,740
that means they are also members of the Jin family.

20
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,030
Are you telling the truth?

21
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,070
The former master of Yuanbao Villa

22
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,820
did die of Tree Man Syndrome.

23
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,120
You can ask the elderly servants in the villa,

24
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,050
and you'll know if it's true.

25
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,300
Jin Changbao must have stolen the opal skull.

26
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,490
After using it,

27
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,380
he found out it didn't work on his Tree Man Syndrome.

28
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,780
That's why he went crazy.

29
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,100
How would he know?

30
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,370
Besides using the opal skull,

31
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,380
Jin Mantang also used

32
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,120
human blood,

33
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,910
which was nourished with herbs for a long period of time.

34
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,540
The opal skull was taken by Jin Changbao.

35
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,860
So it was Butler Jin

36
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,060
who set this up

37
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,000
to cure his own illness.

38
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,100
Eventually, the opal skull

39
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,080
couldn't cure his Tree Man Syndrome,

40
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,280
so he got so desperate

41
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,910
that he committed suicide.

42
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,300
I don't think so.

43
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,420
Commander,

44
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,970
we didn't succeed in finding the opal skull.

45
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,700
It makes sense that you didn't.

46
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,700
Li, what do you mean?

47
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,250
Yang,

48
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,250
you may ask someone to go to Jin Mantang's room

49
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,200
and check

50
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,750
if any daily necessities are missing.

51
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:44,980
Yes.

52
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,540
Commander.

53
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,240
Deputy Commander.

54
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,470
There are plenty of things left.

55
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,600
But according to my memory,

56
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,860
there's a flower pot with such a size missing.

57
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,740
Flower pot?

58
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,140
I see.

59
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,400
But I searched

60
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,770
the flower pot before.

61
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,270
There was nothing hidden inside.

62
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,270
If there had been nothing in the pot,

63
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,040
that would have meant that the opal skull

64
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,880
was the flower pot itself.

65
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,490
What?

66
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,710
This pot is much larger than the box.

67
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,170
How could it fit in?

68
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,589
Who told you that the box

69
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,220
was used to hold the opal skull?

70
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,550
And who among us

71
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,610
has seen the opal skull before?

72
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,290
Since no one has seen it,

73
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,130
how do you know

74
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,070
what the box that holds it looks like?

75
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,700
Since Jin Mantang used a sham

76
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,700
to lure Dong Ling into the secret room,

77
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,640
that meant

78
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,860
he had hidden

79
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,380
the genuine opal skull well.

80
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,220
When we first entered the secret room,

81
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,020
Butler Jin deliberately gave us

82
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,159
the wrong guidance.

83
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,070
He opened the empty box

84
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,250
and told us the opal skull was missing.

85
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,050
Opal skull?

86
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,070
The opal skull is missing!

87
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,510
After that, everyone went around the villa,

88
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,860
looking for a skull that would fit in this box.

89
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,370
But the genuine opal skull

90
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,340
is this flower pot itself.

91
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,140
I'm afraid we can't find the flower pot

92
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,700
in such a short time.

93
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,210
What do you mean?

94
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,520
Let's talk about Jin Changbao first.

95
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,720
Jin Changbao indeed set Jin Mantang up.

96
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,550
But he didn't have the guts to kill him.

97
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,220
Otherwise,

98
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,640
he wouldn't have been in Yuanbao Villa for so many years

99
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,790
but only waited until now to take action.

100
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,520
It's because

101
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,360
he didn't commit suicide.

102
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,020
If he had hanged himself,

103
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,830
the traces of the rope would only have reached behind his right and left ears

104
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,890
in a dark purple colour.

105
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,450
And there would have been a white mark

106
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,710
among the rope traces.

107
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,820
His fists should've been held into fists before he died.

108
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,950
Why were his hands stretched out then?

109
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,520
On this crossbeam,

110
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,560
there are only traces of one rope.

111
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,380
If a person's committing suicide,

112
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,380
they will struggle because of pain.

113
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,950
And there will be many scratches on the beam,

114
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,250
apart from a clear hanging mark.

115
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,290
So Jin Changbao's dead body was moved

116
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,740
to make it look like he hanged himself.

117
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,520
Mr. Gongyang, I wonder if you know

118
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,820
the toxicity of withered agave.

119
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:56,960
Well...

120
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,640
A minor injury caused by the poisoned arrow

121
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,659
would've been insufficient to cause a person with profound inner power

122
00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:04,010
to pass out and completely lose consciousness.

123
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,070
Mr. Gongyang, as a famous physician,

124
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,110
are you hiding it on purpose,

125
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,090
or do you have other intentions?

126
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,410
What do you mean?

127
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,430
Are you trying to slander me?

128
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,600
Do you still want to deny it?

129
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,270
In town,

130
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,500
the largest pharmacy is Jishi Hall.

131
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,930
Jin Changbao would fill the prescription of medicine for Jin Mantang.

132
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,330
But in the past two years,

133
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,740
he had been buying two portions every time.

134
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,140
It means he became ill in the last two years.

135
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,310
He was worried that Jin Mantang would find out his identity.

136
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:37,920
So,

137
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,340
he resolved to scrape away his skin

138
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,120
to hide the truth.

139
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:48,720
But he was still tortured by illness,

140
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,220
and he wanted to solve this problem completely.

141
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,280
Don't get me wrong.

142
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:52,980
I...

143
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,040
At this moment,

144
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,240
Dong Ling came to ask Jin Mantang for the opal skull.

145
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,840
He discovered that Jin Mantang

146
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,530
had locked Dong Ling in the secret room

147
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,330
and tried to starve him to death.

148
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,320
Hurry up.

149
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,870
Don't play tricks on me.

150
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,970
I said I'll give it to you.

151
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,760
What else do you want?

152
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,110
Where's the opal skull?

153
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,580
I put it there.

154
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,770
Right there.

155
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,070
Trying to escape?

156
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,990
Jin Mantang, let me out!

157
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,100
Jin Mantang!

158
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,270
At this time,

159
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,340
someone taught him a trick to kill someone by making use of another person.

160
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,320
As planned, Jin Changbao had indeed

161
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,940
gotten rid of Jin Mantang and Dong Ling successfully

162
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,990
and took the opal skull

163
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,850
that Jin Mantang hid in his own room

164
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,970
without anyone knowing.

165
00:08:44,409 --> 00:08:45,650
If I'm right,

166
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,669
you are the person, aren't you?

167
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,419
Gongyang Wumen.

168
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,320
Li Lianhua.

169
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,490
Mr. Gongyang is highly moral and respectable.

170
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,900
Don't slander him.

171
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,390
I'm so sure

172
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,030
because of three pieces of evidence.

173
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,360
This

174
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,030
is the latest prescription of Jin Mantang.

175
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,460
I got it from the pharmacy he went to.

176
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,400
This prescription is not different from

177
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,900
the previous prescriptions of Jin Mantang.

178
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,790
It's just that Ezhu was added.

179
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,510
Ezhu can promote blood circulation,

180
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,920
so it will accelerate the relapse of Tree Man Syndrome.

181
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,710
In this way,

182
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,080
Jin Mantang was forced

183
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,760
to use the opal skull more frequently

184
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,690
so that Jin Changbao could have more opportunities.

185
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,440
The time this prescription was modified

186
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,800
was exactly 17 days ago

187
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,230
when Dong Ling went to see Jin Mantang

188
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,180
and was locked in the room by him.

189
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,510
Also, it was the day when Mr. Gongyang

190
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,060
came to the town.

191
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,860
Nonsense.

192
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,070
How would you know

193
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,650
when I came to this town?

194
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:52,820
It's a piece of cake.

195
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,440
For me,

196
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,540
all I had to do was to check the entry records of out-of-towners

197
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,700
in my father's name

198
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,870
at the government office.

199
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,320
We'd know right after investigating it.

200
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,580
How are you going to defend yourself now?

201
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,940
There is also this unexpected discovery.

202
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,160
The blackmail letters written to Jin Mantang

203
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,310
have the same handwriting

204
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,570
as this prescription.

205
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,060
Mr. Gongyang,

206
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,820
did you not expect

207
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,530
someone would investigate this prescription,

208
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,660
so you forgot about your handwriting?

209
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,420
I see.

210
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,170
You colluded with Jin Changbao

211
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,330
and deliberately pretended that

212
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,240
someone was trying to kill Jin Mantang

213
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,500
and stole his treasure

214
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,120
so he would recruit famous physicians

215
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,290
to save his life,

216
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,380
and that would allow you

217
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,400
to officially enter Yuanbao Villa.

218
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,780
So what?

219
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,120
As a physician,

220
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,320
I was curious about the martial arts world's

221
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,430
legendary opal skull that can cure all illnesses.

222
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,060
So I played a small trick

223
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,250
to enter this villa.

224
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:00,040
How can you say that I killed Jin Changbao?

225
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,320
He didn't say

226
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,750
that you killed someone.

227
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:03,350
He...

228
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,690
I didn't expect you to be so stubborn.

229
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:07,920
Mr. Gongyang,

230
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:11,460
looks like I can only bring out the second piece of evidence.

231
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:12,740
Sir.

232
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:13,910
I'm sorry.

233
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,670
Jin Changbao promised to work with you,

234
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,370
but he didn't completely trust you.

235
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,440
I guess

236
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,240
he asked you to treat him

237
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,040
after he got the opal skull.

238
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,460
That's why

239
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,120
he made a deal using the opal skull.

240
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,310
Mr. Gongyang was also struggling because of that.

241
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,010
That day,

242
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,670
you followed Miss Zhiyu.

243
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,690
But unexpectedly,

244
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,420
you did find out

245
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,440
the secret of her collecting blood.

246
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,770
So, Gongyang Wumen

247
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,540
gave Zhiyu's blood to Jin Changbao in exchange,

248
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,030
then took the opportunity to steal the opal skull

249
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,420
before killing him to dispose of a witness.

250
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,420
Unfortunately,

251
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,550
you didn't take Miss Zhiyu's blood.

252
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,510
So you used your blood to deceive Jin Changbao.

253
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,580
Poor Jin Changbao.

254
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,220
He thought he would get better

255
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,460
after he got the opal skull

256
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,730
and Miss Zhiyu's blood.

257
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,130
But it didn't work at all.

258
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,180
That's why he went crazy.

259
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,870
Then you seized the chance

260
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,030
to kill him.

261
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,360
That is all bullshit!

262
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,610
It's just a scar.

263
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,380
But you made up so many stories.

264
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,280
Fine.

265
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,070
I did prepare the third piece of evidence.

266
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:22,530
Hold on.

267
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,290
You said Gongyang Wumen has killed Jin Changbao.

268
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,950
We searched all over his body,

269
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,530
but no fatal injury was found.

270
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,940
He was not poisoned too.

271
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,880
If he didn't hang himself,

272
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,560
how did he die?

273
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,950
It's said that Gongyang Wumen

274
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,280
has 68 magical needles.

275
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,260
His acupuncture can always achieve a miraculous cure.

276
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,390
There are 57 needles

277
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,740
in this needle bag.

278
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,820
Ten needles are on Jin Changbao's head.

279
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,010
There's one more left.

280
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,760
Right here.

281
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,200
You're the murderer,

282
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,470

Deputy Commander.

286
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,270
I found this in Gongyang Wumen's bag.

287
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,980
In Gongyang Wumen's room,

288
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,220
I found the same flower pot as in Jin Mantang's room.

289
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,950
It was indeed the opal skull after being cleaned.

290
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,870
Is this the opal skull?

291
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:09,370
You may leave.

292
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:09,850
Yes.

293
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,390
Since the murderer has been caught

294
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,250
and the opal skull has been found,

295
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,980
I'll take the witness and evidence

296

This issue is related to the martial arts world.

303
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,460
Baichuan Court should take care of it.

It's not Supervision Bureau's turn to meddle in our business.

305

I insist on handling this matter.

So what if it's Baichuan Court?

307

As the deputy commander of the Supervision Bureau,

I order you to withdraw from Yuanbao Villa immediately.

00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,310
Here.

342
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,500
Can you see it?

343
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,760
Don't get involved

344
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,910
in Baichuan Court's business.

345
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,340
I can't defeat you today.

346
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,910
But don't be arrogant.

347
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,460
Wansheng Clan is rapidly emerging in the martial arts world,

348
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,980
and they have a good relationship with the government.

349
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,180
Sooner or later, they will replace Baichuan Court.

350
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,710
You won't be happy for long.

351
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,490
Wansheng Clan.

352
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:29,710
Miss Shi.

353
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,760
Sorry for the trouble.

354
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,560
I'm now giving the treasure box and Gongyang Wumen

355
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,890
back to Baichuan Court.

356
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,260
Master Shi.

357
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,240
Lord Yang.

358
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,100
My son is suffering from Tree Man Syndrome.

359
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,360
Only the opal skull can cure his illness.

360
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,260
Please,

361
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,340
for the sake of my years of treatment,

362
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,660
lend me the opal skull

363
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,020
to save my son.

364
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:53,970
Mr. Jian,

365
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,040
I heard that the opal skull has to be complemented with

366
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,530
drinking human blood long-term to treat Tree Man Syndrome.

367
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,780
It's not a good prescription.

368
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,640
Are you really going to do this?

369
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,320
Please get up.

370
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,750
I remember in the palace,

371
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,570
an old imperial physician mentioned

372
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:09,920
he had been studying Tree Man Syndrome for half his life

373
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,130
and had some experience.

374
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,380
Although he can't cure the disease,

375
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,310
he can slow its progression

376
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,810
so your son's life won't be in danger.

377
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,270
I can introduce him to you.

378
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,270
I can't repay

379
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,339
your great kindness.

380
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:19,650
Please accept my bow.

381
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,420
No need. You don't have to do so.

382
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,470
[Yuanbao Villa]

383
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,020
The Gang Qi has indeed been removed.

384
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,250
I feel refreshed now.

385
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,810
You've cleared the Gang Qi.

386
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,060
But you don't have to thank me.

387
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,920
Let me tell you.

388
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,610
I felt a Genuine Qi helping me just now.

389
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,140
The feeling was so strange.

390
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:23,190
It must be because of the opal skull.

391
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,390
What a good thing.

392
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,590
The supreme Yin of this opal skull

393
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,190
is really powerful.

394
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,150
You're kind of a treasure,

395
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,370
but so many people died because of you.

396
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,290
I don't know if you're saving them or harming them.

397
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,620
We'd better put it away.

398
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,770
What is this?

399
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,050
This is not an ordinary thing.

400
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,090
I can't believe Jin Mantang put it

401
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,820
together with the opal skull.

402
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,750
It looks like Nanyin Script.

403
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,150
It seems to be similar to scripts

404
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,390
that appeared in Yipin Tomb before.

405
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,070
I don't remember that.

406
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,710
Before Nanyin perished,

407
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,230
they were indeed close to the Central Plains.

408
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,770
They also strengthened the bond with marriage.

409
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:21,830
Jin Mantang loved to

410
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,230
collect rare treasures.

411
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,270
Maybe he really collected

412
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,400
the treasures which came from Nanyin.

413
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,240
Forget it.

414
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,890
I don't care what treasure it is.

415
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,560
It's not that I can make a living on it.

416
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,290
Give it back.

417
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,240
I'll put it back.

418
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,090
Be careful.

419
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,410
Here.

420
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,670
The moon is beautiful tonight.

421
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,690
What are you going to do next?

422
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,990
The two sentences you said don't seem to have any relation.

423
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:57,790
Cut the crap!

424
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,120
I studied at the Imperial Academy.

425
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,420
I am good at literacy.

426
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,620
I just want to ask you.

427
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,660
Now that I've gotten rid of the Gang Qi,

428
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,190
and got my detective badge,

429
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,010
how about

430
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,270
you travel the world with me?

431
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,690
That doesn't sound good.

432
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:11,370
Why?

433
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,950
My martial arts and your brain

434
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,460
will surely make us significant figures in the world.

435
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,180
Then?

436
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:16,990
Then,

437
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,860
we'll become heroes whom everyone admires

438
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,600
and bring justice to this world.

439
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
Isn't that great?

440
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,500
And then what?

441
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,020
After that,

442
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,710
we will retire after the great achievements

443
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,840
and become a legend.

444
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,480
This is the most glorious ending of a hero.

445
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,760
What else?

446
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,120
And

447
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,410
we can have some sunbathing

448
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,340
and fishing.

449
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,100
It must be very carefree.

450
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,800
Am I not

451
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,150
living like this now?

452
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,700
Why should I wait until the future?

453
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,780
It's different.

454
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,960
You should at least go to the peak of the martial arts world,

455
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,000
to the top of it, to have a look.

456
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,370
I've been there before.

457
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:06,910
It's boring.

458
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,900
You're just talking nonsense.

459
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,580
The highest place you've ever been

460
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,730
is the two-storey building of Lingshan Sect.

461
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:15,210
Tell me.

462
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,800
Where do you want to go?

463
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,930
I can accompany you.

464
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,880
Where do I want to go?

465
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,950
Where?

466
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,760
I want to go to the toilet.

467
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,640
You don't have to follow me.

468
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,320
Take it.

469
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,230
Hurry up.

470
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,200
Be careful.

471
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,740
You're so bad at martial arts.

472
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,400
I'll teach you some other day.

473
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,880
Where did my two taels of silver go?

474
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,590
Zongzheng Mingzhu.

475
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,700
Leave the thing behind.

476
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,280
Let's see what you're capable of.

477
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,630
It's quite cold up here.

478
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,510
Why isn't he back yet?

479
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,570
Did he run away again?

480
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,580
Who are you?

481
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,400
Who is the young hero dressed in white?

482
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:49,590
Oh no.

483
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,450
Where is Li Lianhua?

484
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,390
Wake up.

485
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,220
Why am I here?

486
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,470
I came to the wrong room.

487
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,180
What do you mean by you came to the wrong room?

488
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:21,980
Are you drunk?

489
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,880
You can't drink much, huh?

490
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,430
Why did you take this back?

491
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:29,470
Let me tell you.

492
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,440
Zongzheng Mingzhu appeared just now

493
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,420
and wanted to steal it.

494
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,210
Luckily, a young hero dressed in white

495
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:34,920
saved it.

496
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,430
W-What in white?

497
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,350
That young hero dressed in white just now

498
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,680
is definitely a master.

499
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,730
He could even use a branch as a sword

500
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,230
and defeated Zongzheng Mingzhu with one move only.

501
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,430
You don't know

502
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,550
the speed of his attack with the sword

503
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,280
was too fast to be seen clearly.

504
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:49,640
The sword he was holding

505
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,070
was so agile, like a snake.

506
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:51,950
But when the sword aura appeared,

507
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,480
it was extremely powerful.

508
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,840
Except for my master, Li Xiangyi,

509
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,040
I've never seen such an amazing person.

510
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,990

No wonder.

So it turns out that Zongzheng Mingzhu

518
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,760
didn't want the opal skull

What is the ice plank for?

00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,670
Is it worth his effort?

My grandpa told me

542
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,960
this is a bad habit of ancient Nanyin.

543
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,700
They'd choose the most intelligent white ape

and nurture it until it reaches adulthood.

545
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,890
Then they'd peel the skin of the white ape alive to make drums

546
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,690
and used its bone as a bone stick.

547
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:23,770
They said

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,970
a drum made like this

Was the ancient Nanyin that cruel?

this incense can numb the pain after being lit

00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,990
I can't let this brat

681
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,650
risk his life with me anymore.

682
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,610
What's more,

683
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,580
I used my sword skills yesterday.

684
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,640
If this continues,

685
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,320
he'll find out who I am sooner or later.

686
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,440
Li Lianhua.

687
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,650
Have you thought about

688
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:05,890
what I told you last night?

689
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:06,890
I can go anywhere.

690
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,340
I'm talking to you.

691
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,180
What are you thinking about?

692
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:16,090
I'm calculating how long a smoke signal

693
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,620
will take in general

694
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:20,070
to reach Tianji Mountain Manor.

695
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,190
What smoke signal?

696
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,140
The smoke signal from your aunt.

697
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,490
Li Lianhua.

698
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,020
It's fine to make the same joke thrice.

699
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,220
But do you really think I won't be angry?

700
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,870
I'm used to being alone.

701
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,040
I don't like to get too close to people.

702
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,490
Lotus Tower is not spacious too.

703
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,820
It can only fit me.

704
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,040
It's troublesome having one more person stay here.

705
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,700
And I told you earlier ago that

706
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:48,820
I'm not interested

707
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,220
in investigating cases.

708
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,150
If it weren't for Shan Gudao,

709
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,090
and I didn't owe him a favour,

710
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,200
I wouldn't have helped you.

711
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:58,410
Now that your Gang Qi has been removed,

712
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:00,140
we should go our separate ways.

713
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:02,390
You're not interested in investigating cases?

714
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,350
Then why did you ask Su Xiaoyong

715
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,410
to investigate the ice plank for you?

716
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:09,480
Hold on.

717
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,070
Do you think it's dangerous

718
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,860
so you don't want me to get involved?

719
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,790
Young Hero Fang,

720
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,110
people rely on themselves in the martial arts world,

721
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:20,310
instead of hiding behind me every time.

722
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:21,270
As you said,

723
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,560
I helped you to solve

724
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,690
all the problems along the way.

725
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,320
If you don't want to be a useless rich man,

726
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,100
you have to learn to walk independently.

727
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,090
Fine.

728
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:35,170
I can't believe that your impression of me is like that.

729
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,170
People who walk different paths cannot make plans together.

730
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,170
We are different.

731
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,449
Well said. People who walk different paths cannot make plans together.

732
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:55,580
I, Fang Duobing, make friends at will.

733
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,690
I never thought of being your burden.

734
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:58,420
In that case,

735
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,590
as a useless rich young master,

736
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,510
I won't pester you anymore.

737
00:35:04,659 --> 00:35:05,210
Bye.

738
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:11,310
I'll call myself a fool if I talk to you again.

739
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:39,240
Who is the rich young master he reprimanded?

740
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,820
Who can't walk independently?

741
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,750
I'm walking now.

742
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:43,830
Who cares?

743
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:46,980
Fang Xiaobao.

744
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,340
Aunt.

745
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:51,660
Hello.

746
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:53,610
Aunt.

747
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,320
Where are you going?

748
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,890
Why did you tie me here?

749
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:58,320
Aunt.

750
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,530
Li Lianhua.

751
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,740
When we meet again,

752
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:06,420
I'll call myself a fool if I talk to you.

753
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,050
Mr. Li.

754
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,510
Thank you for helping me

755
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,370
catch this naughty young master.

756
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,490
May I invite you

757
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,370
to Tianji Mountain Manor together with us

758
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:19,290
so that I can treat you to a feast

759
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,780
to express my gratitude?

760
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,180
You're welcome, Miss He.

761
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,880
We're close enough.

762
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,810
Don't be so courteous.

763
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,070
Just call me Xiaofeng.

764
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,090
Miss Xiaofeng.

765
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,910
Actually, I have a question.

766
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,410
I wonder if I can ask it.

767
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,990
I'll tell you everything I know.

768
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:38,180
Is the Deputy Leader of the Sigu Sect, Shan Gudao,

769
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,540
Fang Duobing's biological father?

770
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,520
How do you know?

771
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,140
Why are you saying this?

772
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,110
Are you joking with me?

773
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,860
What you said is really interesting.

774
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:54,820
Miss He,

775
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,710
I got something that came into my mind.

776
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,310
I won't bother you then.

777
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:01,470
By the way,

778
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,510
you're of no fixed abode.

779
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,420
Thus, Miss Qiao Wanmian had to ask Tianji Hall

780
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,080
to hand her wedding invitation card over to you.

781
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,080
It's just in time.

782
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,840
I'll get going then.

783
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,730
Aunt, what's wrong with you?

784
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,860
How could you tie Gongyang Wumen and me

785
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,630
together?

786
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,550
I was afraid you'd run away.

787
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,110
Why would I bother to run away?

788
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,310
I'll go back with you.

789
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,260
Stand still. Don't move.

790
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:23,550
Master Shi,

791
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,670
I'm relieved to have you escort him.

792
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,620
Sister Shi.

793
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:29,440
What a coincidence.

794
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:30,870
Don't mind it.

795
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,900
Our elders

796
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:34,930
care about their juniors like this.

797
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:38,500
That's right.

798
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,900
If you don't prune a tree, it won't be upright.

799
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,080
If you don't teach a child well, they won't be obedient.

800
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,010
Tie him tightly.

801
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,480
Let's see where he can go.

802
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,800
In the end, you ended up just like me.

803
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,610
I was tied up

804
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,040
but waiting to go back and enjoy my life.

805
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,600
You are different.

806
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,970
You have to be imprisoned

807
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,210
in Prison 188 of Baichuan Court.

808
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,630
The most evil villains all these years are locked inside.

809
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:00,700
Enjoy it.

810
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:03,990
Young Master Fang,

811
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:09,630
your birth mother, He Xiaolan, almost had a miscarriage when she was pregnant with you.

812
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,110
I saved her.

813
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,070
You must repay the kindness

814
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,620
for saving your life.

815
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,970
What a joke.

816
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:18,430
What nonsense are you talking about?

817
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,090
He Xiaolan is my second aunt.

818
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:20,920
Do you know?

819
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,400
I have seen Chief He and Lord Fang before.

820
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,080
They were infertile.

821
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:29,520
You're about the same age

822
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,340
as Second Young Miss He's child.

823
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:35,020
If you want to know your real identity,

824
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:36,920
save me first.

825
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,730
Don't try to get away by talking nonsense.

826
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:40,930
Fine.

827
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,960
Since you are not willing to protect me,

828
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,950
you should watch your back.

829
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:47,630
What are you talking about?

830
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,430
Take him away.

831
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:58,610
Master Shi.

832
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,440
It's late.

833
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,380
I'll take my naughty young master back first.

834
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,160
See you.

835
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,120
Master Shi,

836
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,110
Gongyang Wumen was kidnapped.

837
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,450
Who was it?

838
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:17,770
It was an ambush

839
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,720
with a tank.

840
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,310
A tank?

841
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:25,020
It's the Jinyuan Alliance.

842
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:36,930
Thank you, Saintess, for saving me.

843
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:44,370
He's a loser.

844
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,180
Why do you bother saving him?

845
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,500
He's not good at martial arts.

846
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,500
But he's good at treating diseases.

847
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,890
Of course he is useful.

848
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:51,930
Today, the tank

849
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,380
was really invincible

850
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,180
and powerful.

851
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,340
Of course.

852
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,150
Unfortunately, the cost is too expensive.

853
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,160
Only one or two are available.

854
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:02,470
Don't worry, Qiao.

855
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:04,620
I'm emptying the Yu City Treasury.

856
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,610
After I'm done preparing all the materials,

857
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:07,770
it's not a problem

858
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,340
to make as many as you like.

859
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,340
We'll be able to kill everyone then.

860
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,640
By then, Baichuan Court and all those sects

861
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,040
can't do anything to the Jinyuan Alliance.

862
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,070
You did a good job.

863
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,450
Where's Rama Heavenly Ice?

864
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:35,310
By the way,

865
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:38,330
is Li Xiangyi dead or not?

866
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,640
What do you mean?

867
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,310
I met someone in the Yuanbao Villa.

868
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:46,240
He used one of the moves in Xiangyi Swordplay,

869
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,720
the one you've told me about before.

870
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,980
The East Wind Blew Through My Small Lodge Again Last Night.

871
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,700
What kind of person was he?

872
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:54,190
He was wearing a mask.

873
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:56,010
But I'm sure it was that move.

874
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,750
And he mastered it well.

875
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,780
He used only a branch as his sword

876
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,240
to crush me.

877
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,520
But his inner power seemed to be weak.

878
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:06,500
That's why I managed to escape.

879
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:07,770
In this world,

880
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,180
who else

881
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,120
can master the Xiangyi Swordplay like this?

882
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:13,440
Impossible.

883
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,480
He already drowned.

884
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,580
Bicha Poison

885
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,600
is the most poisonous in the world.

886
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,330
How could he escape from death?

887
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:21,910
In this world,

888
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,110
there is nothing that is definite.

889
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,500
Di Feisheng is still alive.

890
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,560
Why can't Li Xiangyi be that lucky?

891
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,840
If that's the case,

892
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:33,520
I will let him die again.

893
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,720
Do you hate him so much?

894
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:41,140
No man in this world doesn't look at me.

895
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:44,110
Except for the one I've been following,

896
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,200
Li Xiangyi.

897
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,860
Back then, that bitch from Fengling Sword Sect

898
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,040
always provoked me in front of me.

899
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:54,390
So I massacred Fengling Sword Sect,

900
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,870
broke her tendons and bones,

901
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:58,070
and let her watch her master and seniors

902
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:00,720
burning into ashes in front of me.

903
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,340
That's what she deserved.

904
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:06,950
Who would have thought that Li Xiangyi would try to stop me and kill me?

905
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,560
I begged him so much,

906
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,270
but he was still reluctant to let me go.

907
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,470
He looked at me just like looking at a dead person.

908
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:19,160
If Lord hadn't come to save me,

909
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:22,040
I would have been killed

910
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,440
by Xiangyi Swordplay.

911
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,400
Although Lord saved me,

912
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,230
he hates me and avoids me after that.

913
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:36,900
This is all because of Li Xiangyi.

914
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:39,640
How can I not hate him?

915
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:42,700
[Keep Silent]

916
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,560
Xiangyi Swordplay?

917
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,270
My Lord, do you think it's Li Xiangyi?

918
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,590
So what?

919
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,520
Li Xiangyi used to be your only opponent.

920
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,720
Now you know he might be alive.

921
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,240
Aren't you curious?

922
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:01,780
This is my own business.

923
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,840
You don't have to speculate about it.

924
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:05,280
That's not what I meant.

925
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,220
How about I kill him for you

926
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:08,780
and cook you a dish

927
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:11,770
so that he won't hurt you?

928
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,870
I only obey your orders

929
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,740
and do what you say.

930
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:23,470
My Lord, please don't be angry.

931
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:28,730
I'll assist you to take a shower and get changed.

932
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:32,990
No need.

933
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,820
Do what you should.

934
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,110
I want to assist you.

935
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:41,750
-That's what...
-I don't need a woman to serve me.

936
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:43,740
If you don't understand what I said,

937
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,070
let others take care of what you're doing.

938
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:52,210
Yes.
