Farewell, your Highness.

8

You're in such a hurry to bid me farewell.

Do you take me for a plague?

10

Can he really cure us?

100

Then we can leave here.

101
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:17,730

102

Yes

104
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,820
The Nanyin people left their hometown.

105
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,250
But they must need a place to worship their ancestors.

106
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,220
We've found

107
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,530
Jin Mantang's ancestral hall.

108
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,280
But we've never seen Yu Louchun's ancestral hall.

109
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,020
I think the formula for the antidote

110
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,450
should be in the same place as the ancestral hall.

-Go ahead.
-I’m sorry.

114
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,340
I'll look into the ancestral hall.

115
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,760
Let's go there.

116
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,430
Mr. Fang,

117
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,340
are you the nephew of Shan Gudao?

118
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:55,960
Yes.

119
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,540
That's good.

120
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,290
Thank you for saving me from Li Yufu's

123
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,580
But I have a favor to ask.

124
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,260
Please help me.

125
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,220
Go ahead.

126
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,360
Many years ago,

127
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,100
Shan Gudao once brought a piece of cloud iron

128
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,300
to the Weapon Valley.

129
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,190
He said he wanted to make himself an armor piece

130
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,420
and a sword for Li Xiangyi.

131
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,440
But he died in the battle against the Jinyuan Alliance.

132
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,840
It doesn't make sense.

133
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,860
Why?

134
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,980
Mr. Fang, you don’t know.

135
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,720
Cloud iron is both the toughest and softest material to exist.

136
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,580
The Weapon Valley had only ever seen

137
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,040
Shan Gudao with such a material once in a hundred years.

138
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,140
The armor forged from cloud iron

139
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,460
can only be penetrated by

140
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,060
Li Xiangyi's Wenjing Sword,

141
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,380
which was also made from cloud iron.

142
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,740
I saw my father forge it with my own two eyes.

143
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,070
There's no doubting it.

144
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,530
So I wanted to ask you

145
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,030
if Shan Gudao was wearing the armor

146
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,320
when he died.

147
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:51,350
This...

148
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,470
Only Li Xiangyi's Wenjing Sword

149
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,400
can penetrate Shan Gudao's armor.

150
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,780
Isn't it just like what they said at the Sigu Tea Party?

151
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,380
The death of Shan Gudao is very strange indeed.

152
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,020
My father held a grudge

153
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,550
over this matter for years.

154
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,860
That’s why I came to ask you.

155
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,020
He wasn't wearing

156
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,340
the armor.

157
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,750
I see.

158
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:17,860
Great!

159
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:18,980
Great.

160
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,620
I’ll take my leave.

161
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,610
If you do visit me in the Weapon Valley in the future,

162
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,460
I’ll compose ten poems for you.

163
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,340
Goodbye.

164
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,220
Goodbye.

165
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,390
The armor was indeed on my father's body.

166
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,060
But a hole was pierced into it by a sword.

167
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,010
What the hell is going on here?

168

Fang Xiaobao.

169
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,250
Why are you spacing out?

170
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,400
Let's go. I found the ancestral hall.

171
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,370
I asked Xifei.

172
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,270
There should be a Yingyue Pavilion

173
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,730
near the Guanri Pavilion.

174
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,320
It's just a pavilion.

175
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,100
Why didn't Yu Louchun allow

176
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,180
anyone near it for the past few years?

177
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,580
All these years,

178
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,920
Xifei has only seen one guest,

179
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,290
Jin Mantang.

180
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,700
What's on your mind?

181
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,220
The fog here is so heavy,

182
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,180
it's exactly the same as the fog at the Yipin Tomb.

183
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,540
If my guess is right,

184
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,020
the key

185
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,330
should be this tree.

186
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:31,830
I did it.

187
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:32,720
Let's go.

188
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:52,980
Li Lianhua!

189
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,650
Li Lianhua!

190
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,510
Fei!

191
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,590
At least you have a conscience.

192
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,300
The trick of this mechanism is the stone walls on both sides.

193
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,590
Think of a way to push them back.

194
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,120
Why don't you think of a way?

195
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,540
Yangzhouman?

196
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,040
I'm exhausted.

197
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,240
Your inner power is Yangzhouman?

198
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,130
I'm very familiar with inner powers.

199
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,660
Where did you learn it from?

200
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,290
Tell me,

201
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,110
what's the name of this technique?

202
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,620
Oh, it's an amazing one.

203
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,650
It's as powerful as Yangzhouman,

204
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,780
called Suzhoukuai.

205
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,340
This is not Yangzhouman.

206
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,080
It's called Suzhoukuai, understand?

207
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,480
I’ll teach you next time.

208
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,240
What are you waiting for?

209
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,190
Find Li Lianhua.

210
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,450
What happened to the two of you?

211
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,650
What took you so long?

212
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:14,880
Everything is here.

213
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,610
I found them.

214
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,630
Young master, here.

215
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,690
This is the formula for the antidote.

216
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:24,740
Take it.

217
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,650
Take a good look.

218
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,580
Take it.

219
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,380
This is Yu Louchun's ledger from ten years ago.

220
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,180
I've checked all these ledgers.

221
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,230
Ten years ago,

222
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,410
Yu Louchun

223
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,180
rarely invited people to the Girls' Mansion.

224
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,620
Apart from Jin Mantang,

225
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,330
there were only two other people.

226
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,810
One of them was Four-faced Qingzun from the Jinyuan Alliance.

227
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,140
The other was the Lord of the Netherworld.

228
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,640
I think these two are descendants of Nanyin.

229
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:53,030
Four-faced Qingzun and Jinyuan Alliance?

230
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:56,790
Oh, right.

231
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,290
It's also a famous sect in the martial world.

232
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,820
It’s no surprise if you've heard of it before.

233
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,660
But the Four-faced Qingzun

234
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,630
had long died

235
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,240
in Prison 188,

236
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,380
which is your territory.

237
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,230
The only clue left

238
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,260
is this Lord of the Netherworld.

239
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:14,740
See?

240
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,590
I'm still the best.

241
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,820
Fang Xiaobao.

242
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,370
Why are you spacing out?

243
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:25,630
I'm not.

244
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,460
I just think

245
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,360
it's good to have a smart friend like you.

246
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,510
That's right.

247
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,340
Let's go.

248
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,980
You two nearly scared me to death.

249
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,510
Hurry up.

250
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,160
This is the prescription.

251
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,790
Please find a physician

252
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,480
to make an antidote for the guards.

253
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,740
Don’t worry, Mr. Fang.

254
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,160
Will you report back to Sigu Sect with us?

255
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,610
I have something important to do.

256
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,560
Please help me

257
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,500
report back instead, Sister Shi.

258
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,450
What are the Jinyuan Alliance and Nanyin up to?

259
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,350
If you've changed your mind,

260
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,350
it's not too late.

261
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,860
Maybe Baichuan Court

262
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,660
can reduce your punishment.

263
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,190
Fine.

264
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,900
You're on your own.

265
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,330
If it's really him,

266
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,350
how could he be hurt by Li Yifu?

267
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,490
He brought it on himself.

268
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,150
Are you okay?

269
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,700
I'm fine.

270
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,330
He was right behind you just now.

271
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,790
You really didn't notice?

272
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,010
No.

273
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,350
Luckily you came in time.

274
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,610
That really scared me.

275
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,820
Check it out for me.

276
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,390
How is it?

277
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,980
Is it serious? Any marks?

278
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,220
Stop messing around.

279
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,160
Miss Shi,

280
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,010
shall we proceed to the

281
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,140
local government office

282
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,140
and count the confiscated goods?

283
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:38,580
Let's go.

284
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:44,710
Let's go.

285
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,730
It's time to move.

286
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,940
Let's find the Lord of the Netherworld.

287
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,700
Why are we avoiding the Baichuan Court?

288
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,890
That's because you've done a lot of evil in the martial world.

289
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,090
If someone finds out,

290
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,430
it'll be a big trouble.

291
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,400
Am I really wrong?

292
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,610
How could Li Lianhua be Li Xiangyi?

293
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,340
But...

294
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,530
What about the Yangzhouman?

295
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,580
Di Feisheng.

296
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,050
Li Xiangyi.

297
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:30,460
No.

298
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,040
I have to get to the bottom of this.

299
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:44,910
What are you doing?

300
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:45,790
Here.

301
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,210
Have a drink on me.

302
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:47,880
A celebration for

303
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,940
solving the big Girls' Mansion case.

304
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,740
You're treating me with my wine?

305
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,870
You're so eloquent.

306
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,550
I just want to drink and

307
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,820
chat with you, can't I?

308
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,480
What do you want to chat about?

309
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,140
How about why you know Yangzhouman?

310
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,700
What Yangzhouman? You're so full of strange words.

311
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,940
Stop pretending.

312
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,820
It's the inner skill mental factor you taught me.

313
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,680
Let me tell you.

314
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,270
I rarely offer to let bygones be bygones.

315
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,840
Think before you answer.

316
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,560
If you're really hiding something from me,

317
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,760
you'd better tell me everything today.

318
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,810
You mean the mental factor?

319
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,500
I remember it now.

320
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,250
What did I tell you back in that cave?

321
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,820
Can you stop talking nonsense?

322
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,100
There can't be so many coincidences at once.

323
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,100
Do you take this for writing a novel?

324
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:32,870
Let me ask you.

325
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,380
You know Yangzhouman,

326
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,340
and you appeared in Yuanbao Villa at the same time

327
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,950
as that mysterious swordsman in white.

328
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:37,350
You...

329
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,270
Are you Li Xiangyi?

330
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,960
Li Xiangyi? How's that possible?

331
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,130
Fang Xiaobao.

332
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,230
If I were Li Xiangyi,

333
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,940
how could Fo, Bi, Bai, and Shi not have recognized me?

334
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,660
Besides,

335
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,040
I asked you to practice every day,

336
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,280
but you only think about this nonsense.

337
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:10,680
What?

338
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,790
You don't trust me?

339
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,130
Do you know that

340
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,839
my father had impenetrable armor

341
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,020
forged from cloud iron?

342

343
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:24,619
Junior.

344

It's your first time leaving the mountains for training.

345

The He family of Changma Blade Sect

346
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,460
was besieged by the Dongling Three Gang.

347
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,589
It'll be dangerous.

348
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,339
You should not take the risk.

349

The Changma Blade Sect has long retired.

352

The Dongling Three Gang claims to be eliminating bandits,

353
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,060
but they are actually coveting the He family's cloud iron.

354
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,330
I must interfere with this matter.

I beg of you.

364
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:18,050

365

00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,620
-We will...
-Junior.

367
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,180
I heard that the He family owns the

368
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,980
cloud iron, a material that is both tough and soft.

369
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,850
Heroes,

370
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,620
as long as my son arrives safely,

371
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:38,050
he will tell you the whereabouts of the cloud iron.

372
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,420
There is no need.

373
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:40,940
A hero does not

374
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,880
take advantage of others.

375
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,260
I'm just worried that it might fall into the wrong hands.

376
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,320
That's why I asked.

377
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,370
Master He, don't worry.

378
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,060
We will send your son

379
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,100

380
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:55,730
Senior.

381
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,440
You asked me to assist you outside the city that day.

382
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,570
You escorted the kid to Luoyang alone.

383
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,150
Did you personally send him to his grandfather's house?

384
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,880
Then why did he still die outside of Luoyang City?

385
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,510
Really?

386
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,700
Of course I sent him

387
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,300
to his grandfather's house.

388
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,820
The He family of Changma Blade Sect committed a lot of evil deeds.

389
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,330
It must be their enemies seeking revenge

390
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,930
and wanting to get rid of him.

391
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,750
How unfortunate.

Did Senior still acquire the cloud iron in the end?

395
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,510
No.

396
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,240
He's definitely not that kind of person.

397
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,690
It's just a random guess.

398

If you had only stumbled upon the Yangzhouman,

your words are meaningless?

I just don't get it.

421
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,070
You obviously lied to him.

00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,630
But you don't seem to want to harm him.

423

The Shishou Village.

455

It is said that Shishou Village was famous for

456
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:23,280
its Rouchang wine, which can enhance one's inner power.

457
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,010
Back then, many people in the martial world went there for the wine.

I may have heard of this legend before.

00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:34,770
Was the Lord of the Netherworld also seeking the Rouchang wine?

had a serious internal injury once.

464

If Rouchang wine can increase his inner power,

465
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,780
it's possible for him to go to Shishou Village.

00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,340
is always getting in my way.

512
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:54,170
We can't keep such a nuisance alive.

513
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,900
Mount Chrysanthemum is Feng Qing's territory.

514
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:00,020
I'll wait for your good news there.

515
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,430
Go now.

516
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,020
We've been circling around Mount Chrysanthemum for so many times.

517
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,750
We haven't even seen a village.

518
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,360
No wonder

519
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,910
they said Shishou Village is a mysterious village.

520
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:32,440
Could it be that we're not destined to find it?

521
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,020
I don't know if it's destiny.

522
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,900
But we seem to be lost.

523
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,300
Lost?

524
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,610
Are you kidding me?

525
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,860
I've never been lost since I was six.

526
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,070
Even in the desert,

527
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,060
I could find my way.

528
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,620
We're already lost.

529
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,740
Stop bragging.

530
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,440
Let's go. Hurry up.

531
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,650
[Bahuang Hunyuan Lake]

532
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,300
Bahuang Hunyuan Lake.

533
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:09,540
Since there's a boundary stone here,

534
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,340
there should be someone nearby.

535
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,610
I'll wash my face by the lake.

536
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,250
Come and have a look.

537
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,960
I just wanted to wash my face.

538
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,020
But why are there skulls in the water?

539
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,000
It's the reflection of the strange stones.

540
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:47,670
Move!

541
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,450
Who are you?

542
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,690
Can't I wash my face in peace?

543
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,900
We're the ones who will kill you.

544
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,740
Windy Poplar?

545
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,730
My Lord.

546
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,980
Who are you? Why are you calling me your lord?

547
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,580
Don't you recognize me?

548
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,100
I'm your subordinate, Snow Master.

549
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,540
You are the director of the Jinyuan Alliance.

550
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,730
The Jinyuan Alliance. Director.

551
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:14,870
Let's go!

552
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:39,580
Are you okay?

553
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,800
I'm fine. How are you?

554
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,330
I'm fine.

555
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,760
What is this place?

556
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,880
Looks like

557
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,330
we've rounded to the back of the mountain.

558
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:50,630
Let's go.

559
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,550
Let's go over there.

560
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,850
Out of the woods, another village.

561
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,140
It's truly destined.

562
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,700
You were staring at that lake for a long time.

563
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,930
You must have long noticed that

564
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,990
something was under the lake, right?

565
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:26,750
Fei, what's wrong?

566
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,220
The Wuxin Huai poison is spreading throughout his body.

567
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,810
Use your power to suppress it for him.

568
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:36,120
I...

569
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,090
Why should I save this villain?

570
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:39,930
Hurry up.

571
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:41,750
Fine.

572
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,510
I can't let you die

573
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,970
before I take you to Baichuan Court.

574
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:01,820
Why is this small village so quiet?

575
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,870
Are you feeling better?

576
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,900
The Jinyuan Alliance. My Lord.

577
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,140
What do they mean?

578
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,320
You mentioned these words before.

579
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,720
You must know something.

580
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,530
Why do I have a headache whenever I think of it?

581
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,760
Well,

582
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,600
about the Jinyuan Alliance.

583
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,180
You really were

584
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,790
the evil leader of the Jinyuan Alliance.

585
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,150
You were their lord.

586
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,050
However,

587
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,990
you've turned over a new leaf.

588
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,550
You are no longer on their side.

589
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,210
That's why they poisoned you.

590
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:43,970
What's wrong?

591
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,790
Your words can never be fully trusted.

592
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,970
But I can't completely disregard them either.

593
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:49,500
Listen.

594
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,830
-I’m not lying.
-Let's enter the village.

595
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:56,720
Li Lianhua.

596
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,000
How long do you think we can

597
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,530
keep lying to him like this?

598
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:04,050
But if he regains his memory,

599
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:05,530
he might be able to figure out

600
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,730
what happened in the Jinyuan Alliance.

601
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,010
I have something

602
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,050
to ask him too.

603
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,460
Is it about your father?

604
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:20,050
If he regains his memory,

605
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,410
do you think he'll be a friend or foe?

606
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,190
[Shishou Village]

607
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,090
Shishou Village?

608
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,860
This is the legendary paradise?

609
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,050
Maybe it's not paradise season yet.

610
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,490
Right?

611
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,030
But this village is so hidden.

612
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,180
Did the Lord of the Netherworld really come here?

613
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,510
It's been so many years.

614
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:43,330
It's not easy to find someone.

615
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,180
It's not dark yet.

616
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,520
Why is there no one outside?

617
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,030
Kid.

618
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:00,980
Excuse me.

619
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:01,990
It's getting dark.

620
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:03,520
I told you not to run around.

621
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,620
The villagers are strange.

622
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:10,090
They seem to be avoiding something.

623
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,250
Wasn't this place known for its Rouchang wine,

624
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,220
and many martial artists came here for it?

625
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,950
Why is it in this state instead?

626
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,320
This place is indeed strange.

627
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,740
It's getting late.

628
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,580
Let's find an inn first.

629
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:24,630
Let's go.

630

00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:46,660
[Yuquan Inn]

633
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,700
no one has lived here for a long time.

634
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,060
This village is so desolate.

635
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,120
But they built an inn here.

636
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,580
Who is it for?

637
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,540
Maybe it was quite lively a few years ago.

638
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:57,490
Don't forget.

639
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,170
Many martial artists

640
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,690
came here for the Rouchang wine.

641
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,670
Let's go in.

642
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,070
What is this?

643
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:45,670
Don't you think

644
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,330
there's a strange smell here?

645
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,400
What smell?

646
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:52,940
The smell of the dead.

647
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,050
It's all blood.

648
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,590
You're right.

649
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,660
The marks here are short and messy.

650
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,750
They weren't caused by swords or blades.

651
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,670
It's more like

652
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,690
someone tore into them with bare hands.

653
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:37,490
The blood splattered very fast.

654
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:40,330
I'm afraid the victim won't survive.

655
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:45,470
Look.

656
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,040
Be careful.

657
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:41,530
This way.

658
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,350
Someone hanged to death here.

659
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,610
Since they have retrieved the body,

660
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:17,340
why didn't they remove the cloth

661
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,870
and the bench on the ground?

662
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,510
At night, the ghost emerged from the fourth room.

663
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,080
It peeped into my window.

664
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,700
I am terrified.

665
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,970
I wish you were here.

666
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,660
It's a suicide note.

667
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,020
This is left by a woman.

668
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,020
Before her husband returned,

669
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,170
she encountered something terrible.

670
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,830
It forced her to hang herself.

671
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,680
She said a ghost entered through the window.

672
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,080
The main hall does have a lot of

673
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,480
bamboo tags with ghost characters on them.

674
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,270
Is this another haunted inn?

675
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,660
Don't you think it's strange?

676
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,260
There's the sound of wind outside,

677
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,660
but the wind can't get in.

678
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,060
It's as if someone is blocking the wind.

679
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,630
It's a ghost.

680
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,470
The ghost blocked the wind for you.

681
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,650
Are you done?

682
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,320
Fine.

683
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,550
Let's go our separate ways.

684
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,860
Did you find anything?

685
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:54,880
There are signs of a

686
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,230
serious battle in the room.

687
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,550
But the bodies are all gone.

688
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:59,140
It's like everyone disappeared

689
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,470
at the same time one day.

690
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,070
How did we get in here?

691
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,800
There's a door.

692
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,020
You're right.

693
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,050
What is it?

694
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,400
This severed hand was ripped off.

695
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,950
Judging from the decay,

696
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,580
it should be less than four to five days.

697
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:33,740
That means

698
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,280
this ghost is still killing.

699
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,050
Why are you looking at me?

700
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:40,960
Think about it.

701
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,210
We've been in the inn for so long.

702
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,270
Maybe we're already being targeted.

703
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:48,350
If we don't leave this inn now,

704
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,670
we'll be in danger.

705
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,870
Look. On the doorframe.

706
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,870
Looks like this hand

707
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,480
had an insane grip.

708
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,310
If not for the traces of martial arts,

709
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,200
I would have thought that the people here

710
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,130
were torn apart by a vicious tiger.

711
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:20,270
The pillar was broken like this.

712
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:22,690
I'm afraid this beast

713
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,160
was no match for the owner of this severed hand either.

714
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:30,700
They even managed to

715
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,560
split such a tough copper censer.

716
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,790
This was split open in one strike.

717
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:37,020
The person must have been quite skilled.

718
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,880
But they are still inferior to me.

719
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,080
Why are you looking at me?

720
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:51,030
The sword mark split the copper censer from the center.

721
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,500
But the sword tilted left by three points.

722
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,840
This seems to be a move from Zhaoyue Sect.

723
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:55,920
Also,

724
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:59,060
the fingerprints and the palm print on the doorframe

725
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,460
were also made by people.

726
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:03,140
The finger strength was strong enough to dent a hard surface.

727
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,270
There are also claw marks on each side.

728
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,030
This is the outer martial arts of the Kunlun Sect.

729
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,060
Identifying the moves and sects only through the marks...

730
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,190
Only those who are skilled in martial arts can do that.

731
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:15,910
Li Lianhua.

732
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:17,700
Who are you?

733
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:18,590
Zhaoyue here,

734
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,470
Kunlun there.

735
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:21,660
Looks like a bunch of skilled martial artists

736
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,920
really did fight here.

737
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,380
If it really was a fight between martial artists,

738
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,980
why are there so many

739
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
beast marks here?

740
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:29,470
Fang Xiaobao,

741
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,240
have you heard of

742
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,200
any sect in the martial world

743
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:35,370
that specializes in taming beasts?

744
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:44,650
What are you doing?

745
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:46,450
Why are you spacing out at night?

746
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:48,330
I've never heard of it.

747
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:52,190
You're right.

748
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:53,650
Where did these people go?

749
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,870
Whether they won or lost the fight,

750
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,840
they had to leave after fighting.

751
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,320
They might have left after the fight,

752
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,360
but this is an inn.

753
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:01,820
It has been deserted all these years.

754
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,720
Is there no one here to clean this up?

755
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,120
So many people died here,

756
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,720
and there are so many talismans downstairs.

757
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,080
Maybe no one dared to come in

758
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:09,810
because this place is haunted.
