00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Kissing myself thousands of times

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The most reluctant moment is that moment

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Right on the earth, a thousand miles of crazy

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who doesn't wander around

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds and the moon on the cliff

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Right on the earth, the young love story

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
A thousand times, I won't fall into the sorrow

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
A journey through the world is like a dream

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Right on the earth, a thousand miles of crazy

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Who doesn't wander around

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds and the moon on the cliff

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Right on the earth, the young love story

14

Episode 17

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You know, as long as you check Miss Yuer's body,

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
you will know that the guards at the scene have found the flaw.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So you set the fire at night.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But you never thought that Madam Yu came back in advance

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and took back the body that had not been completely burnt.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What a pity, Madam Yu.

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You set the fire at night

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and made a fire in the middle of the night.

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Madam Yu, you set the fire in the middle of the night

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and killed all the guards in the door.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You let them lose the chance to speak forever.

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You don't take the lives of the guards seriously.

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
How can you be so serious about the murderer's death?

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You are so thoughtful.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Miss Yun, you are so devoted to the Lord of the Jade City.

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But he wants to kill you tonight.

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Such a person

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
doesn't deserve your protection.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
At the Xiaoming Inn,

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
the one who tried to break the needle

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
was also defeated by the warm bath given by Miss Yu.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It was he who was protecting you.

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You should give him justice.

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes.

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I was wrong.

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I was wrong.

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I was wrong.

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I was wrong.

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
At first, he wanted to hide the needle

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and see the black flag inside.

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I took it and put it on him.

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yu Mulan,

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
you should admit it.

52
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Be careful.

53
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Be careful.

54
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's the Jade City.

55
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I want to avenge Shuang'er.

56
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Come and see him.

57
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What are you doing?

58
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
If Mrs. Yu wants to avenge your sister,

59
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm afraid she needs to make a signal.

60
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What do you mean?

61
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Don't forget, Mrs. Yu.

62
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Before Miss Yu's death,

63
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
she was seriously injured.

64
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
She was injured from the beginning.

65
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
When we saw Mr. Zongzheng

66
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
he helped us to get rid of the wound.

67
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Mr. Zongzheng,

68
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm afraid you can't beat him

69
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
with such a skill

70
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
that can break the internal organs.

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I've been curious about it all the time.

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yu Mulan took the needle by accident.

73
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He could have killed Yu Qiushan directly.

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But why did he give him a slap?

75
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Now I know

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
all the doubts.

77
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Why did he kill Miss Yu twice?

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Because

79
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Jin Zhen and Zhang Feng are not the same person.

80
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Mr. Zongzheng,

81
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
you slapped him, right?

82
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I did slap him.

83
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
But why did I kill him?

84
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Why?

85
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Because you and Mrs. Yu

86
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
have a private relationship.

87
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You were hit by Miss Yu.

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And you have

89
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Mrs. Yu's osmanthus fragrance in your room.

90
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And you don't have the osmanthus fragrance

91
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
in the guest room.

92
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
In a hurry,

93
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Mrs. Yu protected you very much.

94
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
For many years,

95
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
you never sympathized with me

96
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
and looked at me with your eyes.

97
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It was you.

98
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I was not calm.

99
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But you are not getting better.

100
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Shut up!

101
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's you.

102
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You killed Qiushuang.

103
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I...

104
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I did slap him.

105
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
But I didn't mean it.

106
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That day, I met with Hongzhu outside.

107
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We were supposed to break off the relationship.

108
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But Hongzhu was angry.

109
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I couldn't leave.

110
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So I chased him to the guest house.

111
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Hongzhu was very angry.

112
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I tried to persuade him for a long time.

113
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Then he calmed down and listened to me.

114
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But suddenly I heard a sound outside the window.

115
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Our time-lapse can't let people know.

116
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So I slapped him outside the window.

117
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
When I checked,

118
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
no one was there.

119
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I didn't know that person was Qiushuang.

120
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So the one who killed your sister

121
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
was you.

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Bless me!

123
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
We are all part of it.

124
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
She shouldn't have died.

125
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's us.

126
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's us.

127
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I didn't have the courage to save her.

128
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I didn't have the courage to admit it.

129
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I didn't have the courage to admit it.

130
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I even did so many bad things with you.

131
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I pushed it all on the ghost killer.

132
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's me.

133
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's me.

134
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Qiushuang was hit by the arrow.

135
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
She was nowhere to be found in Ruoda's imperial city.

136
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
She could only come to me

137
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
and find her best friend.

138
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Qiushuang!

139
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
But she met me and Yu Mulan in private.

140
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Qiushuang, don't misunderstand.

141
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
We are not what you think.

142
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
She was seriously injured.

143
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
How desperate she should be.

144
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yu Mulan,

145
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
you were worried that things would go wrong.

146
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You even killed her.

147
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
But in order to survive,

148
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I had to pretend to be crazy

149
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
even if I knew you were going to kill me.

150
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yes.

151
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Thank you.

152
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
May you be safe.

153
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm not worthy of being her friend.

154
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm not worthy of being her best friend.

155
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm not worthy.

156
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm not worthy.

157
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Keling,

158
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
no one loves the second lady

159
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
as she loves her.

160
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And no one wants to let her go.

161
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's my fault.

162
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's my fault.

163
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You told me that no one was outside the window.

164
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's my illusion.

165
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Why didn't you tell me

166
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
that she was hurt by your palm?

167
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Calm down.

168
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm not her friend.

169
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm not her friend.

170
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Why are still following us

171
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
when she's going to go to the back hill?

172
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What can I do

173
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
if I don't do that?

174
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
We talked a lot that day.

175
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
We talked and we couldn't talk.

176
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Do you want her to know that

177
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
it's all because of me?

178
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Shut up, Zongsheng Mingzhu.

179
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,200
You're cold and heartless.

180
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,600
You even did something that's against your family name.

181
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,360
Why pretend to be a love-sick man?

182
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,760
Mr. Fang, Mr. Li.

183
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,560
Thank you for your concern.

184
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:06,960
Guards.

185
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,520
Take Yu Mulan and Yun Jiao to the prison.

186
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,320
Yes.

187
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,560
Prepare the carriage.

188
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,480
Send Mr. Fang, Mr. Li,

189
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,440
and all the guests out of the city.

190
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,080
Wait.

191
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,360
Mrs. Yu, you shouldn't send guests like this.

192
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,680
Why did you put them in the prison?

193
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,000
What about the Pearl of Zongzheng?

194
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,720
What's your plan?

195
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,160
This is my family property.

196
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,960
I'll handle it.

197
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,800
This is a criminal case.

198
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,920
According to the law,

199
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,200
the criminal case in the Jianghu is determined by the Baichuan Court.

200
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,000
The Pearl of Zongzheng is a court-ordained property.

201
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,440
It should be checked by the Procuratorate.

202
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,160
Besides, Mrs. Yu killed the guards in the gate.

203
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
She killed them all.

204
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,400
You're guilty too.

205
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,560
What about killing my own guards?

206
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,480
This is the record of the injured guards of Yucheng.

207
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,320
These guards were injured by the attack.

208
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,520
According to the law,

209
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,400
those who raise the guards and attack them three times

210
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,680
are not allowed to be treated as family slaves.

211
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You're guilty, of course.

212
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,280
You should be punished.

213
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,440
You should also compensate the families of these guards.

214
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,360
You're trying to seek justice for these guards?

215
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,800
They shouldn't have died.

216
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,120
When did I, Kunlun Yucheng,

217
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,040
break the law?

218
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,360
Fang Dobin,

219
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,560
you don't want me to kill you?

220
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,120
Take them

221
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,040
to seek justice for Lord Yan.

222
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,840
Go!

223
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,200
Leave this to me.

224
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,880
You go first.

225
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,240
Don't worry.

226
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,680
The reinforcements will arrive soon.

227
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,560
Reinforcements?

228
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,120
The Rear Escort!

229
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,280
The Fox King?

230
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,560
Why are they here?

231
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,280
Of course, it's the Fox King's merit.

232
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,280
Take your time.

233
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,040
Take a step first.

234
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:10,920
Thank you.

235
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,800
Kill them!

236
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,720
Don't be a nuisance.

237
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,600
The Fox King should be punished!

238
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,520
Stop!

239
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,520
Go?

240
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,080
Stop!

241
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,920
The Qingalah southern border,

242
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,440
the Baichuanveng Gorge,

243
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,840
in the past fifty years

244
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,440
the ring of self-killing

245
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,440
I've known him for a long time.

246
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,960
I want to know

247
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,640
how great he is

248
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,560
to force the guard of the Shuming Sect to commit suicide.

249
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,720
Yu Hongzhu broke the law and was arrested.

250
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,880
The people of the Baichuan Courtyard and the Supervision Bureau

251
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,840
are surrounded outside the city.

252
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,520
Thank you for your help.

253
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,960
Who are you?

254
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,600
Supervision Bureau.

255
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,760
Yang Yunchun.

256
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,840
I received a secret letter

257
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,240
saying that the grandson of the prime minister

258
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,320
was making trouble in the imperial city.

259
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,000
I came to see him.

260
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,960
Song Zheng Mingzhu

261
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,760
has been in the court for a few times.

262
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,000
I didn't expect

263
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,640
he would be so popular with you today.

264
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,760
Secret letter?

265
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,840
Did Li Lianhua send it out?

266
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,640
The Supervision Bureau is very quick.

267
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,440
You have settled down in the imperial city.

268
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,440
The previous case

269
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,640
was so difficult to solve

270
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,160
that you were even

271
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,440
trying to solve the problem.

272
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,280
Mr. Fang.

273
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,680
The Supervision Bureau

274
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,200
has never made it difficult for the Supervision Bureau.

275
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,800
Miss Shi, don't misunderstand.

276
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,920
I really received

277
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,000
that secret letter.

278
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,440
The Supervision Bureau and the Baichuan Courtyard

279
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,800
have the same responsibility.

280
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,040
How could they make it difficult on purpose?

281
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,880
Last time, I helped Miss Shi

282
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,520
to catch the thief and cooperate with Wu Jian.

283
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,600
I didn't expect

284
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,320
I could meet Miss Shi again this time.

285
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,280
Mr. Fang.

286
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,360
What are you hiding from?

287
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,040
What a coincidence, Sister Shi.

288
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,800
Didn't you send a letter to the Supervision Bureau

289
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,920
and improvisation on the new case?

290
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,220
You wanted to

291
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,480
plunge into angoing crisis.

292
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,720
Then what about my another thing?

293
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,840
And accept it as you're imp już.

294
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,200
You didn't ощущate an indicator.

295
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,360
The imperial capital

296
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,520
is not something

297
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,440
for a positive outcome.

298
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,400
Also,

299
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,920
return my things to me.

300
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,000
Well,

301
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:38,920
I will use this card

302
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,800
directly.

303
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,720
Sister Shi.

304
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,640
By the way, Senior Sister,

305
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,920
there's someone

306
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,360
I want to take you to identify.

307
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,000
I suspect he's

308
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,240
a drug addict of the Golden Thread Embroidery.

309
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,840
Where is he?

310
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,640
Red mud.

311
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,120
Where did the red mud come from?

312
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,440
What secret

313
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,440
is Yu Cheng hiding?

314
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,560
Second Miss was bitten by a poisonous bug

315
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,760
in the back hill a year ago.

316
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,760
He followed me all the way from the back hill.

317
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,400
Back hill.

318
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,840
Hu Li Jing.

319
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:32,920
Smell it.

320
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,240
When you smell it,

321
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,280
I'll give you a big chicken tonight.

322
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:38,760
Go.

323
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,880
You rest for a while.

324
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,320
Fucking Barbara.

325
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,260
Have Sir'soffs.

326
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,060
Congratulations, Your Majesty, on your promotion to the official position.

327
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,860
Your Majesty,

328
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,860
is it possible?

329
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,460
The statue was right here.

330
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,660
Where's the Lotus?

331
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,860
Where's the Lotus?

332
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,860
Where's the Lotus?

333
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,460
Where's the Lotus?

334
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,060
Where's the Lotus?

335
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,460
Where's the Lotus?

336
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,060
Where's the Lotus?

337
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,060
Where's the Lotus?

338
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,060
Is it in there?

339
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,060
Don't go in.

340
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,060
This is a life-and-death trap.

341
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,460
There's no way to avoid the poison.

342
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,860
If you go in, you'll be dead.

343
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,860
You're the mastermind of the demon.

344
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,860
Demon?

345
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,060
The five-leaf-leaf is about to fall apart.

346
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,260
You two are here.

347
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,060
Why are you still wearing a tail?

348
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,660
This Jade-Hongzhu is getting useless.

349
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,860
Anyone can come here.

350
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,660
Demon, go get your precious poisonous bug

351
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,860
and cut off its bone.

352
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,260
Don't worry.

353
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,860
I promise you,

354
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,260
it won't even find its bone.

355
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,260
Demon, you're really here.

356
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,460
Are you okay?

357
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,060
I'm fine.

358
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,060
I'm fine.

359
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,060
I'm fine.

360
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,060
I'm fine.

361
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,060
I'm fine.

362
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,860
Are you okay?

363
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,860
Why are you hurt like this?

364
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,860
I'm fine.

365
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,860
You don't know death.

366
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,260
Don't bother.

367
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,060
Let's go.

368
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,060
He has something to do.

369
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,260
Let's go.

370
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,060
Di Feisheng.

371
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,260
Di Feisheng is still alive.

372
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,460
Demon, let's go.

373
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,860
Stop!

374
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,660
Li Lianhua.

375
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,860
Li Lianhua.

376
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,260
Li Lianhua.

377
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,860
The Real Demon ran away with Di Feisheng?

378
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,260
You're really not a demon.

379
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,060
Where is my senior brother's body?

380
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,260
Di Feisheng.

381
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,860
Di Feisheng?

382
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,460
How do you know his name?

383
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,860
You know him?

384
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,060
I slept so soundly.

385
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,860
I think I heard someone call him by his name.

386
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,060
Be careful.

387
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,660
Do you know that

388
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,860
the one who ran into him

389
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,860
was the demon Di Feisheng?

390
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,060
You're really lucky.

391
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,660
The chaos was full of gas.

392
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,060
How did you get in?

393
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,860
I went to find my dog.

394
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,460
I don't know why it exploded suddenly.

395
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,060
Fortunately, you came.

396
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,860
Who would have thought that the demon

397
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,060
was hiding in this remote place?

398
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,460
I heard that in the stone cave,

399
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,060
the internal medicine was all in it.

400
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,260
During the East Sea War,

401
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,860
he must have been seriously injured

402
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,260
and was there to practice.

403
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,660
It's a pity that

404
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,460
I didn't see his face clearly.

405
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,660
If he didn't die,

406
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,660
the world would be in chaos.

407
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,060
Since Di Feisheng didn't die,

408
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,860
Li Xiangyi must be still alive, right?

409
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,060
He must be still alive, right?

410
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,460
Are you confused?

411
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,860
I knew it.

412
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,260
He must be still alive.

413
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,460
He will definitely come back.

414
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,460
He was just temporarily

415
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,060
led by something.

416
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,460
By the way,

417
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:18,260
about the last time,

418
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,460
I misunderstood you.

419
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,060
So,

420
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,660
I was suspicious of the demon and I was innocent?

421
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,460
I was the one who caught the thief and offended him.

422
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,260
You can just tell me

423
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,460
how I should apologize to you.

424
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,060
It's nothing.

425
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,860
I'm just a little hungry.

426
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:36,860
It's that simple?

427
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,260
Okay, I'll arrange it for you.

428
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,060
Wait for me.

429
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,460
Di Feisheng,

430
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,660
you're still alive.

431
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,660
There are some things

432
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,260
I need to ask you.

433
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,460
I didn't catch up with him,

434
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,860
but it must be Di Feisheng.

435
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,460
I'm sure that he's around the Jiali Bridge.

436
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,260
I've checked with the Jade Emperor.

437
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,460
He was one of the twelve disciples of the Golden Abyss Alliance.

438
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,060
He escaped from the Golden Abyss Alliance

439
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,260
and destroyed the Jade City.

440
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,460
It seems that

441
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,660
the Jiali Bridge was controlled by the Golden Abyss Alliance

442
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,660
and the other places were in chaos.

443
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,460
It must be Di Feisheng who ordered them.

444
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,460
The Jade Red Pearl broke the snake's mouth.

445
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,060
The Pearl of Zongzheng was taken away by the Supervisory Bureau.

446
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,060
It's hard to question the people in the court.

447
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,460
Di Feisheng has no clue now.

448
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,860
If Di Feisheng really survives,

449
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,460
then our sect leader will be able to save him.

450
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,860
I'm sure that

451
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,060
the people in the sect will be able to save him.

452
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,860
Then, will our sect leader...

453
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,860
Is Xiang Yi the same as Di Feisheng?

454
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,460
If he still lives, why won't he come back?

455
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,260
It's most hurtful to guess for nothing.

456
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,660
Don't mention it again in the future.

457
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:03,660
Wan Mian.

458
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,460
Zi Jin, we should go back.

459
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,260
Okay.

460
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,060
Let's go.

461
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,460
It's daytime and you're already doing the daytime work?

462
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,460
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

463
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,660
I'm grateful to the most beautiful woman in the martial arts world, Qiao Wan Mian.

464
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,460
You should ask Xiao Zi Jin about the broken sword in his hand.

465
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,460
Stop guessing.

466
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,060
Don't even joke around.

467
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,460
I'm just curious.

468
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,660
They haven't entered Bai Chuan Yue yet.

469
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,060
Why are they here?

470
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,060
They are here for a reason.

471
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,060
They are here to see the world.

472
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,660
They are here to see the world.

473
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,060
They are here for a reason.

474
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,060
They must be the old people of the Silk Gate.

475
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,260
I heard that the great demon Di Feisheng

476
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,460
is not indifferent to it.

477
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,660
Fang Xiao Bao!

478
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,460
He's here so soon?

479
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,860
He must have contacted our county.

480
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,460
Brother, please block me.

481
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,460
Yes, I'll give you the tape.

482
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,860
That's weird.

483
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,260
I just heard the sound.

484
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,260
You are...

485
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,860
I'm Li Lian Hua.

486
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,260
Li Lian Hua?

487
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,060
You are the owner of the Lotus Pavilion in the legends.

488
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,460
You are the legendary doctor who can save lives.

489
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,460
Doctor, I'm so dizzy.

490
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,860
I'm so dizzy.

491
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,060
Please help me.

492
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,060
Miss.

493
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,860
Although Li Shen Yi is not as beautiful as I thought,

494
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,660
he has the aura of a gentle breeze and a gentle moon.

495
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,060
He's very moving.

496
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,860
I've always admired people with great skills.

497
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,460
But you haven't treated me yet.

498
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,660
Miss.

499
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,860
You look so red.

500
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,260
You are as deep as a red bell.

501
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,660
How are you feeling?

502
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,260
I'm fine.

503
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,660
I'm probably too anxious to run after my nephew.

504
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,260
That's why I'm dizzy.

505
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,460
Li Shen Yi, have you seen him?

506
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,260
Oh, I forgot to introduce myself.

507
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,060
I'm He Xiao Hui, the owner of the Lotus Pavilion.

508
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,460
My little sister, He Xiao Feng.

509
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,260
My nephew is a very well-known person.

510
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,260
He's very well-known.

511
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,260
He's not a young man.

512
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,260
He's very naughty.

513
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,860
He refused to marry me and ran away from home.

514
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,660
He made me worry about him.

515
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,660
So that's what he looks like.

516
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,660
Miss He,

517
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:38,260
Mr. Fang said he was going to the north to see you.

518
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,260
Miss He,

519
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,260
you should be able to catch up with him now.

520
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,060
Oh.

521
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,660
Shen Yi,

522
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,460
this is my special Phoenix's heart.

523
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,460
If you want to see me,

524
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,460
you can light this heart and let me find you.

525
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,060
Good thing Li Shen Yi is angry.

526
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:24,860
How's it going?

527
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:29,980
Not bad.

528
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,600
in the process of piercing the

529
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,100
heart of everyone

530
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,100
Cl 저도

531
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,360
Why did you sister

532
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,640
die

533
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,900
Pal is good

534
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:42,780
dad

535
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,060
Lem감

536
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:44,760
less

537
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:45,640
ceo

538
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,520
Exactly

539
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,780
Like this

540
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:48,640
you

541
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:49,800
died

542
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,400
caldron

543
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,420
A

544
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,360
Died

545
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:55,940
Of course

546
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:56,660
so

547
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:57,820
different

548
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:58,780
You

549
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,280
You

550
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,960
It's a new place.

551
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,720
Honorable, you took the position ten years ago.

552
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,800
The Golden Abyss Alliance has conquered the martial arts world.

553
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,760
There's nothing you can't do.

554
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,640
But since you left the palace,

555
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,120
those so-called righteous sects

556
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,480
have been using their power to attack us.

557
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,960
We had to give up our old grudges.

558
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,280
Fortunately, Saintess Rui Zhi

559
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,000
led us to the Treasure Land

560
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,160
and rebuilt our grudges.

561
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,680
We've been waiting for you to return.

562
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

563
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,600
We're waiting for you to return.

564
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,440
I don't dare to be so arrogant.

565
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,640
All these years of business

566
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,560
has been waiting for you to leave the palace

567
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,760
and rebuild the power of the Golden Abyss Alliance.

568
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,480
Today, we finally got what we wanted.

569
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,280
It's a good thing.

570
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,280
I'm Ding Yun, the Thunder Division.

571
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,040
I'm the new head of the Golden Abyss Alliance.

572
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,800
I'm Wan Rishan, the Star Moon Division.

573
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,560
I'm the new head of the Golden Abyss Alliance.

574
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,640
Please have a look, Your Majesty.

575
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,200
So it's you two.

576
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:07,680
I've been

577
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:15,680
Your Majesty,

578
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,000
I'm Latest.

579
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,560
I don't know what they did wrong

580
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,200
ails you not.

581
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,880
During electronics and electricity,

582
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,480
instead of combating the north,

583
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,960
Grace and Nei fought each other.

584
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,760
I just managed to controls Guo mentioned

585
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,980
Jason and Yun

586
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,120
How can we know

587
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:53,960
not only the privatePer carefully

588
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,700
Your Majesty

589
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,300
I've been in seclusion for ten years.

590
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,740
I always remember some old things

591
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,420
and find it strange.

592
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,980
I hate betrayal the most in my life.

593
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,380
If I find out someone betrayed me,

594
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,420
the two mistakes in the Hall

595
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,140
will be the end.

596
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,620
Honorable Superior killed well.

597
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,500
If someone is not loyal to Honorable Superior,

598
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,100
I'll be the first to not spare him.

599
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,820
I'll be the first to not kill him.

600
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,620
Today is the day

601
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,940
that Honorable Superior returns to his home.

602
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,100
They are

603
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,860
the ones who wrote to him.

604
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,100
Honorable Superior,

605
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,980
this is the Holy Order of Golden Thread Embroidery.

606
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,220
I've been protecting you with my life

607
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,980
and never lost anything.

608
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:44,820
Today,

609
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,500
I'll return it to you.

610
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,800
Congratulations!

611
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,260
You reached the Holy Order,

612
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,720
Golden Thread Embroidery attacks the enemy in the battlefield!

613
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,180
We will be waiting for you tomorrow!

614
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,300
Honorable Superior,

615
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,380
I have something to report.

616
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,500
When you wereーいadded to Guanyin,

617
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,940
Yu Hongzhu was assistant to Court Lawyer.

618
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,500
If I hadn't protected you

619
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,180
and guarded you harboring some labors,

620
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,380
I would have crossed the border with the V schlim side

621
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,900
before,

622
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,780
There have been outsiders who have disturbed you.

623
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,820
Now,

624
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,620
the red bamboo has been taken away by Baichuan Courtyard.

625
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,780
I beg you to order

626
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,180
to send someone to kill the red bamboo

627
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,020
in case of a long night.

628
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,020
I also have something to report.

629
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,420
You need to announce the world about your departure.

630
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,460
First, let the righteous path be cold.

631
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,900
Second, let the old path be returned.

632
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,540
Boring.

633
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,580
Your Majesty.

634
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,740
I also sent someone to prepare a new book of thousands of people.

635
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,540
All the latest martial arts ranks are listed above.

636
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,020
Please have a look.

637
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,860
I have another good news.

638
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:02,740
Tell me.

639
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,620
Ten years ago,

640
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,940
you have been looking for

641
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,180
a spiritual medicine that can make martial arts great.

642
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,220
I have found it.

643
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,780
Here it is.

644
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:22,820
Well done.

645
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,420
Well done.

646
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,140
I should do it.

647
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,260
What else do you want me to do?

648
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,780
Jingyuan Alliance has been running well for the past ten years.

649
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,940
From today on,

650
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,300
the sacred girl will be in charge of the alliance.

651
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,500
Thank you, Your Majesty.

652
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,460
I am relieved to have you.

653
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,340
I will help you

654
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,340
to dominate the martial arts world

655
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,180
and rule the world.

656
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:22,240
wiped away

657
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,260
Cun Shang

658
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,180
I've been waiting for you for ten years.

659
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,260
I finally didn't lose to him.

660
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,940
buffalo

661
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,700
calf

662
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,680
crocodile

663
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,140
it won't help

664
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,660
my lord

665
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,860
the way I had just amver

666
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,880
why not showing

667
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:16,500
don't dare to come in świat

668
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,300
back

669
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,220
you are so suitable

670
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:24,400
What I care about is what you and the Third Prince knew ten years ago.

671
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,800
Your Majesty is only interested in the five-way peak.

672
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,640
The other officials are not interested.

673
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,400
You are my personal bodyguard.

674
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,560
You and the four royal princes of the Yan State, the Prince of Yan, are under my watch.

675
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,500
Where are the three of them now?

676
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,840
Help me find out.

677
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:47,720
You four are born into my death and are going to build the Golden Agreement alliance together.

678
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,800
No matter what happens, you can't give up.

679
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,780
You can't let anyone else take the reins.

680
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,580
I will obey.

681
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:59,540
Your Majesty, you have used your weapons to kill Wan Ren Shan and Ding Yu.

682
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:04,860
In my opinion, your power has been restored to 60% ten years ago.

683
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:07,020
60%?

684
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:13,220
It seems that he really left me a lot of trouble.

685
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:18,100
Only he deserves to be the emperor of the emperor.

686
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,880
I fought him on the sea ten years ago.

687
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,480
I defeated him by half a move, but he died.

688
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,560
There is no other opponent in this world.

689
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,120
There are many new masters on the side of the Great Sage.

690
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,840
The first one is the Three Saints of the Eastern Camp.

691
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,120
The second one is the Heavenly Dragon, Yang Yun Chun.

692
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,520
The third one is the Blood Jade, the Immortal of the World, and the Demon Monk.

693
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,840
These three should all have some skills.

694
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,920
If you want to be a good servant, I can find out their whereabouts.

695
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:51,740
After Li Xiang Yi, there is no other opponent in this world.

696
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,580
The fish painting of the Guanyin Hammer?

697
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,100
That's right.

698
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,140
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

699
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:12,220
This Guanyin Hammer is a magical medicine made by the King of Bodhi and the Demon King, Qiong Ji.

700
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,540
It was only three times that year.

701
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,760
The first one was married by the King of Sword.

702
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,760
He saved the eldest son of the heart, Duan Jue, who died three days ago.

703
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,520
The second one was subdued by Qiu Wu Ya.

704
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,000
He has great power and has been the leader of the martial arts for more than ten years.

705
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,800
Now, the third one is on the list.

706
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,080
If the village head gets this medicine, he will have great power and will be rich.

707
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,200
Maybe he can break through the seventh level of the Bailang Mountain.

708
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,200
He can reach the eighth level of the Supreme Mirror.

709
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,200
The Guanyin Hammer is a magical medicine.

710
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,200
But it's a pity that it has great power and is rich.

711
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,860
Who can I find to get it?

712
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:47,860
Granny Xue, be careful and keep an eye on the village head.

713
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:51,860
By then, he will definitely go to get the magical medicine.

714
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,860
Yes.

715
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,860
Village head, village head.

716
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:07,860
From now on, you are the only one who is by Qiao's side.

717
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,520
Only you.

718
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:16,520
You can only have me by your side.

719
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,520
When we parted, you said you would find it hard to solve.

720
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,520
Only ten years of time can be spent.

721
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,520
Now, only one year has passed.

722
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,520
You are in a tight spot.

723
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,520
If you don't return to the old friends of the Fujian Temple,

724
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,520
you will seek help from everyone.

725
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,180
The monk is not very arrogant.

726
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,180
The village head is still young.

727
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,180
Why would he take advantage of Lord Yan?

728
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:45,180
Di Feicheng, where are you?

729
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,180
I told you.

730
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,180
I avoided my aunt's attack.

731
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,180
I was able to turn around and no one was there.

732
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,180
Fortunately, I was smart and knew you were here.

733
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,180
What were you burning?

734
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,180
It's not important.

735
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,840
You didn't say anything, did you?

736
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,840
Tell me what happened.

737
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,840
I will take care of you.

738
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,840
You ran away from home,

739
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,840
was cut off from your family,

740
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,840
and was thrown into the forest.

741
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,840
I'm afraid even the little girl next to you

742
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,840
was caught and taken back.

743
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,840
You are a homeless person.

744
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,840
Do you want to stay in my Lotus Pavilion?

745
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,840
I...

746
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,840
You can't say that.

747
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,840
We are helping each other.

748
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,500
We were born and raised together.

749
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,500
What kind of friendship is this?

750
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,500
People who are in the martial arts world

751
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,500
have to rely on friends.

752
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,500
I don't teach friends in the martial arts world.

753
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,500
You...

754
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,500
You look

755
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,500
casual and talkative.

756
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,500
You don't seem to have a temper.

757
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,500
Actually, you are cold

758
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,500
and no one wants to be close to you.

759
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,500
This is not good.

760
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,500
You are always alone.

761
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,500
You don't even have friends to eat and drink with.

762
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,160
How boring is this place?

763
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,160
Is this for you?

764
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,160
Today's food is not bad.

765
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,160
It's okay.

766
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,160
Next time you try

767
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,160
to dry the food,

768
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,160
and then put some sugar in it, it will be better.

769
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,160
You are still a true man.

770
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,160
Of course.

771
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,160
I didn't come here for nothing.

772
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,820
How is it?

773
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,820
You lack a master like me.

774
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,820
You can eat and fight.

775
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,820
You are handsome and a partner.

776
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,820
Isn't it a pleasure to work together?

777
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,820
Stop. Let's solve this case together.

778
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,820
I already made it clear last time.

779
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,820
I can't figure it out.

780
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,820
You really want to enter this Baichuan Hospital?

781
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,820
Of course.

782
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,820
My master is gone.

783
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,820
But I can't forget my promise to him.

784
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,820
Moreover, the Di Feisheng demon is still alive.

785
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,820
I will help my master to deal with him.

786
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,820
As a person,

787
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,820
you can't live in the expectations of others.

788
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,820
Maybe this Li Xiangyi

789
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,820
hasn't had such a big expectation for you.

790
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,820
I say, you

791
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,820
are good at everything.

792
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:12,820
You just love to make people cold.

793
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,820
I told you so much, I really treat you as a friend.

794
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,820
You...

795
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,820
How did you...

796
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,820
Sleep well.

797
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,820
Li Xiangyi doesn't remember these at all.

798
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,820
He won't go back.

799
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,820
Don't be too serious.

800
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,820
Silly boy.

801
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,820
Where is the car?

802
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,820
Li Tianhua!

803
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,820
You threw me off the road again!

804
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,820
You are awake.

805
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,820
You are awake.

806
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,820
You are awake.

807
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,820
You are awake.

808
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,820
You are awake.

809
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,820
You are awake.

810
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,820
You are awake.

811
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,820
You are awake.

812
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,820
You are awake.

813
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,820
You are awake.

814
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,820
You are awake.

815
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:52,820
You are awake.

816
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:54,820
You are awake.

817
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,820
You are awake.

818
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,480
You are awake.

819
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,480
You are awake.

820
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,480
You are awake.

821
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,480
You are awake.

822
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,480
You are awake.

823
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,480
You are awake.

824
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,480
You are awake.

825
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,480
You are awake.

826
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,480
You are awake.

827
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,480
You are awake.

828
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,480
You are awake.

829
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,480
You are awake.

830
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,480
You are awake.

831
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,480
You are awake.

832
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,140
You are awake.

833
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,140
You are awake.

834
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:32,140
You are awake.

835
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:34,140
You are awake.

836
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:36,140

You are awake.

849
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,800
You are awake.

850
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,800
