00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,890
This tea is called Xiangyunhong.

5
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:48,560
No need.

6
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,020
I'm not here for tea.

7
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,180
I just want to take a rest.

8
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,020
I'll serve you tea, Young Master.

9
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,820
I didn't mean it.

10
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,370
Wait.

11
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,160
It was my careless mistake.

12
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,300
It had nothing to do with Miss Qing'er here.

13
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,979
Can you not take this down?

14
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:16,100
I'm just following the rules.

15
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,560
Did the girls offend you, Young Master?

16
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,940
The girls are fine.

17
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,030
I have a question

18
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,430
for you though, Miss Bihuang.

19
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,820
Go ahead please, Young Master.

20
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,260
If the girls from the Girls' Mansion

21
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,410
make any mistake,

22
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:30,650
will they be punished?

23
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,990
We are fair in meting out rewards and punishments.

24
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:34,730
We only deduct some money from their salaries.

25
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,290
Then why are they so scared?

26
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,610
We are here to make money.

27
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,910
Of course we don't want our salary to be deducted.

28
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,420
Even so,

29
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,690
may I ask you a favor, Miss Bihuang?

30
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,460
If any mistake

31
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,820
is made by the girls serving us today,

32
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,100
I'll pay for their fine. Is that okay?

33
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:54,820
This may not be...

34
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,250
If the girls are fearful,

35
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,660
the guests won't be at ease, either.

36
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,340
If you can't make this call, Miss Bihuang,

37
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,190
I'll go talk to Yu Louchun myself.

38
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:02,810
Wait.

39
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,820
Since it's your request, Young Master Fang,

40
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,170
I dare not disobey.

41
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,270
I'm the steward of the Girls' Mansion.

42
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,100
I hereby make the call to skip today's inspection.

43
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,100
I'll report it to Master later.

44
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,070
Yes.

45
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:16,670
Thank you.

46
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,110
I thought the son of the Minister of Revenue

47
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,780
must be a good-for-nothing second generation.

48
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,910
I was wrong.

49
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,270
I never liked tea,

50
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,870
but there's no wine here.

51
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,140
So I'll drink tea instead of wine,

52
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,040
and propose three toasts to you.

53

I thought it was a big deal.

67
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,520
But people are saying that he bailed on your marriage.

68
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,470
And they say you scared him away because you are eight feet tall,

69
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,610
and you have a waist the size of a huge bucket.

70

What?

71
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,200
He bailed on me?

72
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,140
I'm the one who wants to get out of it, okay?

73
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,220
By the way,

where did Fang Duobing go?

75

He seems to have gone to the martial world.

It's all because of you! You had to come to the martial world.

87
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,000
It's because of you that I was abducted here as a servant.

Don't you think it's a bit like Yuanbao Villa?

Please, make yourselves at home and take a seat.

I'm very grateful.

Since it's short notice,

120
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,780
there must be something urgent.

I do have a presumptuous request.

122
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,740
Young masters, please tell me

123
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:49,140
who killed my best friend, Jin Mantang.

124
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,510
So this is why

125
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,000
you invited us here.

126
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,130
May I ask, Mr. Yu,

127
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,960
were you close to Jin Mantang?

128
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,740
I built this Jinyu Mansion

129
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,820
specially for Jin.

130
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:08,510
I used to invite him here every year for Mountains Red.

131
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,400
Jin and I were best friends, and we confided everything to each other.

132
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,580
Since the murderer has been arrested,

133
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,900
Mr. Yu, you could have inquired Baichuan Court about it.

134
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,190
Why come to us?

135
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,940
Jin was a cautious person.

136
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,140
He wouldn't have been murdered by some greedy unnamable thief.

137
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,340
I know there's more to it.

138
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,260
You two were there.

139
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,170
Could you please tell me what happened exactly?

140
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:32,790
Sorry.

141
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,110
Mr. Yu, there's no need to overthink.

142
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,780
There's nothing behind it.

143
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,450
You don't believe my friendship with Jin?

144
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,460
It's not that.

145
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,020
Master Yu.

146
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:44,400
You worry too much.

147
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,590
It's just

148
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,810
when the murderer killed Master Jin,

149
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,180
he simply did it for the opal skull.

150
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,690
So I did overthink.

151
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,040
However,

152
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,270
something strange happened after the murder.

153
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,700
But I don't know if I should tell you about that.

154
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,770
What strange thing?

155
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:07,940
Feel free to tell me.

156
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,260
When I was in Yuanbao Villa,

157
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,480
I lost a treasure.

158
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,140
The treasure

159
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,530
seems to have been placed together with the opal skull.

160
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:17,210
Fang Duobing.

161
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,070
You saw it too, right?

162
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,600
That treasure is as thin as a cicada's wings,

163
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:23,740
and it's crystal clear.

164
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,150
It's more like an...

165
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:26,280
Ice shard?

166
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,580
From my point of view,

167
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,800
it's more like a jade bamboo leaf.

168
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,200
So you've seen it too, Mr. Yu?

169
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,890
I was just guessing.

170
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,960
Do you know who the treasure thief is?

171
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:44,980
No clue at all.

172
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,460
But Baichuan Court suspects that

173
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,880
Jin Mantang was not from the Central Plains.

174
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,770
We suspect the robber is from another sect.

175
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,420
Do you know where he was from, Mr. Yu?

176
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,590
Jin was not from the Central Plains?

177
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,980
This is also the first time I've heard about it.

178
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,440
There must be some misunderstanding.

179
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,420
I see you have a high-bridged nose

180
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,450
and deep eye sockets.

181
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,190
I thought you are also a person of mixed blood.

182
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,570
I'm a native of Central Plains.

183
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,510
It's getting late.

184
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,210
I'm going to make preparations for Mountains Red.

185
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,310
Pardon me,

186
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,640
young masters.

187
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,830
Not only does he know about ice shards,

188
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,530
but he also has an ice shard himself.

189
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,300
Why don't we visit the Girls' Mansion

190
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,100
in the name of moon-viewing tonight,

191
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,880
and find out where the secret is hidden?

192
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:53,090
[Jinyu Mansion]

193
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,580
Physician Li. Young Master Fang.

194
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,300
The bell of noon has rung.

195
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,260
How about I take you back to your rooms for a rest?

196
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,950
The bell doesn't sound close.

197
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,460
You have good hearing, Physician Li.

198
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,160
This is the bell from an ancient temple.

199
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,340
It's about two or three hills away from here.

200
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,100
But

201
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,520
fortunately, it's tranquil around here.

202
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,130
We usually arrange our schedule according to the bell.

203
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,620
The bells in other temples ring twice, at dawn and dusk.

204
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,530
I've never heard the bell of noon.

205
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,500
This temple believes in asceticism.

206
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,950
So, the bell rings three times, at 5 a.m.,

207
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,940
noon, and midnight, every day.

208
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,540
I won't bother you then, Miss Bihuang.

209
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,630
We'll walk around.

210
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:20,760
Okay.

211
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,260
Okay.

212
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,980
You came up from down the mountain.

213
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,650
Have you heard about what happened on Sigu Tea Party?

214
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,470
It's all over the martial world.

215
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,450
I didn't expect Li Xiangyi to be such a person.

216
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,460
I knew it long ago.

217
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,860
I was there

218
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,400
when the incident took place that day.

219
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,950
I happened to be passing by,

220
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,180
and I wanted to save Shan Gudao.

221
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,430
But after 100 rounds,

222
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,970
I made one tiny mistake,

223
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,490
and Li Xiangyi took the chance

224
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,860
to kill Shan Gudao at one swing.

225
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,610
So why did he let you go?

226
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,780
I saved Li Xiangyi's life once.

227
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,700
Otherwise, he would have killed me too.

228
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,590
It's said that Mr. Yu invited an extraordinary man.

229
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,700
I didn't expect that

230
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,320
you were invited here

231
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,450
because you're good at talking nonsense, Master Dongfang.

232
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,410
Fang.

233
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,490
What do you mean?

234
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,980
Why don't you go a few rounds with me?

235
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,460
Bring it on.

236
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,340
I'm not afraid of you.

237

Fang Xiaobao.

238
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,100
Calm down.

239
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:16,940
What's the rush?

240
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,900
Maybe Dongfang here

241
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,750
really saved Li Xiangyi's life.

242
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,610
What are you talking about?

243
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,140
May I ask you, Dongfang,

244
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,220
was there any enemy that Li Xiangyi couldn't beat

245
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,630
when he was young?

246
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:31,800
Yes.

247
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,740
The thing is

248
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,720
maybe when that enemy

249
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,580
was forcing Li Xiangyi to kneel and beg for mercy,

250
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,330
Dongfang here defended the weak

251
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,250
and helped Li Xiangyi

252
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:43,160
by kowtowing 18 times instead of him,

253
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,790
and saved his life in the end.

254

Li Lianhua.

255
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,110
You two are ganging up on me.

256
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,310
I dare not.

257

Dongfang.

258
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,220
They were just kidding.

259
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:53,980
Don't take it seriously.

Please follow me to Qinhong Hall.

[Qinhong Hall]

264
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,340
The Mountains Red banquet will be full of beautiful women.

265
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,820
We are lucky today.

267
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,060
You are a scholar after all.

268

-What?/N-Young Master Fang.

269
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,010
It's fun to have beautiful women around while studying.

270
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,280
One side is honor and fame.

271
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,530
The other side is romantic encounters.

272
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,450
You are all here.

273
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,570
I admire all of you.

274
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,020
It's my honor to have invited all of you here.

275
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,270
Everyone,

276
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,180
please be seated.

277
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,700
The wine on the table in front of you

278
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,170
is made from the water of the ice spring on Fragrant Mountain.

279
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:00,710
It has been stored for 100 years.

280
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,780
We only open one jar on this day every year.

281
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,970
Mountains Red is the name of the wine.

282
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,880
Mountains Red is a wine's name?

283
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,050
Yes.

284
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,250
There's nothing more to it?

285
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,420
So the century-old fine wine is not good enough?

286
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,180
What else do you want?

287
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,060
Great wine.

288
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,590
My gift can lift our spirits of wine drinking.

289
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,100
This ice drinking cup is made from the ice crystal on Snow Mountain.

290
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,820
It's a perfect match for the fine wine of Mountains Red.

291
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,690
It's not to be missed.

292
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,540
When the leaves turn red on a mountain, two people are missing each other.

293
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,700
The third time I saw her made me fall in love on the fourth encounter.

294

The curtain opens, and the dream awakens.

295
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,490
One more drink, and I'll write a poem for nothing.

296
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,940
The poem is full of regrets.

297
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,480
It seems that you love women more than wine, Young Master Shi.

298
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:09,710
What a coincidence.

299
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,250
I also wrote a poem just now

300
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,580
since I was in the mood.

301

[Aroma]

302
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,750
No wonder they say

303
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,510
you, one-word poet Li Yifu, refused to become an official after passing the imperial exam,

304
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,130
and chose to be a carefree man in the martial world.

305
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,970
Using this one word, "Aroma",

306
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,940
you managed to visualize the poem line "Filled and tossed in the jade bowl like opals shine".

307
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,740
So, Physician Li and Young Master Fang,

308
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,650
you really didn't bring any gifts?

309
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,220
Young Master Fang's gift

310
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,510
is to help you

311
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,570
look for the real Mountains Red.

312
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,940
The real Mountains Red

313
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,340
should be around us.

314
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,480
Please listen carefully.

315
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,380
It's foggy and misty here in the hall.

316
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,880
Now the wind is blowing,

317
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,890
but the mist in the hall still hasn't faded.

318
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,820
If I'm not mistaken, Mr. Yu,

319
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,890
the mist behind you is not real, right?

320
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,260
Young Master Fang, you're really smart.

321
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,370
The mist was embroidered by the girls.

322
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,490
It's Jinyun gauze made of ice silk.

323
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,420
Young Master Fang, you saw through the mystery,

324
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,080
so I won't hide my inadequacy anymore.

325

00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,880
Let Mountains Red begin.

327
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,060
Yes.

328
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,250
So this is the real Mountains Red.

329
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,870
The item each of you picked at the mountain gate

330
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,150
belongs to one of the girls here.

331

You've chosen your own match.

00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,100
I shall return this item to you, Miss.

338
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,790
[Yushi, from the Girls' Mansion]

339
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,820
[Yuyan, from the Girls' Mansion]

340
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,590
[Chilong, from the Girls' Mansion]

341
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,010
[Xifei, from the Girls' Mansion]

342
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,820
My name is Xifei.

343
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,680
We're destined to meet today, Physician Li.

344
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,460
I want to give you this hibiscus syriacus flower as a gift in return.

345
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:40,780
May you

346
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,100
have girls as beautiful as the flower by your side every day.

347
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,450
It seems that everyone who comes to the Girls' Mansion

348
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,230
will have beautiful women by their side in the future.

349
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,980
This is the rule of Mountains Red.

350
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,100
It's for good luck.

351
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:09,500
Well,

352
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,220
I was too embarrassed to keep the chicken foot.

353
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,260
So I left it outside.

354
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,040
Can I not return it to you?

355
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,329
You're a swordsman in the martial world.

356
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:20,770
It's fine if you lost it.

357
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,780
What can I do?

358
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,140
Mr. Yu.

359
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,670
This item belongs to Miss Bihuang, right?

360
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,619
Why did you arrange someone else for me?

361
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,260
Please forgive me, Master Dongfang.

362
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,980
I'm the steward of the Girls' Mansion.

363
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,740
There are many chores to do for Mountains Red.

364
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:39,690
I didn't want you to feel neglected,

365
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,050
so I asked Binrong to take my place.

366
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,820
Don't worry, Dongfang.

367
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,150
Others may not know it, but don't you?

368
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,720
You'll have plenty of time

369
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,420
after Mountains Red is over.

370
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,680
Okay.

371
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,520
Bihuang.

372
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,300
You heard that too, right?

373
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,320
Everyone.

374
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,740
Besides wine,

375
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,790
there's a must-taste delicacy at Mountains Red.

376
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,090
This fish soup is called Late Spring Nowhere to be Found.

377
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,800
It's made from white fish of the North Sea brewed for days.

378
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,060
It's very nutritious.

379
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,300
It's not available at every Mountains Red.

380
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,170
You're all lucky.

381
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:27,920
Miss Xifei.

382
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:28,920
I can do it myself.

383
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,040
Qing'er.

384
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:40,850
It's okay.

385
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,670
I don't like soup anyway.

386
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,840
It's good I don't have to eat it.

387
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,260
Young Master Fang.

388
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,740
If you don't eat it,

389
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,140
it means I didn't serve you well.

390
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,670
I'll have to punish myself.

391
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,180
Someone.

392
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,130
Serve Young Master Fang another bowl.

393
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,140
Physician Li, what do you think of the soup?

394
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,900
The soup is really good.

395
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,780
But besides Mr. Yu,

396
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,330
no one else here needs supplements, right?

397
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,920
Mr. Yu's Jade Bone Skill is invincible.

398
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,700
What nonsense are you talking about, quack?

399
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,840
Who do you think you're talking to?

400
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,460
This is not a big deal.

401
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,870
It's just that there's some deficiency in your gallbladder, Mr. Yu.

402
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,620
Otherwise,

403
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,380
why would you always bring a bodyguard?

404
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,000
The one standing next to me is Xin Jue.

405
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,250
He's the guard of the Girls' Mansion.

406
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,520
[Girls' Mansion Guard: Xin Jue]

407
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,380
He never leaves my side

408
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,700
because there are too many women in the Girls' Mansion.

409
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,050
It'll be troublesome

410
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,480
if I walk around willfully.

411
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,980
I see.

412
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,380
I'm sorry if I offended you.

413
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:03,130
Mr. Yu, you really take good care of the girls.

414
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,470
[Dongpin, from the Girls' Mansion]

415
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:06,980
These girls are only for serving us

416
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,680
when I drink or write poems with friends.

417
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,540
What I'm worried about is

418
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:15,410
the guards may be disturbed.

419
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,430
Mr. Yu, you're belittling yourself.

420
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,740
The girls in the Girls' Mansion

421
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,460
are only here for money.

422
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,220
Whether it's master or servant,

423
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,590
you have to show some mercy.

424
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,120
If you don't treat people like people, Mr. Yu,

425
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,540
in others' eyes,

426
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,710
you'll be just a living wallet.

427
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,710
Isn't that belittling yourself?

428
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,950
I see what you mean, Young Master Fang.

429
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,270
It's my turn to offer my gift.

430
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,500
A few months ago,

431
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,090
you sent me a jade drum and an exotic dance score

432
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,540
called Thunder, Murong.

433
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,400
This dance is mysterious and hard to learn.

434
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,800
Even Chilong, the girl who's best at dancing in Girls' Mansion,

435
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,100
couldn't master it.

436
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,790
Today, Murong

437
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,730
will perform the Thunder dance for you

438
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,010
as an eye-opening show.

439
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:15,510
It'll be disrespectful if I refuse.

440
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,490
Please help me with the entertainment, Miss Chilong.

441
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:22,850
Please present the jade drum.

442

[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

444
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,140
Here, Physician Li.

445
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:51,940
Please.

446
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:52,780
Thank you.

447
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:49,950
Bravo!

448
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,130
Bravo!

449
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,860
What a magnificent Thunder dance.

450
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,130
It's like I had a beautiful dream just now.

451
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:09,100
You all must feel the same.

452
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:12,270
Since you've drunk quite a lot,

453
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,940
please go back to your rooms and rest.

454
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,630
Thank you, Master Yu.

455
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,750
Physician Li, let's go back to your room.

456
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,740
Miss Bihuang.

457
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,170
Please don't turn me down.

458
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,960
May I?

459
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,560
Bihuang.

460
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,360
Go if you want.

461
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:39,550
Master.

462
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:40,950
I can't obey.

463
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,150
I only have you in my heart, Master.

464
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,200
I will never be with anyone else.

465
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,400
It's God's will. Do whatever you want.

466
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:49,860
Bihuang.

467
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,510
You're the steward.

468
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,010
Don't break the rules.

469
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:54,770
I know I shouldn't be like this.

470
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,070
But I'm already in love with you, Master.

471
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,460
Even if I have to be punished,

472
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,460
I wouldn't want to do anything against my will.

473
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,900
I know you've been here for a long time.

474
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,190
You have some savings,

475
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,370
so you're not afraid of your salary being deducted.

476
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:08,200
I'll punish you another way.

477
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,260
Today, we have a lot of guests here.

478
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:15,090
I'll punish you to dance on the Zhaixing Stage to entertain us.

479
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,490
You can't leave the stage until dawn.

480
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,180
Mr. Yu.

481
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,310
What's wrong with Bihuang having feelings for you?

482
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,720
Why does she have to be punished?

483
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,260
Young Master Fang.

484
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,940
I'm Master's servant.

485
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,440
Please say no more, Young Master Fang.

486
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,150
This...

487
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,200
I accept the punishment.

488
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:39,670
-Dongfang!/N-Hey, you…

489

Sorry that

490
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,440
I ruined your mood.

491
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:43,700
But

492
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:46,600
you seem tired, Young Master Fang.

493
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,220
Let Miss Qing'er and Binrong

494
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,370
chat with you to relieve your boredom. How about that?

495
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:53,760
Good!

496
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,300
This is good too.

497
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,790
No, I don't want to.

498
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,370
Young Master Fang needs to see me.

499
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,500
Look at him.

500
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,370
Don't make it hard for him.

501
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,640
Miss Qing'er already has a date with me.

502
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,920
That's more like it.

503
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,480
You come to Mountains Red for fun,

504
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,310
not for asceticism.

505
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,910
Young Master Fang, you got it straight right on time.

506
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,780
What about me?

507
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:21,460
I'll gift you lots of treasures tomorrow.

508
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,740
Have a good rest tonight.

509
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,050
Everyone.

510
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:30,640
Let's meet at Guanri Pavilion tomorrow morning

511
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:33,740
and enjoy the sunrise splendor on Fragrant Mountain together.

512
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:39,760
Please go back to your rooms and rest tonight.

513
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,770
Young Master Fang.

514
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,550
I'll take Physician Li back to his room.

515
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:47,990
Don't forget.

516
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:49,220
The moon-viewing.

517
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:55,680
I'll wait for you!

518
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,240
[Girls' Mansion]

519
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,610
Physician Li, are you trying to avoid me?

520
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:23,240
No.

521
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:24,630
What's going on?

522
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,620
I was drunk just now.

523
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,860
And now I'm back in my room.

524
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,860
Thank you for sending me back, Miss Xifei.

525
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,910
I know you're not a frivolous person, Physician Li.

526
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,710
But I truly admire you.

527
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,540
Since you don't like to get intimate,

528
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,060
I can only kiss with my finger instead of your lips

529
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,200
to express my love.

530
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,620
I'll leave you alone tonight.

531
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,800
Only the moon above the yard is romanticizing.

532
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,150
It still shines on fallen blossoms for separated lovers.

533
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:51,470
Physician Li.

534
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:52,480
Have a good dream.

535
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:53,950
Okay.

536
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,730
I suddenly remembered

537
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,440
someone is waiting for me outside for moon-viewing.

538
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,090
How about this?

539
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,670
Miss Xifei, you can sleep in this bedroom.

540
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,740
I'll sleep in the lobby.

541
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:02,820
I won't disturb you.

542
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,530
Pour me a glass of water.

543
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,060
The teapot is over there.

544
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,360
I've worked for a whole day. I didn't drink any water.

545
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:39,910
There's also dessert over there.

546
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:40,860
Bring it to me too.

547
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,100
Please.

548
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,350
Why are you staring at me?

549
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,550
Don't think about things you shouldn't.

550
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:10,250
I...

551
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,770
Miss Qing'er.

552
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,500
I sincerely advise you

553
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:17,400
to change your career.

554
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,490
Change my career?

555
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,000
You have no talent

556
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:20,890
and you are clumsy.

557
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,390
You always pout and get angry.

558
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,670
Compared with other girls,

559
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,020
you're a far cry from them.

560
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,230
So I advise you to leave here as soon as possible.

561
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,170
Why do you have to be fearful here all day?

562
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,570
Do you think I'm a prostitute?

563
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,860
Do you think I'm here to prostitute myself?

564
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,740
Aren't you?

565
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,480
I would have left if I could.

566
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,900
The girls here would also have left.

567
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,940
Aren't you here for money?

568
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,030
That's Bihuang's lie to tell outsiders like you.

569
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,100
All the girls

570
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,300
were kidnapped or abducted here.

571
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,670
Didn't they say there's no physical punishment,

572
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,070
and they only deduct your salary if you make a mistake?

573
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,460
You will die if your salary is deducted to zero.

574
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,860
Yu Louchun does pay us every day,

575
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,340
but everyday food and clothing here cost money.

576
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:59,350
Once you make a mistake, you'll lose a lot of money.

577
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,620
If you don't have enough money, you'll either starve or freeze.

578
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,460
If you owe too much money,

579
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,530
you'll be sold to the guards outside to get the debt paid.

580
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,390
I didn't expect Girls' Mansion

581
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,460
to be such a place.

582
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:16,650
Such a place?

583
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,330
People from the martial world like you

584
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,660
still can't wait to come here every year.

585
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,020
I...

586
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,150
Disgusting.

587
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,430
Where are you from, Miss, if you don't mind?

588
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,160
Why were you abducted here?

589
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,610
I'm from the capital.

590
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,390
My family is poor.

591
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,170
We couldn't afford fish or meat.

592
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,710
We could only eat rice to appease our hunger.

593
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,080
Two months ago, when I was watching juggling,

594
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,300
I got abducted here for no reason.

595
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,750
Why did you lie?

596
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,820
You wouldn't be able to afford rice if you are truly poor.

597
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,010
Also, you don't have calluses on your hands.

598
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,440
You're obviously from a rich family.

599
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:49,070
I didn't want to tell you, okay?

600
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:51,210
Anyway, that day, I got a sack over my head,

601
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,420
and I passed out over a sweet fragrance.

602
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,370
I have been brought to this hellhole when I woke up.

603
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,560
So you were drugged.

604
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,820
That makes more sense.

605
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,430
Don't you like to knock around the martial world?

606
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,790
Go and defeat the guards now.

607
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,670
Lower the suspension bridge,

608
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,620
and help me out.

609
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,100
Are you really going?

610
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,100
If what you said is true,

611
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,750
I will seek justice for you.

612
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,700
If you want to go, hurry up.

613
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,480
Yu Louchun's residence is on the summit of Kanyun Peak.

614
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:25,860
You can't find him if you're there late.

615
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,500
Yu Louchun!

616
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,310
Guard Xin.

617
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,780
I need to talk to your master.

618
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,900
Send me up.

619
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,420
Outsiders are not allowed to enter Master's residence.

620
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:56,650
You won't be able to spin it.

621
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,590
This spin is really heavy.

622
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,160
It seems that you have extraordinary power skills.

623
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,140
You're quite strong.

624
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,620
It's all for serving Master.

625
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,190
How many treasures do you think are hidden up there?

626
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,360
It's a rude question to ask, distinguished guest.

627
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,940
I'm worried about your master.

628
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,300
I'm afraid that since he has done too many bad things,

629
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:29,910
the ghost would come to haunt him in the midnight.

630
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:30,720
Forget it.

631
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,620
There's no use talking to you.

632
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,250
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

633
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:40,310
You are not going to watch here all night alone, are you?

634
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:45,830
Don't bother to worry about me, distinguished guest.

635
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,260
The bell of midnight has rung.

636
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,880
Everyone in the Girls' Mansion will sleep.

637
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,040
I'm no exception.

638
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,500
Please leave, distinguished guest.

639
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,380
Yu Louchun, you monster.

640
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,000
I'll figure it out tomorrow

641
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,920
and send him to Baichuan Court for trial.

642
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:36,510
How did it go?

643
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,140
I was too late.

644
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,240
He has returned to his residence.

645
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,260
But don't worry.

646
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,130
I'll get even with him tomorrow.

647
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,660
Tomorrow?

648
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,620
I even left you half a cake.

649
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,000
Miss.

650
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,350
You really have a strong appetite.

651
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,570
It's rare that I don't have to pay

652
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,460
for the stuff in this room.

653
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,550
Of course I need to get myself full.

654
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,090
Why did you use all the cups?

655
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,800
So many questions.

656
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:09,400
By the way,

657
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,300
has Li Lianhua dropped by?

658
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:14,670
It's already midnight.

659
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:15,770
Why hasn't he come yet?

660
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:18,679
Fang Duobing.

661
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:19,830
Tell me the truth.

662
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:22,980
Did you come to the martial world because

663
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:23,960
you were scared of someone and you wanted to avoid her?

664
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:25,780
I've never been scared of anyone.

665
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:28,429
Maybe you were.

666
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,400
And it was a woman.

667
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:30,510
A woman?

668
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,389
It's more like two women.

669
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:35,409
Two?

670
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,860
You were quite occupied, weren't you?

671
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,120
One is my mother,

672
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,429
and the other is my aunt.

673
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:43,929
So tough.

674
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,620
Actually, I didn't mean to

675
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,780
lie about my background.

676
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,290
But you'll know in the future.

677
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,540
You helped me out today.

678
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,469
I'll keep that in mind.

679
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:57,949
As long as you help me get out of here,

680
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:59,560
I'll let bygones be bygones.

681
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,050
By the way, tomorrow, you...

682
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:06,220
Fang Duobing, I was talking to you.

683
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,910
I knew you are unreliable.

684
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,140
It's rare that no one is watching tonight.

685
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,910
I'll just run away by myself.

686
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,370
Why did I suddenly fall asleep?

687
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:24,180
[Flowing Emotions, Light Dreams]

688
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:35,530
Gals before pals!

689
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:37,590
Fang Xiaobao.

690
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,260
Why are you so fussy

691
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,180
early in the morning?

692
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,190
You got a beautiful lady in your arms,

693
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,670
so you forgot about our important moon-viewing date.

694
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,860
Isn't that gals before pals?

695
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,110
I wanted to lie down for a while and go find you later.

696
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:47,590
But I didn't expect that

697
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,810
I'd fall asleep.

698
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:49,750
Last night,

699
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,540
I slept in the lobby.

700
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,840
Miss Xifei slept in the bedroom.

701
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:54,800
You were being paranoid, weren't you?

702
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,320
Come here.

703
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,340
Did you secretly

704
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,870
visit the Girls' Mansion yourself last night?

705
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:04,450
I... I waited for you all night,

706
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,390
but you didn't show up.

707
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,900
But you know what?

708
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:11,460
That Yu Louchun is not a good person.

709
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,530
He didn't hire any girls here.

710
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:15,800
They were abducted.

711
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,690
You can tell?

712
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,300
Think about it.

713
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:19,350
All these years,

714
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,980
no one knows where the Girls' Mansion is.

715
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,460
If they were hired,

716
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,300
and they could quit freely,

717
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,420
the information would have already leaked long ago.

718
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,540
Yu Louchun

719
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,540
built his residence on the summit of Kanyun Peak.

720
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,850
He doesn't allow outsiders to enter.

721
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,720
He must be afraid that someone would come to seek revenge.

722
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:35,090
I guess the ice shard is hidden there as well.

723
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,080
Physician Li.

724
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,630
That makes sense.

725
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,370
Young Master Fang, you're here.

726
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,260
You two are going to Guanri Pavilion.

727
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,930
I've prepared a cloak for Physician Li.

728
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,460
Young Master Fang,

729
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:46,750
didn't Qing'er prepare a cloak for you?

730
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,140
Early in the morning, she...

731
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,700
I didn't wake her up because she was sleeping so soundly.

732
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,840
I'll get one for you, Young Master Fang.

733
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:54,610
Thank you.

734
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,620
Guanri Pavilion is outside the Girls' Mansion and

735
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,500
by the guards' camp.

736
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,180
It's inconvenient for us girls to accompany you there.

737
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,100
Don't catch a cold on the way, young masters.

738
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:03,890
Thank you, Miss Xifei.

739
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:11,450
Let's go.

740
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,780
The red leaves and Fragrant Mountain reflect each other's color.

741
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:35,920
This...

742
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,580
The scenery is beautiful,

743
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:39,990
and the vibe is even more enjoyable.

744
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,690
You have fond memories of last night, Shi.

745
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,460
Sadly, I slept too soundly last night.

746
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:47,890
Lu.

747
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,550
You love drinking.

748
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:52,500
Did the wine make you sleep all night till dawn?

749
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,790
Mountains Red goes to your head easily.

750
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,870
Of course I slept soundly since I drank a lot.

751
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,640
Fine.

752
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,870
You are all gentlemen.

753
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,190
You only sleep and enjoy the scenery.

754
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:04,920
I'll get to know the girls more myself today.

755
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,290
I advise you

756
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,990
not to approach the girls inappropriately.

757
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,700
They were all abducted and imprisoned here.

758
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,070
They are not here willingly.

759
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,980
Didn't they say they paid big money to hire them?

760
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,370
I'm afraid the big money

761
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:17,580
has all gone in the pocket of human traffickers.

762
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,060
But I heard that these girls

763
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,330
earn quite a lot of money here.

764
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,310
I don't think they are mistreated.

765
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,390
Dongfang.

766
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,650
How about I give you 10,000 taels of silver

767
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,900
and sell you to the far north as a prostitute?

768
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,610
Hey, you...

769
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,260
Just wait for Yu Louchun to be here and we can ask him.

770
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,930
If what Young Master Fang said is true,

771
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,620
I won't let him get away with this.

772
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,020
What is that?

773
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,100
Isn't this Yu Louchun's thumb ring?

774
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,260
Could it be...

775
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,550
The blood hasn't coagulated.

776
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,540
It should be cut off not long ago.

777
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,110
Why is Yu Louchun's hand here?

778
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:55,990
Where is he?

779
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,100
Let's go check Yu Louchun's residence

780
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:01,970
and we'll know.

781
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:14,720
Where is Yu Louchun?

782
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,930
Of course Master is in his residence on the summit of the mountain.

783
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:17,980
Send us up.

784
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:20,560
Outsiders are not allowed to enter Master's residence.

785
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:23,330
Can your master go down the mountain on his own?

786
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,540
One can only take the rattan basket to go up and down Kanyun Peak.

787
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,200
I didn't see Master get down the mountain,

788
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:28,410
so of course he's up there.

789
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:29,340
What brought

790
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:30,850
you here?

791
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:31,930
We found that

792
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,560
your master's arm was cut off

793
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:34,890
and left by Guanri Pavilion.

794
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,490
You recognize this jade thumb ring, don't you?

795
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,390
How is that possible?

796
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,730
If you don't send us up,

797
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:42,860
it'll be hard to say

798
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,620
if your master is alive or dead.

799
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:46,260
Hurry up.

800
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,770
I'll summon the guards outside the courtyard to come in the Girls' Mansion

801
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:49,640
and send us up the mountain immediately.

802
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,230
I'm Xin Jue. I want to see you, Master.

803
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,240
Pardon me, Master.

804
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,530
Where's his stuff?

805
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,480
Why is it all gone?

806
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:32,470
What room is this?

807
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,530
This is Master's chamber for treasure storage.

808
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:36,500
But now it's empty.

809
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:46,270
Look.

810
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:47,880
The pattern on this silk cloth

811
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,370
is the same as that on the Yipin Tomb.

812
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,430
The cloth is from Nanying.

813
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,030
Could it be because of the ice shard again?

814
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,200
Or maybe it was for the treasure.

815
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:58,410
Say it.

816
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,080
Where were you last night?

817
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:02,440
Every guest was sleeping in their own room last night.

818
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,400
Where could they have been?

819
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,860
Of course we were sleeping and dreaming.

820
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,910
Where were you and the other guards last night, Guard Xin?

821
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,470
The guards couldn't have entered Girls' Mansion

822
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,780
without an order.

823
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,950
I also went to bed outside the courtyard at midnight last night.

824
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:13,130
The guards can testify.

825
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:17,020
So there's no suspect?

826
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:23,050
Young Master Fang.

827
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:26,020
Why did you come to the foot of Kanyun Peak in a hurry last night?

828
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:28,500
Your master abducted and imprisoned commoner girls here.

829
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:30,850
I was here to interrogate him as Baichuan Court's detective, of course.

830
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,570
But you secretly inquired yesterday

831
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,740
if there are treasures up the mountain.

832
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:35,980
It's not normal, is it?

833
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,150
What about you, Guard Xin?

834
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,110
The first thing you checked was the treasure when you rushed in.

835
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,870
It doesn't seem normal either, does it?

836
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:47,760
Guard Xin.

837
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:49,660
A leg of Master's was found outside.

838
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,860
There's a person hidden in the cave of the maple forest.

839
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,580
We've blocked him.

840
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:52,670
Tell the guards

841
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,540
to secure the suspension bridge.

842
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:54,400
Yes.

843
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:55,990
No one is allowed to leave.

844
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:07,250
If you don't come out, we'll set fire and smoke you out.
