00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Ask

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
After four thousand times

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Ask

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The most reluctant

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Is that moment

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Live in the world

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A thousand miles of madness

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who never wanders

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Who doesn't know the distance between the two worlds

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
On the edge of the world

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Live in the world

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Youthful and wild

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The young generation is not drunk like the sorrow

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
A journey into the dream

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Live in the world

00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000

00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Who never wanders

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Who doesn't know the distance between the two worlds

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
On the edge of the world

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Live in the world

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The young generation is not drunk like the sorrow

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
A journey into the dream

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Live in the world

00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
A Long Time No See

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Episode 16

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I've been out for so long this time.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Father must be very worried about me.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The police department is going to escort me back to the palace.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
See you, Princess.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So urgent to see me off.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Who are you sending me to?

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm going to send you.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The princess said she was going to leave.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I just sent it.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You and the prince's head will only be greedy.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Okay, I'm leaving now.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Don't worry about the runaway wedding.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I will feel wronged to ask for your favor with father.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The princess is very righteous.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Thank you very much.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Thank you for what?

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What's the difference between a few days early and a few days late for this wedding?

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's the same when you get married.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Just a few days later.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Otherwise?

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This is after all father's seven years of marriage.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm not in a hurry.

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I think you're a little stupid.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But you're kind.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You're a good husband.

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Well, be careful.

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Don't let others take care of you.

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm leaving.

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
See you, Princess.

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Bye.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Why is the prince so sad?

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The princess is so righteous and brave.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But others can't get a husband.

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's terrible.

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This runaway wedding was caught in the mountain.

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I think you should go home.

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
There are many enemies in the world.

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's better to be a carefree prince.

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Li Lianhua.

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Don't say that again, okay?

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Thank you for your kindness.

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You are princesses.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We're just handling cases.

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's not a merit.

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We had the idea of hiding the gold bricks.

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If it weren't for your suggestions,

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
we would have fallen into the hands of the bad guys.

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We will tell the White-Waist Courtyard and the Overwatch Department

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
to send the treasures of Yulou Village to compensate you.

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's enough to live a rich life.

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
If you can come to the car park after you get married,

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
tell us.

79
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
We will treat you with respect.

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You two have been apart for many years.

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's not easy to reunite.

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Go back and live a good life.

83
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Make money.

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
When we go to the big city,

85
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
be careful not to go bankrupt.

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's a deal.

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I heard Li Shengyi's son's voice.

88
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I thought it was a joke.

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I really admire the two of you.

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm so happy.

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I really admire the two of you.

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
This is the medicine and wine I've been hiding for many years.

93
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Seeing that you're weak,

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I want to give it to Li Shengyi.

95
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
We must make a big mistake when we meet again.

96
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Thank you, Brother Lu.

97
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I won't go.

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I won't go.

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I won't go.

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I won't go.

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I won't go.

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I won't go.

103
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I won't go.

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The female village is a place of life and death.

105
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It will be closed immediately.

106
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You must leave for the White-Waist Courtyard immediately.

107
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Sir, we can't go.

108
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We'll die if we leave.

109
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
We can't go.

110
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We'll die if we leave.

111
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Sir,

112
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
these guards refused to leave

113
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
because they were poisoned.

114
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Can you let me find a solution for them

115
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
for half a day?

116
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay.

117
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Let's take them here for now.

118
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
We'll seal the female village later.

119
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yes.

120
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The man is from a rural background.

121
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
He must find a place to worship the ancestors.

122
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We've found the ancestral hall of Golden Pagoda.

123
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But we've never seen the ancestral hall of Yuelechun.

124
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I think the formula for the antidote

125
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
is the same as the ancestral hall.

126
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Mr. Fang,

127
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
can I have a word with you?

128
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Go ahead.

129
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'll ask about the ancestral hall.

130
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Let's go over there.

131
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
When will they give us the antidote?

132
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Mr. Fang,

133
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
you're the nephew of Shan Gu Dao?

134
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yes.

135
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That's good.

136
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I saved you

137
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
under the thunder and fire of the Li's Mansion.

138
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm grateful.

139
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
But I have a favor to ask.

140
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I beg you to help me.

141
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's okay to say it.

142
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Many years ago,

143
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Shan Gu Dao was killed by a man

144
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
who brought a piece of Yun Iron from the sky

145
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
to the God's Valley.

146
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He said he wanted to give a armor to himself

147
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and a sword to Li Xiang Yi.

148
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But he died in the battle with the Golden Pagoda.

149
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's really hard to explain.

150
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Why?

151
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You may not know,

152
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
but the Yun Iron from the sky

153
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
is the most durable and softest thing.

154
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The God's Valley has only seen it once

155
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
in the hands of Shan Gu Dao for hundreds of years.

156
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's already a home.

157
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Except for the Li Xiang Yi,

158
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Wen Jing and Jian Bai,

159
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
who are all living in the Yun Iron,

160
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
there's nothing to be broken.

161
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I saw my father live in the city with my own eyes.

162
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
There's no problem.

163
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So I want to ask you,

164
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
when the death of Shan Gu Dao

165
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
happened,

166
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
did he wear this armor?

167
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Well...

168
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Only Li Xiang Yi's Wen Jing and Jian

169
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
can wear the armor of Shan Gu Dao.

170
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Isn't it just like what the ancient tea party said?

171
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The death of Shan Gu Dao is full of miracles.

172
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
My father has been talking about this for years.

173
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
He's always in a bad mood.

174
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So I came to ask Mr. Fang.

175
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
He didn't wear this armor.

176
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So that's it.

177
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That's great.

178
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That's great.

179
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Then I'll leave now.

180
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
In the future, if Mr. Fang comes to the God's Valley to find me,

181
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'll definitely help you.

182
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'll leave now.

183
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'll leave now.

184
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I heard that there's a armor on the stone mountain.

185
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm afraid it's not worth it.

186
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I heard that there's a armor on the stone mountain.

187
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But it's not worn by the people.

188
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
What's going on?

189
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Fang Xiao Bao.

190
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Why are you standing there?

191
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Let's go.

192
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We've found the ancestral hall.

193
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I asked Miss Xi Fei.

194
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
There should be a music hall

195
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
near the temple.

196
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's just a pavilion.

197
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Why didn't anyone take care of it

198
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
and let anyone come near?

199
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So many years.

200
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Miss Xi Fei has only seen one guest.

201
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That's the Golden Pavilion.

202
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What are you thinking about?

203
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The fog here is so heavy.

204
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's exactly the same as the first-class powder.

205
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
If I guess it right,

206
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
this is the solution.

207
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
We've succeeded.

208
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Let's go.

209
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Li Qian Hua.

210
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Li Qian Hua.

211
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Li Qian Hua.

212
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Fei!

213
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Even with that cold blood,

214
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
this chance is two hours away.

215
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm so tired.

216
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,520
Your internal force is Yang Zhou Man?

217
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,960
I'm familiar with this internal force.

218
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,960
Where did you learn it?

219
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,360
Tell me.

220
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,520
What's the name of your martial art?

221
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,240
That's incredible.

222
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,440
It's named after Yang Zhou Man.

223
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
Su Zhou Kui.

224
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,200
It's not Yang Zhou Man.

225
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,600
It's Su Zhou Kui.

226
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,040
I'll teach you next time.

227
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,040
What are you waiting for?

228
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,280
Call Li Dian Hua.

229
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Su Zhou Kui

230
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Su Zhou Kui

231
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Su Zhou Kui

232
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Su Zhou Kui

233
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Su Zhou Kui

234
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Su Zhou Kui

235
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Su Zhou Kui

236
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Su Zhou Kui

237
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Su Zhou Kui

238
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Su Zhou Kui

239
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Su Zhou Kui

240
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Su Zhou Kui

241
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Su Zhou Kui

242
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
What's going on with you two?

243
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Why are you here now?

244
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Here's the stuff.

245
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I've found it.

246
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Young Master, come on.

247
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
This is Li Dian Hua's antidote formula.

248
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Take it.

249
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Take a good look.

250
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Take it.

251
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
This is the account book of Yulou Village ten years ago.

252
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I've checked all these accounts.

253
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Ten years ago,

254
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
there were very few guests in Yulou Village.

255
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Except for this gold full of sugar,

256
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
there were only two people.

257
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
One is the four-faced Qing Zun of the Golden Abyss Alliance.

258
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And the other is the father of the imperial power.

259
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I guess these two people

260
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
should be the descendants of the men.

261
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
The four-faced Qing Zun of the Golden Abyss Alliance?

262
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
By the way,

263
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
it's also a famous sect in the martial arts world.

264
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's not surprising that you've heard of it.

265
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
But

266
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
the four-faced Qing Zun

267
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
has long died in this 188-room building.

268
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's your territory.

269
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The only clue now

270
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
is the owner of this imperial power.

271
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Look.

272
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Am I still the best?

273
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Fang Xiao Bao,

274
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
why are you staring?

275
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm not staring.

276
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I just think

277
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
it's good to have such a smart friend like you.

278
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Smart is right.

279
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Let's go.

280
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You two scared me to death.

281
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Hurry up.

282
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
This is the prescription.

283
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Please find a doctor

284
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
and prescribe a antidote for the guards.

285
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Don't worry, Young Master Fang.

286
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'll go back to the Four-Face Temple to report.

287
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I have to go back to the Four-Face Temple.

288
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'll go with you.

289
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I have to report to the Four-Face Temple.

290
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I have something important to do.

291
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Please take care of

292
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
the report for me.

293
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What are the Golden Thread Prince and the South Eagle working on?

294
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
If you can figure it out,

295
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
there's still time.

296
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Perhaps the original version

297
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
can help you to reduce some penalty.

298
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:33,480
Okay then, you keep your

299
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,880
own business floor.

300
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,200
If it was really him, how could he be hurt by the Li's Mansion?

301
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,120
I'll save myself.

302
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,120
Are you okay?

303
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,720
I'm fine.

304
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,120
He was right behind you.

305
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,720
You really didn't notice?

306
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,120
No.

307
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,120
Luckily, you came in time.

308
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,720
I was really scared just now.

309
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,320
Show me how it is.

310
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,120
Is it serious?

311
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,920
Is there any tear?

312
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,120
Stop fooling around.

313
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,520
Miss Shi,

314
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,720
next,

315
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,920
we'll go to the local government office

316
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,520
to clean up the mess according to the old rules.

317
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,920
Let's go.

318
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,920
Let's go.

319
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,920
It's time to go.

320
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,320
Let's go find the assistant director.

321
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,520
Why did you have to avoid the White-Sail Courtyard?

322
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,920
You did a lot of evil things in the martial arts world.

323
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,320
If someone finds out,

324
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,920
it'll be a big trouble.

325
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,920
I'm not a bad person.

326
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,120
Sorry to trouble you.

327
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,120
Did I really guess wrong?

328
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,120
How could Li Lianhua be Li Xiangyi?

329
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,120
But how can Yang Zhongman explain it?

330
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,720
Di Feisheng, Li Xiangyi.

331
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,520
No.

332
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,720
I have to find out.

333
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,120
What are you doing?

334
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,320
Come on.

335
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,320
Let's drink.

336
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,120
Let's celebrate

337
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,920
the big case of breaking the house.

338
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,120
You're really good at talking

339
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,120
when you bring my wine to me.

340
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,720
I just want to drink with you

341
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,920
and chat with you.

342
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,920
What are you talking about?

343
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,920
Why would I talk to you about Yang Zhongman?

344
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,320
What Yang Zhongman?

345
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,920
You're always so arrogant.

346
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,520
Stop pretending to be confused.

347
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,520
It's the inner work that you taught me.

348
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,720
I'm not a fool.

349
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,920
I'm just a man.

350
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,120
I'm not a man.

351
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,120
I didn't teach you about inner work.

352
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,320
Let me tell you.

353
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,320
I have a lot of problems,

354
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,720
so I don't have much opportunities.

355
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,120
You can answer after you think it through.

356
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,720
If there's something you're hiding from me,

357
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,320
you'd better tell me today.

358
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,720
You mean the new house.

359
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,720
That reminds me,

360
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,520
what we said in the cave last time?

361
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,920
Stop talking nonsense, okay?

362
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,320
Why are there so many coincidences?

363
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,720
You're turning into a notebook.

364
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,520
Listen.

365
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,720
You and Yang Zhongman

366
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,120
also appeared at Yuanbao Villa

367
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,120
with Mr. Bai Yi.

368
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,120
Could it be...

369
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,120
Could it be...

370
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,120
Li Xiang Yi?

371
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,120
Li Xiang Yi?

372
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,120
What Li Xiang Yi?

373
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,120
Fang Xiao Bao.

374
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,120
If I were Li Xiang Yi,

375
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,120
how could I not know the White Stone of the Buddha?

376
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,120
Besides,

377
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,120
I let you practice hard every day.

378
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,120
You just think about these things.

379
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,120
What?

380
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,120
You don't believe me?

381
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,120
Do you know that

382
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,120
my father had a armor that was unparalleled?

383
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,120
It was made of a piece of cloud iron.

384
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,120
Cloud iron?

385
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,120
Junior Brother,

386
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,120
this is your first time to go down the mountain to practice.

387
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,120
The He family who searched the horse-riding road

388
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,120
was surrounded by the Feng Lin Three Gangs.

389
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,120
It's very dangerous.

390
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,120
Don't risk it anymore.

391
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,120
The Shao Shi Sword in my hand

392
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,120
is for fair justice.

393
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,120
I'm going to investigate the Shao Shi Sword

394
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,120
for fair justice.

395
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,120
The Shao Shi Sword has been washed away by the Golden Pond.

396
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,120
The Three Gangs of the Donglin

397
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,120
are fighting against the bandits.

398
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,120
In fact,

399
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,120
it's based on the He family's sky-high cloud iron.

400
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,120
I, Li Xiang Yi, am sure about this.

401
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,120
Father!

402
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,120
Father!

403
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,120
Father!

404
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,120
Father!

405
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,120
Wake up, Father!

406
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,120
Master He.

407
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,120
Come.

408
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,120
Master He.

409
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,120
You two masters.

410
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,120
I, He Lu Jing,

411
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,120
will send my son to Luoyang

412
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,120
to buy a house for him.

413
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,120
Don't worry.

414
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,120
We will definitely do it.

415
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,120
I heard that the He family has a

416
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,120
very soft and strong sky-high cloud iron.

417
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,120
You two heroes.

418
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,120
As long as my son is safe and well,

419
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,120
he will definitely

420
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,120
get the sky-high cloud iron.

421
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,120
No need to do that.

422
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,120
It's not a hero's job to take advantage of others.

423
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,120
I'm just worried that

424
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,120
this thing will fall into the hands of the cowards.

425
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,120
That's why I asked.

426
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,120
Master He, don't worry.

427
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,120
We will definitely

428
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,120
send your son to

429
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,120
the family of the Luoyang family.

430
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,120
Senior Brother.

431
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,120
The day you asked me to receive him outside the city,

432
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,120
you sent He's son alone

433
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,120
into Luoyang City.

434
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,120
Did you personally

435
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,120
send him to the family of the Luoyang family?

436
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,120
Then why did he still die

437
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,120
outside Luoyang City?

438
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,120
How could this happen?

439
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,120
I personally sent him

440
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,120
to his family.

441
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,120
I often rode to the He family

442
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,120
to do evil deeds.

443
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,120
I think it's the enemy's revenge.

444
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,120
They want to cut the grass and get rid of the roots.

445
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,120
It's a pity.

446
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,120
Everything has its cause and effect.

447
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,120
You and I have tried our best.

448
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,120
Senior Brother still loves

449
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,120
Duan Lan Yun Tian.

450
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,120
No.

451
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,120
Senior Brother Duan is not that kind of person.

452
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,120
It's just a continuous guess

453
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,120
that can change

454
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,120
Senior Brother's

455
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,120
look in Fang Lu's heart.

456
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,120
What are you thinking?

457
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,120
You haven't answered me yet.

458
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,120
There is no such thing as

459
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,120
a knife and a sword in this world.

460
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,120
Who must have made it up?

461
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,120
It's fake.

462
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,120
Okay.

463
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,120
You said there was no such thing.

464
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,120
Then there is no such thing.

465
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,120
I'll go see Hu Li Jing.

466
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,120
Hu Li Jing, come to eat.

467
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,120
Li Lian Hua.

468
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,120
You lied again.

469
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,120
If Yang Zhou Man picked it up,

470
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,120
you wouldn't have used it so easily.

471
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,120
Let me tell you.

472
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,120
Don't you think

473
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,120
these words are meaningless?

474
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,120
You don't even remember your own things.

475
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,120
What do you know about Yang Zhou Man?

476
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,120
I don't understand.

477
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,120
He was obviously lying.

478
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,120
It seems that he didn't want to harm her.

479
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,120
Tell me something about me.

480
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,120
I won't tell her

481
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,120
that you lied to her.

482
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,120
Hurry up.

483
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,120
Okay.

484
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,120
I'll tell you.

485
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,120
Ten years ago,

486
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,120
you died once.

487
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,120
I died once?

488
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,120
What do you mean?

489
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,120
This is the second question.

490
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,120
If you ask again, you have to pay the fee.

491
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,120
Li Lian Hua.

492
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,120
Li Lian Hua.

493
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,120
What do you think

494
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,120
the Golden Gate and Nan Ying have to do with each other?

495
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,120
They have repeatedly taken the Luomo Heavenly Soldiers.

496
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,120
Ye Huo Teng

497
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,120
and those who represent

498
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,120
the mark of revenge.

499
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,120
I'm afraid that the people of Nan Ying

500
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,120
want to re-enter the land.

501
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,120
If that's the case,

502
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,120
we should hurry up and get the Luomo Heavenly Soldiers

503
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,120
before the Jiao Li Bridge.

504
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,120
Why is Su Xiang still not here?

505
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,120
She's not here yet.

506
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,120
Why hasn't Su Xiang arrived yet?

507
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,120
I wonder if she has found out

508
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,120
the whereabouts of the Lord of the Imperial Harem.

509
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,120
There's nothing that

510
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,120
I can't find out.

511
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,120
Shi Shou Village.

512
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,120
My grandfather said

513
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,120
the last place where the Lord of the Imperial Harem

514
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,120
appeared was this Shi Shou Village.

515
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,120
It's said that Shi Shou Village has produced

516
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,120
a civilization that can enhance the internal strength

517
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,120
of the Rouchang Jade Nian.

518
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,120
Many martial arts masters

519
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,120
went there without notice.

520
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,120
Rouchang Jade Nian?

521
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,120
I think I've heard about this legend.

522
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,120
Could it be that the Lord of the Imperial Harem

523
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,120
is also going to find Rouchang Jade Nian?

524
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,120
I've also heard that

525
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,120
the Lord of the Imperial Harem

526
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,120
has been seriously injured internally.

527
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,120
If Rouchang Jade Nian

528
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,120
can enhance the internal strength,

529
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,120
it's very likely that he's going to Shi Shou Village.

530
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,120
But this is more than ten years ago.

531
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,120
That village

532
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,120
is said to have been

533
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,120
flooded by the river that has been changed.

534
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,120
It's located on the map of Shanghai.

535
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,120
But I don't know

536
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,120
if I know it.

537
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,120
Thank you, Miss Su.

538
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,120
We'll leave now.

539
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,120
Goodbye.

540
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,120
I'll go with you.

541
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,120
No need.

542
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,120
You...

543
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,120
Miss Su,

544
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,120
this trip is dangerous.

545
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,120
Fei is afraid that the girl will be involved,

546
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,120
so she ordered your blood.

547
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,120
After a life,

548
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,120
she will leave automatically.

549
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,120
I didn't think so.

550
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,120
It's been long enough

551
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,120
to ask the Lord of the Imperial Harem

552
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,120
to help us.

553
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,120
Shut up!

554
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
Fei is going to get up now.

555
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,120
Sit down.

556
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,120
Crazy!

557
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,120
Li Tianhua, come back!

558
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,120
You left me alone again!

559
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,120
Holy Maiden,

560
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,120
the Li's Mansion has failed.

561
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,120
Luo Mo Tian Bing from the Yulou Village

562
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,120
was kidnapped by Li Lianhua

563
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,120
and Fang Duo Bin.

564
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,120
Li Lianhua and Fang Duo Bin again?

565
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,120
Why do they always

566
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,120
oppose me?

567
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,120
Where are they now?

568
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,120
Go to the detective office.

569
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,120
Yes.

570
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,120
I'll go with you.

571
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,120
Go.

572
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,120
Go.

573
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,120
Go.

574
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
Go.

575
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,120
They seem to have gone to Juhua Mountain.

576
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,120
Juhua Mountain?

577
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,120
Blood Lord and Blood Lady.

578
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,120
Holy Maiden.

579
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,120
Go to Juhua Mountain.

580
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,120
Remove Li Lianhua and Fang Duo Bin's head

581
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,120
and peel their skin for me.

582
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,120
Bring Luo Mo Tian Bing back.

583
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,120
Yes.

584
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,120
Li Lianhua

585
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,120
loves me everywhere.

586
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,120
I can't let him

587
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,120
get in trouble.

588
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,120
Juhua Mountain is a place of the wind and rain.

589
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,120
I'm waiting for your good news.

590
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,120
Go.

591
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,120
How many circles

592
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,120
have we been in Juhua Mountain?

593
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,120
I didn't even see the shadow of a village.

594
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,120
No wonder this stone beast village

595
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,120
is a mysterious village.

596
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,120
Is it because we're not meant to be?

597
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,120
We don't know if we're meant to be.

598
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,120
It seems that we're lost.

599
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,120
Lost?

600
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,120
Are you kidding?

601
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,120
I've never been lost since I was six years old.

602
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,120
Even if it's a thousand miles of desert,

603
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,120
I can still find it.

604
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,120
You're lost.

605
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,120
Stop bragging.

606
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,120
Let's go. Hurry up.

607
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,120
The Eight Deserts and the Abyss Valley

608
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,120
have established a barrier.

609
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,120
I think there should be someone nearby.

610
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,120
I'll wash my face by the lake.

611
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,120
Stop Right, stop.

612
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,120
tissue

613
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,120
Don't make too much noise.

614
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,120
All right.

615
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,120
Why not glasses under my feet?

616
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:28,680
It's my song.

617
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,440
Ice Creaking Ice

618
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,920
Come and have a look.

619
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,760
They're still washing their faces.

620
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,280
Why are there holes in the water?

621
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,680
It's the truth.

622
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:47,880
Who's there?

623
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,600
Who are you?

624
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,280
Don't you want to wash your face?

625
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,520
I'll kill you.

626
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,160
You're so cold.

627
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,840
You're so cold.

628
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:41,880
Your Majesty.

629
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,240
Who are you?

630
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,120
Why did you call me Your Majesty?

631
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,600
Don't you recognize me?

632
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,160
I'm your subordinate, Xue Gong.

633
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:51,960
You're...

634
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,680
You're the leader of our Golden Moon Alliance.

635
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,360
Golden Moon Alliance?

636
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,000
Leader?

637
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,920
I'm Song Give Negotiate.

638
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,920
What do you want with me?

639
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,640
Director.

640
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,320
Your Majesty.

641
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,200
Who are you?

642
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,840
Theshot save me.

643
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,360
You should have left us midway.

644
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,400
In this case,

645
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,160
in return,

646
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,800
we will fight bak.

647
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,160
Let's go.

648
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:32,800
I'm fine.

649
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,560
How are you?

650
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,280
I'm fine.

651
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,520
Where are we?

652
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,640
It seems that

653
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,480
we're behind this mountain.

654
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,520
Let's go.

655
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,480
Let's go over there.

656
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,360
Liu'an Flower Shop

657
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,040
Lollipop with 170 speaking of shining days

658
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,160
you are just like the wind.

659
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,360
You had been staring at those lakes

660
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,360
for a long while.

661
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,880
You actually realized that

662
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,280
there is an Council of the Phoenix already.

663
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,720
A'bao, are you okay?

664
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,960
The poison in his body has spread.

665
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,600
You should use it to suppress him.

666
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,320
I...

667
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,920
Why did I save this devil?

668
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,120
Hurry up.

669
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,000
Forget it.

670
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,720
Before we catch you in the gold boat,

671
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,320
I won't let you die.

672
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,040
Wake up.

673
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,480
How could the old man be so quiet?

674
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,620
What's up?

675
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,420
Have you improved more?

676
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,860
Jin Yuan's Alliance.

677
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,960
What's going on?

678
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,740
You mention these words before.

679
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,620
You must know something.

680
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,340
Why did I Xiaotong it as soon as I thought of it?

681
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:23,960
Ah.

682
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,420
That Jin Yuan's Alliance

683
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,740
In the past

684
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,240
you've been energyletter slave to them.

685
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,920
You are indeed the devil of the Golden Thread Embroidery.

686
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,280
You are the superior of those people.

687
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,240
But,

688
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,120
you have changed your ways.

689
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,240
You are not on the same side with them.

690
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,080
That's why they poisoned you.

691
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:43,840
What's wrong?

692
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,720
You can't believe everything you say.

693
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,840
You can't.

694
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,160
I'm telling you, I won't lie to you.

695
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,760
Please.

696
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,880
Li Lianhua.

697
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,040
How long do you think

698
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,200
can we keep lying to him?

699
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,040
But if he regains his memory,

700
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,720
he might be able to find out

701
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,920
what happened in the Golden Thread Embroidery.

702
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,920
I happen to have some things

703
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,000
that I want to find out.

704
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,360
It's about your father.

705
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,880
You guess if he regains his memory,

706
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,080
he will be a friend.

707
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,280
Shi Shou Village.

708
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,240
The Golden Thread Embroidery

709
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,960
This is the legendary

710
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,000
Taoyuan.

711
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,800
It's not easy to escape in this season.

712
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,720
Right?

713
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,880
But this village is so hidden.

714
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,000
Has the owner of the Red Spring really been here?

715
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,400
Shi has been here for so many years.

716
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,440
It's not easy to find someone.

717
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,360
It's not dark yet.

718
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,560
Why is there no one outside?

719
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,560
The Golden Thread Embroidery

720
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,040
Kid,

721
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:00,960
let me ask you...

722
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,360
Well...

723
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,160
I can tell you not to run around.

724
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,560
The villagers are strange.

725
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,640
They seem to be hiding something.

726
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,160
Didn't you say that this place is famous for its herbal medicine?

727
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,920
Many people from the martial arts world came here for a reason.

728
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,520
Why is it so quiet?

729
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,040
There is something strange here.

730
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,800
I think it's getting late.

731
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,680
Let's find a hotel first.

732
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,480
Let's go.

733
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,080
It seems that

734
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,360
no one has lived here for a long time.

735
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,880
This village is so quiet.

736
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,960
But there is a hotel here.

737
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,480
Who is the owner of this hotel?

738
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,480
Maybe it was quite lively a few years ago.

739
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,360
Don't forget that

740
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,160
many people from the martial arts world

741
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,080
came here for herbal medicine.

742
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,680
Let's go in.

743
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,360
The Golden Thread Embroidery

744
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,160
What is this?

745
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:44,960
Don't you think

746
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,480
there is a strange smell here?

747
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,760
What smell?

748
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,160
The smell of dead people.

749
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,360
It's all blood.

750
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,960
You are right.

751
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,560
The traces here are short and messy.

752
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,160
It's not a sword lock.

753
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,760
It's more like

754
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,560
being smashed by someone.

755
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,560
The blood is flowing very fast.

756
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,160
It's hard for the injured

757
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,560
to live.

758
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:44,960
Look.

759
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,360
Be careful.

760
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,160
The Golden Thread Embroidery

761
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,760
Look here.

762
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,160
The Golden Thread Embroidery

763
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,160
The Golden Thread Embroidery

764
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,160
Someone died from a hangover here?

765
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,160
Since he is dead,

766
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,960
why didn't he take the cloth

767
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,560
and the wooden chair?

768
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,160
The ghost came out of the room at night

769
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,160
and came back to the window.

770
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,760
The Golden Thread Embroidery

771
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,960
The Golden Thread Embroidery

772
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,360
is...

773
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,760
The Golden Thread Embroidery

774
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,360
This is a will.

775
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,960
It's a woman's will.

776
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:52,960
Her husband was a ghost.

777
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,960
He was forced to

778
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,360
hang himself because of something terrible.

779
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,760
He said there was a ghost in the window.

780
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,960
But the hall was full of

781
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,560
the sign of the ghost.

782
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,160
Could it be a haunted inn?

783
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,160
The Golden Thread Embroidery

784
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,560
Don't you think it's strange?

785
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,960
There's a wind noise outside.

786
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,560
The wind cannot blow in.

787
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,560
It's like someone is blocking the wind.

788
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,760
It's a ghost.

789
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,960
The ghost blocked the wind for you.

790
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,960
Are you done?

791
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,360
Okay.

792
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,160
Let's go our separate ways.

793
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:45,760
Okay.

794
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,160
The Golden Thread Embroidery

795
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,960
The Golden Thread Embroidery

796
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,760
Did you find anything?

797
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,760
There's indeed

798
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,160
a serious mark in the room.

799
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,360
But the body is gone.

800
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,960
It's like one year, one month, one day,

801
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,560
everyone disappeared.

802
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,160
How did we get in?

803
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,560
There's a door.

804
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:08,960
That's right.

805
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,160
What's that?

806
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,560
The door was taken away by Huo Shenshen.

807
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,960
Judging from the decay,

808
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,760
it should be less than four or five days.

809
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,760
That means

810
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,560
the ghost is still killing people.

811
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,760
Why are you staring at me?

812
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,160
Think about it.

813
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,160
We've been in the inn for so long.

814
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,960
Maybe we've been targeted by someone.

815
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,160
If we don't leave this inn soon,

816
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,560
we'll be in a lot of trouble.

817
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,360
Look at the top of the door frame.

818
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,560
It seems that this hand

819
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,360
is very powerful.

820
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,360
If it wasn't for the marks of martial arts,

821
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,360
I thought the people in here

822
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,560
were torn apart by the Mongolians.

823
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,560
The pillars were all broken into pieces.

824
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,760
I'm afraid this beast

825
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,160
can't beat the master of this broken hand.

826
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,160
How could you cut off the head of such a strong willful person?

827
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,460
It's not easy to

828
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,760
cut off a head like this.

829
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,360
But it's still under me.

830
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,560
Why are you staring at me?

831
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,760
I'm afraid I can't beat the master of this broken hand.

832
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,760
I'm afraid I can't beat the master of this broken hand.

833
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,760
I'm afraid I can't beat the master of this broken hand.

834
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,760
The sword marks are changed from the same way.

835
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,560
The sword wind blows away three parts.

836
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,960
This move looks like a move from the Zhaoyi School.

837
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,360
And

838
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,160
the fingerprints and prints on this door frame

839
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,560
are all human.

840
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,760
The fingerprints can be cut into the scale of the ink.

841
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,960
Only human can do it.

842
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,360
Li Lianhua,

843
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,960
who are you?

844
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,960
It's Zhaoyue and Kunlun.

845
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,760
It seems that there are really a group of martial arts masters

846
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,960
fighting here.

847
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,360
If it's really a martial arts master's mistake,

848
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,960
why are there so many

849
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,360
traces of beasts here?

850
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,760
Fang Xiaobao,

851
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,360
have you ever heard

852
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,360
which sect in the martial arts world

853
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,160
is the master of beasts?

854
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,560
What are you doing?

855
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,160
What are you doing here at this late night?

856
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,160
I haven't heard of it.

857
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,160
That's right.

858
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,760
Where have these people been recently?

859
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,760
After the fight, no matter who wins or loses,

860
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,360
they will naturally leave.

861
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,160
After the fight, people leave.

862
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,360
This is a guest house.

863
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,760
It's been a mess here for years.

864
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,360
Has no one cleaned up here?

865
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,160
So many people died here.

866
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,560
There are so many services attached downstairs.

867
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,760
I dare not come in.

868
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,160
There is a ghost.

869
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,760
I'm here.

870
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,960
I'm here.

871
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,160
I'm here.

872
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,360
I'm here.

873
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,560
I'm here.

874
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,760
I'm here.

875
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,960
I'm here.

876
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,160
I'm here.

877
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,360
I'm here.

878
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,560
I'm here.

879
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,760
I'm here.

880
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:57,960
I'm here.

881
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,160
I'm here.

882
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,360
I'm here.

883
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,560
I'm here.

884
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,760
I'm here.

885
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:03,960
I'm here.

886
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,160
I'm here.

887
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,360
I'm here.

888
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,560
I'm here.

889
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,760
I'm here.

890
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:09,960
I'm here.

891
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,160
I'm here.

892
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,360
I'm here.

893
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,560
I'm here.

894
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,760
I'm here.

895
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,960
I'm here.

896
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,160
I'm here.

897
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,360
I'm here.

898
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,560
I'm here.

899
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,760
I'm here.

I'm here.

902
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,360
I'm here.

903
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,560
I'm here.

904
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,760
I'm here.

905
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,960
I'm here.

906
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,160
I'm here.

907
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,360
I'm here.

908
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,560
I'm here.

909
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,760
I'm here.

910
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:33,960
I'm here.

911
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,160
I'm here.

912
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,360
I'm here.

913
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,560
I'm here.

914
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,760
I'm here.

915
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:39,960
I'm here.

916
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,160
I'm here.

917
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,360

I'm here.

925
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:51,960
I'm here.

926
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,160
I'm here.

927
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,360
I'm here.

928
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,560
I'm here.

929
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,760
I'm here.

930
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,960
I'm here.

931
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,160
I'm here.

932
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,360
I'm here.

933
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,560
I'm here.

934
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,760
I'm here.

935
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,960
I'm here.

936
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,160
I'm here.

937
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,360
I'm here.

938
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,560
I'm here.

939
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,760
I'm here.
