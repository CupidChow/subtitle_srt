00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,860
Since I can't prove myself innocent,

173
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,460
I hope you can give me a chance

174
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,360
to find out the truth.

175
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,090
Mr. Fang is from the Baichuan Court.

176
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,880
Of course we trust him.

177
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,790
But whether this guy named Happy

178
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,110
is innocent too,

179
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,230
it's hard to say.

180
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,200
He should stay.

181
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,860
After the test is over,

182
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,180
we'll find out the truth

183
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,270
and then give him back to you.

184
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:41,710
Wait.

185
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,020
We haven't found out who did it.

186
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,390
How can you resume the test?

187
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,430
What if

188
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,820
the guy behind it

189
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,150
hurts these kids again?

190
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,460
Let me explain.

191
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,580
The date of the test was set

192
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,490
by Leader Wang before he died.

193
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,450
The Lingshan Sect needs a new leader.

194
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,220
No.

195
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:05,990
Easy, everyone.

196
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,910
I have an idea

197
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,070
but don't know whether I should say it.

198
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,580
You're arguing

199
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,950
because Leader Wang

200
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,240
didn't specify how to identify the Spiritual Child.

201
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,770
That's the source of the problem.

202
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:19,410
How about

203
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,860
I talk to Leader Wang

204
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,280
to find out what he thought?

205
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,980
What are you talking about?

206
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,300
Our master has passed away.

207
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,830
How can you talk to the dead?

208
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:31,980
Wei Bai.

209
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,340
Who are you?

210
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,340
I'm Li Lianhua.

211
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,050
Many people call me the miracle physician.

212
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,400
So you're the physician

213
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,700
who resurrected Master Tiexiao.

214
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,550
Yes, it's me.

215
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,630
I've heard a lot about you.

216
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,010
It's such a great honor

217
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,110
to meet you here.

218
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,510
What are you up to this time?

219
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,310
Look.

220
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,730
This is not a simple case.

221
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:01,800
If I find out who's behind it,

222
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,920
can you let me go?

223
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:03,620
No.

224
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,780
You're a detective from the Baichuan Court.

225
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,580
Do you have no conscience at all?

226
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,550
Look at them.

227
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,420
Look at these innocent boys.

228
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,190
Look how much they've suffered.

229
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,450
Can you bear to let them suffer even more?

230
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:20,980
Besides,

231
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,980
catching a murderer

232
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,980
can bring you more recognition than catching a quack.

233
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,420
Leader Wang

234
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,620
is six feet under now,

235
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,220
but I know how to summon ghosts.

236
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,180
If you trust me,

237
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,190
can you let me give it a try?

238
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,100
How can we know if you're just playing tricks

239
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,980
and pretending to be our master?

240
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,170
Don't be rude to the miracle physician.

241
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,410
We trust you.

242
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,630
Let's do it your way, Physician Li.

243
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:52,730
Well,

244
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:56,100
please send Leader Wang's body back to his room.

245
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,220
I also need some of his belongings

246
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,580
to summon his ghost.

247
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:05,770
Sir,

248
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,340
this is where our master lived.

249
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,510
[Qinglan Residence]

250
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,460
Tell me.

251
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,290
What tricks did you play

252
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,940
to resurrect Master Tiexiao

253
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,670
and the heir to the Tiejia Sect?

254
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,720
Master Tiexiao was cornered by his enemy

255
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,540
and jumped off the cliff.

256
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,300
Everyone thought he was dead

257
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,580
and buried him.

258
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,950
I happened to pass by

259
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,360
and heard his voice.

260
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,860
So I dug him out.

261
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,950
As for Shi Wenjue,

262
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,450
he was determined

263
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,380
to start a career in public service

264
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,990
but his family didn't support him.

265
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,150
His story is even more interesting.

266
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,280
He faked his suicide

267
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,100
but

268
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:50,890
I could tell

269
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,980
that he was acting.

270
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,270
I didn't expose him.

271
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:54,940
These two guys

272
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,870
naturally won't reveal the truth.

273
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,340
That's what happened.

274
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,430
Word travels fast.

275
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,440
Now I'm famous.

276
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,420
As I expected,

277
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,270
you earned your reputation

278
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,910
through hanky-panky.

279
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,500
I'm just more observant than most people.

280
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,980
To make my own way in the world,

281
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,220
I have to have some strengths.

282
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:11,940
Strengths?

283
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,860
You call that a strength?

284
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,050
You're just lucky.

285
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,710
You have to admit it.

286
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,030
Good luck is a kind of strength too.

287
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,130
I'm indeed lucky.

288
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,870
Let me make it clear.

289
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,700
After I help you,

290
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,940
we'll be even.

291
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,960
It depends on how much your help is worth.

292
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,500
You said you're observant.

293
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,420
Then let's see

294
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,320
who can find out the cause of his death first.

295
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,360
[Humble and Disciplined]

296
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,800
[The heir is a sixteen-year-old Spiritual Child born in early April in the southwest of the city. He has a lotus-shaped mole on his right foot.]

297
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,560
Not only do I know how he died,

298
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,280
but I also know that the murderer

299
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,680
is among his steward and three disciples.

300
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,070
Why…

301
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:17,740
Look.

302
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,790
Does that hand gesture

303
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,990
look familiar to you?

304
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,190
Breath Stopping Skill.

305
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,030
No need to check.

306
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,220
That skill could only stop his breath for three days at most.

307
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,200
Three days later,

308
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,660
he needed someone to hit his acupoints

309
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,590
Baihui and Tanzhong three times to come back to life.

310
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,250
It's been over ten days.

311
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,700
He's long dead.

312
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,500
Wang Qingshan used Breath Stopping Skill to fake his death

313
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,960
and needed someone he trusted to wake him up.

314
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,760
But that guy didn't do it.

315
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,370
So he was suffocated.

316
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,040
No wonder you said

317
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,500
the murderer is among those four guys.

318
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,110
He needed the help of someone very close

319
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,060
to practice this secret skill.

320
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,620
Those four guys

321
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,700
were the closest to Wang Qingshan

322
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,340
in the Lingshan Sect.

323
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,940
You figured it out right away

324
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,140
because you used the same trick before.

325
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,330
I haven't finished my words.

326
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,690
Haven't you noticed that the gold leaf on his lips is very thick?

327
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,120
He was injured before he died.

328
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,300
So the murderer used thick gold leaf

329
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,360
to cover the blood.

330
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,100
Go scrape off the gold leaf on his back.

331
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:47,500
You…

332
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:52,750
I'll do you a favor.

333
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,230
Is it Five Poison Palm?

334
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,470
You know it?

335
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,620
Xin Lei, the Thunder Chaser of the Jinyuan Alliance,

336
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,220
is famous for his Five Poison Palm.

337
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,190
Ten years ago, the Jinyuan Alliance was wiped out.

338
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,410
Most of its disciples were arrested by the Baichuan Court,

339
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,530
but some escaped.

340
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,720
Xin Lei is one of those who escaped.

341
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,570

he can't have his father's surname,

the Thunder Chaser seized the opportunity

513
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,650
to replace his body.

514
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,770
It was such an easy trick

515
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,540
but fooled you all.

516
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,510
Do you mean

517
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,420
Leader Wang didn't turn into a full-body sarira?

518
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,970
It was all arranged by Leader Wang.

519
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,370
I just did what I was told.

520
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:18,940
You can't blame me.

521
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,830
Piao Erhuang,

522
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,620
stop playing dumb.

523
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:24,790
By the way,

524
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:28,600
should I call you Happy's father?

525
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,120
Or Xin Lei, the Thunder Chaser of the Jinyuan Alliance?

526
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,060
You can go check Leader Wang's body now.

527
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,490
There is a black palm on his back

528
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,500
which was caused by the skill that made the Thunder Chaser famous.

529
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,260
I guess

530
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,770
that Leader Wang

531
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,970
had an affair with a girl named Helan Yan.

532
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:02,610
Later,

533
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,450
they had an illegitimate son.

534
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,220
Because he wasn't allowed to get married and have children,

535
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,460
Helan Yan threatened to leave.

536
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,070
But Leader Wang

537
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,910
didn't want to leave his child,

538
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:15,130
so he decided to put on a show.

539
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:18,030
You found out his plan by chance.

540
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,780
You also found that Leader Wang had noticed

541
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:24,470
the remnants of the Jinyuan Alliance in Jia Province.

542
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,880
So you decided to get rid of him

543
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,090
by giving him this idea.

544
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,350
Will it work?

545
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,030
That woman came to make a fuss again and again.

546
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,260
Unless she gets what she wants,

547
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,940
I'm afraid the whole sect

548
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:44,280
will find out about it sooner or later.

549
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:47,890
Not only will your reputation be ruined,

550
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,160
but the disciples may also join hands to topple you.

551
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:54,900
You'll lose everything by then.

552
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,090
Leader Wang wanted both the assets

553
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,100
and his son.

554
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,730
So he colluded with you

555
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,700
to use the mirrors

556
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,830
to fake his death in front of everyone.

557
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,490
Three days later,

558
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,590
instead of waking him up,

559
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,170
you gave him a fatal blow.

560
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,300
After that,

561
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,250
you covered his body with gold

562
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,380
to conceal the print left by your Five Poison Palm.

563
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,280
There's really a palm print on Leader Wang's back.

564
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,560
You killed our master.

565
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,450
Why do you believe him so easily?

566
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,720
Let me tell you.

567
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,440
It's all just his imagination.

568
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,500
I haven't finished yet.

569
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,540
Wang Shouqing.

570
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,350
Can I borrow the letter

571
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,420
Leader Wang left?

572
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,320
[The heir is a sixteen-year-old Spiritual Child born in early April in the southwest of the city. He has a lotus-shaped mole on his right foot.]

573
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,300
Leader Wang

574
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,460
intended to

575
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,620
leave the Lingshan Sect to his six-year-old illegitimate son.

576
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,860
So the suffix "teen"

577
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,750
is in a different handwriting.

578
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,170
Moreover, part of this letter was cut out.

579
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,420
I guess

580
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,220
the missing part contains the most important information

581
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,180
that the kid's mother's surname is Helan.

582
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:11,040
You deliberately leaked the news to Happy's cousin

583
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,880
and caused a mysterious fire in the ancestral hall

584
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,250
because you didn't want

585
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,620
these three disciples to get suspicious.

586
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:21,180
You've never thought of Happy in the past decade

587
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,710
but after killing someone,

588
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,980
you suddenly remembered the son you abandoned.

589
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,440
What a good father you are.

590
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,650
You just want to use him as a puppet

591
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,970
to control the Lingshan Sect.

592
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,090
Father.

593
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:36,490
Did you do it?

594
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,720
You're a good storyteller.

595
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,470
But unfortunately…

596
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,510
Unfortunately, I don't have any evidence, right?

597
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,650
After seeing the surname Helan last night,

598
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,330
you were worried that your cover might be blown.

599
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,740
So you went to her house in the middle of the night

600
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,200
to kill the mother and son.

601
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,000
But we had smeared Baihong juice

602
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,960
on their quilt.

603
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,480
If you wash your hands, they'll turn black.

604
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:05,980
Show us your hands.

605
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,600
Avenge our master!

606
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,320
You talk too much.

607
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,640
Go to hell!

608
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:33,410
Fang Duobing.

609
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,460
Please keep him under control.

610
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,900
I'll send out a letter immediately

611
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,850
and have him brought back to the Baichuan Court.

612
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:01,420
Wait.

613
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,730
Do you have anything else to say to Happy?

614
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,060
I got nothing to say

615
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,650
to a good-for-nothing.

616
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,270
-You trash!
-Move.

617
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,670
Happy.

618
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:18,990
Young Master.

619
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:20,660
Don't be sad.

620
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,320
After you grow up,

621
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,140
I'll give you money and land.

622
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:27,960
It's fine.

623
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:35,860
You're welcome.

624
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,000
What do you mean?

625
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,440
This is the first case I solved for you.

626
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,300
I know you're grateful to me.

627
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,020
I'm grateful to you?

628
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,460
Don't you remember shouting my name just now?

629
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,820
I saved your life.

630
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,190
Lower your voice.

631
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,190
After we leave here,

632
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,300
we'll go our separate ways.

633
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,160
So who saved who is not important.

634
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:55,230
Why are you…

635
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:56,850
By the way,

636
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,420
I left something in Leader Wang's room.

637
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,380
I'll go get it.

638
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,310
So rude.

639
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:04,660
Young Hero Fang.

640
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,420
We want to ask you for a favor.

641
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:26,310
I heard that the 188 prisons of the Baichuan Court

642
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,830
are like hell.

643
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,890
What are you doing here?

644
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,740
I'm here to give you a chance.

645
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,940
If you tell me one thing,

646
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:35,270
I'll let you go.

647
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:37,889
You captured me and then offer to release me.

648
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,250
What do you want?

649
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,460
I didn't want to capture you.

650
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:44,770
The guy named Fang Duobing wanted.

651
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:46,460
I don't care

652
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:48,060
whether you live or die.

653
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:49,460
Go ahead.

654
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,010
What do you want to know?

655
00:34:58,219 --> 00:34:59,199
Ten years ago,

656
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,030
the Three Great Fighters of the Jinyuan Alliance

657
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,949
killed Shan Gudao of the Sigu Sect

658
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,260
and took away his remains.

659
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,780
Where are his remains now?

660
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,670
You used to work for Medicine Demon.

661
00:35:12,909 --> 00:35:14,179
You should know that.

662
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,310
How did you know

663
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:18,840
I used to work for Medicine Demon?

664
00:35:20,449 --> 00:35:21,290
Who are you?

665
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,090
You don't need to know that.

666
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,699
Just answer my question.

667
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:30,980
There are three holes in your earlobe.

668
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:34,210
When I tested poisons on people for Medicine Demon,

669
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,720
I saw the same mark

670
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,270
on their ears.

671
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,010
It's a mark left by Bicha Poison.

672
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,540
That poison is lethal

673
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,570
and has no cure.

674
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:47,190
The victims' bones and joints will rot in one month

675
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,710
and their fresh will peel off until they die.

676
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,460
Most victims will die within a month

677
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:59,390
unless they can force the poison out with strong inner force.

678
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,810
You're standing in front of me now.

679
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,620
The only explanation

680
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,340
is that you're him.

681
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,430
It's been ten years.

682
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,300
You're still alive.

683
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,420
I don't have time to waste on you.

684
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,100
People from the Baichuan Court should be on their way.

685
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,690
You've become a coward.

686
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,420
You don't even dare to say who you are.

687
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,660
I got it.

688
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,890
It's not that you don't know martial arts.

689
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,900
You lost all of your skills.

690
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:32,820
Li Xiangyi.

691
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,320
I guessed right.

692
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:44,170
You were once the invincible Master of Sword

693
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,750
but ended up like this.

694
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:52,020
You challenged the Jinyuan Alliance for your senior back then

695
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,170
but now,

696
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,270
you're searching for his remains.

697
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,630
Everyone says you're heartless,

698
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,270
but they're wrong.

699
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,030
At least you care about your senior very much.

700
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,390
Unfortunately, I can't help you.

701
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,630
I don't know where his remains are.

702
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,970
You're dead.

703
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,480
I'll kill you for the Director!

704
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:33,000
Li Lianhua!

705
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:45,540
Are you okay?

706
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,030
I'm fine.

707
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,900
Luckily, you appeared in time.

708
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,680
How dare you strangle me?

709
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,740
I was too quick.

710
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:56,420
We haven't gotten anything out of him yet.

711
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,420
He died too soon.

712
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,460
Yes.

713
00:37:59,020 --> 00:37:59,730
Thank you.

714
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:04,920
Li Lianhua.

715
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,550
You said you needed to fetch something.

716
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,480
Why are you here?

717
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,440
I took the wrong turn.

718
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,780
Why are you here?

719
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,380
The three disciples of the Lingshan Sect

720
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,380
are grateful to us

721
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,850
and invited us to dinner.

722
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:17,940
So I came to tell you about it.

723
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,320
Man,

724
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,690
I saved you again.

725
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:20,280
Thanks.

726
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,180
Aren't you going?

727
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:22,710
No.

728
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,060
Fox Spirit is waiting for me at home.

729
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,030
Fox spirit?

730
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,050
A little bit of salt.

731
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,310
A little bit.

732
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,100
A-A little bit.

733
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,860
You must be hungry, Fox Spirit.

734
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,610
Sit down.

735
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:58,710
Go ahead.

736
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,380
So you're Fox Spirit.

737
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:07,040
So cute.

738
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,690
So you're not only a quack

739
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,410
but also a bad cook.

740
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,720
So this is the Lotus Tower.

741
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:25,770
What is this?

742
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:28,110
You grow vegetables here?

743
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,540
If I remember correctly,

744
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,060
we're even now.

745
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,090
Even if we are,

746
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,480
there are questions I need to ask you.

747
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,990
Why did you steal the manual of sword fighting from the Hall of Flames?

748
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:42,910
That manual

749
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,800
belonged to the Shi family in Henan in the beginning.

750
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,650
Several years ago, it was taken away by the Hall of Flames.

751
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:51,270
So I paid Master Thief a lot of money to get it back.

752
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,150
Why did you do that?

753
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,140
He helped me once.

754
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,510
Years ago,

755
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,450
I had heart disease.

756
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:01,340
He came to steal things from me

757
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,340
and gave me some medicine.

758
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,720
I had to pay him back.

759
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:10,060
I didn't expect you to be a grateful man.

760
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:10,860
I'm not.

761
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,050
I didn't want to pay him back.

762
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:13,940
But that guy

763
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,790
told the Hall of Flames about my whereabouts.

764
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:17,790
I had no choice.

765
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:20,750
Why are you still here?

766
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,140
Do you expect to have dinner with me?

767
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,320
I saved you twice today.

768
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,780
I brought wine with me.

769
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,840
Can't you let me stay for dinner?

770
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:45,210
I'll help myself.

771
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:47,840
Let me try it.

772
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,610
The beef is great.

773
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,250
Why did you ruin it

774
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:57,400
with so much pepper?

775
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,250
Also,

776
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,810
look at this artemisia selengensis.

777
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,040
It looks so plain.

778
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,530
The next time you cook,

779
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:03,660
add some bacon to it.

780
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,630
The fragrance of bacon goes perfectly with its refreshing taste.

781
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,660
It'll be very delicious.

782
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,100
Well,

783
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,340
look at the chicken stewed with chestnuts.

784
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,350
It must taste gamy.

785
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,900
The next time you make it,

786
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,170
try using broth to get rid of the gamy taste.

787
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:12,630
Really?

788
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,310
Yes.

789
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,880
If you like cooking,

790
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,920
I can teach you.

791
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:16,820
I'm an expert.

792
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,960
I won't bother you.

793
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:19,820
Bro,

794
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,770
do you have to be so cold?

795
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,410
You're the first friend I made

796
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:24,730
after leaving home.

797
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,350
To tell you the truth,

798
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:34,580
I ran away from home to escape an arranged marriage.

799
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,860
My father wanted me to marry the princess,

800
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,290
but I'm not interested in politics at all.

801
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:38,260
Compared to the court,

802
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,060
I prefer the wide world outside.

803
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,200
What does that have to do with me?

804
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:49,040
I have to solve three cases

805
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,570
to be admitted to the Baichuan Court.

806
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:51,330
Look at us.

807
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:52,180
We finally

808
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,380
solved the case of the Spiritual Child,

809
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,200
but I promised to keep it quiet.

810
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,020
Lucky for you.

811
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,500
You saved your reputation as the miracle physician

812
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,350
and the Lingshan Sect saved its dignity.

813
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:01,150
What about me?

814
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,560
I still need to solve three cases.

815
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:06,610
How about this?

816
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,120
You're sly and I'm good at martial arts.

817
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,430
Why don't we work together

818
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:11,380
to solve more cases?

819
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,420
I can pay you a salary.

820
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,410
What do you think?

821
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:13,870
Salary?

822
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,860
Do you have money?

823
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:16,150
I…

824
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,090
You're so poor that you came to me for a free meal.

825
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:19,780
Besides,

826
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:22,200
I'm not interested in being a hero.

827
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,410
I prefer solitude to venturing into the perilous world.

828
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,940
I just want to

829
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,480
travel around the world.

830
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:30,430
Living on the edge

831
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,390
is not suitable for me.

832
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:31,790
You…

833
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,940
Give it a thought.

834
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,530
If I can't enter the Baichuan Court,

835
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:44,590
my master will be disappointed in me.

836
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,320
Get your hands off me.

837
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:54,990
Master.

838
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,930
You started the Sigu Sect and the Baichuan Court single-handedly.

839
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:01,500
I swear to make them thrive!

840
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:07,640
Wait.

841
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:10,300
Who is your master?

842
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,530
Li Xiangyi, the Master of Sword.

843
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:20,590
I'm fine.

844
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:25,430
Li Xiangyi, the Master of Sword.

845
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:28,090
I never knew

846
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,820
that Li Xiangyi had a disciple like you.

847
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:33,050
No one knows about it.

848
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:34,420
I bet.

849
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,900
I guess he doesn't know it either.

850
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,960
You don't believe me?

851
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,930
Then I'll tell you the truth.

852
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:49,190
I was weak when I was young.

853
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:52,690
My mother didn't even give me a serious name

854
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:55,620
because she thought I wouldn't make it to adulthood.

855
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,980
When I was ten,

856
00:43:58,030 --> 00:43:59,120
my mother found

857
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:02,730
her younger brother who went missing at a young age.

858
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,940
He's the deputy leader of the Sigu Sect,

859
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,140
Li Xiangyi's senior,

860
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,680
Shan Gudao.

861
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,840
Shan Gudao is your uncle?
