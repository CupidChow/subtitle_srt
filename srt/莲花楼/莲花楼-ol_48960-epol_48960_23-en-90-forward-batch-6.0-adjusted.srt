4
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,720
Come out or we'll set the cave on fire!

5
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,490
Set the fire.

6
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:03,840
Hold on.

7
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:04,910
Hold on.

8
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,650
Miss Qing'er?

9
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,220
Where is Master?

10
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,480
Yu Louchun?

11
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,120
How would I know?

12
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,370
You're his guard.

13
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,440
You stole treasures from Master Yu's room.

14
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,380
Where did you hide them?

15
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,560
What do you mean?

16
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,480
You're confusing me.

17
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,070
You sneaked out to hide in a cave.

18
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,870
So stop playing dumb.

19
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:48,260
I came out for a walk and got lost.

20
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:49,650
I didn't steal anything.

21
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,500
A walk?

22
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,110
You're dressed as a man.

23
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,290
You didn't need to disguise yourself for a walk.

24
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,360
That's right.

25
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,730
Mr. Fang asked me to dress like this.

26
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,480
Mr. Fang?

27
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,590
She left with you last night

28
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,250
and you asked her to dress like a man today?

29
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:14,840
Miss Qing'er.

30
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,640
Yu Louchun is perhaps dead.

31
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,140
No one can threaten you now.

32
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,140
You can be honest with us.

33
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,140
Yu Louchun got finished off?

34
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,610
That's great!

35
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:26,860
Then I'll be frank.

36
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,270
I dressed like a man to escape from the Girls' Mansion at night.

37
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,180
There were too many guards at the gate

38
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,950
so I decided to hide here for now.

39
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,260
I didn't steal anything.

40
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,520
You did away with Yu Louchun?

41
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:40,910
I…

42
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,290
You're quite something.

43
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,190
This is no time for jokes.

44
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,210
You two seem familiar.

45
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,350
Didn't you just meet yesterday?

46
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,320
We hit it off. So what?

47
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,100
Aren't you looking for the suspect?

48
00:03:59,610 --> 00:03:59,970
Well,

49
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,780
Yu Louchun's arm and leg

50
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,329
were cut off by an edged weapon.

51
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,170
After we entered the Girls' Mansion,

52
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,050
all our edged weapons were taken away.

53
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,860
So the prime suspect

54
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,520
is no one else but you, Guard Xin.

55
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,830
My sword has the shape of a pine needle.

56
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,850
It's very narrow

57
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,630
and can only be used for piercing.

58
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,600
It would've been broken if I had used it to chop up the body.

59
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,000
How could it be me?

60
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,420
Look.

61
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:34,660
There are body parts.

62
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:39,659
He…

63
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,540
He…

64
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,400
Isn't he the head guard who brought us here yesterday?

65
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,600
He got chopped into so many pieces.

66
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,220
It's brutal.

67
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,409
Brutal!

68
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,800
Things are complicated now.

69
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,390
His machete is not in its sheath

70
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,500
and his body is near your hiding spot.

71
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,260
You must've snatched his machete and killed him!

72
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,680
I just happened to be hiding here.

73
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,890
I didn't kill him.

74
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,740
It's fine that you wouldn't confess.

75
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,570
After I pull your fingernails out one by one,

76
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,020
you'll tell us everything.

77
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,340
How dare you!

78
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,960
Do you know who I am?

79
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,440
I'm the princess.

80
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,240
If you trifle with me,

81
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,460
I'll wipe out your whole family!

82
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,750
Princess?

83
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,120
I don't care even if you're the dowager empress.

84
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,300
Guard Xin, are you going to

85
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,520
torture her into confessing in front of a detective of the Baichuan Court?

86
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,180
Help me.

87
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,350
I'll reward you generously.

88
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,659
You don't need to come up with such a ridiculous lie

89
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:39,380
to get my help.

90
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:39,900
I…

91
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,510
You keep covering for her.

92
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,510
Are you afraid I'll get something out of her?

93
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:44,900
I'm not covering for her.

94
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,610
She doesn't know martial arts.

95
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,150
Even if you gave her a sword,

96
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,320
how could she kill Yu Louchun?

97
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,720
She couldn't but you could.

98
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,180
You two slept in the same room last night

99
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,330
and you're so protective of her now.

100
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,100
Maybe you're her accomplice!

101
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:56,730
Wait.

102
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,300
I'm curious about something.

103
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,210
If they conspired together,

104
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,400
how did they get up the Kanyun Peak?

105
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,350
-Exactly.
-Exactly.

106
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,350
This wheel is so heavy.

107
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,050
Did they fly up there with the flying skill?

108
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,340
Is there anyone in this world

109
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,220
with such excellent flying skill?

110
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,100
Fei?

111
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,060
There you are.

112
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,550
Su Xiaoyong is too noisy.

113
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,910
I'm afraid I can't help killing her.

114
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,210
I prefer to stay with you.

115
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,710
How did you get up here?

116
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,480
Flying skill.

117
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,780
I searched peak after peak.

118
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,960
It took me some effort

119
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,070
but the singing arrow just now helped a lot.

120
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,290
Perfect timing.

121
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,080
Li Lianhua.

122
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,460
You just said

123
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,270
that no one has such excellent flying skill in the world.

124
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:44,770
This place is thousands of feet high.

125
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,590
He can get to the Girls' Mansion

126
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,300
and can definitely go up the Kanyun Peak.

127
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,230
You guys killed them!

128
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:51,920
It's just a misunderstanding.

129
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,000
Let me introduce him.

130
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,720
He's Fei from the Nanhai Sect.

131
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,980
He's my servant.

132
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,940
He's got great flying skill,

133
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,190
but he's a weird guy

134
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,650
and never picks up fights.

135
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:05,630
Yeah.

136
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,510
This guy called Fei can fly wherever he wants.

137
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,070
He didn't need to snatch the head guard's machete to kill him.

138
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,100
He could bring one up here.

139
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,570
Miss Qing'er.

140
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,000
You're not helping.

141
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,840
What's on Fei's back?

142
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,250
My machete.

143
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,300
A big machete it is.

144
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,490
His machete is a bit special.

145
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,970
It's made of special material.

146
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,210
The cut it leaves is very different from those on the severed limbs.

147
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:34,980
Fei.

148
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,730
Wield your machete.

149
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:37,990
No.

150
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,810
Just wield it once.

151
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,600
I'll make dinner for you tonight.

152
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,750
Your cooking sucks.

153
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,820
What makes you think you can bribe me with that?

154
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,730
Forget it, Li Lianhua.

155
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,530
Your servant won't do it.

156
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,190
You don't know that.

157
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:54,880
Come closer.

158
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:02,940
Sure.

159
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,890
He agreed?

160
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:07,900
What did you say?

161
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,350
One secret for three favors.

162
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:10,830
I…

163
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,830
Young Master Shi.

164
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,520
You're an expert from the Weapon Valley.

165
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,130
Why don't you check the cut on the trunk?

166
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,200
Fei's machete is double-edged.

167
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,980
The cut is indeed different

168
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,059
from those on Yu Louchun.

169
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,940
He's so powerful.

170
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,080
Who did he train under?

171
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,480
I've never seen such swordsmanship.

172
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:48,940
That doesn't matter.

173
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,180
What matters is that Fei is not a suspect.

174
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:51,620
Right?

175
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,360
Then who is it?

176
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,930
Do we have no clues at all?

177
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,900
The clue has been there all the time.

178
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,740
The body was put back together.

179
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:07,810
Look.

180
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,590
That seems to be a hash mark.

181
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,290
Why are you shaking?

182
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,220
I think of a rumor.

183
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:34,290
Rumor?

184
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,920
A swordsman once died violently in the Fragrant Mountain

185
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,690
and turned into a vengeful ghost,

186
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,700
killing people in the Fragrant Mountain all day long.

187
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,680
He was called the Machete Ghost.

188
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,480
This is his Hash Slash.

189
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,360
The Machete Ghost was a real person.

190
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,170
He was good with a machete

191
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,520
but went missing seven years ago.

192
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,240
Look at the cuts on the head guard.

193
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,720
They're rough but were indeed left

194
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,950
by the Hash Slash which made the Machete Ghost

195
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,060
famous.

196
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,700
Were Yu Louchun's limbs

197
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,260
cut off by the Hash Slash too?

198
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,560
Then I'm afraid he's already dead.

199
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,170
He just lost one arm and one leg.

200
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,150
Master still stands a chance of living.

201
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:11,870
He's dead.

202
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,710
What did you say?

203
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:14,970
Follow me.

204
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,440
It's Yu Louchun's torso.

205
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,720
He really died.

206
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,080
Putting these body parts together,

207
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,270
we don't need to find the rest of his body

208
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,850
to recognize the Hash Slash.

209
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,360
[Kill the evil and send them back to hell.]

210
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,300
The Machete Ghost! It's the Machete Ghost!

211
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,190
Kill the evil

212
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,360
and send them back to hell.

213
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,960
Do ghosts really exist?

214
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,280
The guy was killed,

215
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,700
but not necessarily by a ghost.

216
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,320
What do you mean?

217
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,640
Don't they sell weapons in the underworld?

218
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,240
Fei means

219
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,530
if the murderer were a ghost,

220
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,840
why did he snatch a sword before the killings?

221
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,680
So the Machete Ghost can only be a human.

222
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,260
Mr. Fang and Physician Li solved many tricky cases.

223
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,220
In your opinion,

224
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,000
what should we do now?

225
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,480
The drawbridge of the Girls' Mansion hasn't been set down.

226
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,180
Few people's flying skill

227
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,460
is as great as Fei's.

228
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,420
So the suspect must be among us.

229
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,460
First,

230
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,070
let's narrow it down.

231
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,800
The girls in the Girls' Mansion seem the least suspicious.

232
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,990
Why?

233
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,890
Yu Louchun's arm

234
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,720
was found in the Guanri Pavilion.

235
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,350
The Guanri Pavilion is outside the Girls' Mansion.

236
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,750
The girls are banned from going out

237
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,620
so they couldn't put the arm there.

238
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,030
That's why they're the least suspicious.

239
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,690
Next, let's turn our focus

240
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,630
to Guard Xin and the other guards.

241
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,280
Before you came here,

242
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,480
everything was fine.

243
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,280
The murderer must be among the guests.

244
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,750
May I say something?

245
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,020
The head guard was not allowed in the Girls' Mansion

246
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,360
but died in the Girls' Mansion.

247
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,240
Guard Xin.

248
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,900
Don't you find that worth investigating?

249
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,980
The head guard was a peeper.

250
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,980
He sneaked in every year during Mountains Red

251
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,330
to spy on the guests and girls at night.

252
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,800
He never hurt anybody

253
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,600
so I just let him be.

254
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,160
Are you satisfied with my answer?

255
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,930
Yes, yes.

256
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,220
That means

257
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,390
as long as Guard Xin turns a blind eye,

258
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:33,900
those guards

259
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,900
can enter the Girls' Mansion freely, right?

260
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,210
Yes.

261
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,570
Here is my second question.

262
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,670
The wheel at the foot of the Kanyun Peak

263
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,230
is so heavy that Guard Xin

264
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,610
is the only one in the Girls' Mansion who can spin it

265
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,500
without anyone's help, right?

266
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,540
Yes.

267
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,010
Good.

268
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,860
The murderer needed to spin the wheel

269
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,250
and got up the peak in the cane basket for the killings.

270
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,320
It's almost impossible

271
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,980
to do those two things at the same time.

272
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,240
So the murderer had an accomplice.

273
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,550
Other than you two,

274
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,050
are there other guests who are acquaintances?

275
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,620
We don't know that.

276
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,120
What I want to say

277
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,500
is that we can't know

278
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,810
who may know whom personally.

279
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,050
Maybe

280
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:19,820
one of the guards

281
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,240
knows one of the guests.

282
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,400
The guards would in no way kill Master.

283
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,120
Why?

284
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:27,680
Guard Xin.

285
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:29,530
You've been acting weird.

286
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,830
So have the other guards.

287
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,780
You seem to care more about the treasures

288
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,110
than Yu Louchun.

289
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,420
If you can't prove yourself innocent,

290
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,610
you'll be in a dangerous situation.

291
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,240
I and all the other guards in the Girls' Mansion

292
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,770
would never kill Yu Louchun

293
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,910
because he poisoned us all

294
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,850
with the Loyal Potion.

295
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,740
We must take the antidote every month

296
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,810
or our entrails will melt into blood

297
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,580
and we'll die in excruciating pain.

298
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,610
The antidote is hidden in the secret room.

299
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:16,700
The day we should take the antidote this month

300
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,180
is tomorrow.

301
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,880
So if you can't get the antidote by tomorrow,

302
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:26,610
you'll die?

303
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:27,600
Yes.

304
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,980
I beg you to save us.

305
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:30,830
Otherwise,

306
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,110
the guards may be driven mad

307
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,000
by the unbearable pain before they die

308
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,090
and hurt you guys.

309
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,790
Are you begging them or threatening them?

310
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:40,440
Guard Xin.

311
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,510
Get up.

312
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,940
I'm a detective of the Baichuan Court.

313
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,500
We'll find out

314
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,010
whether you're innocent or not.

315
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,750
I'll find it out with you.

316
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,190
Fang Duobing.

317
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,920
We can use

318
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,930
Miss Qing'er's help.

319
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,780
She's familiar with this place.

320
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,640
From now on,

321
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,480
except for Physician Li and Mr. Fang,

322
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,010
no one is allowed to leave the Girls' Mansion

323
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,790
until the murderer is found.

324
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,850
Don't blame me for being rude if you violate it.

325
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,910
How did the murderer get up the Kanyun Peak?

326
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,490
Fei can fly.

327
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,930
Maybe the murderer flew up there.

328
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,770
Few people can be as good at the flying skill

329
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,560
as Fei.

330
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,490
By the way, where is Fei?

331
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,400
Fei doesn't care about all this

332
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,840
and is probably sleeping.

333
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,330
Maybe the murderer climbed up the rope.

334
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,830
This rope has oil on it

335
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,490
and is very slippery.

336
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,060
Climbing it

337
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,420
is even harder than flying.

338
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:58,810
I got it.

339
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,280
This is how the murderer went up the peak.

340
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,370
Vine?

341
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,430
It's burnt.

342
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,050
Tie a slipknot with the vine

343
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,580
and hang it under the cane basket.

344
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,130
When the cane basket reached the peak,

345
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,080
the knot was untied by the hook at the foot of the mountain

346
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,890
and the vine was put down.

347
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,940
The murderer went up and down through the vine

348
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,410
and then burned it

349
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,400
to wipe all the traces.

350
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,620
With the vine,

351
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,690
he wouldn't need anyone's help

352
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,840
to go up and down the Kanyun Peak.

353
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,210
But it's conspicuous

354
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,480
to hang a vine under the basket.

355
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,160
Why didn't Xin Jue notice it?

356
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,880
Unless he's the one who did it.

357
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,370
He's the Machete Ghost.

358
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,060
But Xin Jue uses a sword.

359
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,650
Who says the Machete Ghost can't use a sword?

360
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,260
I have another question.

361
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,140
Why did he dump the body parts in plain sight?

362
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,860
To become a hero and set an example.

363
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,570
The Machete Ghost is rumored

364
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,850
to be a ghost hero.

365
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,020
That guard said

366
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,300
the Machete Ghost killed innocent people.

367
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,540
Why is he a hero?

368
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,530
Those guards are afraid of him,

369
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,120
but the girls in the Girls' Mansion

370
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,580
all look forward to his coming.

371
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,060
Why?

372
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,560
It's said that many years ago,

373
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,099
the Machete Ghost's wife was abducted here.

374
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,290
He came to find her but got killed.

375
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:15,890
Then

376
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,680
something very unusual happened.

377
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,060
Tell us.

378
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,890
The mountain god appeared.

379
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,220
He pitied the Machete Ghost

380
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:29,589
and used his magic

381
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:31,400
to turn the Machete Ghost into a real ghost

382
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,300
who has been upholding justice since then.

383
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,520
I see.

384
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,800
Miss Qing'er.

385
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,800
Save your bedtime story for another day.

386
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,150
What we're looking for now

387
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,350
is the Machete Ghost in the real world.

388
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,090
The Machete Ghost is in the real world.

389
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,660
His wife Luo Hongyan

390
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,260
was once cooped up in the Girls' Mansion.

391
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:50,960
Miss Qing'er.

392
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,760
Did you know her?

393
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,170
No.

394
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,310
I arrived here too late.

395
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:56,740
She died a few years ago.

396
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,250
Then how did you know about her?

397
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,430
The ledger.

398
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,220
Yu Louchun recorded all his incomes

399
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,930
and expenses these years on his ledger.

400
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,430
Luo Hongyan's name is on it.

401
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,810
So, Miss Qing'er,

402
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,210
do you have the ledger?

403
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:08,980
Of course.

404
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:10,500
I have it.

405
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,060
I planned to use it to kill Yu Louchun,

406
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,930
but someone did it before I could.

407
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,660
Then show it to us.

408
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,760
Now you think I'm useful?

409
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:25,960
Yes, yes, yes.

410
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,730
Miss Qing'er, you're so smart.

411
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,500
It was a brilliant idea to steal the ledger.

412
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,750
I'm so impressed.

413
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,040
Come with me.

414
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:40,650
[Qunfang House]

415
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,190
What is this place?

416
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,480
This is where the girls live.

417
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,160
I've forgotten that it's the laundry day.

418
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:52,970
Wait for me here.

419
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,750
I'll be right back.

420
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,090
Here is the ledger.

421
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,270
Why does it stink?

422
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:09,030
Yu Louchun hit the ceiling after his ledger was lost.

423
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,130
I had to hide it.

424
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,940
Where did you hide it?

425
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:13,970
Under the chamber pot.

426
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,260
Don't be so picky.

427
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:16,600
Take it.

428
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,460
Luo Hongyan's name

429
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,580
is mentioned in an entry eight years ago.

430
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:31,780
Here it is.

431
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,000
Luo Hongyan, female,

432
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,280
23 years old,

433
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,740
bought with 20 bags of opium.

434
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,660
Luo Hongyan was sold here

435
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,070
just for 20 bags of opium.

436
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:43,370
Dongfang Hao?

437
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,700
Dongfang Hao sold Luo Hongyan here.

438
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,290
Who else would trade girls for opium?

439
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,650
He sold me here too.

440
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,840
I can never forget

441
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,040
the stink of opium on him.

442
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,420
If the Machete Ghost aims at revenging his wife,

443
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:58,840
his next target

444
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,250
will be Dongfang Hao.

445
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,050
Let's go.

446
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,060
Dongfang Hao

447
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,380
is already dead.

448
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,050
The Hash Slash.

449
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,730
We're too late.

450
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,650
He killed Dongfang Hao in this room.

451
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,460
That's a very useful clue.

452
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,030
How could this happen?

453
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,070
He's dead.

454
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,510
Dongfang Hao is dead too?

455
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,230
What happened?

456
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,610
Does the Machete Ghost want to kill us all

457
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,800
instead of just Yu Louchun?

458
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:48,950
That question

459
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:52,030
can only be answered by the Machete Ghost.

460
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,490
Have you found him, Physician Li?

461
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,250
Everyone,

462
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,100
can I have a smell of you?

463
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,660
You can smell out the murderer?

464
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,540
You're a great physician.

465
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,830
Do you also have an incredible sense of smell?

466
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,250
Dongfang Hao's room stinks of opium.

467
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,680
Killing him in the room

468
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,220
would make the murderer smell of it too.

469
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,000
So we just need to have a smell of you.

470
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,840
Please hold out your hands.

471

What do you mean, Physician Li?

474
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,810
I don't smell like opium.

475
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,490
That's what gave you away.

476
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,270
We've been running around the whole morning for the case.

477

Guard Xin, it's amazing

478
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,880
that you don't have a sweaty smell

479
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,320
and even smell like soap.

480
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,050
I just took a shower and changed.

481
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,160
What's wrong with that?

482
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,410
There's nothing wrong with that.

483
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:32,990
But your master just died

484
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:33,790
and the antidote was stolen.

485
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,790
You shouldn't be in the mood for showering and changing.

If I'm right,

you're the Machete Ghost, aren't you?

You saw my sword yesterday.

It's in the shape of a pine needle.

Why are you still suspecting me?

491

512
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,310
and wanted to kill Yu Louchun.

513
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,680
But I didn't kill him.

514
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,750
Seven years ago, my wife was sold to the Girls' Mansion.

515
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,170
I came to find her and was told that she killed herself.

516
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,780
Yu Louchun was skilled in martial arts

517
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,790
and took me down.

518
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:39,770
To stay alive,

519
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,260
I took the Loyal Potion and became his guard.

520
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:44,410
I'm…

521
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,150
I'm a coward who couldn't protect my wife

522
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:49,160
and became my enemy's lackey to stay alive.

523
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,050
How could I have the courage to kill Yu Louchun?

524
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,470
What a touching story.

525
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,740
But you changed your clothes

526
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:57,840
because you killed Dongfang Hao, didn't you?

527
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,120
When I saw the words written in blood on the tree this morning,

528
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,780
I was worried that someone might frame me.

529
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:02,940
When I came back,

530
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,320
I saw those treasures and the machete.

531
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:07,100
The machete was stained with opium powder

532
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,990
so I thought it must have something to do with Dongfang Hao.

533
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:12,550
When I got to his room, he was already dead.

534
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,740
Only then did I realize that I was set up.

535
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,850
I hurried back to shower and change.

536
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,320
Before I could put these things away,

537
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,520
I was called out.

538
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,200
I…

539
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,000
Xin Jue, come out!

540
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,090
What's this?

541
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,580
I saw you hiding something

542
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,100
outside the door just now.

543
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,500
I dug it out and it's actually the antidote.

544
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,110
You killed Yu Louchun

545
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:34,360
and hid the treasures.

546
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,500
Now you're keeping the antidote for yourself?

547
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,590
Are you going to use it alone

548
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,040
and watch us die?

549
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,740
-You're dead!
-Wait.

550
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,520
Now that the murderer has been found,

551
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,610
the Baichuan Court will decide his punishment tomorrow.

552
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,190
Please calm down.

553
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,340
The antidote is two months' worth.

554
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,330
You scumbag don't deserve to take it.

555
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,310
Lock him up in the woodshed.

556
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,960
I shouldn't have hidden the antidote,

557
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,980
but it was put on my table

558
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,890
with the treasures.

559
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:00,140
I just want to stay alive. What's wrong with that?

560
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,050
Mr. Fang. Physician Li.

561
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,310
I didn't do it. I didn't do it!

562
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,800
I'm being framed. I'm being framed!

563
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,210
Move.

564
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,460
The Baichuan Court

565
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,860
lives up to its reputation.

566
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,510
You said you could solve the case tomorrow,

567
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,500
but you solved it today.

568
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,390
You're so amazing.

569
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,660
I admire you.

570
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:27,390
I finally got a new topic for my poetry and paintings.

571
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,370
I haven't been in the Central Plains for long

572
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,970
and thought people here only cared about profits and pleasure.

573
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,000
You two are wise men.

574
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,960
I respect you.

575
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,380
It's getting late.

576
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,810
Go back and have a good sleep.

577
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,710
After my colleagues from the Baichuan Court arrive tomorrow,

578
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:55,420
we'll go down the mountain.

579
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:58,910
I'm so disappointed.

580
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,290
Who'd have known the Machete Ghost was a coward?

581
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:05,880
Don't worry.

582
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,210
Li Lianhua.

583
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:18,180
[Girls' Mansion]

584
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:23,070
[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

585
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,490
Li Lianhua.

586
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,220
What's wrong?

587
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,090
Xin Jue doesn't have the ice shard.

588
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,900
Did Yu Louchun hide it somewhere else?

589
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,180
Xin Jue doesn't know

590
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:38,100
where the missing parts of Yu Louchun's body are either.

591
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,350
Did Xin Jue hide it somewhere else?

592
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:04,960
Mr. Fang, Physician Li.

593
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:07,200
When these guards saw that Yu Louchun was killed

594
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:07,930
and Xin Jue was locked,

595
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,390
they barged in

596
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:10,190
and tried to…

597
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,180
You're all poisoned

598
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,640
and deserve sympathy

599
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,670
but are here assaulting those poor girls.

600
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:17,470
So pathetic.

601
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,600
They're kept to entertain guests.

602
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:21,320
Who is entertained doesn't matter.

603
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,380
You'll die eventually.

604
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:25,360
So when you die doesn't matter, does it?

605
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,040
The antidote can only last you

606
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,270
for two months.

607
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:30,350
If you do this again,

608
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:33,400
I'll forget about giving you its formula.

609
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,730
Sorry. We won't do it again.

610
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,590
Go, go, go.

611
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,220
Hurry.

612
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:42,980
Girls,

613
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,320
Yu Louchun is dead.

614
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:46,080
Let's leave here together tomorrow.

615
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,180
Qing'er.

616
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,000
Master treated us well.

617
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:50,410
How can you be so ungrateful?

618
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:51,680
He treated us well?

619
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,930
Xifei, are you crazy?

620
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:57,050
We were locked here day after day,

621
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,430
worrying about not having food and clothes

622
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,050
if we lost money,

623
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,500
living in fear of being sent to the guards outside.

624
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,470
How was that treating us well?

625
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,970
The outside world is more dangerous than the Girls' Mansion.

626
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,110
Just look at what those guards

627
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:07,780
did today.

628
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,210
All these years,

629
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,370
it was Master who protected us.

630
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,680
That was imprisonment, not protection.

631
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,020
He locked us here

632
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,420
as if we were animals.

633
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:18,260
He never treated us like humans!

634
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,420
Binrong. Yuyan.

635
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:21,650
Say something.

636
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:29,920
You're all crazy.

637
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,810
Being locked here has made all of you crazy.

638
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,870
Do whatever you want, you cowards.

639
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,280
Since you like being cooped up,

640
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,770
lock yourselves here forever

641
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,200
and say prayers for him every day.

642
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,760
Thank you for finding out the truth

643
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,220
and avenging Master.

644
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,050
Do you not hate Yu Louchun at all?

645
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,300
The outside world

646
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,990
is too dangerous for women.

647
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,180
We got no worries when we stayed here serving Master.

648
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,570
Entertaining one person

649
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,990
is easier than entertaining lots of people.

650
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:00,610
But…

651
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,090
Not everyone wants the same thing.

652
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:05,560
I wish you all the best.

653
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,820
They've been cooped up here for too long

654
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:25,910
and gotten used to it.

655
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,260
Don't force them.

656
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,180
They're cowards.

657
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,450
So is Xin Jue.

658
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,850
Is everyone in the martial world so cowardly?

659
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,520
That's so boring.

660
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:35,950
Some people are fearless,

661
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,030
some just want to stay alive.

662
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:39,780
That's the real martial world.

663
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,060
Li Lianhua.

664
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,930
You've been quiet tonight.

665
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,210
What are you thinking?

666
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:49,910
I'm thinking

667
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:53,470
why there was mud on the flower.

668
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,050
I didn't see any mud.

669
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:59,470
I mean the night of Mountains Red.

670
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,420
Flowers grow in the soil.

671
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,620
What's weird about that?

672
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,800
The hibiscus tree is more than three meters high.

673
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,270
The flowers blooming high were stained with mud.

674
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:14,880
That's very weird.

675
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,690
Maybe the girls dropped them on the ground when picking them.

676
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:19,660
It was mud splash

677
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:20,840
so the flowers weren't stained

678
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,230
by being dropped to the ground.

679
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,550
How did the girls splash mud

680
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,660
over the flowers three meters high?

681
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:34,950
Also,

682
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,690
half of the body was in plain sight.

683
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:40,330
Why is the other half hidden?

684
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,380
Xin Jue admitted that he was the Machete Ghost.

685
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,390
But why wouldn't he confess to murder?

686
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,070
It's obvious.

687
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,110
What?

688
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,950
The answer is obvious.

689
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:55,430
Obvious?

690
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,680
Fine. Tell us what you think.

691
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,800
You tell me a secret

692
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,820
and I help you three times in the Fragrant Mountain.

693
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,360
Is this the third favor?

694
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,040
Don't push your luck.

695
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,230
Why don't you tell me the secret first?

696
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:09,500
Who knows if you'll go back on your word?

697
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,520
How could you say that, Fei?

698
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,230
Have I ever gone back on my word openly?

699
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,140
Don't look so sulky.

700
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:20,870
Fine. I'll tell you.

701
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,040
You said

702
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:26,540
you know you don't want me to die

703
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,560
but don't know why.

704
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,240
The reason

705
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,340
is that you want me

706
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,800
to save an important person for you.

707
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:32,880
Save someone?

708
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,440
Who's it?

709
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,350
That's another question.

710
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,310
Fei, tell us.

711
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:42,300
What have you found?

712
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,710
The cuts on those three bodies are different.

713
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,260
The cuts on the three of them

714
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,760
look the same,

715
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,500
but when examining more carefully,

716
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:00,000
we can notice differences in the murderers' states of mind.

717
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:04,400
The cuts on Dongfang Hao are quite calm.

718
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,630
Those on Yu Louchun

719
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:08,570
are determined.

720
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,770
Those on the head guard are hesitant.

721
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,430
So there are three murderers?

722
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:15,670
It's imitation.

723
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:17,000
Imitation?

724
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,970
Don't get distracted by the Hash Slash.

725
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,930
Yu Louchun died first.

726
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,280
The head guard is the second.

727
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,940
To imitate the Hash Slash

728
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,400
on Yu Louchun's body,

729
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,650
the murderer left slashes on the head guard that looked like hash marks.

730
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,220
Same goes for Dongfang Hao.

731
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,170
But the cuts on the head guard show a different state of mind

732
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,030
from those on Dongfang Hao.

733
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,320
That's because the murderer was inexperienced

734
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,180
when killing the head guard.

735
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,750
When he killed Dongfang Hao,

736
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,710
he was much more skilled.

737
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,250
Li Lianhua.

738
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:44,420
That's not right.

739
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,300
Yu Louchun died first

740
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,250
but the cuts on him are the most skilled.

741
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,700
Why did the murderer become less skilled

742
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,860
when killing the head guard?

743
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,510
Also,

744
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,590
if Yu Louchun died first,

745
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,230
where is the machete that ended him?

746
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,980
He couldn't be dismembered without a machete.

747
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,700
You remind me.

748
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,960
We haven't found that machete yet.

749
00:33:59,230 --> 00:33:59,800
No.

750
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,210
No one can do the Hash Slash without a machete.

751
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,060
We don't know how the murderer

752
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,990
dismembered Yu Louchun without a machete,

753
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,370
but since he was capable of that,

754
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,370
we can be sure that Xin Jue is not the murderer.

755
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,420
Because in that case, he wouldn't have to hide his machete

756
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,520
to arouse suspicion.

757
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,739
The missing part of Yu Louchun's body

758
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,730
can definitely tell us who killed him.

759
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,590
That's all we need to know

760
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,909
that Xin Jue is not the murderer?

761
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:22,840
And this.

762
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,500
Take it, Fei.

763
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,610
We thought

764
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,630
that Xin Jue is the most likely one

765
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:30,350
who hung the vine under the cane basket.

766
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,040
Yes.

767
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,350
He burned the vine after he came down the peak.

768
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,239
That's not right.

769
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,340
Think about it.

770
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,699
If the vine were put down from above

771
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,730
and lit from below,

772
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:41,239
only one end would be burnt.

773
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,940
But both ends of the vine are burnt.

774
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,270
Didn't you notice that?

775
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:48,620
Do you mean someone is trying to make us believe

776
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:50,409
that Xin Jue is the murderer?

777
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,679
Xin Jue is not the murderer?

778
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,360
Then who is the murderer?

779
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,340
The murderers are a few smart people.

780
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:57,610
A few?

781
00:34:58,219 --> 00:34:59,480
Xin Jue isn't the murderer,

782
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,110
so the killings required collective cooperation to be done.

783
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,210
Let's go meet Xin Jue.

784
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,190
Those guards beat you like this?

785
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,500
They beat me the same way

786
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,920
I used to beat them.

787
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,800
Now all the evidence points to you.

788
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:34,180
Tell me whatever you want to say.

789
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:37,960
Tomorrow morning,

790
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,530
I'll die from the Loyal Potion.

791
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,930
No one can save me now.

792
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:51,650
You…

793
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,520
Why did you save me?

794
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,380
I gave you the antidote

795
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,750
because I don't want anyone to be wrongfully convicted.

796
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,150
I didn't kill Yu Louchun.

797
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,020
Neither did I kill Dongfang Hao.

798
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,650
But I've sinned.

799
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,820
From the moment I worked for Yu Louchun,

800
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,840
I was beyond redemption.

801
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:28,350
Sirs,

802
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,110
ask me whatever you want.

803
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:31,760
I'll tell you everything I know.

804
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,010
Did you notice anything or anyone

805
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,520
unusual yesterday?

806
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:41,820
Yesterday?

807
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:45,010
We were preparing for Mountains Red,

808
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,940
so the whole Girls' Mansion was unusual.

809
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,740
Was there anything too strange?

810
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,530
No.

811
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:53,540
What about you?

812
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:56,550
Me?

813
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:00,740
You claim that someone knows you're the Machete Ghost

814
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:01,660
and framed you.

815
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,820
Maybe you can recall something unusual

816
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,790
about yourself.

817
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,890
About myself?

818
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,170
Except that I woke up very early,

819
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:16,960
nothing was unusual.

820
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,820
Did you wake up very early yesterday?

821
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:22,360
Yes.

822
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,440
As Yu Louchun's guard, I went to bed at midnight

823
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,500
and had to get up at four.

824
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,300
Usually, when the bell chimes four,

825
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,360
I'm still very sleepy.

826
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,380
But yesterday, I waited for a long time after waking up

827
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,880
before the bell chimed four.

828
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:38,710
The moon.

829
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:44,910
Yes. Something's wrong with the moon.

830
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,150
Calm down.

831
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:46,840
What's wrong?

832
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,260
The moon is wrong so the time is wrong.

833
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:50,330
It's the eighth today.

834
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,080
Yesterday was the seventh.

835
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,300
The moon at midnight

836
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:54,980
should hang low in the western sky.

837
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,350
After I met Yu Louchun here last night,

838
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:58,810
the bell chimed midnight.

839
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:00,770
Bihuang was dancing at that moment.

840
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:03,120
But the moon was in the west above her head,

841
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,720
hanging high in the sky.

842
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,990
So the chimes of midnight

843
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,260
were early last night.

844
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,340
Xin Jue went to bed at twelve and got up at four.

845
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,920
Since he isn't the murderer,

846
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:13,880
the real murderer had only four hours

847
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,720
to go up the peak and commit murder.

848
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,800
But if the bell chimed early,

849
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:21,040
the murderer would have more time.

850
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,700
If Yu Louchun was killed

851
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,500
before four o'clock,

852
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,090
why was his severed arm still bleeding

853
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,480
when it was found in the morning?

854
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,060
Let's find out why the bell chimed early first.

855
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,180
The bell is in a faraway temple.

856
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,710
We can definitely find clues there.

857
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,060
But those from the Baichuan Court won't arrive until tomorrow

858
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,030
and only then will the drawbridge be put down.

859
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,260
Fang Xiaobao,

860
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,210
how can we go to that temple now?

861
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:47,370
Fei!

862
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:49,870
You…

863
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,110
Don't point at me.

864
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,830
Go to the temple with the bell

865
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,430
and find out why the bell chimed midnight early last night!

866
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:56,970
It's fine that he orders me.

867
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:58,320
Who are you to order me around?

868
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,310
You helped Li Lianhua three times in exchange for one secret.

869
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:02,480
I'll tell you a secret too.

870
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,600
You just need to help me once.

871
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,250
What do you think?

872
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,260
Isn't it a bargain?

873
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,730
Can I believe you?

874
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,140
I'll tell you the secret first.

875
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,250
You used to be a super villain

876
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,380
who was great at martial arts

877
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,940
and killed lots of people.

878
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,020
Many people wanted you dead but no one dare to mess with you.

879
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,320
What do you think?

880
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,370
It is a bargain, isn't it?

881
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,410
You can go to the temple now.

882
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:32,320
OK.

883
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:41,640
Fang Xiaobao.

884
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,750
You shouldn't tell him that

885
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,350
so early.

886
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,350
You're so glib.

887
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:49,130
You can make it up later.

888
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:52,430
By the way,

889
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,020
what should we do next?

890
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,030
You tell me!

891
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,090
Detective Fang.

892
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,400
She danced on the Zhaixing Stage the whole night.

893
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:04,250
We should meet her.

894
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:09,120
[Qunfang House]

895
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:15,400
Where are you going?

896
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:16,830
I'm moving out.

897
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,770
I'll leave here tomorrow morning.

898
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:20,610
I don't want to stay

899
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,360
with those cowards.

900
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:24,560
Aren't you supposed to be with Xin Jue?

901
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:25,440
What are you doing here?

902
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,740
Bihuang danced all night last night.

903
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,120
How is she?

904
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,150
You're very caring.

905
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:32,720
I…

906
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,700
Come tomorrow.

907
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,350
Bihuang caught a cold last night

908
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:36,900
and has gone to bed.

909
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:37,850
Qing'er.

910
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:40,640
What kind of person is Bihuang?

911
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,500
She's the housekeeper of the Girls' Mansion.

912
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,350
She seems strict

913
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,180
but is actually soft-hearted.

914
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:45,170
She's a good person.

915
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,030
Did she like Yu Louchun?

916
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:50,670
She was meticulous with everything he asked her to do.

917
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,560
Of course she liked him.

918
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,280
Yu Louchun must have put a spell on her.

919
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,450
Was there anything

920
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:57,820
in her charge yesterday

921
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,070
during Mountains Red?

922
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:00,920
The rouge.

923
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,310
She made the girls'

924
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,770
rosy rouge herself.

925
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,180
I have some here.

926
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:06,960
Here.

927
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:17,490
There are opium poppies in it.

928
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:21,580
Are there opium poppies in the Girls' Mansion?

929
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,020
There is an opium poppy field behind the mountain.

930
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,520
Opium poppies are used to make opium.

931
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,820
So Yu Louchun

932
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,250
did illegal business to make money.

933
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:32,300
No wonder that junkie Dongfang Hao

934
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,220
sold him girls to cozy up to him.

935
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,090
Bihuang has opium poppies

936
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:39,320
so she could make anesthetics here.

937
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:40,400
Do you remember

938
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,780
the fish soup during Mountains Red?

939
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,760
Late Spring Nowhere to be Found.

940
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,760
There was Baizhi and Danggui in it.

941
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,880
Opium poppy, Baizhi, and Danggui

942
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:54,980
make up an anesthetic.

943
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,620
That's why those who had the fish soup

944
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:59,320
and kissed the girls fell into heavy slumber yesterday.

945
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:02,170
No wonder they all slept in.

946
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,110
Li Lianhua.

947
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:07,460
I fell asleep because I used her glass

948
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:08,170
by accident.

949
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,680
What happened to you?

950
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,050
Don't ask so many questions.

951
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,260
-I…
-Miss Qing'er.

952
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:19,860
Last night,

953
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:21,680
the girls gave the guests

954
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,140
hibiscuses as gifts.

955
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:24,300
Where did they pick them?

956
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,020
The best hibiscuses here

957
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,700
grow on Yu Louchun's Kanyuan Peak.

958
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,210
So we have to go the Kanyun Peak

959
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,430
to find other evidence against Bihuang.

960
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:37,930
Are you suspecting Bihuang?

961
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:39,480
It can't be her.

962
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,380
She's very nice

963
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:41,720
and liked Yu Louchun very much.

964
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,290
How could it be her?

965
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:44,290
Miss Qing'er.

966
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:47,290
If Bihuang really liked Yu Louchun,

967
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:49,850
why would she put her silk handkerchief

968
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,280
among the items?

969
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:54,950
She knew that if her item got picked, she'd have to sleep with the guest

970
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,880
but she did it nonetheless

971
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:00,200
because she wanted to be punished in front of everyone.

972
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:02,410
Why did she want that?

973
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,300
The answer is at the Kanyun Peak.

974
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,900
I see.

975
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:18,530
Li Lianhua.

976
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:19,620
Have you figured out

977
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:21,690
the reason why Bihuang wanted to be punished on the Zhaixing Stage?

978
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:24,430
She needed to know the situation at the Kanyun Peak

979
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:26,320
and keep an eye on the guards.

980
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:27,710
In the Girls' Mansion,

981
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,390
the only place where she could do that

982
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,680
is the Zhaixing Stage.

983
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,360
Do you mean that Bihuang was keeping watch

984
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,120
on the Zhaixing Stage for the real murderer?

985
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,280
Who on earth is the murderer?

986
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,560
Yu Louchun's missing body parts can tell us the answer.
