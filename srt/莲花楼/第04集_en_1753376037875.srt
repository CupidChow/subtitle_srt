YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Kissing myself thousands of times

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The most reluctant moment is that moment

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Live in the world, travel thousands of miles

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who doesn't wander around

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds and the moon on the cliff

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Live in the world, young love stories

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The whole world is drunk in sorrow

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The journey to the end of the world is like a dream

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Live in the world, travel thousands of miles

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Who doesn't wander around

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds and the moon on the cliff

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Live in the world, young love stories

14

Live in the world

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The End

Episode 2

19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I heard that the dead can always see ghosts

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'll help you remember

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Are you crazy

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Not a ghost, it's that fake god doctor Li Lianhua

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Li Lianhua, she is the demon of the Golden Garden

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
She pretended to be a ghost and killed Wang Fu

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I think, I think Miss Yucheng was killed by her

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Don't kill people

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Not like that

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Who is Li Lianhua

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I am Li Lianhua

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Li Lianhua

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Take Li Lianhua in

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What are you doing

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
This matter is not clear

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Don't kill innocent

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Take the others back to the prison

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yes

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Hurry up

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Young master, don't you suspect that fake god doctor

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Said it was her ghost

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
This matter has not been settled yet

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
If she is really innocent

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
She is not harming her

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What are you doing

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I am a detective in the court of Fu Rencheng

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Don't you remember me

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I am Fang Dobin

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Family Affairs Department, Fang Ce

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We met at the birthday banquet of Lin Su

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,400
At that time, Lin Su also said

50
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,000
The engagement between you and Miss Yucheng

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I didn't expect to see you again so soon

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Really, Mr. Fang

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
We met with Miss Yucheng at Xiaomei Inn

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This matter is a long story

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Mr. Zongzheng

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I don't know if

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Make more misunderstandings

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,540
It'sブ

60
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,680
Thanks Texas

61
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,360
Today problem

62
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,740
We also don't need a win

63
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,200
Thank you

64
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,420
Those someone

65
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,300
Don't rest until you are recovered

66
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,740
and priests

67
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,680
you are able to この

68
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,780
right

69
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,780
I'm not afraid of you.

70
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,540
The hospitality of Lady Yu

71
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,220
is too warm.

72
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,980
What nonsense!

73
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,500
I told you

74
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,460
I have a bad temper

75
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,980
and I don't have much patience.

76
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,700
I'll teach you a good lesson

77
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,140
for the crimes that I've committed.

78
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,140
Tell me.

79
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,740
Why did you pretend to be a demon?

80
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,620
Lady Yu trusts me very much.

81
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,620
Do you know who the demon is?

82
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,260
When will you ask me?

83
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:04,620
Do it.

84
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,660
Are you okay?

85
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:26,740
What do you think?

86
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,900
I didn't expect Li Erhui to summon you.

87
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,460
You're here, aren't you?

88
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,900
Who are you?

89
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,460
It's a misunderstanding.

90
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,820
It's a misunderstanding.

91
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,540
Hong Zhu.

92
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,780
This is the son of the current Minister Fang, Fang Duobin.

93
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,020
It turns out that he is the young master of Tianji Hall,

94
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:47,940
Young Master Fang.

95
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,580
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,660
I'm sorry for the misdeed of the guest.

97
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,180
Mr. Fang.

98
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,660
I'm sorry for the misdeed of the guest.

99
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,460
I'm sorry for the misdeed.

100
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,660
I didn't mean to involve you.

101
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:58,940
I'm really sorry.

102
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,020
You're sorry

103
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,020
for the innocent lives of those who were killed online.

104
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,660
Lady Yu said that the guard was a slave

105
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,580
and he killed you.

106
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,500
But the owner of Lotus Pavilion is not a guest.

107
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,260
He is a famous and amazing doctor.

108
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,020
Do you want to kill him without any reason?

109
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,780
You're bragging about me?

110
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,580
You're famous.

111
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,500
It's not necessary.

112
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,620
But it doesn't mean that I'm innocent.

113
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,380
Tianji Hall has never participated in the dispute in the martial arts world.

114
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,460
Young Master Fang likes to be nosy.

115
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,140
But I'm also handling family affairs.

116
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,340
I don't mean to cause any trouble.

117
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,700
Since it's a misunderstanding,

118
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,740
I'll get someone to prepare a good carriage

119
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,740
to send Mr. Fang and this doctor

120
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,580
out of the city to return home.

121
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,780
Lady Yu, please

122
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,020
follow my girl

123
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,500
and send her back to the mansion to report to the police.

124
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,780
I don't plan to leave.

125
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,900
What do you mean?

126
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,060
Yu Si, my little sister, was killed in this case.

127
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,700
I must find the person who killed her.

128
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,260
Yu Gong, as a detective of Baichuan Academy,

129
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,020
I must find out the blood and capture the murderer.

130
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:11,100
So, before I find out the truth,

131
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,060
please don't hurt anyone anymore.

132
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,540
When did I agree to let you investigate the case?

133
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,940
Young Master Fang, don't be so arrogant.

134
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,340
Yu Cheng is trying to make himself a good man.

135
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,580
He has to follow the law of the West.

136
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,340
What do you think, Zhong Zhenxiong?

137
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,140
Ms. Hong, the detective of Baichuan Academy

138
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,340
has the right to intervene.

139
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,980
Lady Yu, since you don't believe that your sister

140
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,340
was killed by a villain,

141
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,860
do you only want to kill someone

142
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,580
and not find out the truth?

143
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,180
Killing people will only hide the truth.

144
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,220
The real murderer who killed your sister

145
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,820
may have escaped death.

146
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,020
Do you really dare to do that?

147
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,140
I don't have the patience.

148
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,940
I only give you one day

149
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,660
to find out the truth of my sister's death.

150
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,540
If you can't find it out one day,

151
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,660
please leave the prison immediately.

152
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,980
I want to bury all these people with Shuang'er.

153
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,260
I won't let anyone

154
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,860
to come and break the rules of my prison.

155
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,980
Just one day.

156
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,940
Young Master Fang, you are really thoughtful.

157
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,660
You said I was a murderer before.

158
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,900
Now you suddenly save me.

159
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,540
I'm just temporarily removing your suspicion

160
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,340
in case you are framed by Yu Hongzhu.

161
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,140
Really?

162
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,420
I'm removing the suspicion so quickly.

163
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,060
As you said,

164
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,780
the body of Yu Qiushuang was destroyed by the big fire.

165
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,500
If you did it,

166
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,940
you don't have to give me all the clues.

167
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,940
But you are not the murderer of Mian Shan.

168
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,900
Or maybe you are not.

169
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,020
Young Master Fang is really smart.

170
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,980
Since I don't have any suspicion,

171
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,980
I'll leave first.

172
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,580
Wait.

173
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,420
If this case is not solved,

174
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,180
the prisoner will die.

175
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,780
You have to stay and investigate the case with me.

176
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,380
I stay?

177
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,180
Young Master Fang,

178
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,580
you promised me to solve the case.

179
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,820
You are not me.

180
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,100
Why should I stay?

181
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,780
Besides, I hate to get involved

182
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,540
in the business of Jiangwu.

183
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,500
If you dare to run away,

184
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,060
I'll dare to persuade Mrs. Yu

185
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,060
to let Yuchen release you from the chase of Jiangwu

186
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,260
and clean up your old fox's family.

187
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,700
And...

188
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,900
Look at this.

189
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,500
I didn't expect your dog to be loyal to you.

190
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,060
It chased Yuchen from the Xiaomian Inn.

191
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,700
It's a pity that I met it first.

192
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,180
Let me tell you.

193
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,820
I'm not a drug addict.

194
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,420
The fox is just an ordinary dog.

195
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,660
Who told its owner to abandon it?

196
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,500
Do you think it's a stew or braised?

197
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,540
They should be similar.

198
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,180
Why are you so close to a dog?

199
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,660
I'm not a detective.

200
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,100
Why do you make me not help you?

201
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,500
Aren't you a doctor?

202
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,220
If you can cure Yuchuan,

203
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,900
you can't solve the case.

204
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,300
I can't do anything to make him alive.

205
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,700
Then be my coroner.

206
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,780
You're so sharp.

207
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,500
You can use it.

208
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,100
Then let me go after finding out the truth, right?

209
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,380
The body of Miss Yuchuan

210
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,060
was put in the hall when she came back.

211
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,340
But suddenly, half of it was burned.

212
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,500
She couldn't bear to see it,

213
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,740
so she put it in the ice room.

214
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,980
You can check it.

215
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,180
Okay, thank you.

216
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,140
That's it?

217
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,620
You can't even stand the scene

218
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,900
and you want to be a detective?

219
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,300
Go home early.

220
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,540
What's the big deal?

221
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,100
Is there any problem?

222
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,460
The smell is so strong.

223
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,700
Is it because the body was burned?

224
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,780
No.

225
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,980
It's strange.

226
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,380
It's only been a day.

227
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,980
The body was ruined so quickly.

228
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,380
The gold on the neck is perfect.

229
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,060
No pressure and no damage.

230
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,940
It's not because of the ghost.

231
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,700
Wang Hu was killed by the Jijin.

232
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,380
But Yuchuang was killed by the ghost.

233
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,700
Did you see that?

234
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,940
There's a blood clot.

235
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,260
Her abdomen is injured.

236
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,260
It seems that the ghost is easy to find.

237
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,500
But the blood clot

238
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,780
hasn't been removed for so long.

239
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,020
It seems that

240
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,220
this Yuchuang

241
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,820
has died long ago.

242
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,940
There's another death that's hard to detect.

243
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,820
Did you see that?

244
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,020
The second one

245
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,340
is the Jijin that's attacking the heart.

246
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,580
Jijin?

247
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,020
The Jijin and the wound?

248
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,460
Aren't the two wounds

249
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,820
conflicted?

250
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,180
You're smart.

251
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,580
The fight is close.

252
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,180
The real attack is far.

253
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,180
If it's a heavy blow,

254
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,340
why would you need to

255
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,580
hit the side of the body?

256
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,740
If you're going to die from a far attack,

257
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,380
you don't need to hit the side.

258
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,540
You don't need to

259
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,060
hit the side.

260
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,220
There's a big confusion in this.

261
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,460
And

262
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,420
don't you think it's too smart?

263
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,620
Indeed.

264
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,180
Legend has it that Yuchuang is weak in martial arts.

265
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,340
With his ability,

266
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,900
he can kill him twice

267
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,340
in such a powerful way.

268
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,540
The murderer killed Wang Fu

269
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,060
just to make Yuchuang

270
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,460
look like he's real

271
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,580
when he was killed by the ghost.

272
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,020
If Yu Hongtu didn't come back in time,

273
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,340
Yuchuang's death

274
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,300
would be transferred to the ghost.

275
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,940
Wang Fu died in the backyard.

276
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,340
If you insist on saying there's a ghost,

277
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,140
it means someone is pretending to be a ghost.

278
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,700
As long as we find out the real murderer,

279
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,420
we can give Wang Fu a divine decree.

280
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,140
It's not a ghost.

281
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,220
In the Xiaomian Inn,

282
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,860
only Yunjiao and those guards

283
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,100
will use their inner force and hidden weapons.

284
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,460
I think they should have

285
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,700
killed Shuang'er.

286
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,900
Madam Yu, you've come to the conclusion too early.

287
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,060
We've checked

288
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,540
the room before.

289
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,780
Madam Yu's window was broken for years.

290
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,820
It was blocked by the tenants and couldn't be opened.

291
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,060
There's no secret door to the room.

292
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,300
There are guards watching the room.

293
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,180
So,

294
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,740
whether it's Miss Yunjiao

295
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,980
or the escort,

296
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,180
they have no chance

297
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,860
to transfer Madam Yu.

298
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,540
That's even more confusing.

299
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,940
How could someone disappear in the room

300
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,940
and die somewhere else?

301
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,620
Mr. Yu

302
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,700
has a good analysis.

303
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,420
May I ask

304
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,140
why Miss Yunjiao

305
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,420
left home?

306
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,940
When did she leave?

307
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,660
She disappeared a few days before the Mid-Autumn Festival.

308
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,380
I didn't see her this morning.

309
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,100
Her maid Qing Ling said

310
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,940
she was unhappy that day.

311
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,740
She wanted to go out alone

312
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,100
and not be followed.

313
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,260
But she didn't come back at night.

314
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,420
Yes.

315
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,220
My sister was stung by a poisonous bug

316
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,620
and had scars on her face.

317
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,540
She thought she could heal the scars

318
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,340
before the wedding.

319
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,940
But she was still in a bad mood.

320
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,020
So, she was depressed.

321
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,540
That's why she ran out.

322
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,340
I didn't notice her.

323
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,900
We sent people to look for her all day.

324
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,300
But we received

325
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,580
news of her being killed.

326
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,180
Let's take a look at something.

327
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,340
Do you recognize this?

328
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,260
This golden needle

329
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,180
was found in Miss Yunjiao's heart.

330
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,460
This needle can kill people?

331
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,340
This is

332
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,340
the needle that was stolen by You Si?

333
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,220
How did this thing get out?

334
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,260
Do you know where this needle came from?

335
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,620
The killer pretended to be a thief

336
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,060
and took a lot of money to steal my father's life.

337
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,620
My father killed him.

338
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,020
This needle was stolen by You Si

339
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,660
and was put in my father's hands

340
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,300
and put in the weapon warehouse.

341
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,020
It's been ten years.

342
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,060
No one has touched it.

343
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,780
Bring me the record of the weapon warehouse.

344
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,500
Madam, I've checked it.

345
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,540
The needle was stolen by You Si

346
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,260
and the gold needle was not in the warehouse

347
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,020
half a year ago.

348
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,180
Who took it?

349
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,340
It was

350
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,420
Second Young Mistress.

351
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,260
Leave us.

352
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,220
Yes.

353
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,940
Qiu Shuang has never been in the weapon warehouse

354
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,780
in all these years.

355
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,580
It must be Yunjiao, the little bitch,

356
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,140
who asked Qiu Shuang to come and borrow it.

357
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,260
She has been coming to the imperial city every day

358
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,620
and said she was close to Qiu Shuang.

359
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,100
I really can't see

360
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,020
why she is so sneaky.

361
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,580
It must be Yunjiao who killed Shuang.

362
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,660
Madam Yi,

363
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,900
why do you say that?

364
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,340
How can she get what she wants

365
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,060
if Shuang is not dead?

366
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,820
Young Master Fang,

367
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,460
I think the case is over.

368
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,700
Let's write the case.

369
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,860
The Yun family doesn't want to save the girl's life.

370
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,020
I will make her

371
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,300
suffer like Shuang.

372
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,260
She will die in the fire grave.

373
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,220
Let's go.

374
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,700
I knew it.

375
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,300
You bitch killed Shuang.

376
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,780
I have a thousand ways

377
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,740
to make you suffer.

378
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,660
Tell me the truth.

379
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,620
Stop.

380
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,220
Madam Yi,

381
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,100
are you trying to kill yourself?

382
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,620
I amura치노

383
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,340
I don't know whether or not

384
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,260
to whisper the truth.

385
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,180
See how stupid she is.

386
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,980
If she doesn't frame, how can we have her talk?

387
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,180
Since Younger Miss custom tent,

388
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,900
she was very frightened.

389
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,180
I'm sure he's not sick.

390
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,380
Doctor Li.

391
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,260
Think of a way.

392
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,820
Young Master Fang,

393
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,780
you're really funny.

394
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,580
Young Master Fang said that Mr. Li was a doctor?

395
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:11,940
Great.

396
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,980
I also want to see how Mr. Li's medical skills are.

397
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,060
Whether it's a real one or a fake one,

398
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,420
it's better to treat him.

399
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,580
Of course.

400
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,060
If he can't cure it,

401
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,580
Mrs. Yu can get him up and take the exam.

402
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,220
I won't plead for him.

403
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,860
Then I'll try it.

404
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,620
Don't play tricks.

405
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,340
Didn't Young Master Fang ask me to show my real skills?

406
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,340
Watch out!

407
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,900
Are you actually caring for him?

408
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,180
Ms. Hong, I...

409
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,660
Seems like Miss Yun is severely ill.

410
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,060
Doctor Li cares much about her health!

411
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:51,980
Greetings.

412
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,700
General common sense ensemble.

413
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,260
Is the doctor not well?

414
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,300
He's still fine.

415
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,540
Then why don't you cure him?

416
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,580
Well,

417
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,380
we need to find some medicine in the imperial city.

418
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,700
There's medicine in the imperial city?

419
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,740
I guess there must be.

420
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,580
You'll know when you look for it.

421
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,100
Then cure him.

422
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,660
This Yu Hongzhou

423
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,340
is really cruel.

424
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,100
If he hadn't killed those guards,

425
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,660
there wouldn't be any witness.

426
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,380
Miss, come out.

427
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,620
Miss, that bowl of porridge...

428
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,660
Miss Yun Jiang is not a woman of the imperial city.

429
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,940
But you're good at taking care of her.

430
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,380
Then I want to ask

431
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,860
why your wife

432
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,900
doesn't like Miss Yun Jiang.

433
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,380
Don't be afraid.

434
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,860
We asked these questions

435
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,460
to help you find the murderer

436
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,460
for your second lady.

437
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,020
Aren't you the murderer?

438
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,500
At first,

439
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,540
my wife was good to Miss Yun.

440
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,900
But one time,

441
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,580
Miss Yun stole a love poem

442
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,580
and got hit by her.

443
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,820
She tore the poem into pieces.

444
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,100
Miss Yun was so red.

445
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,020
It was like she was bleeding.

446
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,140
After that,

447
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,500
my wife stopped writing Miss Yun.

448
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,700
How did you write that poem?

449
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,660
I remember

450
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,860
there were two sentences.

451
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,340
The heart is like a pearl, love is hard to solve.

452
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,940
The flowers are flying,

453
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,700
it makes me miss you.

454
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:47,780
Pearl?

455
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,500
Miss Yun Jiang, the love is like a pearl.

456
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,220
It's the fiancee of the Yuxiu Village.

457
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,660
No wonder your wife is so stubborn.

458
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,540
But didn't you notice it?

459
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,180
No.

460
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,900
Miss Yun and Miss Yun have always been good friends.

461
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,060
On the previous few days, on Miss Yun's birthday,

462
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,940
Miss Yun especially picked a piece of

463
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,340
good warm jade for her

464
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,620
as her birthday gift.

465
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,220
Thank you, Miss.

466
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,620
The Love by Hypnotic

467
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,620
Episode 16

468
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,420
Are you looking for medicine

469
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,460
to cure Yun Jiao?

470
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,660
What do you think I'm doing?

471
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,060
You're walking so slowly.

472
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,900
You must be thinking of clues.

473
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,460
You're wrong.

474
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,900
I'm looking for medicine.

475
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,820
Excuse me.

476
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,540
Sir.

477
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,020
What is this place?

478
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,740
This is Madam's house.

479
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,420
I think the osmanthus here is very well-kept.

480
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,580
Madam likes osmanthus.

481
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,740
In the Yuxiu Village, only Madam's house

482
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,660
has osmanthus.

483
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,020
Thank you.

484
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:08,900
Make way, please.

485
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,580
What are you looking for?

486
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,020
I saw it in the foot of the Jade Qiu Mountain.

487
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,020
This red mud is earth-shattering clay.

488
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,020
The flowers are osmanthus flowers.

489
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:50,020
I don't see these two things in the North.

490
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,020
Do you remember the weather at the inn that day?

491
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,020
It was rainy day.

492
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,020
If there are traces of mud and flowers in the foot of Mount Yucheng,

493
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,020
it is said that it will be washed away by the rain.

494
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,020
Then why would it keep you safe?

495
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,020
There is only one possibility.

496
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,020
He died here.

497
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,020
He died in Yucheng.

498
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,020
But first,

499
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,020
if he really died in Yucheng,

500
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,020
how did he appear in the Xiaomin Inn?

501
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,020
Besides, that stone body was clearly just broken.

502
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,020
But secondly,

503
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,020
there are so many martial arts masters helping in Yucheng.

504
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,020
Who would kill him twice without knowing the ghost?

505
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,020
Don't you know when to untie these two things?

506
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,020
No.

507
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,020
No.

508
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,020
One more thing.

509
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,020
When we were in the Xiaomin Inn,

510
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,020
we saw Yucheng enter the inn with our own eyes.

511
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,020
Are you sure that was Yucheng?

512
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,020
What do you mean?

513
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,020
Qingming has already said it.

514
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:56,020
Yucheng has a scar on his face.

515
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,020
He doesn't like to be seen by others.

516
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,020
Do you remember that night,

517
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,020
when Yucheng entered the inn,

518
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,020
he was angry.

519
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,020
He was afraid that others wouldn't see him.

520
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,020
Is his face scarred?

521
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:09,020
You mean someone disguised as Yu Qiushuang?

522
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,020
Think about it.

523
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,020
At the same time,

524
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:16,020
the woman who appeared in Yucheng and Xiaomin Inn

525
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,020
was alone.

526
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,020
Yunjiao.

527
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,020
She is pretending to be crazy now.

528
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,020
She must be related to him.

529
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,020
Sure. You can see that she is pretending to be crazy.

530
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,020
You are so arrogant.

531
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,020
You took a needle and walked in front of her.

532
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,020
Even if she is crazy,

533
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,020
she knows how to turn around.

534
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,020
She doesn't need to be blind.

535
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,020
She must be pretending.

536
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,020
But

537
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,020
she is close to Yu Qiushuang.

538
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,020
Why did she hurt others?

539
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,020
Could it be that

540
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,020
she is really related to Zongzheng Mingzhu?

541
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,020
It's simple.

542
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,020
You will know when you cure Yunjiao's illness.

543
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,020
Mrs. Yue.

544
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,020
The medicine for Yunjiao has been found.

545
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,020
This medicine

546
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,020
can make soup,

547
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,020
liver,

548
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,020
and kidney healthy.

549
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,020
Just take it and you will be cured.

550
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,020
Just these herbs?

551
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,020
Are you kidding me?

552
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,020
How could I be kidding you?

553
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,020
I can guarantee that you can cure it.

554
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,020
I checked.

555
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:21,020
Only Yunjiao has been in touch with Qiushuang recently.

556
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,020
So, the better the better.

557
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,020
If the medicine is not good,

558
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,020
we must make her talk.

559
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,020
Guards.

560
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,020
Boil the herbs for Dr. Li.

561
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,020
Wait a minute, Madam.

562
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,020
To be honest,

563
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:36,020
my herb is a little special.

564
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,020
After it is handed over,

565
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,020
it needs me to make a special medicine

566
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,020
and take it together.

567
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,020
Why didn't you say that?

568
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,020
When will the medicine be ready?

569
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,020
Mrs. Yu promised to

570
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,020
finish the case tomorrow.

571
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,020
It's just right.

572
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,020
Didn't you say that you could cure Yunjiao today?

573
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,020
Why did you change the day?

574
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,020
It's too straightforward.

575
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,020
What is too straightforward?

576
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,020
I didn't sleep well yesterday.

577
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,020
Come on, take a break.

578
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,020
It's not over yet.

579
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,020
How can you sleep?

580
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,020
Mr. Fang,

581
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,020
the case is very important.

582
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,020
But the body is more important.

583
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,020
You know I'm very careful.

584
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,020
Look at you.

585
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,020
You have dark circles and dark eyes.

586
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,020
You are too nervous.

587
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,020
You will have a problem.

588
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,020
Go out first.

589
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,020
You are always like this.

590
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,020
You can always be outside the station.

591
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,020
But I can't.

592
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,020
When I close my eyes now,

593
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,020
I can only think about what happened in the small cotton shop.

594
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,020
The murderer has already planned everything.

595
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,020
The small cotton shop is just a stage.

596
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,020
He helped us get in

597
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,020
and watched a game of ghost killing.

598
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,020
But the people who got in

599
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,020
are all innocent.

600
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,020
This Wang Fu...

601
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,020
Have a drink.

602
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,020
If you didn't take him to risk

603
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,020
with your own will,

604
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,020
or

605
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,020
put him under your own eyes

606
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,020
and watch him get old,

607
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,020
he wouldn't have been in trouble.

608
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,020
Do you think so?

609
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,020
Anyway,

610
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,020
I didn't take good care of Wang Fu.

611
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,020
When I was a teenager,

612
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,020
I was the most ambitious.

613
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,020
I always thought that

614
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,020
I would take the responsibility of the world

615
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,020
on my shoulders.

616
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,020
And I always thought that

617
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,020
I could protect everyone around me.

618
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,020
But in fact,

619
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,020
many things

620
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,020
are not as simple as we think.

621
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,020
And they are not

622
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,020
something that we can control.

623
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,020
You are very sad

624
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,020
about your childhood.

625
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,020
But you don't have to

626
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,020
blame yourself

627
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,020
for all the responsibilities.

628
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,020
People

629
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,020
have to learn to let go of themselves first.

630
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,020
Come on, have some tea.

631
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,020
Are you comforting me?

632
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,020
Didn't you say that

633
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,020
all of you in the Golden Thread Embroidery were poor and evil?

634
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,020
And you are so kind.

635
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,020
So I said that

636
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,020
you were wrong at the beginning.

637
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,020
But I still think it's wrong.

638
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,020
If this Yu Qiushuang

639
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,020
really died in the imperial city,

640
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,020
he would have died more than 70 days later.

641
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,020
Why did he still bleed

642
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,020
when he saw him?

643
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,020
Try it.

644
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,020
Fresh, ice-cold watermelon.

645
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,020
You are still in the mood to eat melons?

646
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,020
The secrets are all inside.

647
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,020
Secrets?

648
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,020
Try it.

649
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,020
It's only been left for a long time.

650
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,020
Why is it still broken?

651
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,020
The body of the victim.

652
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,020
You react fast.

653
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,020
How can the ice-cold watermelon

654
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,020
always break faster?

655
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,020
No wonder the body of Yu Qiushuang

656
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,020
was still fine when he was in the Xiaomian Inn.

657
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,020
When he arrived in the imperial city,

658
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,020
he was in a bad shape.

659
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,020
It turned out that he was put in the ice-cold watermelon

660
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,020
with the ice-cold watermelon.

661
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,020
What about the ice-cold watermelon?

662
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,020
It should have been caused by blood.

663
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,020
I'm afraid it's still the blood-curdling ice

664
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,020
that's frozen.

665
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,020
This way,

666
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,020
it can be melted

667
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,020
and turn into ancient blood

668
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,020
to make the fake death of Yu Qiushuang.

669
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,020
Such a small place.

670
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,020
No wonder it was burned.

671
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,020
It can't be hidden.

672
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,020
This is only the first life of it.

673
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,020
Think about it.

674
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,020
If Yu Qiushuang died in the imperial city,

675
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:28,020
why did he appear in the Xiaomian Inn?

676
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,020
Because at the beginning,

677
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:33,020
Yu Qiushuang was in this statue.

678
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,020
Let's go to the Xiaomian Inn.

679
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,020
I'm going to the kitchen.

680
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,020
Why are you going to the kitchen?

681
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,020
You'll get a headache if you go to the kitchen.

682
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,020
There's a blood footprint left on the ground that day.

683
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,020
Come and have a look.

684
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,020
I'll show you the blood footprint.

685
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,020
Excuse me.

686
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,020
What's going on?

687
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,060
The

688
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,020
blood of red-brown grass is red.

689
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,020
But once it meets water,

690
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,020
it will turn red.

691
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,020
Isn't this the herb you wanted to take

692
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,020
to the Yun family to cure the disease?

693
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,020
That's right.

694
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,020
The red-brown grass was found in the yard of the imperial city.

695
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,020
It was picked up and cooked into glue.

696
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,020
It was painted with a ghost foot print and naturally recognized.

697
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,020
It looked at the medicine soup.

698
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:37,020
Isn't this disease naturally cured?

699
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,020
What about the green ghost shadow?

700
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,020
Did everyone in the inn see it that day?

701
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,020
The ghost shadow?

702
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,020
It was sealed in the window.

703
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,020
But how did it turn Miss Yun Qiao

704
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,020
into a jade embroidery?

705
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,020
I'm hungry.

706
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,020
It's a bruise.

707
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,020
The water in this inn

708
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,020
is used to make bruises

709
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,020
to make people look good.

710
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,020
It's easier to make Yun Qiao

711
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,020
look good by looking at people who are not sincere.

712
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,020
Don't look at anything.

713
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,020
Don't look at anything.

714
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,020
After you put down the headdress,

715
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,020
you can go to the inn.

716
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,020
I'm going to the inn.

717
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,020
After you put down the headdress,

718
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,020
you can go to the inn.

719
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,020
Yun Qiao has spent a lot of effort.

720
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,020
It's a pity that I'm not here

721
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,020
to find Yun Qiao's evidence.

722
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,020
What are you looking for?

723
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,020
The evidence to find Yun Qiao's guilty.

724
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,020
The same needle as the jade embroidery that killed the jade embroiderer?

725
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,020
But this jade is...

726
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,020
Qing Ling said that

727
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:22,020
the jade embroidery is a gift for Yun Qiao's warm moon.

728
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,020
Someone wants to kill her.

729
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,020
Such a big show.

730
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:29,020
It's impossible to play by Yun Qiao alone.

731
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,580
Get hold of it!

732
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,220
Despite what's happened,

733
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,500
No one will watch over harm

734
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,380
and put an end to this problem

735
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,300
Li Jian

736
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,740
It's normal

737
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,020
Every dog has its day

738
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,020
But I

739
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,460
The strength of this black procedure

740
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,660
The thread is very thin.

741
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,100
It seems that only those who need to control

742
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,340
and master the craft

743
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,940
can't control the leather in the house.

744
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,020
That's right.

745
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,220
Yu Qiushuang died in the imperial city.

746
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,700
But his body was sealed with blood

747
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,980
into the box and sent to the security.

748
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,980
The murderer then used the head of the person to tear the watch

749
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,580
to bribe Chen Yunhe.

750
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,620
Chen Yunhe didn't want to tear the watch to expose him.

751
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,580
He didn't go out to open the box to check.

752
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,380
So the body of Yu Qiushuang

753
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,020
was transported to the Xiaomian Inn.

754
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,420
Yun Jiao took the guards to find Yu Qiushuang as the name.

755
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,060
He lived in the inn one day in advance.

756
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,140
He could arrange the time for one night.

757
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,860
He came in at half past four.

758
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,340
He cooperated with the sound of the two guards

759
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,860
who were fighting in the shadow.

760
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,540
The guards who were far away

761
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,860
only knew that the second lady was really back.

762
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,220
The watch box was sealed with cold iron.

763
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,100
The blood melted in six days.

764
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,100
When the watch was taken to the inn,

765
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,860
the blood was transferred to the box.

766
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,180
When the guards approached, they noticed something strange.

767
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,580
At that time, Yun Jiao was in disguise

768
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,020
and went down to the inn alone.

769
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,940
But there was blood on his head.

770
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,020
He drew everyone's attention to the second floor.

771
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,380
He could let the guards find the second lady's sword.

772
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,820
The blood-soaked box would also be opened.

773
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,220
The body of Yu Qiushuang was sent to the inn again.

774
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:06,500
The ghost-killing scene was over.

775
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,580
This letter needed to kill someone to make a mark.

776
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,100
But I didn't expect that it was on the second floor.

777
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,940
He was very desperate.

778
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,900
At that time, Yun Jiao was on the first floor.

779
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,100
The man behind the scene killed Wang Fu.

780
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,300
He could let Yun Jiao do so many things.

781
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,580
Now he is pretending to hide the truth.

782
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,580
He is really a wise man.

783
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,220
Yun Jiao has already done this.

784
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,860
I didn't expect that

785
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,660
the murderer would kill someone to make a mark.

786
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,900
What are we waiting for?

787
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,780
We are waiting for the murderer to make a move again.

788
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,820
Before we set off,

789
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:48,100
you had set up the trap in Yun Jiao's room, right?

790
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,660
You know that too.

791
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,620
You are indeed an old fox.

792
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,860
Now,

793
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,180
we can only wait for the murderer to make a move.

794
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,620
We also need to solve the last puzzle in my heart.

795
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,500
What puzzle?

796
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,100
The one-shot and the one-shot.

797
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,860
Why did the murderer kill Yu Qiushuang twice?

798
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:21,660
The murderer

799
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,080
I've been waiting for a long time.

800
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,380
Turn around and show your face.

801
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,380
It's me.

802
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,140
Master Yu.

803
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,780
What are you doing?

804
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,940
You're the one who wanted to kill Yun Jiao

805
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,020
and you're the one who killed Yu Qiusheng.

806
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,700
I'm just worried about his condition.

807
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,780
I came to visit him.

808
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,780
Yun Jiao has been crazy for two days.

809
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,940
You just came now.

810
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,580
Are you afraid that he will talk nonsense?

811
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,420
Please pay attention to your words.

812
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,140
Don't forget our identities.

813
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,740
It's late at night.

814
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,900
What happened?

815
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,660
Madam.

816
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:18,980
Mr. Fang.

817
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,420
What do you mean?

818
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:21,940
Misunderstanding.

819
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,620
Why are you here?

820
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,300
Madam Yu, you're here at the right time.

821
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,380
The murderer who killed the second lady

822
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,140
is right in front of you.

823
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,460
What?

824
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,700
Didn't Yun Jiao do it?

825
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,580
Miss Yun Jiao

826
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,660
just did it for the sake of helping you.

827
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,620
Yun Jiao?

828
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,820
For helping Yu Mulan?

829
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,460
The relationship between Yu Chenzhu

830
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,780
and Miss Yun Jiao

831
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,020
is very close.

832
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,540
Miss Yun once wrote a poem.

833
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,500
But Madam Yu found out that

834
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,980
it's hard to solve the mystery of love.

835
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,420
The flowers are not in the same place.

836
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,100
Isn't this poem written for...

837
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,740
It's not written for Mr. Zongzheng, right?

838
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,420
There are many beautiful flowers in the world.

839
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,620
I dare not read them.

840
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,140
I'd like to ask you a question.

841
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,580
The flowers

842
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,700
are the most important part of Miss Yun's love.

843
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,140
It's related to the flower pendant

844
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,580
that she's wearing.

845
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,860
She's also using the Pujia as a wedding gift.

846
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,980
It seems that Mr. Pu is into Yu Chen.

847
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,060
He's very loyal to the Pujia.

848
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,860
hasta que

849
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:44,700
それ

850
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,700
ooug he's concerned about you.

851
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,540
Pu Mulan

852
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,820
have you all been hiding

853
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,220
the feelings of your Pujia through your Kenneth atop?

854
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,860
many years ago,

855
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,220
reward department was gathered in the name of Pujia.

856
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,980
Unfortunately,

857
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,180
the late Master which really knows about understanding

858
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:07,540
wants to pour hope on Pujia

859
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:12,500
This is the

860
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,500
fire of警告

861
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,300
Fire on the house

862
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,500
Coming

863
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,020
Thanks

864
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,780
Thank you

865
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,060
Thank you

866
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,140
And the other same skin shadow

867
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:40,140
was found in the study of Lord Yucheng.

868
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,260
The Pujia has a trick called

869
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,820
the fire of desire.

870
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,660
The fire of desire can control the mind.

871
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:49,100
The Pujia's fire of desire can kill people.

872
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,820
Won't this ancestor hate the Jiuquan?

873
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,420
You just dug up my old body

874
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,340
and deliberately soiled it.

875
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,820
I have no grudge against him.

876
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:02,420
Why should I kill him?

877
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,460
Fine.

878
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,380
Even if I killed him,

879
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,300
I would have been able to dig up the body.

880
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,820
Why should I do so many tricks

881
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,260
to expose my body?

882
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,380
You must have a reason.

883
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,260
Fumulan,

884
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,060
your father influenced you

885
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,580
and you were born a gambling addict.

886
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,500
You lost all your family assets

887
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,620
and you can only be put into prison.

888
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,140
It's a pity that

889
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:29,020
you are a gambling addict.

890
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,340
In order to avoid the woman who was pregnant,

891
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,620
you can only

892
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,860
take the money back

893
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,620
while you are guarding the jade mine.

894
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,820
I didn't expect that Yucheng's assets

895
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,860
and Yuchiu's pair were also stolen.

896
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,260
According to the rules,

897
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,580
if Yuchiu's pair is missing,

898
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,380
then everyone knows him

899
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,500
in these mines.

900
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,140
Only by proving that he is dead

901
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,620
can Mrs. Yu inherit all the assets.

902
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,780
Pumulan,

903
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,420
it's you

904
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,140
who has more

905
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,380
opportunities to take the money back.

906
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,980
Yucheng is famous abroad.

907
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:59,300
Maybe he is too rich to be a man of the country.

908
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,860
I think I'm right.

909
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,620
You are so cruel.

910
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:07,660
Mr. Fang.

911
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,300
The money is everywhere in the Fang family.

912
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,620
It's easy to find

913
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,660
the accounts of the gambling addict

914
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:19,900
by asking around.

915
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:22,540
Pumulan,

916
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,500
I'm afraid that

917
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,220
you have already sold all the gambling houses in the Fang family.

918
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,500
Pumulan,

919
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,980
you are so shameless.

920
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,300
I thought you had already

921
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,820
changed all the bad habits

922
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,060
when you came to my house.

923
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,420
I didn't expect that

924
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,980
you would kill my sister

925
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,820
for the money.

926
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:43,900
Madam,

927
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,340
how can you believe

928
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,020
these two cheaters?

929
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,100
I didn't.

930
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,300
You didn't?

931
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:52,100
You really didn't leave any regrets.

932
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:52,700
You know that

933
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:53,260
as long as you check

934
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:54,500
Miss Yu'er's body,

935
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,300
you will find the broken house

936
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,300
if you ask the guards

937
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,700
who were there at that time.

938
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,580
So you are not

939
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:01,020
going to kill them.

940
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,780
But you didn't expect

941
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,500
that you would rush back

942
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,380
and steal the body

943
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,700
which hasn't been burnt completely.

944
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:08,980
It's a pity, Madam Yu.

945
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:09,980
You were angry and burned.

946
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,140
You killed all the guards in the house.

947
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,100
You let them

948
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,180
lose the chance to speak.

949
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,460
You don't take the lives

950
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:16,580
of the guards

951
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,700
and you are not

952
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,580
the murderer's son.

953
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:02,140
The wind blows, the moon falls, the moon shines

954
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:05,940
The dust falls, the candle light flickers

955
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:09,940
The rain falls, the rain falls

956
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,220
The sound of the flute, the sound of the flute

957
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:14,740
The heart is warm

958
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,980
The wine, the wine, the wine

959
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,340
The moon, the moon, the moon

960
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:21,340
The moon, the moon, the moon

961
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,340
The moon, the moon, the moon

962
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,340
The moon, the moon, the moon

963
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:27,340
The moon, the moon, the moon

964
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,340
The moon, the moon, the moon

965
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,340
The moon, the moon, the moon

966
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:33,340
The moon, the moon, the moon

967
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,340
The moon, the moon, the moon

968
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,340
The moon, the moon, the moon

969
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:39,340
The moon, the moon, the moon

970
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:41,340
The moon, the moon, the moon

971
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,340
The moon, the moon, the moon

972
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,340
The moon, the moon, the moon

973
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:47,340
The moon, the moon, the moon

974
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:49,340
The moon, the moon, the moon

975
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:51,340
The moon, the moon, the moon

976
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,340
The moon, the moon, the moon

977
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,340
The moon, the moon, the moon

978
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:58,340
In exchange for a god's wish

979
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:01,340
People are too reckless

980
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:06,340
The blue mountains and blue rivers are all different

981
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:13,340
Who doesn't want to go to the bottom of the valley

982
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:18,340
People are too reckless

983
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,340
Can't wait to see the old heaven

984
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:23,340
The future is long

985
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:26,340
In exchange for a god's wish

986
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:29,340
People are too reckless

987
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:34,340
The blue mountains and blue rivers are all different

988
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:41,340
Who doesn't want to go to the bottom of the valley

989
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:56,340
The blue mountains and blue rivers are all different
