00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Kissing myself thousands of times

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The most reluctant moment is that moment

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Right on the earth, a thousand miles of madness

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who doesn't wander

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds and the moon on the cliff

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Right on the earth, the youthful panic

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
My heart is as wild as a silkworm

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The whole world is in a dream

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Right on the earth, a thousand miles of madness

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Who doesn't wander

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds and the moon on the cliff

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Right on the earth, the youthful panic

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000

16
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,960
Don't come out, I'll fire my smoke.

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,160
The fire!

18
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,400
Let go of the fire!

19
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,440
Do not talk, do not talk

20
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,440
Miss Qi'er?

21
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,160
Where is the master?

22
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,440
Yuliu Spring?

23
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,880
How would I know?

24
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,240
Aren't you the caretaker?

25
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,240
You stole the treasure from the master's room.

26
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,480
Where is it?

27
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,760
I don't know.

28
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,360
I just found it.

29
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,640
I found it.

30
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,640
Where is it?

31
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,840
I found it.

32
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,040
I found it.

33
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,440
I found it.

34
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,640
I found it.

35
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,840
I found it.

36
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,040
I found it.

37
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,240
I found it.

38
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,640
Where is it?

39
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,440
What treasure?

40
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,440
You've confused me.

41
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,040
You're hiding here.

42
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,440
You're pretending to be confused.

43
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,840
You even want to get away from me.

44
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,040
I'm here to take a walk.

45
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,440
I didn't steal anything.

46
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,640
Take a walk?

47
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,040
You're dressed as a man.

48
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,640
Take a walk?

49
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,240
Why do you need to pretend to be brave?

50
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,640
Right.

51
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,840
Mr. Fang asked me to dress up like this.

52
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,440
Mr. Fang?

53
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,440
You went back to your room last night

54
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,240
and asked him to go out in a man's dress?

55
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,840
Qing'er.

56
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,440
Yuliu Spring is now unknown.

57
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,040
No one can threaten you.

58
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,240
You can tell the truth.

59
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,040
Yuliu Spring is in danger?

60
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,440
That's great.

61
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,840
I'll be honest.

62
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,240
I wore a man's dress to escape from the battle at night.

63
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,040
But there are too many guards outside the door.

64
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,040
So I hid here.

65
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,240
I didn't steal anything.

66
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,640
You've been here all night.

67
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,640
Why didn't you tell me?

68
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,440
You've cleaned up Yuliu Spring?

69
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,240
I...

70
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,440
You're quite a scene-stealer.

71
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,440
Don't talk nonsense at this time.

72
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,240
You two seem to be familiar.

73
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,640
Didn't you see each other for the first time yesterday?

74
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,640
We can chat, of course.

75
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,240
It's just to look for suspects.

76
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,440
Come on.

77
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,240
Yuliu Spring's broken hands and legs

78
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,240
The patient has been collected.

79
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,920
The only suspicion

80
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,520
is that you are the new guard.

81
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,920
I'm equipped with the Songzhen Sword.

82
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,760
It can be cut into several sections.

83
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,840
It's not easy to cut it.

84
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,840
If I had used it to divide the body,

85
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,840
it would have been broken.

86
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,000
How could it be me?

87
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,520
Look.

88
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,720
There are dead pieces here.

89
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,800
This...

90
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:38,800
This...

91
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,320
This...

92
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,920
Isn't this the guard who brought us here yesterday?

93
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,240
Why are there so many pieces?

94
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,840
It's too cruel.

95
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,840
It's too cruel.

96
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,480
It's hard to do.

97
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,040
The sword in the guard's knife is missing.

98
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,160
The body is right next to where you are hiding.

99
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,880
It's obvious that you are the one who took the knife.

100
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,240
I...

101
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,480
I'm so lucky to hide here.

102
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,480
Don't blame me.

103
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,520
It doesn't matter if you don't tell me.

104
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,240
I'll cut your fingers into pieces.

105
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,240
I'll cut your fingers into pieces.

106
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,240
I'll cut your fingers into pieces.

107
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,960
I'll pull your nails down.

108
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,240
I'll see if you can tell me.

109
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,520
How dare you...

110
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,160
Do you know who I am?

111
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,720
I'm the princess of the court.

112
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,480
How dare you be rude to me?

113
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,560
I'll kill you.

114
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,960
Princess?

115
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,160
Today,

116
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,320
you said you are the empress dowager.

117
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,680
Are you going to fight with the detective

118
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,760
in front of the Baichuan?

119
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Save me.

120
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,640
I'll reward you in the future.

121
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,520
Don't be so ridiculous.

122
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,600
I'll help you.

123
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:39,800
I...

124
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,680
Young Master Fang is so protective of this girl.

125
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,840
Are you afraid that I'll ask him something?

126
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,120
I'm not protecting her.

127
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,880
She doesn't know martial arts.

128
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,080
Even if I give her a knife,

129
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,360
can she kill Yulou Chun?

130
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,960
She can't, but you can.

131
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,600
I know you are from the same room.

132
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,720
Today, you are protecting her.

133
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,080
Maybe you are plotting against her.

134
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,960
Wait.

135
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,680
I'm a little curious.

136
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,360
If they are plotting against each other,

137
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,640
how can they get to the kite?

138
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,680
That's right.

139
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,560
The wheel is so heavy.

140
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,200
Could it be that there is an attack?

141
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,680
Who is there in this world

142
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,360
with such a strong attack?

143
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,200
Fei?

144
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,440
I finally found you.

145
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,760
Su Xiaoyong is too noisy.

146
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,120
I'm afraid I can't help killing him.

147
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,400
I'd better find you.

148
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,840
How did you get here?

149
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,840
I did the attack.

150
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,040
I did it one by one.

151
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,920
You did a good job.

152
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,360
Thanks to the little street.

153
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,600
You came at the right time.

154
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,520
Li Lianhua.

155
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,800
You just said there is no one

156
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,600
with such a good attack.

157
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,800
There are thousands of people here.

158
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,320
He can go to the woman's house.

159
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,080
He can go to the kite.

160
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,520
The murderer is you.

161
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,680
It's a misunderstanding.

162
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,280
I forgot to introduce you.

163
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,000
This is Fei from South Han Sect.

164
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,320
He is also my follower.

165
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,120
His new skill is really good.

166
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,360
But he has a strange temper.

167
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,000
He doesn't like to do anything.

168
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,240
Yes.

169
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,680
Fei's people come to humiliate themselves.

170
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,520
Why do they need to kill the bodyguard?

171
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,520
They can just come from the back of the mountain.

172
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,960
Miss Jingrui.

173
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,400
You are the first one to be in trouble.

174
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,240
What is Fei carrying on his back?

175
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,680
A knife.

176
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,640
It's a big knife.

177
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,920
This knife is indeed different.

178
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,200
The material of this knife is very special.

179
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,520
It's completely different from the knife on this branch.

180
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,640
Fei.

181
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,560
Cut a knife for everyone to try.

182
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
No.

183
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,000
Just one knife.

184
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,480
I'll make you a delicious dinner.

185
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,680
Your food is so bad.

186
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,720
You can still take it as a reward.

187
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,200
Forget it, Li Lianhua.

188
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,760
Your follower won't agree with you.

189
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,800
Not necessarily.

190
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,480
Come here.

191
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,640
What's this?

192
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,600
No.

193
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,320
Okay.

194
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,960
Why did you agree?

195
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,960
What did you say?

196
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,200
It's a secret.

197
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,360
I need his help.

198
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
I...

199
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,000
Mr. Shi.

200
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,600
You're an expert in the valley of gods.

201
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,320
Why don't you test the knife on this tree?

202
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,360
Fei is using a double knife.

203
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,240
It's indeed different from the knife on this branch.

204
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,160
But his power is so powerful.

205
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,120
How did he get it?

206
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,000
I've never seen such a knife before.

207
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,160
That's not important.

208
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,120
What's important is that Fei is not suspicious.

209
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,120
Right?

210
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,640
Then who is it?

211
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,160
Is there no clue?

212
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,880
Clue?

213
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,320
Isn't it always there?

214
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,200
The food is ready.

215
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
Look.

216
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,240
This...

217
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,840
It looks like a well.

218
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,720
Why are you shaking?

219
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I...

220
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,680
I think I remember a rumor.

221
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,680
A rumor?

222
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,440
A swordsman died in Xiangshan.

223
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,240
He turned into a jade ghost

224
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,200
and killed people in Xiangshan.

225
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,920
It's called the Ghost King's Knife.

226
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,840
It's the Mirror Slash.

227
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,760
There's a strange person in Ghost King's Knife.

228
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,440
He was also an expert in the knife.

229
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,800
But he lost his reputation seven years ago.

230
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,640
Look at the cut on the body of the guard.

231
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,920
It's a little rough.

232
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,280
But it resembles the famous knife of Ghost King's Knife.

233
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,640
Mirror Slash.

234
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,360
Think about it.

235
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,720
Will the hand and foot of Yulou Chun be Mirror Slash?

236
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,920
I'm afraid Yulou Chun won't live.

237
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,240
It's just a knife.

238
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,720
The owner may not die.

239
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,920
He's dead.

240
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,920
You...

241
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,120
What did you say?

242
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,440
Follow me.

243
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,720
This is Yulou Chun's body.

244
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,800
He's really dead.

245
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,560
These body's knife marks are put together.

246
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Even if we can't find the rest,

247
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,200
we can tell it's a mirror slash.

248
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,560
Ghost King's Knife.

249
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,680
It's the Ghost King's Knife.

250
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,520
The knife is sharp and the sword is sharp.

251
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,600
The Ghost King's life.

252
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,280
Is there really a ghost in this world?

253
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,600
Life is a wave.

254
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,160
Ghosts are not necessarily.

255
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,680
What do you mean?

256
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,080
Is there no weapon shop in the underworld?

257
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,680
What A'Fei means is,

258
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,200
if there's really a ghost,

259
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,360
why would she hide the knife before killing?

260
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,200
So,

261
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,600
the Ghost King's Knife

262
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,000
can only kill people.

263
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,480
Young Hero Fang and Doctor Li have made many mistakes.

264
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,440
What do you think

265
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,240
should be done now?

266
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,040
The bridge of the female house has not been put down.

267
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,760
A'Fei's light attack is rare.

268
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,280
So the suspect

269
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,000
will only be among us.

270
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,960
First,

271
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,560
let's search this area.

272
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,920
The girls in the female house

273
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,120
are suspected of the smallest.

274
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,320
Since when?

275
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,320
The arm of Yulou Chun

276
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,320
was found in Guanri Hall.

277
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,720
And Guanri Hall is outside the female house.

278
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,760
The girls can't go out.

279
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,160
They can't escape.

280
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,400
So the suspect is the smallest.

281
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,040
Next, I'd like to ask

282
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,840
if the new guards and guards

283
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,320
are suspected.

284
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,480
Before you came here,

285
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,800
everything was peaceful.

286
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,640
The murderer is clearly among you.

287
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,920
Let me say something.

288
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,960
The guard who is not allowed to enter the female house

289
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,720
died in the female house.

290
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,320
Guard Xi,

291
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,200
don't you need to check it?

292
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,240
The guard has a bad taste.

293
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,880
Every year, he will sneak in

294
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,520
to have a drink with the girls.

295
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,000
Since he never went out,

296
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,800
I knew it long ago, but I didn't care about him.

297
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,440
Are you satisfied with this answer?

298
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,200
Yes.

299
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,400
That means

300
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,760
as long as the new guards are suspected,

301
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,960
the guards

302
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,200
can enter the female house freely, right?

303
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,440
Yes.

304
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,200
So here comes my second question.

305
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,960
If the turntable under the clouds

306
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,560
doesn't rely on the power of the human,

307
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,320
then the whole female house

308
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,680
can only be turned by the new guards alone, right?

309
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,040
Yes.

310
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,440
Very good.

311
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,280
The murderer has to turn the turntable around

312
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,600
and have to take the turntable up the mountain to kill people.

313
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,800
At the same time, it's really troublesome

314
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,440
to do these two things.

315
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,640
So there are more than one murderer.

316
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,000
Except you two,

317
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,840
other guests

318
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,520
still have old acquaintances?

319
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,960
Don't talk nonsense.

320
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,160
What I want to say is

321
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,440
how can it be said clearly

322
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,240
who knows who?

323
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,880
Maybe

324
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,960
these guards

325
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,480
recognize these guests.

326
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,680
Guards can't be the master.

327
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,400
Why?

328
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,440
Xing Hu Yuan,

329
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,840
you're very abnormal.

330
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,200
These guards are also abnormal.

331
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,800
I found that you care about the whereabouts of the treasure

332
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,400
more than this jade spring.

333
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,560
If you don't get rid of your suspicion,

334
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,000
it's very dangerous.

335
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,080
All the guards in the female house and I

336
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,080
will never hurt the jade spring.

337
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,920
Because we were all poisoned by the jade spring

338
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,320
and we were very tired.

339
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,280
This poison must be taken once a month.

340
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,960
Otherwise, the liver, liver, and kidney will be dissolved into blood and die of great pain.

341
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,120
The antidote hidden in the secret room is the antidote.

342
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,280
And the day to take the antidote this month

343
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,760
is tomorrow.

344
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,480
If we can't find the antidote tomorrow,

345
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,080
you will die.

346
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,280
That's right.

347
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,280
Xing Jue asks you to save us.

348
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,080
Otherwise,

349
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,680
these brothers will die of great pain.

350
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,080
I'm afraid I can't control myself

351
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,480
and hurt you.

352
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,880
Are you poor or scaring people?

353
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,680
Xing Gu Wei, get up first.

354
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,080
I'm the commander-in-chief.

355
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,680
Whether the new guards are innocent

356
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,480
will be investigated by us.

357
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,280
I want to investigate with you too.

358
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,480
Wang Da Bing,

359
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,880
let Qing Ren

360
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,080
follow her.

361
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,080
She is familiar with this place.

362
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,080
Start immediately.

363
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,480
Except for the doctor, Fang Shao Xia Wan,

364
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,480
no one is allowed to leave the house.

365
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,280
Until the truth is found,

366
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,280
otherwise, don't blame me for offending you.

367
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,680
How did the murderer

368
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,280
get on the cloud-viewing wind?

369
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,880
Doesn't that Fei fly?

370
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,680
Maybe the murderer

371
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,080
flew up the mountain from here.

372
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,480
There are not many people

373
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,080
who are as capable as Fei in this world.

374
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,880
By the way,

375
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,280
where is Fei?

376
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,680
Fei is too lazy to care about this.

377
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,280
I'm afraid he's sleeping.

378
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,680
Maybe he climbed up the mountain

379
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,880
following the rope.

380
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,680
This is the place

381
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,080
where Fei was killed.

382
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,480
This rope is covered with black oil

383
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,680
and can't be slipped.

384
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,080
If he climbed up the mountain,

385
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,880
I'm afraid it's harder than flying.

386
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,280
Got it.

387
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,480
How did the murderer climb up the mountain?

388
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,880
The rope?

389
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,880
Was it burned by fire?

390
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,880
Put this rope

391
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,080
on the fence

392
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,280
under this fence.

393
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,080
When the fence reaches the top of the mountain,

394
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,080
the fence will hook the hook

395
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,080
at the bottom of the mountain.

396
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,280
The rope will go down the mountain.

397
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,880
The murderer used the rope to climb up and down

398
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,280
and then burned it with fire.

399
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,880
Then he was in a state of unconsciousness.

400
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,080
If he used the rope,

401
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,880
he didn't need anyone's help.

402
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,280
The murderer could climb up and down the cloud-viewing wind.

403
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,480
But he was so confused.

404
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,480
He hung himself on the fence

405
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,080
with the rope.

406
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,680
Didn't Xingjue find it?

407
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,280
Unless he held his sword

408
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,880
and he was the Ghost King's sword.

409
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,680
But he used a sword.

410
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,880
Who said the Ghost King's sword

411
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,280
wouldn't use a sword?

412
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,480
I have another question.

413
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,680
Why did he

414
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,480
throw the corpse?

415
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,680
To show justice,

416
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,080
he killed hundreds of people.

417
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,280
Isn't the legendary Ghost King's sword

418
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,880
the same as the Ghost King's sword?

419
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,880
Didn't the guards say

420
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,280
that the Ghost King's sword killed innocent people?

421
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,880
Why did he become a hero?

422
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,680
Of course, the guards were afraid of him.

423
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,080
But the girls in the girl's house

424
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,080
were all looking forward to the Ghost King's sword.

425
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,480
What happened?

426
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,880
It is said that many years ago,

427
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,280
the wife of the Ghost King's sword was also brought here.

428
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,480
He came to find his wife, but unfortunately died.

429
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
But at this time,

430
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,680
something terrible happened.

431
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,080
Tell me.

432
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,280
The Mountain God came.

433
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,680
The Mountain God saw that the Ghost King's sword was poor.

434
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,680
So he used magic

435
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,680
to turn the Ghost King's sword into a ghost's.

436
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,280
From now on, he will show justice.

437
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,080
I see.

438
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,080
Miss Qingyan,

439
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,880
we can talk about this later.

440
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,080
What we are looking for now

441
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,280
is the Ghost King's sword in reality.

442
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,480
The Ghost King's sword is in reality.

443
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,680
His wife Luo Hongyan

444
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,680
was really locked up in the girl's house.

445
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,880
Miss Qingyan,

446
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,080
do you know her?

447
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,080
I don't know her.

448
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,480
I came too late.

449
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,080
She died a few years ago.

450
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,480
How did you know?

451
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,880
The account book.

452
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,080
On the account book of Yulou Village,

453
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,880
there are all the fingers of her in recent years.

454
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,680
Luo Hongyan's name is in the account book.

455
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,880
So, Miss Qingyan,

456
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,280
you have this account book, right?

457
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,480
Of course.

458
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,880
In my hand,

459
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,280
I kept the one that killed Yulou Village's head.

460
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,480
I didn't expect

461
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,480
someone to kill her head for me first.

462
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,880
Then, show us

463
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,480
what you have.

464
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,480
Do you think I'm useful now?

465
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,280
Yes.

466
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,080
Miss Qingyan is smart.

467
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,880
The account book is hidden well.

468
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,280
I admire you.

469
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,680
Then, come with me.

470
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,680
What is this place?

471
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,280
This is the place where girls usually live.

472
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,880
I forgot that I need to get some food today.

473
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,080
Wait for me here.

474
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,480
I'll be right back.

475
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,480
The account book is here.

476
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,880
Why is the account book so smelly?

477
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,880
Yulou Village lost the account book.

478
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,080
It's so bad.

479
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,080
Of course I hid it.

480
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,480
Where did you hide it?

481
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,480
You can help me.

482
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,280
Don't be picky.

483
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,280
Here.

484
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,280
Luo Hongyan's name

485
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,280
is in the account book from eight years ago.

486
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,280
I found it.

487
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,280
Luo Hongyan,

488
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,680
23 years old,

489
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,280
20 yuan for the ointment.

490
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,480
Luo Hongyan was sold here,

491
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,480
and he changed it to 20 yuan for the ointment?

492
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,680
Dongfang Hao?

493
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,480
Did Dongfang Hao

494
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,880
bring Luo Hongyan here?

495
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,480
Who else would change the ointment for a girl?

496
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,080
He also dragged me here.

497
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,080
I can't forget the smell of ointment on him.

498
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:55,680
If the Ghost King

499
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,680
is going to avenge his wife,

500
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,080
the next one to die

501
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,480
is Dongfang Hao.

502
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,480
Let's go.

503
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,480
Dongfang Hao

504
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,880
is dead.

505
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,480
Jin Ziqian?

506
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,280
He was taken by the Ghost King again.

507
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,680
It's not hard to find

508
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,080
the person who killed him here.

509
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,480
How could this happen?

510
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,480
He's dead?

511
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,880
Dongfang Hao is dead too?

512
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,680
What's going on?

513
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,080
Could it be that

514
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,080
Dongfang Hao

515
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,080
is dead?

516
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,080
What's going on?

517
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,080
What's going on?

518
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,080
What's going on?

519
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,080
What's going on?

520
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,080
What's going on?

521
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,080
What's going on?

522
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,080
Could it be that

523
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,080
the Ghost King's blade not only wants to kill Yulou Chun,

524
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,080
but also wants to kill all of us?

525
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,080
You'll know

526
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,080
when you ask the Ghost King's blade

527
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,080
about these questions.

528
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,680
Did you find the murderer, Doctor Li?

529
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,680
Everyone,

530
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,680
could you let me smell

531
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,080
the smell of you?

532
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,880
Senior Wen Wei?

533
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,680
Doctor Li is not only skilled,

534
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,080
but also has a dog's nose.

535
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,080
Dongfang Hao's room

536
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,680
is full of the smell of ointment.

537
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,880
If you kill someone in the room,

538
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,480
you'll naturally smell bad.

539
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,080
So you'll know when you smell it.

540
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,880
Please reach out your hand.

541
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,480
It's you, for sure.

542
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,480
Is that you?

543
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,480
I'll go find you.

544
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,080
What do you mean?

545
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,920
I don't smell anything like ointment.

546
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,760
It's weird if you don't smell anything.

547
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,400
Everyone was running around for the murder case.

548
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,440
But the new house is the most powerful.

549
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,840
You don't even have a cold.

550
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,840
You're still wearing a little bit of a mask.

551
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,800
I...

552
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,240
I'm just taking a bath and changing clothes.

553
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,640
What's so strange?

554
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,640
Of course, it's not strange.

555
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,800
But the owner's heart is dead.

556
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
The antidote has been stolen.

557
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,600
Are you still in the mood to take a bath and change clothes?

558
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,320
If I'm right,

559
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,320
you're the Ghost King Sword.

560
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,400
You saw my weapon yesterday.

561
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,000
It's this Song Zhen Sword.

562
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,320
Why do you need to ask?

563
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,600
Of course, the Ghost King Sword is useless.

564
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,600
Fei!

565
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,600
Fei!

566
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,600
It's the second time.

567
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,400
Everyone, look.

568
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,400
Jing Ziqian?

569
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
You're the Ghost King Sword?

570
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
So I said the Ghost King Sword

571
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,800
is also used to use a sword.

572
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,800
Let's go to the new house.

573
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,800
So the new house is the Ghost King Sword.

574
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,800
It's the most powerful sword in the world.

575
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,800
So the new house

576
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,800
has always been a thief.

577
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,800
I didn't kill him.

578
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,800
The new house has treasures.

579
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,800
The knife of the mayor is also here.

580
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,800
The blood on the knife hasn't been wiped clean.

581
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,800
You're going to confess, right?

582
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,800
Someone is trying to frame me.

583
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,800
The Ghost King Sword?

584
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,800
The Jing Ziqian of the wall is very powerful.

585
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,800
It's like a fake sword.

586
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
I'm not bad with the Ghost King Sword.

587
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,800
I also want to kill Yu Lou Chun myself.

588
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,800
But I didn't kill him.

589
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,800
Seven years ago, my wife was caught in a female camp.

590
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,800
I came to find her, and she committed suicide.

591
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
Yu Lou Chun is good at martial arts.

592
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,800
I'm not inferior to him.

593
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,800
I'm here to ask for my own protection.

594
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,800
I promised Fu Jia to be his bodyguard.

595
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,800
I'm like this.

596
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,800
I can't even protect my wife.

597
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,800
I was born to be a dog for my enemy.

598
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,800
How can I have the courage to kill Yu Lou Chun?

599
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,800
It's touching.

600
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,800
But you changed your clothes

601
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,800
just because you killed Dong Fang Hao.

602
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,800
When I saw the book on the bookshelf this morning,

603
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,800
I was worried that someone would frame me.

604
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,800
I saw the gold and silver and the sword on the table.

605
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,800
The sword had some pink powder on it.

606
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,800
I wanted to know if it was related to Dong Fang Hao.

607
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,800
Who knew that he would die when he entered the door?

608
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,800
I knew that I was hit by the Lotus Robe.

609
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,800
I came back to change my clothes.

610
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,800
I didn't have time to hide these.

611
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,800
I was called out of the door.

612
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,800
I...

613
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,800
Xian Jue, get out!

614
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,800
What is this?

615
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,800
What is this?

616
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,800
When I was at the door,

617
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,800
I saw you hiding something.

618
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,800
I saw it was a antidote.

619
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,800
You killed Yu Lou Chun.

620
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,800
You hid the treasure and wanted to take the antidote.

621
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,800
You took this and let us wait to die?

622
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,800
I want to kill you.

623
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,800
Wait.

624
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,800
The murderer has been exposed.

625
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,800
We will release him tomorrow.

626
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
Don't worry.

627
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,800
This antidote is two months' worth.

628
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,800
I won't give you a penny.

629
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,800
Take him to the woodshed.

630
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,800
I won't give him the antidote.

631
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,800
But the antidote is also on my desk with the treasure.

632
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,800
I want to live.

633
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,800
What's wrong with that?

634
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,800
Young Master Fang, Lin Shan Yi.

635
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,800
It's not me.

636
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,800
Someone is hiding it.

637
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,800
Hiding it!

638
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,800
Go.

639
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,800
They say that Bai Chun Yan is great.

640
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,800
It's true what you saw today.

641
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,800
You said that you would solve the case tomorrow.

642
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,800
I didn't expect that you would solve the case today.

643
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,800
You two are really great heroes.

644
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,800
I admire you.

645
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,800
My poetry is a new topic.

646
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,800
I came to the Central Plains for a short time.

647
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,800
I just think that this place is full of the beauty of the world.

648
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,800
You two are wise.

649
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,800
I admire you.

650
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,800
It's late.

651
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,800
You should have a good sleep.

652
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,800
We will go down the mountain tomorrow when Bai Chun Yan comes.

653
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,800
I'm so scared.

654
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,800
I didn't expect that the Ghost King Sword is so easy to give away.

655
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,800
Don't worry.

656
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,800
Give me the phone.

657
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,800
What's wrong, Die Lian Hua?

658
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,800
There is no ice chip in the Star Pavilion.

659
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,800
Could it be that Yulou Village is hiding somewhere else?

660
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,800
He doesn't know where the body under Yulou Village is hidden.

661
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Could it be that the Star Pavilion is hiding somewhere else?

662
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
Master Fang, Godess Li, these guards...

663
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,800
They saw Yulou Chun Yi dead and were arrested.

664
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,800
They came here to kill the girls.

665
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,800
You are all poisoned.

666
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,800
You are pitiful people.

667
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,800
But you are going to offend the girls.

668
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,800
It's really pathetic.

669
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,800
Everyone is collecting the guests' stuff.

670
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,800
Isn't it the same to have fun?

671
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,800
Your left and right are the same.

672
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,800
I'm not the only one who's suffering.

673
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
I'm the only one who's suffering.

674
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,800
I'm the only one who's suffering.

675
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,800
I'm the only one who's suffering.

676
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
I'm the only one who's suffering.

677
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,800
You are all the same.

678
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,800
Your left and right are all the same.

679
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,800
Is it the same to die at any time?

680
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,800
The amount of this antidote can only be two months.

681
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,800
If you see this kind of behavior again,

682
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,800
then the formula of this antidote will be forgotten.

683
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,800
We dare not.

684
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,800
We dare not.

685
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,800
Let's go.

686
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,800
Sister Zhu Yue, Yulou Chun is dead.

687
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,800
Let's leave here together tomorrow.

688
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,800
Qing, Master takes us to the cloth shop.

689
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,800
Why are you so ungrateful?

690
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,800
Take us to the cloth shop?

691
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,800
Are you crazy?

692
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,800
We are locked here every day.

693
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,800
We are afraid of losing money, food, clothes,

694
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,800
and the guards outside.

695
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,800
This is called taking us to the cloth shop?

696
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,800
The outside world is more dangerous than the women's house.

697
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,800
You can see what the guards are doing today.

698
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,800
These years,

699
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,800
it's the master who has been protecting us.

700
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,800
This is a trap, not protection.

701
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,800
We are locked here every day.

702
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,800
It's like a cat and a bird.

703
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,800
It's like a human.

704
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,800
Ping Rong, Yu Yan,

705
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,800
say something.

706
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,800
I'm crazy.

707
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,800
I think you are all locked up.

708
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,800
I don't want to talk to you.

709
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,800
If you like to be locked up,

710
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,800
then you are always locked here.

711
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,800
Be grateful.

712
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,800
Thank you for finding out the truth.

713
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,800
I'm grateful for your help.

714
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,800
You really don't hate Yulou Spring?

715
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,800
Women have nothing to lose in this world.

716
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,800
Staying here to serve the master is useless.

717
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,800
Serving one person is easier than serving everyone.

718
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,800
But...

719
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,800
There are people, so you don't have to say more.

720
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,800
Then I wish you a happy night.

721
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,800
They have been locked here for too long.

722
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,800
You are used to it.

723
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,800
Don't force them.

724
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,800
They are like this.

725
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,800
Xin Xue is like this.

726
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,800
Are there such soft bones in the world?

727
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,800
What else can we do?

728
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,800
Some people are fearless.

729
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,800
Some people are afraid of death.

730
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,800
This is the world.

731
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,800
Li Lian Hua.

732
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,800
You are silent all night.

733
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,800
You are not afraid of death.

734
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,800
You are afraid of death.

735
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,800
You are silent all night.

736
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,800
What are you thinking?

737
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,800
I'm thinking...

738
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,800
Why is there a puzzle on this flower?

739
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,800
There is no puzzle.

740
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,800
I'm talking about the night of the Monkey King.

741
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,800
The flower is growing in the soil.

742
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,800
Is it strange to stick to it?

743
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,800
This rose has a high level of flower.

744
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,800
If it is high, it will be strange to stick to the soil.

745
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,800
Maybe the girls picked the flowers and fell on the ground.

746
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,800
The soil is not stuck to the soil.

747
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,800
It is built up.

748
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,800
Why would a girl pick flowers and build up a high level of soil?

749
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,800
And...

750
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,800
If half of the body is exposed,

751
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,800
why can't people find the rest?

752
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,800
Why can't people find the rest?

753
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,800
Xing Jue admitted that he was the Ghost King.

754
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,800
Why didn't he admit that he killed people?

755
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,800
It's obvious.

756
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,800
What?

757
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,800
It's obvious that he is a bad guy.

758
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,800
It's obvious.

759
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,800
Okay, why don't you tell us?

760
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,800
You used a secret to make me help you three times in Xiangshan.

761
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,800
Is this the third time?

762
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,800
Don't try to be a judge.

763
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,800
Why don't you tell us the secret first?

764
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,800
We can avoid getting caught.

765
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,800
I'm not talking about you.

766
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,800
When have I ever been caught?

767
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,800
Don't be so shy.

768
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,800
Okay, I'll tell you.

769
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,800
You said before

770
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,800
that you know you don't want me to die, but you don't know why.

771
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,800
All these reasons

772
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,800
are the reason why you want me to save a very important person for you.

773
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,800
Save someone?

774
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,800
Save who?

775
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,800
That's the next question.

776
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,800
Fei, tell us.

777
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,800
What's the flaw?

778
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,800
The three people's knife skills have flaws.

779
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,800
The three people's knife skills look the same.

780
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,800
But if you practice the skills of the blade,

781
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,800
you can see the difference between the new skill of the user.

782
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,800
Dongfang Hao's blade skills are less rigid.

783
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,800
The blade skills of Yulou Chun's blade skills are more rigid.

784
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,800
And the blade skills of the guard are more rigid.

785
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,800
Are there three people?

786
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,800
It's an imitation.

787
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,800
Imitation?

788
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,800
Don't be taken in by Jing Ziqian.

789
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,800
The first one who died was Yulou Chun.

790
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,800
The second one died was the guard.

791
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,800
In order to imitate Jing Ziqian on Yulou Chun's body,

792
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,800
the killer didn't use the guard's blade skills.

793
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,800
Dongfang Hao is also like that.

794
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,800
But the blade skills of the guard and Dongfang Hao are different.

795
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,800
Because the killer is more vivid when killing the guard.

796
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,800
When killing Dongfang Hao, the killer is less vivid.

797
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,800
Li Lianhua, are you confused?

798
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,800
The first one died was Yulou Chun.

799
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,800
But the blade skill of his is the most mature.

800
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,800
Why did the second guard become vivid?

801
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,800
And if the first one died was Yulou Chun,

802
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,800
how can the blade be different without a blade?

803
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,800
But you said that the blade skill is not found.

804
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,800
Yes, how can the blade be different without a blade?

805
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,800
Jing Ziqian,

806
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,800
although I don't know why,

807
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,800
Yulou Chun was lost without a blade.

808
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,800
If the killer can do this,

809
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,800
then Xing Jue is not the killer.

810
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,800
Because of this,

811
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,800
he doesn't need to hide the blade and use it to kill people.

812
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,800
So the body below Yulou Chun

813
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,800
must have the real killer's secret.

814
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,800
With this, we can conclude that the killer is not Xing Jue.

815
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,800
And this.

816
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,800
Come, Fei.

817
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,800
We guessed that Xing Jue is the most convenient person

818
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,800
to hang the lantern on the lantern basket.

819
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,800
Yes.

820
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,800
He burned the lantern strip after he went down the mountain.

821
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,800
That's not right.

822
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,800
Think about it.

823
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,800
If the lantern strip falls from the water

824
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,800
and lights up from below,

825
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,800
then only one part will be burned.

826
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,800
But this lantern strip was burned on both sides.

827
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,800
Didn't you find it last time?

828
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,800
You mean

829
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,800
someone is confusing us

830
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,800
and pointing the killer to Xing Jue.

831
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,800
Xing Jue is not the killer.

832
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
Who is the killer?

833
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,800
The killer is a few smart people.

834
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,800
A few?

835
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,800
If Xing Jue didn't do it,

836
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,800
the other people must cooperate.

837
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,800
Let's go find Xing Jue.

838
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,800
Did the guards beat you?

839
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,800
How do I usually punish them?

840
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,800
How do they punish me now?

841
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,800
What are you doing?

842
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,800
Now all the evidence points to you.

843
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,800
You can say whatever you want.

844
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,800
When I leave tomorrow,

845
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,800
my liver will be exhausted.

846
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,800
I can't escape death.

847
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,800
You...

848
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,800
Why did you save me?

849
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,800
I brought this antidote to save you.

850
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,800
I just don't want to make people dizzy.

851
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,800
I didn't kill Yulou Chun.

852
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,800
It has nothing to do with the Eastern Phoenix.

853
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,800
But I am guilty.

854
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,800
When I was working for Yulou Chun,

855
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,800
I was the most unforgivable.

856
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,800
You two,

857
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,800
ask me whatever you want.

858
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,800
I won't say anything.

859
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,800
Did you see

860
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,800
someone or something different

861
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,800
yesterday?

862
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,800
Yesterday?

863
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,800
Yesterday, I went to the Red Temple to prepare.

864
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,800
The whole house is different from before.

865
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,800
But it's too strange.

866
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,800
It's useless.

867
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,800
What about you?

868
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,800
Myself?

869
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,800
You said someone knew that

870
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,800
your ghost king was trying to frame you.

871
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,800
Maybe this different place

872
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,800
is on you.

873
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,800
On me?

874
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,800
I...

875
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,800
I woke up too early.

876
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,800
Nothing is different.

877
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,800
You woke up very early yesterday.

878
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,800
Yes.

879
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,800
I was serving Yulou Chun.

880
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,800
I had to get up at noon.

881
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,800
I used to sleep late.

882
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,800
I didn't sleep enough.

883
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,800
But I woke up yesterday.

884
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,800
I just heard the clock.

885
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,800
Moon.

886
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,800
Yes.

887
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,800
The moon is wrong.

888
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,800
Don't be so agitated.

889
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,800
What's wrong?

890
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,800
The moon is wrong.

891
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,800
It's the time.

892
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,800
Today is the eighth day.

893
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,800
Yesterday is the seventh day.

894
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,800
The moon at this time

895
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,800
should be in the western sky.

896
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,800
It hasn't fallen yet.

897
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,800
After I saw Yulou Chun here yesterday,

898
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,800
the bell rang at midnight.

899
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,800
And the ghost king was dancing.

900
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,800
But the moon was on the top of his head.

901
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,800
It's still far away from the horizon.

902
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,800
It seems that the bell at midnight last night

903
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,800
has already arrived early.

904
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,800
I thought the bell was asleep.

905
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,800
I woke up at noon.

906
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,800
If he is not the murderer,

907
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,800
the time of the murderer's

908
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,800
crime is only two hours from

909
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,800
midnight to the time of the night.

910
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,800
But if it's early in the morning,

911
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,800
the time of the murderer's crime

912
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,800
will be even more important.

913
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,800
The time of Yulou Chun's murder.

914
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,800
The murderer killed someone

915
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,800
before the time of the night.

916
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,800
Then why did he still

917
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,800
have a heartache

918
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,800
when he found his arm this morning?

919
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,800
Let's figure out

920
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,800
why the bell rang early in the morning.

921
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,800
The bell came from a temple far away.

922
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,800
There must be a clue.

923
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,800
But the moon will be up

924
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,800
before the moon passes through.

925
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,800
That's why Lan Ran

926
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,800
gave up this bell.

927
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,800
Then, Fang Xiao Wang,

928
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,800
how do we go now?

929
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,800
Fei!

930
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,800
You!

931
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,800
What do you mean you?

932
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,800
Go to the temple at midnight

933
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,800
and ask why the bell rang

934
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,800
at midnight?

935
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,800
Forget about him.

936
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,800
Why do you have to order me?

937
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,800
Li Lian Hua used one secret

938
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,800
to ask you to help him three times.

939
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,800
I'm telling you a secret

940
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,800
just to ask you to help him once.

941
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,800
How is it?

942
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,800
Is it easy to get rid of it?

943
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,800
You can count on me.

944
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,800
You'll know it

945
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,800
when you hear it.

946
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,800
You were once a

947
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,800
powerful martial artist

948
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,800
who killed people like horses.

949
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,800
Everyone was able to kill them,

950
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,800
but they didn't dare to offend

951
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,800
the super demon.

952
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,800
How is it?

953
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,800
Do you believe me now?

954
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,800
If you believe me,

955
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,800
then hurry up and go.

956
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,800
Okay.

957
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,800
Fang Xiao Wang,

958
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,800
you shouldn't have told her

959
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,800
about this so early.

960
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,800
Do you know that?

961
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,800
You're so capable.

962
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,800
Next time, help her get back.

963
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,800
By the way,

964
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,800
what should we do next?

965
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,800
What do you think,

966
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,800
Fang Da Qin?

967
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,800
They've been dancing all night

968
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,800
at Zhai Xing stage.

969
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,800
It's time to meet her.

970
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,800
Where are you going?

971
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,800
Move out.

972
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,800
I'll leave here tomorrow morning.

973
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,800
I don't want to

974
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,800
stay with these weak people.

975
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,800
Didn't you come to find Xing Jue?

976
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,800
Why are you here again?

977
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,800
Bi Huang danced all night last night.

978
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,800
How is he doing?

979
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,800
You care about people a lot.

980
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,800
I...

981
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,800
Come back tomorrow.

982
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,800
Bi Huang slept early last night.

983
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,800
Qing,

984
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,800
Bi Huang

985
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,800
usually doesn't

986
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,800
have a good sleep.

987
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,800
He's not a good person.

988
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,800
What kind of person

989
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,800
is Bi Huang?

990
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,800
He's a female housekeeper.

991
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,800
He looks strict,

992
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,800
but he's actually a good person.

993
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,800
Does he like Yulou Spring?

994
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,800
He's always

995
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,800
thinking about Yulou Spring.

996
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,800
Of course he likes it.

997
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,800
He must have been

998
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,800
scared by Yulou Spring.

999
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,800
What happened

1000
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,800
to Man Shan Hong yesterday?

1001
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,800
Did he manage it himself?

1002
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,800
Chun Hong?

1003
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,800
The girls' Chun Hong

1004
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,800
is the peach blossom powder

1005
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,800
he made himself.

1006
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,800
Oh, right.

1007
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,800
I have another box here.

1008
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,800
Here you are.

1009
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,800
Thank you.

1010
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,800
Peach blossom porridge with aphrodisiac powder.

1011
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,800
Did the girls' porridge

1012
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,800
have aphrodisiac in it?

1013
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,800
Man Shan Hong did

1014
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,800
plant aphrodisiac.

1015
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,800
Aphrodisiac is the raw material

1016
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,800
for the phoenix cake.

1017
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,800
It seems that Yulou Spring

1018
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,800
is doing these black-hearted business.

1019
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,800
No wonder Dong Fang Hao,

1020
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,800
the hidden gentleman,

1021
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,800
has been selling girls

1022
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,800
to please Yulou Spring.

1023
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,800
Bi Huang has aphrodisiac powder.

1024
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,800
That's why he made

1025
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,800
aphrodisiac in your house.

1026
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,800
Do you remember

1027
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,800
the fish soup on Man Shan Hong?

1028
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,800
The spring is full of

1029
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:57,940
white paper and the

1030
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,800
So, yesterday,

1031
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,800
they said they were sleepy.

1032
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,800
Li Lian Hua,

1033
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,800
I misused his water

1034
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,800
yesterday.

1035
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,800
He found it.

1036
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,800
What's wrong with you?

1037
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,800
Why do you ask so many questions?

1038
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,800
Miss Qing Er,

1039
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,800
last night,

1040
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,800
where did the girls

1041
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,800
who were selling the flowers

1042
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,800
plant the aphrodisiac?

1043
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,800
The best aphrodisiac flowers

1044
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,800
are planted in Yulou Spring.

1045
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,800
It seems that we can only go to see the aphrodisiac

1046
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,800
to find other evidence of Bi Huang.

1047
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,800
You're suspecting Bi Huang?

1048
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,800
Impossible.

1049
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,800
He's a good person

1050
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,800
and he likes Yulou Spring.

1051
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,800
How could it be him?

1052
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,800
Miss Qing Er,

1053
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,800
if Bi Huang really likes Yulou Spring,

1054
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,800
how could he choose the aphrodisiac

1055
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,800
and plant his own aphrodisiac?

1056
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,800
He knew that

1057
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,800
he would be chosen by the aphrodisiac,

1058
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,800
but he still did it.

1059
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,800
His purpose

1060
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,800
is to be punished in public.

1061
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,800
Why did he have to be punished in public?

1062
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,800
The answer is in this kanyun peak.

1063
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,800
That's the truth.

1064
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,800
You know that?

1065
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,800
I'm not sure.

1066
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,800
If I'm wrong,

1067
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,800
I don't know what to do.

1068
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,800
You're right.

1069
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,800
Li Lian Hua,

1070
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,800
have you found out

1071
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,800
the reason why Bi Huang

1072
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,800
went to the aphrodisiac

1073
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,800
and was punished?

1074
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,800
You need to know

1075
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,800
the kanyun peak

1076
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,800
and avoid being noticed by the guards.

1077
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,800
In a ladies' house,

1078
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,800
you could only see

1079
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,800
the aphrodisiac

1080
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,800
from here.

1081
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,020
Why the Fengshe

1082
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,060
You kill it

1083
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,480
Well, shoot

1084
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,720
Take advantage of them

1085
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,880
So can the Fengshe

1086
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,840
point a gun at the Fang18

1087
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,580
Right

1088
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,920
domestic violence

1089
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,980
If you want to point a gun at the Fang21

1090
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:54,180
Ñ

1091
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,200
Then you should check well

1092
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,100
My master

1093
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,080
If you want alearning

1094
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,740
I no longer believe

1095
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,800
The mortal world is too hasty

1096
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,800
Can't wait for the old heaven

1097
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,800
The coming of rain is long

1098
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,800
Let's make a wish

1099
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,800
The mortal world is too hasty

1100
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,800
The green mountains and waves are full of you

1101
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,800
Who doesn't want to part with the old life

1102
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,800
Let's go

1103
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,800
The mortal world is too hasty

1104
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,800
Can't wait for the old heaven

1105
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,800
The coming of rain is long

1106
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,800
Let's make a wish

1107
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,800
The mortal world is too hasty

1108
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,800
The green mountains and waves are full of you

1109
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,800
Who doesn't want to part with the old life

1110
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,800
Let's go

1111
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,800
The mortal world is too hasty

1112
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,800
The green mountains and waves are full of you

1113
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,800
Who doesn't want to part with the old life

1114
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,800
Let's go
