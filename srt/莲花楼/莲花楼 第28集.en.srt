4
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,160
It's been six days.

5
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,080
I can't wait any longer.

6
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,140
You're up.

7
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,460
Li Lianhua, you're really something.

8
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,190
You're so weak, you might as well be made of paper.

9
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,810
You just caught the flu.

10
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,990
But you were bedridden for so many days,

11
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,540
took so many of Brother Guan's ginseng pills,

12
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,000
and still didn't recover.

13
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,220
When you were sick,

14
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,079
your eyes weren't working very well either.

15
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,760
Li Lianhua.

16
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,660
Why don't you

17
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,220
stop looking for Lian Quan?

18
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,660
We can go back to my brother's place

19
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,510
and get him to treat you properly.

20
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,840
I am a physician myself.

21
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,660
If I go to your sworn brother,

22
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,050
won't I be admitting that I'm a bad physician?

23
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,050
I've gotten much better these days.

24
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:32,910
Next,

25
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,600
I think I should go out for a walk.

26
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,320
It might be a good idea.

27
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,430
Don't worry.

28
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,120
But the Lian Quan you mentioned

29
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,320
has disappeared from Shishou Village.

30
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,980
Where should we find him?

I need your help.

33
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,490
Get me a map of the emerald mines.

34
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:52,710
Emerald...

35
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,340
Why do you need that?

36
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,579
Lian Quan practiced the Netherworld Holy Passage.

37
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:58,950
The most powerful move is Bizhong Strike.

38
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,810
This move requires regular detoxing

39
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,600
to avoid harming the user.

40
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,730
I heard

41
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,950
he once bought

42
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,980
a massive screen wall made of emeralds.

43
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,240
With this screen wall,

44
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,970
he could detox and cool down.

45
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,440
When he left back then,

46
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,550
the emerald screen wall in his house

47
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,210
was shattered by his enemies.

48
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,770
I think, in order to stay alive,

49
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,950
he must be living near an emerald mine.

50
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,470
I see.

51
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,730
I'll go look for the map now.

52
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,130
Take care of your health.

53
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:27,800

56
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,470
waited outside your room for three days and nights.

57
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,400
Are you really not going to see him?

58
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,190
I can't give him the answer he wants.

59
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,329
Just tell him I'm out.

60

61
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,650

I have important work to do.

64
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,740

66
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,310
I know who Li Lianhua is.

67
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,130
You know?

68
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,170
Then why are you stopping me?

69
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,990
I just want to know

70
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,120
why he concealed his identity and refused to come back.

71
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,589
Also,

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,930
did my father, Shan Gudao's death,

73
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,420
have anything to do with him?

74
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,090
For your first question,

75
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,080
I know the answer, but I can't tell you.

76
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,659
For your second question,

77
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:41,280
I don't know the answer, and I cannot comment on it.

78
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,240
Why not?

79
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,030
Are you hiding something on purpose?

80
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:49,020
Okay.

81
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,130
Let me ask you one more question.

82
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,090
Is his martial arts really gone?

83
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:58,780
Or is he hiding his strength on purpose?

84
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,700
Even if he was hurt in his duel with Di Feisheng,

85
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,580
a master like him

86
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,440
couldn't have lost all his vigor.

87
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,250
What is he doing?

88
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,210
Mr. Fang,

89
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,430
have you thought about it?

90
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,880
Sometimes the simplest answer

91
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,130
is the most correct answer.

92
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,760
The tree wants to be still, but the wind wouldn't stop.

93
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,270
I don't understand.

94
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,340
Please enlighten me.

95
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,670
That's all I could say.

96
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,150
As for the rest, I've explained already.

97
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,130
I can't help you.

98
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,090
You have to find the truth yourself.

99
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,220
However,

100
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,010
I have a question for you.

101
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,350
Do you feel conflicted

102
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,920
because he is Li Xiangyi,

103
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,200
or because he is Li Lianhua?

104
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,030
If you have a storm in your heart,

105
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,080
you will lose the wisdom of a drop of water.

106
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,920
It's better to look back

107
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,850
at the wisdom in that single drop of water.

108
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,409
All these years,

109

he has always been alone.

110

You are the only friend

111

I've ever seen him with.

112
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,320
Friend?

113
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,870
I've known him for so long.

114
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,420
You knew about it.

115
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,780
Di Feisheng knew about it.

116
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,170
But I didn't know.

117
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,030
What kind of friend am I?

why is Li Lianhua on the Blade List?

131
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,710
The Sigu Sect received a secret letter stating that

132
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,230
Li Lianhua has joined the Jinyuan Alliance.

133
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,110
Sect Leader Xiao specially asked the Baichuan Court

134
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,160
to investigate this matter thoroughly.

135
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,960
This is absolutely impossible.

136
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,700
How can a secret letter that came out of nowhere

137
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,100
be enough to convict him?

138

Li Lianhua and I traveled together for months.

139
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,420
I can testify for

140
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,940
the kind of person he is.

All the righteous sects in the martial world can arrest him.

143

He is Di Feisheng.

150
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,260
You and Li Lianhua were inseparable.

How could he possibly recognize

158
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,380
Di Feisheng when he hadn't appeared

159
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,580

Mu Rongyao hasn't left Great Xi yet.

161

We'll know the truth soon.

163
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,550
I met Fei before.

164

But I've never seen his face.

165
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,390
Have you seen his weapon?

166
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,150
He carried a long knife on his back.

167
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,020
But he never unsheathed it.

168
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,470
He was very arrogant.

169
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:25,010
He said ordinary people are not worthy of his blade.

170
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,470
I remember now.

171
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,120
He unsheathed it once.

172
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,480
I remember it was a horizontal knife.

173
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,539
The blade was sharp on both sides.

174
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:41,900
There were golden hoops on it.

175
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,130
Every time he unsheathed his knife,

176
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,140
it unleashed a metallic whistling sound.

177
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,700
The first famous master that Di Feisheng killed

178
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,770
was the monk of the Blood Realm, Kuang Jiezi.

179
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,890
He removed the Golden Jade hoops

180
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,240
from his staff

181
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,580
and hung them on his knife as a trophy.

182
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,290
It seems that

183
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,380
he is indeed Di Feisheng.

184
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,510
I didn't expect Li Lianhua

185
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,400
to collude with Di Feisheng.

186
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,520
No matter what,

187
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,500
good and evil are irreconcilable.

188
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,190
If he is colluding with

189
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,600
the director of an evil sect,

190
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,750
then we didn't wrong him.

191
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,640
Wait.

192
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,460
Even if he's really with Di Feisheng,

193
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,020
it doesn't necessarily mean he's part of the Jinyuan Alliance now.

194
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,140
Maybe he's making use of Di Feisheng's authority

195
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,130
to investigate the Rama Heavenly Ices.

196
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,190
What's that?

197
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,360
We found an ancient vessel

198
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,820
while investigating Jin Mantang's case.

199
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,020
Hidden inside was the King of all Poison,

200
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,740
the searing karmic fire.

201
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,080
Searing karmic fire.

202
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,770
I didn't expect that

203
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,520
the searing karmic fire might resurface again.

204
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,420
This is such a serious matter.

205
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,390
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

206
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,710
In my opinion,

207
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,310
the searing karmic fire has been gone for a hundred years.

208
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,770
It's hard to tell if it's the real deal or not.

209
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,740
We have to get it back and find out.

210
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,940
Where is the Rama Heavenly Ice now?

211
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,460
It's with Li Lianhua?

212
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,910
With him?

213
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,190
You trust him so much,

214
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,390
but he's always so guarded against you.

215
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,050
He has no martial arts skills.

216
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,920
Could he have been better than you

217
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,080
at keeping it safe?

218
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,270
He's certainly skilled at manipulating people.

219
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:25,900
You're just

220
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,760
a greenhorn in the martial world,

221
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,760
and he played you like a fiddle.

222
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,420
After that,

223
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,330
you're still willing to speak up for him.

224
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,660
I'm not trusting him.

225
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,760
I'm trusting my instinct.

226
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,600
He might really be hiding something,

227
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,020
but he's not an evil person.

228
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,650
Was he ever frank to you?

229
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,880
We looked into it.

230
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,660
His name and origin are all fabricated.

231
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,840
If he were really just a

232
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,060
defenseless wandering physician of the martial world,

233
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,910
why was he somehow always

234
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,800
involved in the conflicts of the martial world?

235
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,610
You thought you were leading the investigations.

236
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,890
In actual fact,

237
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,440
think about who was actually in charge

238
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,760
between the two of you.

239
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,030
What kind of person is Di Feisheng?

240
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,820
He's selfish, prideful,

241
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,080
and cold-blooded.

242
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,340
But he's willing to disguise himself

243
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,700
and follow Li Lianhua.

244
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,050
I really can't figure out

245
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,970
who in the martial world can make Di Feisheng

246
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,450
follow him so obediently,

247
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,480
let alone this person's objective.

248
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,250
Li Lianhua is unfathomable.

249
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,720
Maybe

250
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,590
he is hiding an even bigger secret.

251
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,080
We must find out

252
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,470
who Li Lianhua is.

253
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,000
This is also your duty as a detective.

254
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,860
You know him best.

255
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,430
You must know his future moves

256
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,910
better than anyone else.

257
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,930
You're in charge of this case.

258
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,760
Bring him to justice as soon as possible.

259
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,490
Don't worry.

260
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:01,950
The Baichuan Court

261
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,680
will never wrong a good person.

262
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,950
If Li Lianhua is really innocent,

263
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,500
he can explain everything after we have captured him.

264
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,430
Then, we'll surely clear his name.

265
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,350
You also hope

266
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:15,210
to solve his mystery as soon as possible, don't you?

267
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,360
Besides being stingy,

268
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,840
always making things up,

269
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,570
and holding a bunch of secrets,

you are considered a good person.

271

You are also my first friend

Yes.

All traces of Lian Quan

277

were from ten years ago.

278
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,820
In the past ten years, this person has disappeared

279
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,080
without any movement.

280

Where should we find him?

281
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,970
Lian Quan disappeared without a trace.

282
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:31,700
But his henchmen

283
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,300
couldn't have done the same.

284
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,790
If I look for them one by one,

285
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,390
I'll surely find something.

These two are so special.

290
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,820
It must be hard to hide their traces even if they disguise themselves.

Dig up all the records about the

Look.

298
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,100
Most of the emeralds in the nation came from Persia.

299
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,500
There aren't many mines,

300
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,970
but there are five of them.

301
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,670
But they are so far apart from each other.

302
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,570
Are we going to check them one by one?

303
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,700
Lian Quan wants to avoid enemies.

304
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,560
Big mines attract too much attention.

305
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,890
It's impossible for Lian Quan to go there.

306

There's a hot spring here.

Hot spring?

312
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,600
Here, one can hide behind the mountains

We all thought he was a hunchback.

514
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,800
But one time he went to the brothel

515
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,590
and took off his clothes.

516
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,160
That was when we found another person on his back.

That must be the conjoined monster you mentioned.

After that,

half of the mine was blown up.

every 10 to 15 days,

530
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,520
strange sounds would come from the cave,

yelling that the King of Hell was getting married.

532
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,080
Then,

533
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,900
a family in the city will find

534
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,540
a box of money at their doorstep.

We used to disallow mining.

I heard from my ancestors that there is a God residing in the mountain.

543
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,520
Outsiders came here

544
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,520
to buy those green stones at a high price.

545
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,920
Many people heard the news

546
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,360
and came to mine for the rocks.

547
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,510
They left holes all over the mountain.

548

burnt a rich stone buyer's house to ashes.

I believe his surname was Yan.

552

Half of the mountain was blown up too.

Since then,

build 18 hot spring baths here

682
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,710
and compete with the beauty baths of Nanshan.

683
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,550
It will surely be famous in the southwest.

684
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,410
The only problem is that

685
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,160
there was a fire in that backyard.

686
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,490
It burnt quite badly.

687
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,480
I need to get someone to repair it.

688
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:55,360
Fire?

689
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,300
Doesn't that make this a haunted mansion?

690
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,300
Why did you buy it?

691
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,500
Haunted mansions are cheap.

692
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,170
How rich do you think we are?

693
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,260
Our riches came from

694
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,020
our savings.

695
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:05,350
It doesn't matter.

696
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,350
I've asked the local abbot

697
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,710
to perform an exorcism.

698
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,370
Do you know?

699
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,180
This mansion would normally sell for 5,000 taels.

700
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,790
Do you know how much I paid for it?

701
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,030
50 taels!

702
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,700
What do you think? Your mother has good taste, right?

703
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,900
Praise me. Praise me.

704
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:26,900
The beautiful and capable Lady He Xiaohui

705
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,640
is truly smart, observant,

706
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,440
and decisive.

707
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:30,550
Alright.

708
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,960
Good luck with your hot spring baths.

709
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,160
I'll be off to do work.

710
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:35,340
Goodbye.

711
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,230
Where are you going?

712
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,960
I have serious work to do.

713
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,540
Even if you have serious work to do,

714
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,740
you still need to eat.

715
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,630
I met him on the way.

716
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,190
I invited him here too.

717
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,120
Him?

718
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,160
Who?

719
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,130
Oh, just in time.

720
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,520
You sure are brave.

721
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,740
How dare you come here?

722
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,290
Do you really think I dare not arrest you?

723
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:05,620
I'm looking for Master He.

724
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,830
This has nothing to do with you.

725
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,390
Let go.

726
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,070
Xiaobao, what are you doing?

727
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,780
Isn't he your friend?

728
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,240
Mother.

729
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,220
He's not my friend now.

730
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,770
He's a wanted man on the Baichuan Court's Blade List.

731
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:16,970
I'll take him with me.

732
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,400
Xiaobao.

733
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,700
What happened?

734
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,670
Explain it to me.

735
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,260
Mother.

736
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,240
I'm here to arrest him.

737
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,150
Arrest him?

738
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,070
What crime did he commit?

739
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,070
Rape, abduction,

740
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,460
murder, or robbery?

741
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,880
I can't explain it to you.

742
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,880
Don't interfere.

743
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,420
Let me tell you.

744
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,310
Li Lianhua is my guest.

745
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,100
We were like old friends at first sight.

746
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,760
If anyone dares to harm my guest in my territory,

747
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,620
they'll be going against me.

748
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,540
You are no exception.

749
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,110
Mother.

750
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,850
Your aunt admires him too.

751
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,820
You know your aunt is getting old.

752
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,590
She has never admired someone before.

753
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,050
Right?

754
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:02,970
Mr. Li, right?

755
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,500
Your sister is indeed my friend.

756
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,380
We are...

757
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,080
Shut up.

758
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,580
Don't use my aunt as a shield.

759
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,390
Come with me.

760
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,040
Fang Xiaobao.

761
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,090
How dare you.

762
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,620
You won't even obey me now?

763
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,380
I never taught you

764
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,780
to treat a guest like this.

765
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,510
Let go of him.

766
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,400
Mother.

767
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,100
Be careful of my punishment.

768
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:28,740
I'm sorry.

769
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,680
Don't mind him.

770
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,960
Please come in, Physician Li.

771
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:32,970
Watch the steps.

772
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:33,920
Physician Li.

773
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,560
Master He.

774
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,290
Just call me Mr. Li.

775
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:36,760
Okay.

776
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,350
Might as well call him Swindler Li.

777
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,820
Please come in.

778
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:45,710
Mr. Li.

779
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,040
Please have a seat.

780
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,970
I didn’t expect you to be so young, Master He.

781
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,260
Really?

782
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:55,520
Boot licker.

783
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,190
I didn’t expect that the

784
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,410
smart and resourceful Mr. Li my son always mentioned

785
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:07,980
is such a handsome man.

786
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,770
Xiaobao often told me about

787
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,300
his case solving adventures with you.

788
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,700
He said you are good at making decisions,

789
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,820
and he learned a lot from you.

790
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,460
You're too kind, Master He.

791
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,710
Your son helped me a lot too.

792
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,270
The young fox is no match for the old fox.

793
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,650
The older, the wiser.

794
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,920
Wasn't it you who couldn't stop

795
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,160
praising Li Lianhua?

796
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,750
You said that you found a bosom friend in life,

797
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,480
and it was worth your trip to the martial world.

798
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,210
You said you only wished to travel with him again.

799
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:42,820
Didn't you say that?

800
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,060
I didn't see his true colours back then.

801
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,260
You don't use your eyes to make friends.

802
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,830
You use your heart.

803
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,110
When I saw Li Lianhua,

804
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,990
I had a feeling we would get along.

805
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,600
I believe he's not an evil person.

806
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,780
What happened between you two?

807
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,180
Let's make it clear here today.

808
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,820
If you like our wine, drink more.

809
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,920
When you go to the prison of Baichuan Court,

810
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,120
you can't drink such good wine anymore.

811
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,570
Don't listen to him.

812
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,370
Drink more.

813
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,719
-Drink more.
-Mother.

814
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:24,940
Fang Xiaobao,

815
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,610
I was reluctant to let you go

816
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:29,980
when you insisted on roaming the martial world.

817
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,100
I was afraid that your bad habits

818
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,380
and lack of experience

819
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,040
would land you in big trouble.

820
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:38,290
But you met Li Lianhua.

821
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,350
Not only did he not lead you astray,

822
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,739
but he also protected you in many ways.

823
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:43,460
Just for that, I'll accept it.

824
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:47,020
In life,

825
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:49,530
everyone has secrets they don't want to tell.

826
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,130
If you leave room for others,

827
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:53,340
you're leaving room for yourself.

828
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,620
Just like how you hid the fact that

829
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,020
Shan Gudao was my father?

830
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:57,940
You...

831
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,110
You brat.

832
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,560
How dare you bring that up again?

833
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,280
-You've gotten too arrogant.
-It hurts.

834
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,500
-Is that it?
-It hurts.

835
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,170
Do you think your father was a good man?

836
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:09,230
I have my reasons for not telling you.

837
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,110
I hate the people

838
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,590
from Baichuan Academy and Sigu Sect the most.

839
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:15,590
All the grudges in the martial world

840
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,360
were caused by those people

841
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,920
who claimed to be from righteous sects.

842
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,310
They wanted to set rules for the martial world.

843
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:23,110
But in the end,

844
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,160
it was all for the rulemakers

845
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,240
to gain more power.

846
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,150
The martial world is what it is.

847
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,380
The rules of the martial world are the world itself.

848
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,780
There are 420 volumes of law in this dynasty.

849
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:37,050
There are more than 3,000 books worth of rules.

850
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,420
But out of those rules,

851
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,300
none of them can restrain the people of the martial world.

852
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,730
So,

853
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,260
I admire willful and free-spirited

854
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,520
wanderers like Mr. Li.

855
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,860
He doesn't participate in any sect conflicts,

856
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,410
unlike Fang Xiaobao's past subject of admiration,

857
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,370
Li Xiangyi.

858
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,570
I think the so-called hero

859
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,300
is a man who hunts for fame.

860
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,230
I don't know what's so good about him.

861
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:10,920
Mother.

862
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:12,800
Mr. Li,

863
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,800
you don't know.

864
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:14,880
Xiaobao

865
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,490
tried very hard to be Li Xiangyi's disciple.

866
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,320
Such a big bitter pill,

867
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,970
he would swallow it by force.

868
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,680
In order to stand up,

869
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:25,290
he pierced his 12 major acupoints every day.

870
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,480
It was so painful,

871
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,220
he fainted many times.

872
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,420
But he refused to cry.

873
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,580
All that, just for what Li said.

874
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:35,300
He said, if Xiaobao could hold a sword,

875
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,320
he would take him as his disciple.

876
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,650
Isn't this kid silly?

877
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,680
Mother, can you stop talking?

878
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:48,660
Madam,

879
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:50,420
the doctor sent the medicine.

880
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:50,750
Okay.

881
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:51,540
Just put it there.

882
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,140
Medicine?

883
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,340
Mother, are you feeling unwell?

884
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,390
I heard that the underground water nearby

885
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:59,700
is not clean enough for drinking.

886
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,500
Li and I were new here.

887
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:02,860
We didn't know that.

888
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,660
That's why we have some diarrhea

889
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,720
these two days.

890
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:06,930
It's nothing serious.

891
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,230
Go back and take your medicine.

892
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,630
Don't talk so much.

893
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,330
Okay?

894
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,180
Master He,

895
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:16,200
no need to be so polite.

896
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,930
Your health is more important.

897
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:19,380
Okay.

898
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,020
Mr. Li.

899
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,620
I’ll leave you to it.

900
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:24,660
By the way,

901
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,470
you haven't seen the courtyard, have you?

902
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,150
Li.

903
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,540
-Madam.
-Take Mr. Li

904
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,460
and Young Master

905
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,620
on a tour of the mansion later.

906
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,020
Yes.

907
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,450
This way, Young Master.

908
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,340
Why is the backyard so deserted?

909
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,860
Actually, I heard from the servant next door that

910
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,460
a tragic incident happened in this yard.

911
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,740
Was it the fire my mother mentioned?

912
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,900
The original owner of this place was called Yan Qingtian.

913
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,590
Apparently, his wife had an affair with his steward.

914
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,010
They killed him in the middle of the night,

915
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,810
burnt half of the mansion down,

916
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,310
and ran away with all the valuables in the house.

917
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:09,390
Madam isn't afraid.

918
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,390
But we servants are scared to death.

919
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,180
Young Master,

920
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,780
please tour the rest of

921
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,500
the courtyard yourselves.

922
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:28,760
I'm really sorry

923
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:32,470
for keeping some things from you.

924
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,330
You purposely came to my house

925
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,930
to befriend my mother.

926
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,560
What do you want?

927
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:40,460
That's not true.

928
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:44,070
I just happened to run into Li.

929
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:47,410
Fang Duobing.

930
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,400
I didn't kill your father.

931
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,460
I can trust you.

932
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:01,820
All of a sudden, so many evidence pointed to you.

933
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,060
It's too coincidental.

934
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,500
It's possible that someone knows you're alive

935
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,620
and deliberately pointed all the clues toward you.

936
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,620
But just because it's intentional,

937
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,410
it doesn't mean it's definitely fake.

938
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:11,420
You may be innocent.

939
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,220
You may not be.

940
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,290
If you can tell me

941
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,050
everything you've concealed,

942
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,920
I can make my own judgment.

943
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,350
Other than my identity,

944
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,890
I didn't hide

945
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,860
anything else.

946
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,820
Did you really show up

947
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,460
outside the Yipin Tomb by accident,

948
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,440
and not because you knew Di Feisheng

949
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,910
was looking for the Weeping Guanyin there?

950
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,670
Did you really investigate cases with me

951
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,130
because you admire my skills,

952
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:35,060
and not because you want to enter the Baichuan Court.

953
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:35,900
Did Difeisheng really

954
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,360
plant the Gang Qi in my body

955
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,450
because you refused to save someone?

956
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:41,290
You lied to me that he was an Iron Head Slave

957
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,140
and kept him by your side.

958
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,740
Was that also coincidental?

959
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,740
Come to think of it,

960
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,700
you really don't hide anything.

961
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:56,010
In the end, I was the only one kept out of the loop.

962
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,060
I didn't know anything.

963
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,660
There are many things

964
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,840
I really can't help.

965
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,940
How convenient.

966
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,160
Wait.

967
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:20,550
[Baishui Garden]

968
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:22,790
This yard was originally called Baishui Garden.

969
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,860
Baishui means spring.

970
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,640
Could it be the Netherworld Mansion?

971
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,510
Netherworld Mansion.

972
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,880
Did my mother buy the Netherworld Mansion?

973
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,540
If what those servants said is true,

974
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,100
the one who died must be Lian Quan.

975
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,580
But the Lord of the Netherworld is so skilled.

976
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,770
How could he be killed

977
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:56,830
his wife and her lover just like that?

978
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,730
There must be something wrong.

979
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:04,190
Have you heard of the King of Hell getting married?

980
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:04,940
I suspect

981
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,300
this is related to Lian Quan.

982
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:12,420
The Lord of the Netherworld's martial arts ranked third 10 years ago.

983
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:15,510
His unique skill, Bizhong Strike, could even dissolve bones.

984
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,170
Since you can find this place,

985
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,350
you must also be here for Lian Quan.

986
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:20,170
Maybe,

987
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:21,850
we can work together.

988
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,260
Do you think

989
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:26,220
I can't solve the case without you?

990
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:27,800
That would be a waste of

991
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,930
all the skills you secretly taught me.

992
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:33,210
If you can't tell me your secrets,

993
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,180
fine.

994
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:37,410
There'll be someone who can make you talk.

995
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:46,220
What a coincidence.

996
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,400
When I met you at the door,

997
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,660
I sent a messenger pigeon.

998
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,320
I have no time to joke with you.

999
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:00,380
Where is the Rama Heavenly Ice in your possession?

1000
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:03,830
Why are the two of you

1001
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,590
always pulling a long face?

1002
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,580
I heard that

1003
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:09,220
Master Yun shut himself away for 10 years.

1004
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,240
I didn't expect you to

1005
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,310
leave your place to catch me.

1006
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:13,370
You even tied me up.

1007
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,940
What did I do to deserve this?

1008
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:18,950
Don't change the subject.

1009
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:22,220
Maybe you don't know what the Baichuan Court is capable of.

1010
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,980
We have something called the Water Dragon Incense.

1011
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,460
The first stick of incense creates an addiction.

1012
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,170
The second stick alleviates the addiction.

1013
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,370
No matter what kind of tough man you are,

1014
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,750
you can't withstand it.

1015
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:32,590
Well,

1016
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:34,550
isn't it a waste

1017
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:36,510
to use something so strong on me?

1018
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:44,490
We only use the Water Dragon Incense

1019
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:46,350
to deal with extremely evil people.

1020
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:48,290
I don't know why

1021
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:50,080
you hate Li Lianhua so much.

1022
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,440
When we find where Lotus Tower is,

1023
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:56,580
we'll return to Baichuan Court immediately.

1024
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:00,530
Fang Xiaobao.

1025
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:02,070
Fang Xiaobao!

1026
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,090
Since I caught you this time,

1027
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,930
you should be obedient and

1028
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:10,230
go back to Tianji Mountain Manor with me.

1029
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,740
You've had your fun playing detective.

1030
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,190
Next, you should go back

1031
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,900
and prepare to get married.

1032
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,050
-You hear me?
-Who said I’m going back?

1033
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,700
Where are you going then?

1034
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,820
You don't even have a partner now.

1035
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,850
Are you going to travel alone?

1036
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:30,990
Madam.

1037
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:32,620
Young Master.

1038
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:33,420
What's wrong?

1039
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:34,660
Why did someone put a box of money

1040
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:35,810
in front of our door?

1041
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,070
The King of Hell is getting married.
