4
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:40,380
What's wrong?

5
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:44,660
The jade pendant hanging on his waist

6
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,289
shouldn't be this heavy.

[A promise of life and death]

8
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,460
A promise of life and death.

9
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:58,300
The life-and-death jade?

10
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,190
You know about it too?

11
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,140
The life-and-death jade is the proof of contract with the royal family.

12
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,260
By accepting this contract,

13
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,780
the family is obliged to serve the royal family forever.

14
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,520
But Liu Kehe's family

15
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,100
worked in the Ministry of Works for generations.

16
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,900
Their positions weren't high either.

17
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,260
Why do they own a piece of life-and-death jade?

18
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,500
Who did they make the contract with?

19
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,920
The answer

20
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,870
is in the Pagoda of Bliss.

21
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,100
Imperial Preceptor.

22
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,740
Why do you have to enter the palace in the middle of the night to choose the address?

23
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,150
A murder happened a few days ago.

24
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,430
It's not safe at night.

25
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,220
I purposely chose to come here at night.

26
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,630
Because when the moon is the brightest,

27
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,410
the direction of Fengshui becomes most obvious.

28
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,900
Why are there new recruits today?

29
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,590
The ministry's craftsmen were killed.

30
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:54,960
We were short of hands.

31
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,870
So I asked people from the Wansheng Clan to help.

32
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,590
This matter has been delayed for too long.

33
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,540
We should speed up.

34
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,850
I'll ask them to search the place right away.

35
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,290
Everyone.

36
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,970
I come with Empress Dowager's verbal instructions!

37
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,400
Eunuch Wang, please take the Imperial Preceptor and all craftsmen

38
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,770
to Mingluan Garden immediately.

39
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:14,880
She wishes to discuss something important.

40
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,270
Everyone?

41
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:17,730
Yes.

42
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,710
Faking the Empress Dowager's verbal instructions...

43
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:33,490
Fang Xiaobao,

44
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,329
you owe the princess another favor.

45
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,510
This is an important matter.

46
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,450
I hope we can stall them for a while.

47
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,750
Let's start searching.

48
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:41,190
Over there.

49
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,420
This way.

50
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:00,980
Strange.

51
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,350
We've searched everywhere.

52
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,260
It doesn't look like

53
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,940
there's a tower hidden anywhere.

54
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,980
Did we pick the wrong direction?

55
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,540
Or

56
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,780
is there some kind of illusion

57
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,880
that we missed out?

58
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,780
Li Lianhua.

59
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,820
Why are you spacing out?

60
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,220
The Demon Monk will be back if we don't find it soon.

61
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,020
It should be nearby.

62
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,460
The Pagoda of Bliss is a tower.

63
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,510
But why is the entrance a well?

64
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,650
Maybe the pagoda is gone.

65
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,040
But the treasure is still there.

66
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,260
So they must have entered

67
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,780
a secret room in the well instead.

68
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,120
Think about it.

69
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,460
Li Fei and others have been to the Pagoda of Bliss.

70
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,150
That means if we fall into the well,

71
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,580
we can find the pagoda.

72
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,100
Was Zhao Chi's action before he died

73
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,560
hinting at something?

74
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,810
You mean

75
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,460
the Pagoda of Bliss is in the well?

76
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,340
How is that possible?

77
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,300
Did the Pagoda of Bliss become a well?

78
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,840
I got it.

79
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,010
The Pagoda of Bliss is a well.

80
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:12,880
Look.

81
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:17,930
Well.

82
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:22,850
Pagoda.

83
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,260
When Zhao Chi died,

84
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,260
he hinted that the pagoda is a well.

85
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,640
Such an abstruse design.

86
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:35,980
I understand now.

87
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:37,700
It's the Iron Mountain Collapse.

88
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,020
You've heard of it too?

89
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,850
In the Book of Mechanisms,

90
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,010
there is a Blood Realm mining mechanism called the

91
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,540
Iron Mountain Collapse.

92
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,350
They first hang an extremely heavy weight up high.

93
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,420
Then, by suddenly reversing the mechanism,

94
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,480
the weight will rapidly fall down,

95
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,750
smash a hole into the ground,

96
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,330
and pour stucco into the hole.

97
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,340
In an instant, a small mine cave will be created.

98
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,130
There was a heavy weight at the top of the pagoda.

99
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,430
Each level of the pagoda was connected too.

100
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,980
On the night of the disappearance,

101
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,540
someone reversed the mechanism

102
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,470
and let the heavy weight at the top of the pagoda fall rapidly.

103
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,020
It penetrated the ground layer

104
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,970
and sank the entire pagoda underground.

105
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,220
And so, the pagoda became a well overnight.

106
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,100
The well opening must be well hidden.

107
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,700
There was no need for Liu Kehe

108
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,900
to fill the well more than ten years ago.

109
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,540
It should be Xue Kuan.

110
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,090
After he got drunk,

111
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,770
he accidentally found the entrance.

112
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,890
Then, to find the entrance to the Pagoda of Bliss,

113
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,550
we need to think about where a drunk person

114
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,750
would go in an abandoned garden.

115
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,140
Drunk.

116
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,659
Moonlight.

117
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:33,900
Osmanthus.

118
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,200
If he wanted to admire the moon or rest his legs,

119
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,940
wouldn't he look for a pavilion?

120
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:40,930
Wait.

121
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,260
Eunuch Wu wrote this poem.

122
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,290
He used to serve Emperor Guangqing

123
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,360
and stayed closely by his side.

124
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,820
He was such a busy man,

125
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,370
yet he had the time to admire the moon and write poems.

126
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:01,890
Don't you think it's suspicious?

127
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,740
Unless his poem has a hidden meaning.

128
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,060
The Hanyun fluffs piled in a corner.

129
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,800
Gathering them, I made a flowerbed.

130
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,430
There isn't a place called Hanyun

131
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,620
in the palace.

132
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,730
Maybe it's the name of the pavilion.

133
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,540
And this one.

134
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,390
Flying snow turns into rain.

135
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,650
The snow turned into rain in mid-air.

136
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,480
It means the temperature was high.

137
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,290
Could it be...

138
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:28,760
A hot spring pool?

139
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,980
The Iron Mountain Collapse could only be built on soft soil.

140
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,050
Naturally, a spot with water is more suitable.

141
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,920
Liu Kehe's construction booklet.

142
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,020
On the 8th of July,

143
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,530
we dismantled the Hanyun pavilion,

144
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,700
filled the Liuye pond,

145
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,260
and built a stone mountain.

146
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,659
It's here.

147
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,870
The base of the pavilion is still here.

148
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,870
The rocks look like they weigh hundreds of kilograms.

149
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:05,990
Fang Xiaobao.

150
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,300
Can you do it?

151
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:09,380
Li Lianhua.

152
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:10,530
Just watch me.

153
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,800
The spiritual tower leads to mysteries.

154
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,190
Move not and obtain bliss.

155
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,040
This well was formed when the Pagoda of Bliss was inverted.

156
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,050
Looks like we've found the right place.

157
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,530
Let's go over there.

158
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,850
Come and have a look.

159
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,340
So many treasures.

160
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,780
This should be the main hall of the Pagoda of Bliss.

161
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,050
When Xue Kuan and the others found this place,

162
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,370
it was hard for them to resist their greed.

163
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,430
The people who accidentally entered the pagoda back then

164
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,210
must have seen these veiled hats too.

165
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,040
Maybe someone wore such a hat

166
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,200
and escaped with the treasures.

167
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,280
Liu Kehe who had been guarding nearby

168
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,660
found that they accidentally entered the pagoda.

169
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,060
So he released the tiger to bite Xue Kuan to death.

170
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,830
The rest of them were traumatized by the event.

171
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,790
That's why Liu Kehe

172
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,420
just had to hang a veiled hat

173
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,680
in the White Jade Academy

174
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,540
to terrify them.

175
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,850
Liu Kehe sure went out of his way

176
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,000
to protect the treasures here.

177
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,800
If this pagoda were that simple,

178
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,260
the person who sealed this tower 100 years ago

179
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,050
should have taken

180
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,100
these treasures long ago.

181
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,390
Forget it.

182
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,060
Let's not think about that.

183
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,940
Our priority is to find the mother bug.

184
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,300
Fang Xiaobao.

185
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,470
The Rama Vessel.

186
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,950
It's not the same one.

187
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,810
But the shape is exactly the same.

188
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:26,700
This one

189
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,330
must have been sealed here

190
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,970
with the Pagoda of Bliss 100 years ago.

191
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:31,820
Look.

192
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,040
The vessel is broken.

193
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,390
Is the mother bug inside?

194
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,920
Look at this male body.

195
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,090
There's a hole between his eyebrows.

196
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,680
You're right.

197
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:41,980
Why is that?

198
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,090
Karmic bugs

199
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,670
feed on blood and flesh.

200
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,280
They're especially fond of the human head marrow.

201
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,100
Since the vessel is broken,

202
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,850
after the mother bug woke up,

203
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,580
she'd definitely look for blood and flesh to eat.

204
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,180
As such,

205
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,840
the mother bug is in his head.

206
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,510
Demon Monk!

207
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,780
Thank you for your help.

208
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,110
I'll be taking the mother bug.

209
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,930
The two of you can die here in the Pagoda of Bliss instead.

210
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,040
Darn it. He took the mother bug.

211
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:20,830
Wait.

212
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,600
It's in the vessel.

213
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,020
I saw a movement outside the door,

214
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,520
so I only said half of my words.

215
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,190
It's been decades since the mother bug

216
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,360
fed on this male body.

217
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,520
Once nothing was left,

218
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,340
she returned to her nest to hibernate.

219
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,330
The vessel is her nest.

220
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,630
Go ahead, open it.

221
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:45,820
It's really inside.

222
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,580
I'm afraid we can't hide this for long.

223
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,890
Shan Gudao will be here for it soon.

224
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,460
Li Lianhua.

225
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,340
It will be a tough battle later.

226
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,760
You'd better hide.

227
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,860
Why fight a tough battle?

228
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,370
Since we have the stuff,

229
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,870
the most important thing now

230
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,230
is to find a chance to escape.

231
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,860
I have so many traps waiting to be used.

232
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,910
If not now,

233
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,640
when will I ever use them?

234
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,330
Good for you.

235
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:16,720
I found it.

236
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:17,960
You found it?

237
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,300
Why is it empty?

238
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,210
Li Lianhua tricked us.

239
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,670
Li Xiangyi.

240
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,640
Even if you swallow the mother bug this time,

241
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,040
I'll cut your belly open and get it.

242
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,530
Li Lianhua.

243
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,690
I found a secret passage out of here

244
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,310
when I was setting the traps.

245
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,210
We can go now.

246
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,070
What are you looking at?

247
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,120
Did you hear me?

248
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,540
I know why the Pagoda of Bliss

249
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,580
disappeared overnight.

250
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,020
Why?

251
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,710
The words and murals were carved on the wall

252
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,330
to cover up a huge secret.

253
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,780
The biggest secret in the pagoda is not these treasures,

254
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,170
but the man on the bed.

255
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,550
This body belonged to the

256
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,240
long-deceased Nanyin sorcerer,

257
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,460
Feng Ahlu.

258
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,440
Feng Ahlu, the man who could control the karmic bugs?

259
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,960
No wonder the karmic bug is here.

260
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,670
A hundred years ago, Emperor Guangqing had no offspring.

261
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,240
He built the Pagoda of Bliss to change the Fengshui and pray for a son.

262
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,950
Feng Ahlu pretended to be a craftsman,

263
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,420
[Feng Ahlu]

264
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,370
mixed into the palace,

265
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,000
and intended to use the mother bug in the Rama Vessel

266
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,500
to assassinate Emperor Guangqing.

267
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,610
But when he sneaked into the palace for the assassination,

268
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,810
he ran into Consort Ying instead.

269
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,500
[Consort Ying]

270
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,520
He fell for her unparalleled beauty

271
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,500
and thought they were destined to be together.

272
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:01,990
For Consort Ying,

273
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,490
the sorcerer forgot his mission

274
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,880
and willingly became her secret lover.

275
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,960
He looked forward to meeting

276
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,560
Consort Ying every day.

277
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,450
The sorcerer was hidden in the Pagoda of Bliss,

278
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,340
where he often met Consort Ying in private.

279
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:16,700
Soon,

280
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,040
Consort Ying finally got pregnant.

281
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,820
The sorcerer thought that after Consort Ying gave birth,

282
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
she would take the child and elope with him.

283
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,460
Consort Ying was pregnant for ten months.

284
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,740
The sorcerer waited eagerly for her for ten months.

285
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,220
But when Consort Ying gave birth,

286
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,860
the sorcerer fell into the underground with the Pagoda of Bliss

287
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,900
and never saw the sun again.

288
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:44,830
The entire pagoda

289
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,660
was Consort Ying's plan.

290
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,990
Emperor Guangqing

291
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,660
was infertile.

292
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,200
Consort Ying wanted a child.

293
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,000
So she planned the whole thing

294
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,380
to become the queen

295
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,670
and seize power.

296
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,190
After that, she destroyed all the records

297
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,490
related to the Pagoda of Bliss.

298
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,010
Sorcerer Feng Ahlu

299
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,860
was buried underground with the Pagoda of Bliss.

300
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,190
That's why he was full of anger

301
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,380
and drew these.

302
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,560
In the end, he died in slow agony.

303
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,740
But if Emperor Guangqing’s son

304
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,940
is the son of the sorcerer, then...

305
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,700
After Emperor Guangqing,

306
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,360
the royal bloodline was lost.

307
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,460
If this gets out,

308
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,220
the world will be in chaos.

309
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,650
So the Pagoda of Bliss

310
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,380
must be a secret forever.

311
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,060
No wonder Liu Kehe

312
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,520
would rather kill and commit suicide

313
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,980
than let anyone find out the secret.

314
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,910
Consort Ying and the Liu family made the contract

315
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,810
and promised to employ the Liu family for generations.

316
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,820
So they conspired to build

317
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,770
the Pagoda of Bliss.

318
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,460
Not only was the pagoda equipped with the Iron Mountain Collapse,

319
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,320
it also had a secret room.

320
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,340
This pagoda was designed

321
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,220
to keep this secret forever.

322
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,460
The secret passage you just mentioned

323
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,050
is the one where Feng Ahlu and Consort Ying used to meet in private,

324
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:01,870
right?

325
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:07,319
Oh no.

326
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:08,290
They are here.

327
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:09,400
Come with me.

328
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:16,470
Let's go!

329
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:23,010
They escaped.

330
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,140
Li Xiangyi!

331
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:26,810
It's okay.

332
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:28,300
They can't escape.

333
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:29,540
This secret passage

334
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,370
should lead to somewhere in the palace.

335
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:32,830
It's not convenient for me

336
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,980
to openly search

337
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,290
the palace yards yet.

338
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,570
I can only count on you now.

339
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:00,810
What's going on?

340
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,380
Someone must have reported to the Imperial City Division.

341
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,700
They're here to stop us.

342
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,220
That's right. You're correct.

343
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,800
Here comes His Majesty.

344
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,400
Greetings, Your Majesty.

345
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,010
Be careful, Your Majesty.

346
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,630
The vessel in his hand

347
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,220
is for poisoning people.

348
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,460
I shall capture him.

349
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,620
Don't bother, Imperial Preceptor.

350
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,220
The Imperial City Division should keep the evidence.

351
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:37,790
Your Majesty.

352
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,270
Li Lianhua, Fang Duobing.

353
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,020
When the Imperial Preceptor said you dug a secret passage

354
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,250
in the imperial harem and wanted to rebel,

355
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,230
I didn't believe it.

356
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,430
But I see it's true.

357
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,400
Your Majesty,

358
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,140
we didn't dig the secret passage.

359
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,630
We don't plan to rebel either.

360
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,600
Then tell me,

361
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,910
why are you digging a secret passage

362
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,660
in the imperial harem instead of

363
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,460
investigating the murder case?

364
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,500
Your Majesty.

365
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:16,990
The entrance of the secret passage

366
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,490
is at least a few decades old.

367
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,140
I believe they didn't do it.

368
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,430
Maybe there's some misunderstanding.

369
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,500
This secret passage has been here for a hundred years.

370
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,640
Where does the secret passage lead to?

371
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,680
Why are you hesitating?

372
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,550
Can't you say it?

373
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,460
It leads to the Pagoda of Bliss.

374
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:46,710
Is there really the Pagoda of Bliss?

375
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,100
Fang Duobing.

376
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:51,800
You are the son of Fang Zeshi.

377
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,980
You've been to the palace since you were young.

378
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,590
You should know the consequences of deceiving me.

379
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:58,770
Tell me.

380
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,660
Is there really the Pagoda of Bliss?

381
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:04,680
Yes.

382
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,900
What's in the Pagoda of Bliss?

383
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,080
A lot of treasures.

384
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,050
A lot of treasures,

385
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,420
but you came out empty-handed?

386
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,680
We are not thieves.

387
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,360
Then why did you take this strange vessel?

388
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:19,620
Tell me.

389
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,650
What's the origin of this strange vessel?

390
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,780
Lock them here for now.

392
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,500
Come take a look with me.

393
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,280
If there really is the Pagoda of Bliss,

394
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,570
I can believe

395
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,540
what they said.

396
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,540
If not,

397
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,780
don't blame me for being ruthless.

398
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,520
Your Majesty.

399
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,550
You can't enter the secret passage.

400
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,420
Step aside.

401
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:45,910
Your Majesty.

402
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,780
At this point,

403
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,270
why didn't you tell His Majesty about the Karmic Bugs?

404
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,130
If we tell him about the Karmic Bugs,

405
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,450
we have to talk about the pagoda's 100-year-old secret.

406
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,130
We can't talk about that.

407
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,110
Even if we don't say it,

408
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,280
His Majesty saw it himself.

409
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,320
Your Majesty.

410
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,020
Bad news.

411
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,080
The Empress Dowager left the palace to burn incense.

412
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,020
But she was abducted.

413
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,260
It's my fault.

414
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,750
I'll bring the Empress Dowager back now.

415
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:42,800
Let's go.

416
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,530
Are you two responsible for that?

417
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,280
At a time like this,

418
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,600
if we can't explain, we should run.

419
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,980
The secret passage and the Pagoda of Bliss are all fake.

420
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,390
It's all your tricks.

421
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,140
Arrest them!

422
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,480
Get ready to retreat.

423
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,110
Stop! Stop!

424
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:03,670
After them!

425
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,250
The three of us have yet to find a worthy opponent

426

Your Highness, please forgive me.

433
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,920
So you really plan to rebel.

434
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,360
It's not too late to know now.

435
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,400
Lord Xuanyuan.

436
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,530
I struck you too hard.

437
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:20,960
My apologies.

438
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,130
Wipe your eyes and take a good look.

It merely screeched,

Why was he so angry

455

and wanted to arrest you two?

456
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,980
His Majesty has his own reason.

457
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,860
Your Highness, it's better not to ask.

458
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,090
Did those thieves steal things

459
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,460
and make Father misunderstand you?

460
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,460
This can't do.

461
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,050
I'll arrest all of them

462
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,090
and clear your name.

463
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:21,820
Your Highness, don't.

Wait for us to return

By the way,

509
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,740

00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,540
Okay.

514
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,020
When you're done,

515
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,210
we'll meet at the Lotus Tower.

516
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,120
Okay.

517
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,600
I have to meet him

518
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:17,990
eventually.

519
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,200
[Live and work in peace]

520
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,170
[Tianji Mountain Manor]

521
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:32,870
Young Master.

522
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,060
Don't go near the manor.

523
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:35,590
It's surrounded by guards from the court.

524
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:37,940
Where is my mother?

525
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,180
Mother.

526
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,530
I caused trouble

527
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,460
and implicated Father.

528
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,980
Xiaobao, get up.

529
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:53,900
Come on.

530
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:56,460
Xiaobao.

531
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,100
Do you remember the character scroll hanging in your room?

532
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,900
Justice and Righteousness.

533
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,750
When you were three,

534
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,230
your father gave you that scroll,

535
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,590
hoping you could become

536
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,750
a man of integrity.

537
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:13,360
Right now, you're doing exactly that.

538
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,920
What fault do you have?

539
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:16,770
Your father won't blame you.

540
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,940
But the Imperial City Division took Father away.

541
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,070
I don't know what Shan Gudao will do to him.

542
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:22,050
Mother.

543
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,560
Please contact the elders of the court and the princes

544
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,050
and ask them to put in a good word for Father.

545
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,210
I'll send some men who haven't been seen before to wait outside the city.

546
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,010
If anything bad happens,

547
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,460
we'll have to find the chance and break him out of prison.

548
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:36,590
If that happens,

549
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,460
your father will live the rest of his life

550
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,110
as a runaway rebel.

551
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,460
You know your father.

552
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,320
He'd rather die than become that.

553
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,700
I won't take the risk

554
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,170
unless I absolutely have to.

555
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,180
I can't let anything

556
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,240
happen to my father.

557
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,310
You really came.

558
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,030
Sect Leader.

559
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:49,670
It's really you.

560
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,240
I invited you here

561
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,930
to ask about the whereabouts

562
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:57,930
of Jiao Liqiao's lair.

563
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,720
Sorry.

564
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,360
My hands haven't been steady lately.

565
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,790
So I can't pour you tea.

566
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,550
I'm the one who should be sorry.

567
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,460
Let bygones be bygones.

568
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,220
I'm not talking about the past.

569
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:18,540
I'm sorry about the present.

570
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:51,920
Li Lianhua.

571
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:06,440
Sect Leader Xiao.

572
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:08,900
Sect Leader Xiao.

573
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:09,980
Please give the order

574
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,700
for all members of the Sigu Sect to look for Li Lianhua.

575
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,370
What happened to Li Lianhua?

576
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,430
There's only blood left in the Lotus Tower.

577
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,700
Li Lianhua is missing.

578
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:18,760
Mr. Fang,

579
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,870
dozens of people in the martial world

580
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,020
disappear every day.

581
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,700
Why should the entire Sigu Sect be deployed

582
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,220
to look for Li Lianhua?

583
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,060
The Sigu Sect attends to serious matters.

584
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,880
It's not for looking for random people.

585
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:30,440
Finding Li Lianhua is the most serious matter.

586
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,180
Only Li Lianhua

587
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,140
can stop Shan Gudao's diabolical plan.

588
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,040
Otherwise, the consequences will be unimaginable.

589
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:37,850
Quit exaggerating.

590
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,010
There are indeed rumors in the martial world that

591
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,900
Shan Gudao faked his death

592
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,370
and attacked Tianji Hall with the Wansheng Clan.

593
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,620
But this is your personal grudges.

594
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,660
It has nothing to do with the world's safety.

595
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,650
Sect Leader Xiao.

596
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,420
I don't know if you're really dumb

597
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,440
or just pretending to be.

598
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,180
In his ten years of hiding,

599
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,540
Shan Gudao led the Wansheng Clan,

600
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,540
joined forces with Jiao Liqiao,

601
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,070
and recruited many evil and skilled martial artists.

602
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,140
His power has already surpassed the authorities.

603
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,380
Not just that,

604
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,010
he has also acquired the mother Karmic Bug.

605
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,680
With time,

606
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,340
he can control anyone to be his puppet.

607
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,650
Do you still think you can mind your own business?

608
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:17,480
I swear to heaven and earth

609
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,260
that I am telling the truth.

610
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,390
Everyone.

611
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,620
Only by finding Li Lianhua

612
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,540
can we stop Shan Gudao.

613
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:32,500
How will finding Li Lianhua

614
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,060
stop Shan Gudao?

615
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,670
Do they know each other?

616
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:43,700
Because Li Lianhua is his junior

617
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,450
and the leader of the Sigu Sect,

618
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,360
Li Xiangyi.

619
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,240
Are you telling the truth?

620
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,400
Li Lianhua is really the Sect Leader?

621
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:58,420
Nonsense!

622
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,410
Li Xiangyi was such a magnificent figure.

623
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,010
Meanwhile, Li Lianhua is just

624
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:04,280
a village man and a farmer.

625
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,210
Master Shi.

626
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,700
In this world,

627
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,130
apart from Fang Duobing,

628
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:09,730
who else can prove that

629
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,160
Li Lianhua is Li Xiangyi?

630
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,000
I'll prove it for him.

631
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,150
Zhan Yun Fei, Master Zhan.

632
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,560
I have a way to prove it right here.

633
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:51,660
This is...

634
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:52,440
Yangzhouman?

635
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:53,550
Fang Duobing.

636
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,500
Your inner power is Yangzhouman?

637
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,700
Back then, I was seriously injured

638
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:01,490
and my life was at risk.

639
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,150
So, Li Lianhua taught me Yangzhouman.

640
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,140
Is he really alive?

641
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,020
Sect Leader is in danger,

642
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,130
we should find him immediately.

643
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:12,810
Even if it’s Li Xiangyi,

644
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,060
so what?

645
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,190
Sigu Sect is built to uphold justice in the martial world.

646
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,870
It deals with serious matters of the martial world.

647
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:20,400
If we dispatch the entire sect

648
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,260
to look for a single person,

649
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:23,900
we'll surely become a laughing stock

650
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:26,170
if the word gets out.

651
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,179
We will indeed become a laughing stock.

652
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:33,790
They'll laugh at us for being hypocrites.

653
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,100
Mian.

654
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,230
I didn't expect

655
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,469
you would become like this.

656
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:43,580
You talk about benevolence and righteousness,

657
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:45,340
but your heart is filled with jealousy and ill intentions.

658
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,530
You talk about the risk of

659
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,940
tending to small matters instead of big ones.

660
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,040
But the concept of justice in this world

661
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:54,190
is the accumulation of these small matters.

662
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:56,290
What if the person

663
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,880
who disappeared today was a mere merchant?

664
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:02,010
Will we leave him to his demise

665
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,250
just because he's not significant enough for us to care?

666
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,820
The world doesn't need

667
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:07,940
this kind of Sigu Sect.

668
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,270
Besides,

669
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,730
I knew

670
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,730
all this is just your excuse.

671
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,880
Pass the order of the Sigu Sect Leader.

672
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,200
From today onwards, everyone in the Sigu Sect

673
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,810
must look for Li Lianhua.

674
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,000
No matter how far and wide,

675
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:30,960
we must not miss a corner.

676
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,380
The Sigu Sect also invites all righteous allies

677
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:36,090
to come together and discuss our strategy against the Wansheng Clan.

678
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,510
Yes, Sect Leader.

679
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,830
Yes, Sect Leader.

680
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,750
I regret it so much.

681
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,300
I shouldn't have let you

682
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,600
be the leader of the Sigu Sect.

683
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:57,050
I'll be taking the Leader's Token.

684
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,480
Leaving it with you

685
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,030
is a humiliation to the Sigu Sect.

686
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,130
Farewell.

687
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,200
Is he dead?

688
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,560
[Yu Die, Qing Shu]

689
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,300
He has been here for four to five days.

690
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,780
He hasn't woken up at all.

691
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,620
Master gave him the best medicine.

692
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,150
We gave him so many expensive medicines

693
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:37,940
for his inner injuries.

694
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,070
He's still alive,

695
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,570
and the wound hasn't worsened.

696
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,550
But he just wouldn't wake up.

697
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,100
After all, he hurt his ribs and his lungs.

698
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,660
Anyone would take a long time to heal.

699
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,800
Why did Master save him?

700
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,920
I've been with Master for three years.

701
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,510
I've only seen Master kill people.

702
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:55,940
But I've never seen Master save people.

703
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,590
Could he be...

704
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:58,200
Be what?

705
00:36:58,730 --> 00:36:59,970
The Master's beloved.

706
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,060
The Master's beloved lives there.

707
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,550
That is the one Master likes.

708
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,910
That person has been there for so long.

709
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:05,980
He's completely silent.

710
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,310
-Who is he, anyway? 
-Quit asking.

711
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:09,550
Why are you talking so much?

712
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,770
Master might kill you if you're not careful.

713
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,350
Let's go.

714
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:58,690
It's Jiao Liqiao's lair.

715
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,450
If I had ended up like this back then,

716
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,710
I would have taken my own life already.

717
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,820
I wouldn't have given Jiao Liqiao

718
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,140
the chance to humiliate me.

719
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:08,900
Perhaps, if it were back then,

720
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,970
Li Xiangyi would have killed Biqiu

721
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:14,450
the moment he stabbed him.

722
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,620
Fortunately, times have changed.

723
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,280
He's awake. Let's stop.

724
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:30,180
You lost today.

725
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:37,550
You've been sleeping for a long time.

726
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,870
If you slept for another day,

727
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,470
we'd bury you like a corpse.

728
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:51,980
Are you blind?

729
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:57,620
My eyes

730
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,620
are indeed damaged.

731
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,640
So we're guarding a blind man.

732
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,420
He's a good-looking one.

733
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,050
The ones we guarded

734
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,420
had their eyes dug out by Master.

735
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,380
They were so ugly.

736
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:09,510
Blind man.

737
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:10,860
It's fine if you can't see.

738
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,290
Just don't bother us with anything.

739
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:18,010
Don't worry.

740
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,620
I'm a very obedient blind man.

741
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:21,820
So...

742
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,880
Where am I?

743
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,320
I won't tell you.

744
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:26,410
You won't tell me?

745
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:29,290
Then let me guess.

746
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,710
This should be a dungeon.

747
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,680
You're wearing chains on your arms and legs.

748
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,350
Where else could this be?

749
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:41,270
Then your master must be Jiao Liqiao.

750
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,040
You're pretty smart.

751
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:46,870
The two of you have nice voices.

752
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:51,110
If I'm not wrong,

753
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:54,740
you should be Nanyin's descendents.

754
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,970
Just like your master,

755
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:57,990
right?

756
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,400
You're a sweet talker.

757
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,470
We are very busy.

758
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:02,130
Call us if you're dying.

759
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,660
If you're not dead, go back to sleep.

760
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,300
Give me a cup of tea.

761
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:08,820
Tea?

762
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,760
Didn't I tell you not to bother us?

763
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,110
I don't want to bother you either.

764
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,850
But I'm really thirsty.

765
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,370
If I die from thirst,

766
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:29,010
won't it be more trouble for you?

767
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,800
If you're thirsty and want water,

768
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,850
you can kneel down and beg me.

769
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:52,050
I will let you drink some water.

770
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:01,430
You already have the Karmic Bug.

771
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,490
Why are you here

772
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,150
instead of executing your big plan?

773
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,770
I've worked hard for over ten years.

774
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,590
Of course I have to see

775
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:11,900
your pathetic defeated state.

776
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:14,830
The best in the world,

777
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,710
the invincible Li Xiangyi,

778
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:19,870
has finally lost to me.

779
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:26,810
If I knew you wanted to win this badly,

780
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:29,340
I would have slacked off back then

781
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,810
and let you win.

782
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:34,460
Then, you wouldn't have to waste

783
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,540
ten years of your life like this.

784
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,400
Li Xiangyi.

785
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,580
Don’t be so full of yourself.

786
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,100
So what if you're good at martial arts?

787
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:44,960
So what if you're smart and strategic?

788
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,950
At the peak of your life,

789
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,970
you were just the leader of the Sigu Sect.

790
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,680
As for me,

791
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,260
I am more than ten times better than you.

792
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:54,970
Now that

793
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,310
the Karmic Bug is in my hands,

794
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,530
everything is under my control.

795
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,660
My great cause will be achieved in a few days.

796
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:07,450
My Wansheng Clan will be the best in the martial world,

797
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,210
and I shall rule the world.

798
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:15,900
As for you,

799
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:19,830
I will hang you on the city wall

800
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:22,360
to endure the harsh weather

801
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:23,800
and suffer every day.

802
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,090
No one will remember who you are.

803
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:27,860
And when they think of you,

804
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:30,980
they will only remember that wild mutt at the city gate.

805
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:33,530
And even when you want a cup of water,

806
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:38,970
you have to kneel down

807
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:41,570
and beg for it.

808
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,400
Oh... Shan Gudao.

809
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,980
It doesn't matter if I don't drink the water.

810
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,960
But after so many years,

811
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,340
you still get angry so easily.

812
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,640
You won't be happy for long.

813
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,420
Enjoy your suffering.

814
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:13,540
Take care.

815
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,310
You two keep an eye on him.

816
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:16,460
Torture him every day,

817
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,330
but don't kill him.

818
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,900
He must witness my day of glorious success.

819
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,560
How dare you order us around?

820
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:25,590
I don't think you'll be happy for long either.

821
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,780
Flowers will blossom again.

822
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:31,620
But a man can never be young again.

823
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,820
Seek not eternal wealth.

824
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:35,850
You only need to be content.

825
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,240
Mr. Fang.

826
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:47,240
I read these letters during the day.

827
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,830
There's no news of Physician Li.

828
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:51,580
Any news

829
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,280
from the masters?

830
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:07,430
[Li Lianhua]

831
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,590
Li Lianhua!

832
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:14,110
Stop!

833
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:16,540
Who are you?
