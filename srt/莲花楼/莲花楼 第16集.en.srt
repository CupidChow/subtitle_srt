[Episode 16]

4
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,229
To cover up his Tree Man Syndrome,

5
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,229
he hid in the Yuanbao Villa for so many years.

6
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,539
How could he do this to himself?

7
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,009
The sarcoma kept growing,

8
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,180
and he kept scraping it away.

9
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,950
I can't believe that he endured the pain

10
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,370
but still failed.

11
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,990
What's going on?

12
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,470
The Tree Man Syndrome is actually a hereditary disease

13
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,400
in the Jin family in Yuanbao Villa.

14
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,540
My dead wife

15
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,470
is the half-sister of Jin Mantang.

16
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,580
That's why she knows about this.

17
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,350
Since Dong Ling and Jin Changbao

18
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,410
also suffer from such a rare disease,

19
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,740
that means they are also members of the Jin family.

20
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,030
Are you telling the truth?

21
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,070
The former master of Yuanbao Villa

22
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,820
did die of Tree Man Syndrome.

23
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,120
You can ask the elderly servants in the villa,

24
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,050
and you'll know if it's true.

25
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,300
Jin Changbao must have stolen the opal skull.

26
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,490
After using it,

27
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,380
he found out it didn't work on his Tree Man Syndrome.

28
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,780
That's why he went crazy.

29
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,100
How would he know?

30
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,370
Besides using the opal skull,

31
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,380
Jin Mantang also used

32
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,120
human blood,

33
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,910
which was nourished with herbs for a long period of time.

34
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,540
The opal skull was taken by Jin Changbao.

35
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,860
So it was Butler Jin

36
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,060
who set this up

37
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,000
to cure his own illness.

38
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,100
Eventually, the opal skull

39
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,080
couldn't cure his Tree Man Syndrome,

40
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,280
so he got so desperate

41
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,910
that he committed suicide.

42
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,300
I don't think so.

43
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,420
Commander,

44
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,970
we didn't succeed in finding the opal skull.

45
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,700
It makes sense that you didn't.

46
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,700
Li, what do you mean?

47
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,250
Yang,

48
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,250
you may ask someone to go to Jin Mantang's room

49
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,200
and check

50
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,750
if any daily necessities are missing.

51
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:33,980
Yes.

52
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,540
Commander.

53
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,240
Deputy Commander.

54
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,470
There are plenty of things left.

55
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,600
But according to my memory,

56
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,860
there's a flower pot with such a size missing.

57
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,740
Flower pot?

58
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,140
I see.

59
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,400
But I searched

60
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,770
the flower pot before.

61
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,270
There was nothing hidden inside.

62
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,270
If there had been nothing in the pot,

63
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,040
that would have meant that the opal skull

64
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,880
was the flower pot itself.

65
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,490
What?

66
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,710
This pot is much larger than the box.

67
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,170
How could it fit in?

68
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,589
Who told you that the box

69
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,220
was used to hold the opal skull?

70
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,550
And who among us

71
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,610
has seen the opal skull before?

72
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,290
Since no one has seen it,

73
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,130
how do you know

74
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,070
what the box that holds it looks like?

75
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,700
Since Jin Mantang used a sham

76
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,700
to lure Dong Ling into the secret room,

77
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,640
that meant

78
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,860
he had hidden

79
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,380
the genuine opal skull well.

80
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,220
When we first entered the secret room,

81
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,020
Butler Jin deliberately gave us

82
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,159
the wrong guidance.

83
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,070
He opened the empty box

84
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,250
and told us the opal skull was missing.

85
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,050
Opal skull?

86
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,070
The opal skull is missing!

87
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,510
After that, everyone went around the villa,

88
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,860
looking for a skull that would fit in this box.

89
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,370
But the genuine opal skull

90
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,340
is this flower pot itself.

91
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,140
I'm afraid we can't find the flower pot

92
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,700
in such a short time.

93
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,210
What do you mean?

94
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,520
Let's talk about Jin Changbao first.

95
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,720
Jin Changbao indeed set Jin Mantang up.

96
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,550
But he didn't have the guts to kill him.

97
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,220
Otherwise,

98
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,640
he wouldn't have been in Yuanbao Villa for so many years

99
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,790
but only waited until now to take action.

100
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,520
It's because

101
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,360
he didn't commit suicide.

102
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,020
If he had hanged himself,

103
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,830
the traces of the rope would only have reached behind his right and left ears

104
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,890
in a dark purple colour.

105
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,450
And there would have been a white mark

106
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,710
among the rope traces.

107
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,820
His fists should've been held into fists before he died.

108
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,950
Why were his hands stretched out then?

109
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,520
On this crossbeam,

110
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,560
there are only traces of one rope.

111
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,380
If a person's committing suicide,

112
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,380
they will struggle because of pain.

113
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,950
And there will be many scratches on the beam,

114
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,250
apart from a clear hanging mark.

115
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,290
So Jin Changbao's dead body was moved

116
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,740
to make it look like he hanged himself.

117
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,520
Mr. Gongyang, I wonder if you know

118
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,820
the toxicity of withered agave.

119
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:45,960
Well...

120
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,640
A minor injury caused by the poisoned arrow

121
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,659
would've been insufficient to cause a person with profound inner power

122
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:53,010
to pass out and completely lose consciousness.

123
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,070
Mr. Gongyang, as a famous physician,

124
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,110
are you hiding it on purpose,

125
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,090
or do you have other intentions?

126
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,410
What do you mean?

127
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,430
Are you trying to slander me?

128
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,600
Do you still want to deny it?

129
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,270
In town,

130
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,500
the largest pharmacy is Jishi Hall.

131
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,930
Jin Changbao would fill the prescription of medicine for Jin Mantang.

132
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,330
But in the past two years,

133
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,740
he had been buying two portions every time.

134
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,140
It means he became ill in the last two years.

135
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,310
He was worried that Jin Mantang would find out his identity.

136
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:26,920
So,

137
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,340
he resolved to scrape away his skin

138
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,120
to hide the truth.

139
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:37,720
But he was still tortured by illness,

140
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,220
and he wanted to solve this problem completely.

141
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,280
Don't get me wrong.

142
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:41,980
I...

143
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,040
At this moment,

144
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,240
Dong Ling came to ask Jin Mantang for the opal skull.

145
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,840
He discovered that Jin Mantang

146
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,530
had locked Dong Ling in the secret room

147
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,330
and tried to starve him to death.

148
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,320
Hurry up.

149
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,870
Don't play tricks on me.

150
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,970
I said I'll give it to you.

151
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,760
What else do you want?

152
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,110
Where's the opal skull?

153
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,580
I put it there.

154
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,770
Right there.

155
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,070
Trying to escape?

156
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,990
Jin Mantang, let me out!

157
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,100
Jin Mantang!

158
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,270
At this time,

159
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,340
someone taught him a trick to kill someone by making use of another person.

160
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,320
As planned, Jin Changbao had indeed

161
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,940
gotten rid of Jin Mantang and Dong Ling successfully

162
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,990
and took the opal skull

163
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,850
that Jin Mantang hid in his own room

164
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,970
without anyone knowing.

165
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:34,650
If I'm right,

166
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,669
you are the person, aren't you?

167
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,419
Gongyang Wumen.

168
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,320
Li Lianhua.

169
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,490
Mr. Gongyang is highly moral and respectable.

170
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,900
Don't slander him.

171
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,390
I'm so sure

172
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,030
because of three pieces of evidence.

173
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,360
This

174
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,030
is the latest prescription of Jin Mantang.

175
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,460
I got it from the pharmacy he went to.

176
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,400
This prescription is not different from

177
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,900
the previous prescriptions of Jin Mantang.

178
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,790
It's just that Ezhu was added.

179
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,510
Ezhu can promote blood circulation,

180
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,920
so it will accelerate the relapse of Tree Man Syndrome.

181
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,710
In this way,

182
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,080
Jin Mantang was forced

183
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,760
to use the opal skull more frequently

184
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,690
so that Jin Changbao could have more opportunities.

185
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,440
The time this prescription was modified

186
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,800
was exactly 17 days ago

187
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,230
when Dong Ling went to see Jin Mantang

188
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,180
and was locked in the room by him.

189
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,510
Also, it was the day when Mr. Gongyang

190
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,060
came to the town.

191
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,860
Nonsense.

192
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,070
How would you know

193
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,650
when I came to this town?

194
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,820
It's a piece of cake.

195
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,440
For me,

196
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,540
all I had to do was to check the entry records of out-of-towners

197
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,700
in my father's name

198
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,870
at the government office.

199
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,320
We'd know right after investigating it.

200
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,580
How are you going to defend yourself now?

201
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,940
There is also this unexpected discovery.

202
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,160
The blackmail letters written to Jin Mantang

203
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,310
have the same handwriting

204
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,570
as this prescription.

205
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,060
Mr. Gongyang,

206
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,820
did you not expect

207
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,530
someone would investigate this prescription,

208
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,660
so you forgot about your handwriting?

209
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,420
I see.

210
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,170
You colluded with Jin Changbao

211
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,330
and deliberately pretended that

212
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,240
someone was trying to kill Jin Mantang

213
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,500
and stole his treasure

214
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,120
so he would recruit famous physicians

215
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,290
to save his life,

216
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,380
and that would allow you

217
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
to officially enter Yuanbao Villa.

218
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,780
So what?

219
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,120
As a physician,

220
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,320
I was curious about the martial arts world's

221
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,430
legendary opal skull that can cure all illnesses.

222
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,060
So I played a small trick

223
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,250
to enter this villa.

224
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:49,040
How can you say that I killed Jin Changbao?

225
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,320
He didn't say

226
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,750
that you killed someone.

227
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,350
He...

228
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,690
I didn't expect you to be so stubborn.

229
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,920
Mr. Gongyang,

230
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:00,460
looks like I can only bring out the second piece of evidence.

231
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:01,740
Sir.

232
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:02,910
I'm sorry.

233
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,670
Jin Changbao promised to work with you,

234
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,370
but he didn't completely trust you.

235
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,440
I guess

236
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,240
he asked you to treat him

237
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,040
after he got the opal skull.

238
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,460
That's why

239
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,120
he made a deal using the opal skull.

240
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,310
Mr. Gongyang was also struggling because of that.

241
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,010
That day,

242
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,670
you followed Miss Zhiyu.

243
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,690
But unexpectedly,

244
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,420
you did find out

245
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,440
the secret of her collecting blood.

246
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:35,770
So, Gongyang Wumen

247
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,540
gave Zhiyu's blood to Jin Changbao in exchange,

248
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,030
then took the opportunity to steal the opal skull

249
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,420
before killing him to dispose of a witness.

250
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,420
Unfortunately,

251
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,550
you didn't take Miss Zhiyu's blood.

252
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,510
So you used your blood to deceive Jin Changbao.

253
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,580
Poor Jin Changbao.

254
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,220
He thought he would get better

255
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,460
after he got the opal skull

256
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,730
and Miss Zhiyu's blood.

257
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,130
But it didn't work at all.

258
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,180
That's why he went crazy.

259
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,870
Then you seized the chance

260
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,030
to kill him.

261
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,360
That is all bullshit!

262
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,610
It's just a scar.

263
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,380
But you made up so many stories.

264
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,280
Fine.

265
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,070
I did prepare the third piece of evidence.

266
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:11,530
Hold on.

267
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,290
You said Gongyang Wumen has killed Jin Changbao.

268
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,950
We searched all over his body,

269
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,530
but no fatal injury was found.

270
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,940
He was not poisoned too.

271
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,880
If he didn't hang himself,

272
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,560
how did he die?

273
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,950
It's said that Gongyang Wumen

274
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,280
has 68 magical needles.

275
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,260
His acupuncture can always achieve a miraculous cure.

276
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,390
There are 57 needles

277
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,740
in this needle bag.

278
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,820
Ten needles are on Jin Changbao's head.

279
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,010
There's one more left.

280
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,760
Right here.

281
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,200
You're the murderer,

282
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,470
Gongyang Wumen.

Deputy Commander.

286
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,270
I found this in Gongyang Wumen's bag.

287
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,980
In Gongyang Wumen's room,

288
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,220
I found the same flower pot as in Jin Mantang's room.

289
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,950
It was indeed the opal skull after being cleaned.

290
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,870
Is this the opal skull?

291
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,370
You may leave.

292
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:58,850
Yes.

293
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,390
Since the murderer has been caught

294
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,250
and the opal skull has been found,

295
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,980
I'll take the witness and evidence

296

This issue is related to the martial arts world.

303
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,460
Baichuan Court should take care of it.

It's not Supervision Bureau's turn to meddle in our business.

305

I insist on handling this matter.

So what if it's Baichuan Court?

307

As the deputy commander of the Supervision Bureau,

I order you to withdraw from Yuanbao Villa immediately.

00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,310
Here.

342
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,500
Can you see it?

343
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,760
Don't get involved

344
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,910
in Baichuan Court's business.

345
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,340
I can't defeat you today.

346
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:56,910
But don't be arrogant.

347
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,460
Wansheng Clan is rapidly emerging in the martial arts world,

348
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,980
and they have a good relationship with the government.

349
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,180
Sooner or later, they will replace Baichuan Court.

350
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,710
You won't be happy for long.

351
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,490
Wansheng Clan.

352
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:18,710
Miss Shi.

353
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,760
Sorry for the trouble.

354
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,560
I'm now giving the treasure box and Gongyang Wumen

355
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,890
back to Baichuan Court.

356
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,260
Master Shi.

357
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,240
Lord Yang.

358
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:33,100
My son is suffering from Tree Man Syndrome.

359
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,360
Only the opal skull can cure his illness.

360
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,260
Please,

361
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,340
for the sake of my years of treatment,

362
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,660
lend me the opal skull

363
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,020
to save my son.

364
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:42,970
Mr. Jian,

365
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,040
I heard that the opal skull has to be complemented with

366
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,530
drinking human blood long-term to treat Tree Man Syndrome.

367
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,780
It's not a good prescription.

368
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,640
Are you really going to do this?

369
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,320
Please get up.

370
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,750
I remember in the palace,

371
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,570
an old imperial physician mentioned

372
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:58,920
he had been studying Tree Man Syndrome for half his life

373
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,130
and had some experience.

374
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,380
Although he can't cure the disease,

375
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,310
he can slow its progression

376
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,810
so your son's life won't be in danger.

377
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,270
I can introduce him to you.

378
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:06,270
I can't repay

379
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,339
your great kindness.

380
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:08,650
Please accept my bow.

381
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,420
No need. You don't have to do so.

382
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,470
[Yuanbao Villa]

383
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,020
The Gang Qi has indeed been removed.

384
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,250
I feel refreshed now.

385
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,810
You've cleared the Gang Qi.

386
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,060
But you don't have to thank me.

387
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:04,920
Let me tell you.

388
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,610
I felt a Genuine Qi helping me just now.

389
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,140
The feeling was so strange.

390
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:12,190
It must be because of the opal skull.

391
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,390
What a good thing.

392
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,590
The supreme Yin of this opal skull

393
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,190
is really powerful.

394
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,150
You're kind of a treasure,

395
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,370
but so many people died because of you.

396
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,290
I don't know if you're saving them or harming them.

397
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,620
We'd better put it away.

398
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,770
What is this?

399
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,050
This is not an ordinary thing.

400
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,090
I can't believe Jin Mantang put it

401
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,820
together with the opal skull.

402
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,750
It looks like Nanyin Script.

403
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,150
It seems to be similar to scripts

404
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,390
that appeared in Yipin Tomb before.

405
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,070
I don't remember that.

406
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,710
Before Nanyin perished,

407
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,230
they were indeed close to the Central Plains.

408
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,770
They also strengthened the bond with marriage.

409
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:10,830
Jin Mantang loved to

410
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,230
collect rare treasures.

411
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,270
Maybe he really collected

412
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,400
the treasures which came from Nanyin.

413
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,240
Forget it.

414
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,890
I don't care what treasure it is.

415
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,560
It's not that I can make a living on it.

416
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,290
Give it back.

417
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,240
I'll put it back.

418
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,090
Be careful.

419
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:32,410
Here.

420
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,670
The moon is beautiful tonight.

421
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,690
What are you going to do next?

422
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,990
The two sentences you said don't seem to have any relation.

423
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,790
Cut the crap!

424
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,120
I studied at the Imperial Academy.

425
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,420
I am good at literacy.

426
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,620
I just want to ask you.

427
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,660
Now that I've gotten rid of the Gang Qi,

428
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,190
and got my detective badge,

429
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,010
how about

430
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,270
you travel the world with me?

431
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,690
That doesn't sound good.

432
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,370
Why?

433
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,950
My martial arts and your brain

434
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,460
will surely make us significant figures in the world.

435
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,180
Then?

436
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:05,990
Then,

437
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,860
we'll become heroes whom everyone admires

438
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,600
and bring justice to this world.

439
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
Isn't that great?

440
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,500
And then what?

441
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,020
After that,

442
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,710
we will retire after the great achievements

443
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,840
and become a legend.

444
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:22,480
This is the most glorious ending of a hero.

445
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,760
What else?

446
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,120
And

447
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,410
we can have some sunbathing

448
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,340
and fishing.

449
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,100
It must be very carefree.

450
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,800
Am I not

451
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,150
living like this now?

452
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,700
Why should I wait until the future?

453
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,780
It's different.

454
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,960
You should at least go to the peak of the martial arts world,

455
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,000
to the top of it, to have a look.

456
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,370
I've been there before.

457
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:55,910
It's boring.

458
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,900
You're just talking nonsense.

459
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,580
The highest place you've ever been

460
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,730
is the two-storey building of Lingshan Sect.

461
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,210
Tell me.

462
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,800
Where do you want to go?

463
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,930
I can accompany you.

464
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,880
Where do I want to go?

465
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:10,950
Where?

466
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,760
I want to go to the toilet.

467
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,640
You don't have to follow me.

468
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,320
Take it.

469
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,230
Hurry up.

470
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,200
Be careful.

471
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,740
You're so bad at martial arts.

472
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,400
I'll teach you some other day.

473
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,880
Where did my two taels of silver go?

474
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,590
Zongzheng Mingzhu.

475
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,700
Leave the thing behind.

476
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,280
Let's see what you're capable of.

477
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,630
It's quite cold up here.

478
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,510
Why isn't he back yet?

479
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,570
Did he run away again?

480
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,580
Who are you?

481
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,400
Who is the young hero dressed in white?

482
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:38,590
Oh no.

483
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,450
Where is Li Lianhua?

484
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,390
Wake up.

485
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,220
Why am I here?

486
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,470
I came to the wrong room.

487
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,180
What do you mean by you came to the wrong room?

488
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:10,980
Are you drunk?

489
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,880
You can't drink much, huh?

490
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,430
Why did you take this back?

491
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:18,470
Let me tell you.

492
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,440
Zongzheng Mingzhu appeared just now

493
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,420
and wanted to steal it.

494
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,210
Luckily, a young hero dressed in white

495
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:23,920
saved it.

496
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,430
W-What in white?

497
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,350
That young hero dressed in white just now

498
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,680
is definitely a master.

499
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,730
He could even use a branch as a sword

500
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,230
and defeated Zongzheng Mingzhu with one move only.

501
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,430
You don't know

502
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,550
the speed of his attack with the sword

503
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,280
was too fast to be seen clearly.

504
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:38,640
The sword he was holding

505
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,070
was so agile, like a snake.

506
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,950
But when the sword aura appeared,

507
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,480
it was extremely powerful.

508
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,840
Except for my master, Li Xiangyi,

509
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,040
I've never seen such an amazing person.

510
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,990

No wonder.

So it turns out that Zongzheng Mingzhu

518
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,760
didn't want the opal skull

What is the ice plank for?

00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,670
Is it worth his effort?

My grandpa told me

542
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,960
this is a bad habit of ancient Nanyin.

543
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,700
They'd choose the most intelligent white ape

and nurture it until it reaches adulthood.

545
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,890
Then they'd peel the skin of the white ape alive to make drums

546
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,690
and used its bone as a bone stick.

547
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:12,770
They said

a drum made like this

this incense can numb the pain after being lit

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,990
I can't let this brat

681
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,650
risk his life with me anymore.

682
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,610
What's more,

683
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,580
I used my sword skills yesterday.

684
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,640
If this continues,

685
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,320
he'll find out who I am sooner or later.

686
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,440
Li Lianhua.

687
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,650
Have you thought about

688
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:54,890
what I told you last night?

689
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:55,890
I can go anywhere.

690
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,340
I'm talking to you.

691
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,180
What are you thinking about?

692
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:05,090
I'm calculating how long a smoke signal

693
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,620
will take in general

694
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:09,070
to reach Tianji Mountain Manor.

695
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,190
What smoke signal?

696
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,140
The smoke signal from your aunt.

697
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,490
Li Lianhua.

698
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,020
It's fine to make the same joke thrice.

699
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,220
But do you really think I won't be angry?

700
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,870
I'm used to being alone.

701
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,040
I don't like to get too close to people.

702
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,490
Lotus Tower is not spacious too.

703
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:31,820
It can only fit me.

704
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,040
It's troublesome having one more person stay here.

705
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,700
And I told you earlier ago that

706
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:37,820
I'm not interested

707
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,220
in investigating cases.

708
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,150
If it weren't for Shan Gudao,

709
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,090
and I didn't owe him a favour,

710
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:45,200
I wouldn't have helped you.

711
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,410
Now that your Gang Qi has been removed,

712
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:49,140
we should go our separate ways.

713
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:51,390
You're not interested in investigating cases?

714
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,350
Then why did you ask Su Xiaoyong

715
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,410
to investigate the ice plank for you?

716
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,480
Hold on.

717
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,070
Do you think it's dangerous

718
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,860
so you don't want me to get involved?

719
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,790
Young Hero Fang,

720
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:07,110
people rely on themselves in the martial arts world,

721
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:09,310
instead of hiding behind me every time.

722
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:10,270
As you said,

723
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,560
I helped you to solve

724
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,690
all the problems along the way.

725
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,320
If you don't want to be a useless rich man,

726
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,100
you have to learn to walk independently.

727
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:20,090
Fine.

728
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:24,170
I can't believe that your impression of me is like that.

729
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,170
People who walk different paths cannot make plans together.

730
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,170
We are different.

731
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,449
Well said. People who walk different paths cannot make plans together.

732
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:44,580
I, Fang Duobing, make friends at will.

733
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,690
I never thought of being your burden.

734
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:47,420
In that case,

735
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,590
as a useless rich young master,

736
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,510
I won't pester you anymore.

737
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:54,210
Bye.

738
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:00,310
I'll call myself a fool if I talk to you again.

739
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,240
Who is the rich young master he reprimanded?

740
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,820
Who can't walk independently?

741
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,750
I'm walking now.

742
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:32,830
Who cares?

743
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:35,980
Fang Xiaobao.

744
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,340
Aunt.

745
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:40,660
Hello.

746
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:42,610
Aunt.

747
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,320
Where are you going?

748
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,890
Why did you tie me here?

749
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:47,320
Aunt.

750
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,530
Li Lianhua.

751
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,740
When we meet again,

752
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:55,420
I'll call myself a fool if I talk to you.

753
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,050
Mr. Li.

754
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,510
Thank you for helping me

755
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,370
catch this naughty young master.

756
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,490
May I invite you

757
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,370
to Tianji Mountain Manor together with us

758
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:08,290
so that I can treat you to a feast

759
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,780
to express my gratitude?

760
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,180
You're welcome, Miss He.

761
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,880
We're close enough.

762
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,810
Don't be so courteous.

763
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,070
Just call me Xiaofeng.

764
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,090
Miss Xiaofeng.

765
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,910
Actually, I have a question.

766
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,410
I wonder if I can ask it.

767
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,990
I'll tell you everything I know.

768
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:27,180
Is the Deputy Leader of the Sigu Sect, Shan Gudao,

769
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,540
Fang Duobing's biological father?

770
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,520
How do you know?

771
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,140
Why are you saying this?

772
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,110
Are you joking with me?

773
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,860
What you said is really interesting.

774
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:43,820
Miss He,

775
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,710
I got something that came into my mind.

776
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,310
I won't bother you then.

777
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:50,470
By the way,

778
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,510
you're of no fixed abode.

779
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,420
Thus, Miss Qiao Wanmian had to ask Tianji Hall

780
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,080
to hand her wedding invitation card over to you.

781
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,080
It's just in time.

782
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,840
I'll get going then.

783
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,730
Aunt, what's wrong with you?

784
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,860
How could you tie Gongyang Wumen and me

785
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:06,630
together?

786
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,550
I was afraid you'd run away.

787
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,110
Why would I bother to run away?

788
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,310
I'll go back with you.

789
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,260
Stand still. Don't move.

790
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:12,550
Master Shi,

791
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,670
I'm relieved to have you escort him.

792
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,620
Sister Shi.

793
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,440
What a coincidence.

794
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:19,870
Don't mind it.

795
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,900
Our elders

796
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,930
care about their juniors like this.

797
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:27,500
That's right.

798
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,900
If you don't prune a tree, it won't be upright.

799
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,080
If you don't teach a child well, they won't be obedient.

800
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,010
Tie him tightly.

801
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,480
Let's see where he can go.

802
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,800
In the end, you ended up just like me.

803
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,610
I was tied up

804
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,040
but waiting to go back and enjoy my life.

805
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,600
You are different.

806
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,970
You have to be imprisoned

807
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:46,210
in Prison 188 of Baichuan Court.

808
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:48,630
The most evil villains all these years are locked inside.

809
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,700
Enjoy it.

810
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:52,990
Young Master Fang,

811
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:58,630
your birth mother, He Xiaolan, almost had a miscarriage when she was pregnant with you.

812
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,110
I saved her.

813
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:02,070
You must repay the kindness

814
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,620
for saving your life.

815
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:04,970
What a joke.

816
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,430
What nonsense are you talking about?

817
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:09,090
He Xiaolan is my second aunt.

818
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:09,920
Do you know?

819
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,400
I have seen Chief He and Lord Fang before.

820
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,080
They were infertile.

821
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:18,520
You're about the same age

822
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,340
as Second Young Miss He's child.

823
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:24,020
If you want to know your real identity,

824
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:25,920
save me first.

825
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,730
Don't try to get away by talking nonsense.

826
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:29,930
Fine.

827
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,960
Since you are not willing to protect me,

828
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,950
you should watch your back.

829
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:36,630
What are you talking about?

830
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,430
Take him away.

831
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:47,610
Master Shi.

832
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,440
It's late.

833
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:51,380
I'll take my naughty young master back first.

834
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,160
See you.

835
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,120
Master Shi,

836
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,110
Gongyang Wumen was kidnapped.

837
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:05,450
Who was it?

838
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:06,770
It was an ambush

839
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,720
with a tank.

840
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,310
A tank?

841
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:14,020
It's the Jinyuan Alliance.

842
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:25,930
Thank you, Saintess, for saving me.

843
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:33,370
He's a loser.

844
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,180
Why do you bother saving him?

845
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,500
He's not good at martial arts.

846
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,500
But he's good at treating diseases.

847
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,890
Of course he is useful.

848
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:40,930
Today, the tank

849
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,380
was really invincible

850
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,180
and powerful.

851
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,340
Of course.

852
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,150
Unfortunately, the cost is too expensive.

853
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,160
Only one or two are available.

854
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:51,470
Don't worry, Qiao.

855
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,620
I'm emptying the Yu City Treasury.

856
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,610
After I'm done preparing all the materials,

857
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:56,770
it's not a problem

858
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,340
to make as many as you like.

859
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,340
We'll be able to kill everyone then.

860
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,640
By then, Baichuan Court and all those sects

861
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,040
can't do anything to the Jinyuan Alliance.

862
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,070
You did a good job.

863
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,450
Where's Rama Heavenly Ice?

864
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:24,310
By the way,

865
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:27,330
is Li Xiangyi dead or not?

866
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,640
What do you mean?

867
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,310
I met someone in the Yuanbao Villa.

868
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:35,240
He used one of the moves in Xiangyi Swordplay,

869
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:36,720
the one you've told me about before.

870
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,980
The East Wind Blew Through My Small Lodge Again Last Night.

871
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,700
What kind of person was he?

872
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,190
He was wearing a mask.

873
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:45,010
But I'm sure it was that move.

874
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,750
And he mastered it well.

875
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,780
He used only a branch as his sword

876
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,240
to crush me.

877
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,520
But his inner power seemed to be weak.

878
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:55,500
That's why I managed to escape.

879
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:56,770
In this world,

880
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,180
who else

881
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,120
can master the Xiangyi Swordplay like this?

882
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,440
Impossible.

883
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,480
He already drowned.

884
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,580
Bicha Poison

885
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:07,600
is the most poisonous in the world.

886
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,330
How could he escape from death?

887
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:10,910
In this world,

888
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:13,110
there is nothing that is definite.

889
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,500
Di Feisheng is still alive.

890
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,560
Why can't Li Xiangyi be that lucky?

891
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,840
If that's the case,

892
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:22,520
I will let him die again.

893
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,720
Do you hate him so much?

894
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:30,140
No man in this world doesn't look at me.

895
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:33,110
Except for the one I've been following,

896
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,200
Li Xiangyi.

897
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,860
Back then, that bitch from Fengling Sword Sect

898
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,040
always provoked me in front of me.

899
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:43,390
So I massacred Fengling Sword Sect,

900
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:44,870
broke her tendons and bones,

901
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:47,070
and let her watch her master and seniors

902
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,720
burning into ashes in front of me.

903
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,340
That's what she deserved.

904
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,950
Who would have thought that Li Xiangyi would try to stop me and kill me?

905
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,560
I begged him so much,

906
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,270
but he was still reluctant to let me go.

907
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:03,470
He looked at me just like looking at a dead person.

908
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,160
If Lord hadn't come to save me,

909
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,040
I would have been killed

910
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,440
by Xiangyi Swordplay.

911
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,400
Although Lord saved me,

912
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,230
he hates me and avoids me after that.

913
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:25,900
This is all because of Li Xiangyi.

914
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:28,640
How can I not hate him?

915
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,700
[Keep Silent]

916
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,560
Xiangyi Swordplay?

917
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,270
My Lord, do you think it's Li Xiangyi?

918
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:41,590
So what?

919
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,520
Li Xiangyi used to be your only opponent.

920
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,720
Now you know he might be alive.

921
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,240
Aren't you curious?

922
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:50,780
This is my own business.

923
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,840
You don't have to speculate about it.

924
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:54,280
That's not what I meant.

925
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,220
How about I kill him for you

926
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:57,780
and cook you a dish

927
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:00,770
so that he won't hurt you?

928
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:06,870
I only obey your orders

929
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,740
and do what you say.

930
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:12,470
My Lord, please don't be angry.

931
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:17,730
I'll assist you to take a shower and get changed.

932
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:21,990
No need.

933
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,820
Do what you should.

934
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,110
I want to assist you.

935
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:30,750
-That's what...
-I don't need a woman to serve me.

936
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:32,740
If you don't understand what I said,

937
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:35,070
let others take care of what you're doing.

938
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:41,210
Yes.
