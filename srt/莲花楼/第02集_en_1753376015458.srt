2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Kissing myself thousands of times

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The most reluctant moment is that moment

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Right on the earth, thousands of miles of wind and waves

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who doesn't wander?

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds and the moon on the edge of the world?

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Right on the earth, the youth is flustered

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The cup is not drunk like a cup of wine

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The journey to the end of the world is like a dream

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Right on the earth, thousands of miles of wind and waves

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Who doesn't wander?

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds and the moon on the edge of the world?

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Right on the earth, the youth is flustered

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The cup is not drunk like a cup of wine

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The journey to the end of the world is like a dream

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The journey to the end of the world is like a dream

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The End

The Long Ballad

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Episode 11

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Wait, little brother.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Since you are so smart,

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
you must know what is most beneficial to you.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Now, the leader of this Lingshan Sect has been killed.

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I can help you to solve the case.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I can help you pass the test of Baichuan Academy.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So that your parents won't have any problems.

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
How do you know?

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
How do I know?

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You were not officially admitted to Baichuan Academy, right?

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
If Baichuan Academy admitted you,

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
then you should have your own card, right?

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
How can you take others' cards?

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Next time,

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
pay attention to this.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
When I saw you last time,

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
your shoes were clean and tidy.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But now, you are covered in dust.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The leader of this Lingshan Sect is not even willing to save tea.

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Now, you haven't changed your shoes for days.

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I think you are embarrassed.

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Now, you have taken your jade pendant as a weapon.

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
But your parents don't support you to be the leader.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So you sneaked out.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What about Baichuan Academy?

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You have always been far away from the court.

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The Buddha and the White Stone won't easily accept you.

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So you came up with a way.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You made a bet with the Buddha and the White Stone.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You broke several cases and entered this Baichuan Academy.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The leader of this Lingshan Sect is the first case of you.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That's why you came here, right?

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
How do you know that the leader of this Lingshan Sect is the leader of Baichuan Academy?

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
How do you know that the leader of this Lingshan Sect was killed?

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You are also involved in this?

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Have you forgotten?

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
When the leader of this Lingshan Sect died,

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I was in the hands of those people in the Phoenix Hall.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But the leader of this Lingshan Sect

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
once bought me some medicine.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's the medicine that doesn't work on the body.

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You keep dragging my money and you don't give it to me.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Think about it.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
How can a person who dragged my money

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and couldn't bear to give up all the money to be a deity?

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I see that you are very stubborn now.

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
How about this?

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'll help you solve the case.

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You let me go.

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
How about it?

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Thank you for reminding me.

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That's right.

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Baichuan Academy really hasn't been accepted by me.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:05:08,480
Why don't you take your fake doctor as a

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Let's go.

75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Hurry up.

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Let's go.

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You are not even aware of the death of your wife.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You still believe that living people can turn into gold and return to their souls.

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
If you keep nagging,

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
be careful that I will light up your opium.

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Young Master,

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
you finally caught this fake doctor.

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Little girl,

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I never said that I was a deity doctor.

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Why are you talking about a fake doctor?

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Don't be so polite.

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Where is the talisman?

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I just checked the passports and other things.

89
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
There are five people left in the rest of the talisman box.

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Let's go and take a look.

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Everyone,

92
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
all the friends,

93
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
the deity doctor and the first-time deity of this month

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
left the real words

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and was inherited by the spirit copper to the Ling Shan Sect.

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Therefore,

97
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
today,

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
we are holding this

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Ling Shan Stone Bronze Conference.

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
In order to be fair,

101
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
we invited the Yin Shan Sect's Elder Ma,

102
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
He Gui Sect's Sect Leader Yang to witness.

103
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The selected spirit copper

104
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
will inherit the Ling Shan Sect's entire sect

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and be transferred to the Ling Shan Sect.

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The whole property of the Ling Shan Sect will be inherited,

107
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
including the division of the three families,

108
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
the four hundred acres of land,

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
and the twelve shops.

110
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
If Wang Su can get so much money,

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
he can change his name to Wang Ercai.

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
As for Master,

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
he didn't leave any name-sharing method.

114
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Therefore,

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
please come forward.

116
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
In front of Master and his old man Jin Shen,

117
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
please bow and bow and ask for the name.

118
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
If the selected spirit copper has benefits,

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
what about the other spirits?

120
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Dangerous.

121
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Stop!

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Hurry up!

123
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
This way!

124
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Hurry up!

125
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
This way!

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We are not spirit copper.

127
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
We are just pretending.

128
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
No!

129
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Brother Qing Shan's method is a bit strange.

130
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
But this little brother

131
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
looks like the only one who didn't get it.

132
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Could it be that he is the selected spirit copper

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
of Taoist Wang Xian Ling?

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This is not any kind of Xian Ling.

135
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
This is a man-made fire-fighting case.

136
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Stop talking nonsense!

137
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This is the food I found in the jade well.

138
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
There is a shadow line inside.

139
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It is connected to the cotton under the pot.

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
This is what will catch fire.

141
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
This is a mechanism that someone deliberately

142
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
set up beforehand.

143
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Did anyone of you know about this?

144
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What on earth is going on?

145
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
These are all

146
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
some of the old valuable items.

147
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Usually, they are left in the warehouse.

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
No one is watching.

149
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Have you seen any suspicious people?

150
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
No.

151
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
This is a spirit copper sample.

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The spirit copper only has a little of it.

153
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Why don't you check first

154
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
who touched these children?

155
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Since you say this is a man-made fire-fighting case,

156
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
then it is only your little brother

157
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
who is safe and sound.

158
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
From what I see now,

159
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
your suspicion is the biggest.

160
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Do you know who our young master is?

161
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Lin Ai,

162
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
you are the one who is suspicious.

163
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I am the one who is suspicious.

164
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I am the one who is suspicious.

165
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I am the one who is suspicious.

166
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I am the one who is suspicious.

167
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I am the one who is suspicious.

168
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I am the one who is suspicious.

169
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You know who our young master is?

170
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Lin Ai.

171
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I am Fang Nuobin, the son of Docho.

172
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I am the detective of the Baichuan Courtyard.

173
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
We have just arrived here

174
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
and have never been to the Gui Sect.

175
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
How can we have time and opportunity to start?

176
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Since we can't prove ourselves for a while,

177
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
why don't you give us a chance?

178
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We will definitely find out the truth.

179
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
This is Fang Shaoxia,

180
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
the detective of the Baichuan Courtyard.

181
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
We can trust her.

182
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But it's hard to say

183
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
if she has colluded with others.

184
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
She will stay here

185
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
and wait for the stone bronze meeting to end

186
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
to find out the truth

187
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
and then return it to you.

188
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Wait.

189
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
We haven't found out the truth yet.

190
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Do you still want to continue?

191
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
If someone in the dark

192
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
continues to hurt the children,

193
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
who will be responsible?

194
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Young Master, you don't know that

195
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
the stone bronze meeting of Lingshan

196
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
was set up by the sect leader before he died.

197
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
We, the Lingshan Sect,

198
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
can't be alone.

199
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
No.

200
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
No.

201
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Don't worry.

202
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I have an idea.

203
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I don't know if I should tell you.

204
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I heard you talking about it.

205
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's just because the sect leader Wang

206
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
didn't leave any way to check Lin Tong

207
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
that caused the mess.

208
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
How about

209
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
letting me talk to the sect leader of Qingshan

210
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
and make his thoughts clear?

211
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

212
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
My master has passed away.

213
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
How can you talk to the dead?

214
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Third Brother,

215
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
who are you?

216
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm Li Lianhua.

217
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm not talented,

218
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
but I have a little medical knowledge.

219
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So you're the one

220
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
who will kill the hero

221
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
and bring him back to life.

222
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Li Lianhua.

223
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
That's me.

224
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I've heard a lot about you.

225
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I didn't expect to meet

226
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
your sect leader here.

227
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What are you doing?

228
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Look.

229
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's not easy.

230
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Let me find out the murderer

231
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
and set a course for him.

232
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
No.

233
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You're still

234
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
an inspector at Baichuan Hospital.

235
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
How come you have no conscience at all?

236
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Look.

237
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Look at these simple young men.

238
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What did they look like when they were burned?

239
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Can you bear to see

240
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
the way they are suffering?

241
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Besides,

242
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
you can't catch the murderer

243
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
if you catch the fake body.

244
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You'll be fired.

245
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm serious.

246
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm much better than catching a fake god.

247
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Now the Qing Shan Sect has returned to the heaven.

248
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,800
I know a little about the skill of soul-returning.

249
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,500
If you can trust me,

250
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
can you let me try?

251
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,500
How do we know if you are pretending to be a ghost?

252
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,200
How about pretending to be a master?

253
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,700
Don't be rude to the god doctor.

254
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,800
We can trust you.

255
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,700
Just do as the god doctor said.

256
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,200
And,

257
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,200
please send the master's spirit back to his body.

258
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,200
I also need some of his body parts

259
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,700
to test my skill of soul-returning.

260
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,200
Gentlemen,

261
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,700
this is the residence of our master's body.

262
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,700
Tell me,

263
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,400
what did you play with

264
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,400
the Iron Man and Iron Armor Sect Young Master?

265
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,700
I played a game of rock-paper-scissors.

266
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,700
I won.

267
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,700
This Iron Man met his enemy

268
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,700
and then he had to jump off the cliff.

269
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,200
The character thought he was dead

270
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,700
and buried him in this soil.

271
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,200
What do you think?

272
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,700
I heard a voice when I was passing by

273
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,200
so I dug him out.

274
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,200
As for Shi Wen Jue,

275
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,200
he wanted to get a job

276
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,700
but he couldn't get the support of his family.

277
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,700
This person is more interesting.

278
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,900
He was acting.

279
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,400
I didn't expose him.

280
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,900
These two people

281
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,400
won't tell the truth.

282
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,400
That's the way it is.

283
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,400
The truth is out.

284
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,400
As I expected.

285
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,900
Your fame

286
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,900
is all because of your arrogance.

287
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,400
I just have a better eye than others.

288
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,900
It's a good thing to be alone in the martial arts world.

289
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,900
Good thing?

290
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,900
What do you mean?

291
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,400
It's like playing a big game.

292
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,900
Don't be angry.

293
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,900
Luck is also part of strength.

294
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,400
You're right.

295
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,900
If you have a chance,

296
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,900
let me help you.

297
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,400
We're even.

298
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,900
It depends on whether you can win.

299
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,400
You have a good eye.

300
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,400
Let's make a bet

301
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,900
to see who can find out his cause of death first.

302
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,900
I'm not sure how he died.

303
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,400
I also know that the murderer

304
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,900
is one of his three disciples and his butler.

305
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,900
Why do you think...

306
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,400
Look.

307
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,900
He's familiar with this jewelry.

308
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,900
He's a good man.

309
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,900
He's a good man.

310
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,900
He's a good man.

311
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,900
He's a good man.

312
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,900
He's a good man.

313
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,900
He's a good man.

314
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,900
He's a good man.

315
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,900
He's a good man.

316
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,100
He's familiar with this jewelry.

317
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,100
Gui Qi Palace?

318
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,100
Don't bother.

319
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,100
Gui Qi Palace can hold for three days.

320
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,100
After three days,

321
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,100
we need to hold a meeting.

322
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,100
We need to talk and learn.

323
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,100
We need to write three poems to find out the truth.

324
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,100
It's been 11 days.

325
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,100
He's already dead.

326
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,100
Wang Jingshan is the master of Gui Qi Palace.

327
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,100
We need to find the person who's the master of the heart

328
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,100
to wake him up.

329
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,300
But that person didn't tell the truth.

330
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,300
So he died.

331
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,300
No wonder you said the murderer is one of those four people.

332
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,100
This kind of secret

333
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,100
must be told to the closest people around him.

334
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,100
Among the Lin Shan Sect,

335
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,100
only these four people are the closest people to Wang Jingshan.

336
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,100
You can tell at a glance.

337
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,100
You just used the same trick.

338
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,100
I haven't finished yet.

339
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,100
Didn't you notice

340
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,100
that the gold leaf on your lips is very thick?

341
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,100
This is the wound before he died.

342
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,100
So he's not a murderer.

343
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,100
He's a murderer.

344
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,100
So the murderer used thick gold leaf

345
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,100
to cover his blood.

346
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,100
You can scratch off his back.

347
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,100
You...

348
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,100
I'll help you.

349
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,100
Is this the Five Poison Manual?

350
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,100
You recognize it?

351
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,100
This Five Poison Manual

352
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,100
is the best secret of the heart of the Golden Threads.

353
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,100
The Golden Threads was destroyed ten years ago.

354
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,100
Most of the people in the sect were captured by Bai Chuan Yuan.

355
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,100
But there are still some who are missing.

356
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,100
This heart is one of them.

357
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,100
I didn't expect that

358
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,100
they've been hiding here for so many years.

359
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,100
Let's go.

360
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,100
Go to the place where the sect leader was born.

361
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,100
I'll go with you.

362
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,100
I'll go with you.

363
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,100
Let's go.

364
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,100
Let's go to the place where the sect leader was born.

365
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,100
Maybe

366
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,100
we can find other clues.

367
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,100
For the sake of the evil.

368
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,100
Tian Ji Hall is dedicated to design.

369
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,100
You should know a lot.

370
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,100
Let me test you.

371
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,340
How do you know the

372
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,100
There's a secret in this room.

373
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,100
As expected.

374
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,100
The sect leader

375
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,100
hid a golden body under the stone board.

376
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,100
When Wang Qingshan

377
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,100
was in the middle of the night,

378
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,100
when Wang Qingshan

379
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,100
was in front of everyone,

380
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,100
he was in the cabinet

381
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,100
and exchanged the golden body.

382
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,100
But don't forget.

383
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,100
This is under the watchful eye.

384
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,100
Even if it was fast,

385
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,100
it couldn't escape the eyes of hundreds of people.

386
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,100
Everyone saw

387
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,100
the golden body.

388
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,100
Bronze mirror.

389
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,100
Gold powder.

390
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,100
I know.

391
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,100
Not bad.

392
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,100
It doesn't disappoint the detective.

393
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,100
But I always think

394
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,100
that the gold powder

395
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,100
is not the only thing that can be used.

396
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,100
It's not the only thing that can be used.

397
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,100
It's not the only thing that can be used.

398
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,100
But I still don't understand.

399
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,100
Why did Wang Qingshan

400
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,100
do this fake heart?

401
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,100
Come and see.

402
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,100
Isn't this my three-character crystal?

403
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,100
What's the strange thing?

404
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,100
How old were you when you read the three-character crystal?

405
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,100
I was very talented.

406
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,100
I read the three-character crystal at the age of three.

407
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,100
I was only five or six years older than me.

408
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,100
Yes.

409
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,100
Wang Qingshan was over fifty years old.

410
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,100
How could he have a three-character crystal?

411
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,100
Unless...

412
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,100
Unless he has a child.

413
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,100
The child he wants to find is not 16 years old,

414
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,100
but 16 years old.

415
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,100
Now I understand.

416
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,100
The Lin Shan Sect can't marry a child.

417
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,100
If he doesn't want to leave the business of the sect

418
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,100
to his disciple,

419
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,100
but to the six-year-old illegitimate child,

420
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,100
he can only use this method.

421
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,100
This idea

422
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,100
may have been given to the sect leader by Ben Lei.

423
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,100
It's a good opportunity

424
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,100
to turn the child

425
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,100
who is related to the child into the sect leader.

426
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,100
Where are you going?

427
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,100
Where are we going now?

428
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,100
Go to talk with the sect leader.

429
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,100
You still expect that dead person to give you the answer?

430
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,100
The one who gave you the book

431
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,100
is written on the page with the mark.

432
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,100
Child's signature?

433
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,100
He is a illegitimate child.

434
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,100
He can't wake up with his father.

435
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,100
Then he can only sleep with his mother.

436
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,100
So?

437
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,100
So I have a plan.

438
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,100
I don't know the young master of Tianji Hall

439
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,100
how long it will take to be a mechanism to break the gold and thin

440
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,100
and make the dead man change his life.

441
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,100
Come here.

442
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,100
You are indeed an old fox.

443
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,100
I admit.

444
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,100
So I need your little fox to help me.

445
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,100
The End

446
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,100
The chief's head is out of breath.

447
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,100
The soul has been left for too long.

448
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,100
I have already experienced it.

449
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,100
At the moment of the new midnight soul-returning,

450
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,100
when I am doing the practice,

451
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,100
I ask all the disciples to stay away from the yard.

452
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,100
After I talk to the sect leader,

453
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,100
I will convey the meaning of the sect leader to you.

454
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,740
The soul of the

455
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,100
The essence of the ten thousand souls

456
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,100
is the soul of the soul.

457
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,100
Please.

458
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,100
Although the master has left the immortal,

459
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,100
today the lotus flower has to be returned to the master.

460
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,100
I just want to ask who is the leader that the master wants to find?

461
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,260
Please.

462
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,100
Do as I tell.

463
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:48,100
The influence musst be submitted to the noble.

464
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:56,420
**The content of the text just returned to Like

465
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,720
On July 12th, 2009

466
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,960
he took a more formal job

467
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,020
This is how it stopped

468
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:10,020
His true identity is not known

469
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,080
The cuidado

470
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,760
Note, it called like

471
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,040
Master, don't worry.

472
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,560
The

473
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,360
half burnt, only half seen.

474
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,160
What is this?

475
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,760
Isn't this He?

476
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,760
I see it with all my heart.

477
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,560
It's He.

478
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,960
He.

479
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,960
This is the answer that the master gave me last night.

480
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,360
Thank you, butler Piao.

481
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,560
The correct answer is He Lan.

482
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,760
So it really is you.

483
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,560
You are that Snow-Cloaked Head.

484
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,960
I'm not.

485
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,160
I clearly...

486
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,960
You clearly taught Bai Jun.

487
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,160
Someone changed your answer, right?

488
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,160
Yes.

489
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,960
In just a few steps,

490
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,160
who can change your answer?

491
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,360
Master Piao.

492
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,960
Take out the blank paper in your hand.

493
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,960
I don't know what you're talking about.

494
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,360
These are all his guesses.

495
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,160
There's a misunderstanding.

496
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,560
Moreover, only he wrote the correct answer.

497
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,360
Then he is the real Snow-Cloaked Head.

498
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,960
Who told you this is the correct answer?

499
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,360
I'm not.

500
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,760
Who told you this is the correct answer?

501
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,160
On that paper yesterday,

502
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,760
there was only one He from start to finish.

503
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,960
It's impossible.

504
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,360
It's just a play.

505
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,560
Ordinary people,

506
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,760
when they see half of it burned,

507
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,360
they will only guess it's a He.

508
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,760
Who would have thought

509
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,760
that this obvious and well-known person, Fu Xin He Lan,

510
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,760
only the murderer of killing the master knows.

511
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,360
The master cares about the person the most

512
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,360
and that person is his lover, He Lan Yan.

513
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,760
Let's go.

514
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,760
What nonsense are you talking about?

515
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,360
What murderer? What lover?

516
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,760
The master died of a sudden death.

517
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,760
Everyone saw it.

518
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,160
Li Er.

519
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,760
Why are you looking so released?

520
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,640
Wang Qing Shan jumped goddamn high when it was sees Entenikaya.

521
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,960
That's because she wanted to use this Jade Bar

522
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,400
to invoke the light of dusk

523
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,800
onto the golden aa beams

524
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,960
and then gather it on Wang Qing Shan.

525
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,560
After seeing it from a distance,

526
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,640
it becomes suspensed.

527
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,200
So while everyone was waving their heads away,

528
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,800
I had time to exchange the money for the money.

529
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,280
I didn't expect such a simple trick

530
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,080
to trick everyone.

531
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,800
Is it possible that

532
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,360
the return of the Deity is all fake?

533
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,160
It was arranged by the master.

534
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,480
I just did it as I was told.

535
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,320
I can't blame it on me.

536
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,240
This Piao Erhuang

537
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,920
is still pretending to be stupid.

538
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,120
By the way,

539
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,760
I should

540
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,000
call you Wang Fu's father.

541
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,280
Or the Thunder Lord of the Golden Moon Alliance,

542
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,680
Xin Lei?

543
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,320
You can send someone to check it now.

544
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,040
There is a black seal behind the mountain.

545
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,680
It's the famous trick of this Thunder Lord.

546
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,720
I guess

547
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,160
this Wang Zhemeng

548
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,560
has a friendship with the girl of the Black Seal.

549
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,440
After that,

550
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,840
they had a private child.

551
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,480
But the Lin Shan Sect can't have a child.

552
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,280
So the Black Seal threatened to leave.

553
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,840
But the Green Mountain Master

554
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,520
didn't want to leave his child.

555
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,600
So he set up a trap.

556
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,160
But this trap

557
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,880
was accidentally known to you.

558
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,760
You happened to find that Wang Zhemeng

559
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,440
found that

560
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,920
there was a trace of the Golden Moon Alliance in California.

561
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,640
So you moved to get rid of his mind

562
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,880
and gave him this idea.

563
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,960
Yes, wait for possible reading.

564
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,200
Is it okay for us to do so

565
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,520
that the woman has brought all the trouble.

566
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,760
If we avoid her request,

567
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,840
I'm afraid that everyone of this Sect

568
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,000
will know about it sooner or later.

569
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,040
By then,

570
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,960
we're to go withoutyin.

571
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,720
If some of the disciples get arrays

572
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,120
because of you,

573
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,360
what will happen

574
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,240
and didn't keep me at bay.

575
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,580
And so, you two tried to

576
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,920
create the Go Spirit

577
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,040
to Avra Kripa versuchen to the为 to guard the flesh and devour the toxic cup.

578
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,720
Three days later,

579
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,460
the Master was awake when you Мы hi Woo Hyang

580
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:13,920
Woo Hyang.

581
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:14,700
No one knew that

582
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,400
everything was already scripted after him.

583
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:17,540
depois,

584
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,500
you dug and made turns

585
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,960
covering your red-handed Millenium Palm.

586
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,140
The master does have a seal!

587
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,720
You killed Master.

588
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,400
Did you ever believe

589
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,720
Why do you believe it?

590
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:34,920
Listen to me.

591
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,800
These are the wishes of that person.

592
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,560
I haven't finished yet.

593
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:40,760
Wang Shouqing.

594
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,600
Can I borrow the words

595
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,720
from the master?

596
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,600
Master Wang wanted to give

597
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,440
Lin Shan to his six-year-old illegitimate son.

598
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,160
So this stone

599
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,880
is not compatible with other words.

600
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,720
And this stone

601
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,120
has been cut.

602
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,200
I guess it should be the most important one.

603
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,840
The mother of the stone is He Lan.

604
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,560
You deliberately leaked the news

605
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,960
to Wang Fu's cousin.

606
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,880
And you made a scene in the ancestral hall.

607
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,920
You just

608
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,400
were afraid that these three disciples

609
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,720
would find out some details.

610
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,800
You have never thought about Wang Fu

611
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,000
for more than ten years.

612
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,480
Until you killed him.

613
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,720
Finally, you thought of your son.

614
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,440
You are a good father.

615
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,800
You just want to help him to the throne.

616
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,800
You just want to control this Lin Shan Sect

617
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,200
in your own hands.

618
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,360
Father.

619
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,680
It's really you, right?

620
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,880
The story is right.

621
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,480
What a pity.

622
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,960
But I still don't have any evidence, right?

623
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,640
When He Lan's name came out yesterday,

624
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,360
you were worried that it would be exposed.

625
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,720
So you went to his house

626
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,120
to kill their mother and son.

627
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,920
We have already put

628
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,000
white and red on their quilts.

629
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,160
Once washed,

630
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,480
it will turn black.

631
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,240
Show me your hands.

632
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,680
Revenge for Master.

633
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,000
How dare you say

634
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,600
those kinds of slander!

635
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,040
Hei Housepect.

636
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,960
Please take care of her.

637
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,040
I'll call Fei to send her back to Baichuan Courtyard.

638
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,240
Wait.

639
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,960
Do you have anything else to say to Wangfu?

640
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,760
This useless person.

641
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,160
He deserves it.

642
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,800
You bastard!

643
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,440
Wangfu.

644
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,440
What?

645
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,360
Don't be sad.

646
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,840
When you grow up,

647
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,800
I'll give you a house and a farm.

648
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,360
It's okay.

649
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,960
Don't believe it.

650
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,040
What do you mean?

651
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,640
This is the first case I've solved for you.

652
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,360
I know you're grateful to me.

653
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,160
I'm grateful to you?

654
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,360
Who just called my name so loudly?

655
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,760
Wasn't it me who saved your life?

656
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,160
Lower your voice.

657
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,360
We've gone down the mountain

658
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,360
and walked our own paths.

659
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,960
Is it important to save each other?

660
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,560
Why are you...

661
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,560
Oh, right.

662
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,960
I left something at the door.

663
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,360
I'll go get it.

664
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,960
You're rude.

665
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,160
Young Master Wang.

666
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,960
We have a favor to ask.

667
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,160
I heard that Baichuan Courtyard

668
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,560
has a taste of 188 cells.

669
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,160
It's hard to accept.

670
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,960
What are you doing here?

671
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,960
I'm here to give you a chance.

672
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,160
If you tell me something,

673
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,360
I'll let you go.

674
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,560
It's you to catch and let go.

675
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,360
What do you want?

676
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,360
I don't want to catch you.

677
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,160
It's the guy from Xinfang who wants to catch you.

678
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,360
I don't care about your life.

679
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,760
Tell me.

680
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,960
What do you want?

681
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:20,720
I'm a things 캠LAUGHS and I'm a

682
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,160
the employer.

683
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:23,960
I see...

684
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,760
We're normal.

685
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,960
Just tell me the answer.

686
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,760
There are three holes in your ear.

687
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,960
When I was practicing poison for the demon,

688
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,360
there was a mark like this under the ears of those people.

689
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,160
That's the mark of the poison of Bichazhi.

690
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,760
Bichazhi poison has no double in the world.

691
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,760
The one who gets it will be in a month's time.

692
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,360
The bone is broken, the skin is broken and the flesh is lost.

693
00:35:55,360 --> 00:36:00,360
Unless you have a strong inner force to force the poison out,

694
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,560
otherwise, the ordinary person will not be able to endure it for more than a month.

695
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,560
And you are still standing in front of me.

696
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:12,160
Unless you are that person.

697
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,760
Ten years, you are still alive.

698
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,360
I have no time to talk to you about this nonsense.

699
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,160
The person of Bichazhi is already on the way.

700
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:27,760
You are too timid to even admit who you are.

701
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:32,160
I can tell that you don't have any martial arts.

702
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:36,960
You are a master of martial arts, Li Xiangyi.

703
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,160
I guessed it right.

704
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,960
You were once an indescribable sword god.

705
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,760
Now you have fallen into such a world.

706
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,760
You fought for your senior brother to get the Golden Abyss Alliance.

707
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,960
But today, you are trying to get rid of him.

708
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,960
The world says that you are cold and heartless.

709
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,960
I don't think so.

710
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,360
You are quite caring to your senior brother.

711
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,360
But I can't help you.

712
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,960
I don't know where he is.

713
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,160
I don't know where he is.

714
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,960
I will kill myself.

715
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,360
I will kill you today.

716
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,760
Li Lianhua.

717
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,160
Are you okay?

718
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,760
I'm fine. Thank you for coming in time.

719
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,360
You made me tired.

720
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,160
It's my fault.

721
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,360
I didn't even ask him.

722
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,960
He died?

723
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,160
Yes. Thank you.

724
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,560
Li Lianhua, didn't you go to get something?

725
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,960
Why are you here?

726
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,560
I got lost.

727
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,360
I was just passing by.

728
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,160
I was just passing by.

729
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,760
Why are you here?

730
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,960
Lin Shan sent three seniors to thank us.

731
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,360
He invited us to dinner.

732
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,560
I'm glad I came to you.

733
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,160
I saved your life.

734
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,360
Thank you.

735
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,560
You're not going?

736
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,560
No.

737
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,760
There is a fox spirit at home waiting for me.

738
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,360
Fox spirit?

739
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,960
Salt and pepper.

740
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,160
San Xu.

741
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,760
San Xu salt.

742
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,160
Are you hungry, fox spirit?

743
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,560
Sit tight.

744
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,560
Come, let's eat.

745
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,160
So you are fox spirit?

746
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,160
So cute.

747
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,560
Come, let's eat.

748
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,960
Let's eat.

749
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,160
I'm sorry.

750
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,160
I didn't expect you to be not only a half-dry doctor,

751
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,160
but also a poor cook.

752
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,160
This is Lotus Pavilion.

753
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,160
What is this?

754
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,160
You're still growing vegetables here?

755
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,160
If I remember correctly,

756
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,160
we're even now.

757
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,160
Even if we're even now,

758
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,160
we have to ask them in person.

759
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,160
Why did you steal the sword manual of Phoenix Hall?

760
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,160
That sword manual was originally from the Shi family in Henan.

761
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,160
It was stolen by the people of Phoenix Hall a few years ago.

762
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,160
So I spent a lot of money to get it back.

763
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,160
Then why did you participate in it?

764
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,160
He helped me with a small favor.

765
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,160
I was also very considerate back then.

766
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,160
He stole things and stole them to my house.

767
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,160
He even stole my medicine.

768
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,160
He always wants to return the favor.

769
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,160
I didn't expect you to be a person who is always grateful.

770
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,160
I'm not.

771
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,160
I really want to rely on my husband.

772
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,160
But this person told Phoenix Hall about my whereabouts.

773
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,160
What can I do?

774
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,160
Why aren't you leaving yet?

775
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,160
Liu is going to have dinner with me.

776
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,160
At least I saved you twice today.

777
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,160
I brought the wine.

778
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,160
You have to stay and treat me to dinner.

779
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,160
Then I won't be polite.

780
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,160
I'll try it.

781
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,160
I'll try it.

782
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,160
I'll try it.

783
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,160
I'll try it.

784
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,160
I'll try it.

785
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,160
Eat a piece of good beef.

786
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,160
Why did you add such a strong pepper to ruin its taste?

787
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,160
And look at this pear.

788
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,160
It looks light.

789
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,160
Next time you cook, you can add a few pieces of bacon.

790
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,160
Use bacon to bring out the freshness of the red bean.

791
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,160
That's delicious.

792
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,160
And this chestnut stewed chicken.

793
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,160
It looks good.

794
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,160
Next time you cook, you can use broth to get rid of the fishy smell.

795
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,160
Really?

796
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,160
Of course.

797
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,160
If you like to cook, I'll teach you next time.

798
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,160
I'm an expert.

799
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,160
Then I won't bother you.

800
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,160
Brother, don't be so cold-hearted.

801
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:30,160
You're the first friend I've ever met in the martial arts world.

802
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,160
To be honest, I also escaped from my family.

803
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,160
My father wanted me to live in the martial arts world.

804
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,160
But I don't like the officialdom.

805
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,160
Compared to the temple, I'm more suitable for the martial arts world.

806
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,160
What does this have to do with me?

807
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,160
Bai Chuan must break three cases to accept me as the judge.

808
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,160
Look at us.

809
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,160
It's not easy to break this Lin Shan stone case.

810
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,160
I promised not to spread it.

811
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,160
You guys are good.

812
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,160
You saved the name of the god.

813
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,160
This Lin Shan Sect has also saved the dignity.

814
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,160
What about me?

815
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,160
I'm still three cases away from it.

816
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,160
I think you're a sharp sword.

817
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,160
I'm a powerful martial artist.

818
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,160
Why don't we work together?

819
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,160
Let's work together to earn money.

820
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,160
It's better to have money.

821
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,160
I think we should work together.

822
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,160
How about we work together?

823
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,160
Let's work together to earn money.

824
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,160
It's easy to say.

825
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,160
What do you think?

826
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,160
Money?

827
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,160
Do you have money?

828
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,160
I...

829
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,160
You're poor enough to come to me to save money.

830
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:27,160
Besides, I'm not interested in the work of the martial arts world.

831
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,160
The world is full of bad things.

832
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:33,160
I'm the biggest fan of the mountain and water.

833
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,160
I'm not suitable for a life full of blood on the sword.

834
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,160
You...

835
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,160
Think about it.

836
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,160
If I can't get into the Bai Chuan Courtyard,

837
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,160
how can I face my master?

838
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,160
Let go of my hand.

839
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,160
Master.

840
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,160
The four-door Bai Chuan Courtyard you built,

841
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,160
I must support you.

842
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,160
Wait.

843
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,160
Who do you think your master is?

844
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,160
Li Xiang Yi, the Sword God.

845
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,160
It's okay.

846
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,160
Li Xiang Yi, the Sword God.

847
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,160
How come I didn't know that Li Xiang Yi

848
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,160
had a disciple like you?

849
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,160
No one knows about this.

850
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,160
Yes.

851
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,160
I guess I don't know about it either.

852
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,160
You don't believe it?

853
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,160
Then I'll tell you the truth.

854
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,160
I've been weak and sick since I was a child.

855
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,160
My mother didn't even give me a name.

856
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,160
She was afraid that I wouldn't live until I was an adult.

857
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,160
When I was ten years old,

858
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,160
my mother recognized me as her lost brother.

859
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,160
She was the vice-principal of the Four-Door Sect,

860
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,160
Li Xiang Yi's senior,

861
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,160
Shan Gu Dao.

862
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,160
Shan Gu Dao is your uncle?

863
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,160
I'm here.

864
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,160
I'm here.

865
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,160
I'm here.

866
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,160
I'm here.

867
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,160
I'm here.

868
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,160
I'm here.

869
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,160
I'm here.

870
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,160
I'm here.

871
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,160
I'm here.

872
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,160
I'm here.

873
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,160
I'm here.

874
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,160
I'm here.

875
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,160
I'm here.

876
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,160
I'm here.

877
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,160
I'm here.

878
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,160
I'm here.

879
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,160
I'm here.

880
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,160
I'm here.

881
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,160
I'm here.

882
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,160
I'm here.

883
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,160
I'm here.

884
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,160
I'm here.

885
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,160
I'm here.

886
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,160
I'm here.

887
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,160
I'm here.

888
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,160
I'm here.

889
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,160
I'm here.

890
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,160
I'm here.

891
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,160
I'm here.

892
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,160
I'm here.

893
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,160
I'm here.

894
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,160
I'm here.

895
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,160
I'm here.

896
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,160
I'm here.

897
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,160
I'm here.

898
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,160
I'm here.

899
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,160
I'm here.

900
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,160
I'm here.

901
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,160
I'm here.

902
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,160
I'm here.

903
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,160
I'm here.

904
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,160
I'm here.

905
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,160
I'm here.

906
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,160
I'm here.

907
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,160
I'm here.

908
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,160
I'm here.

909
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,160
I'm here.

910
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,160
I'm here.

911
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,160
I'm here.

912
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,160
I'm here.

913
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,160
I'm here.

914
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,160
I'm here.

915
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,160
I'm here.

916
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,160
I'm here.

917
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,160
I'm here.

918
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,160
I'm here.

919
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,160
I'm here.

920
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,160
I'm here.

921
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,160
I'm here.

922
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,160
I'm here.

923
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,160
I'm here.

924
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,160
I'm here.

925
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,160
I'm here.

926
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,160
