[Episode 27]

4
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,120
If I'd known you were fine,

5
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,100
I wouldn't have come to save you.

6
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,180
Watch out!

7
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,810
Cosmos Fortune Palm!

8
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,500
Jin.

9
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,600
Is it you?

10
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,100
Jin.

11
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:23,860
Is it really you?

12
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,850
As I expected, he and Lu

13
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,140
have a history.

14
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,829
In the inn,

15
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,740
this guy attacked us

16
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,140
but didn't mean to hurt us.

17
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,660
Because he recognized

18
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,600
the wine gourd Lu gave me.

19
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,460
Jin,

20
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,400
you still remember this gourd,

21
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,260
so you must remember me too,

22
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:01,820
right?

23
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,650
I've been looking for you for three years.

24
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,780
I finally found you.

25
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,130
I know you're a man of your word

26
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,110
and won't break your promise.

27
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,790
I came as I promised.

28
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,000
The flower wine this year is mine.

29
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,980
No hard feelings.

30
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,640
Nice move.

31
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,210
You're the first one

32
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,220
who can take something from me.

33
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,420
You can have the wine.

34
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,450
I'm Jin Youdao.

35
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,380
Lu Jianchi.

36
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,810
What a surprising ending.

37
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:27,110
Is he really Jin Youdao?

38
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,110
It's Jin

39
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,590
who protected me.

40
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:00,570
Luckily,

41
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,270
I have the wine gourd Lu gave me.

42
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,630
Later I found that those mutants were afraid of fire.

43
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,880
So I made this fire circle

44
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,820
to keep them away.

45
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,330
I'm glad you're safe.

46
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,740
Where are the other mutants?

47
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,780
When the morning light shone through,

48
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,470
I noticed that their movements slowed down.

49
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:42,460
So I lured them into this dungeon

50
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,560
and locked them up.

51
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,530
That was close.

52
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,630
Thank god you made it to dawn.

53
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:47,980
Yes.

54
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:50,060
I was up all night

55
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,450
and felt so sleepy.

56
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,430
I was going to find a place

57
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,540
to have a good rest

58
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,659
but someone ruined my plan.

59
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,940
Thank you for your concern.

60
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,870
You're welcome.

61
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,300
You're a man.

62
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,430
Don't be so fragile.

63
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:05,490
But…

64
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,140
Why is Jin now afraid of sunlight?

65
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,580
Maybe his Head Bane

66
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,170
isn't the same as it was ten years ago.

67
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:14,870
Head Bane?

68
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,240
I found some clues here.

69
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,560
This sinkhole is

70
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,870
where Nanyin people created mind control bugs.

71
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,120
These people

72
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,900
were tricked here

73
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,030
to be test subjects.

74
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,630
But it seems that those bugs

75
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,700
were a failure.

76
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,780
Nanyin people are so despicable.

77
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,260
Is the Lord of the Netherworld

78
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,400
among these people?

79
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,590
The Netherworld Sword?

80
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,380
Yes.

81
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,670
It's the Lord of the Netherworld's sword.

82
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,130
Then he…

83
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,290
He's not here.

84
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,500
I found it on a stone wall

85
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:53,140
nearby.

86
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,880
It proves that he was here.

87
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,370
The Lord of the Netherworld

88
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,370
knows a technique to break his sword

89
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:01,930
as a diversion to escape.

90
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,100
He must

91
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:05,890
have gotten out of here.

92
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,810
Then the trail goes cold again.

93
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,140
You're still alive!

94
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,050
Tell us.

95
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,210
Where is the antidote for Head Bane?

96
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:26,980
Antidote?

97
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,010
There is no cure for Head Bane.

98
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,150
People who gave their souls to the Head God

99
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,060
will be his servants forever.

100
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:38,690
Nonsense!

101
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,320
All the poisons

102
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,140
and black magic in the world

103
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,260
are invented by humans

104
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,460
and can definitely be neutralized.

105
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,100
Tell us!

106
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,540
There is no cure for Head Bane.

107
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,940
You had it coming.

108
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,100
Shut up!

109
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,130
It's a big world

110
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,200
full of experts and geniuses.

111
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,430
I believe as long as I keep searching,

112
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,220
I'll eventually find a way

113
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,260
to cure Jin.

114
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,020
Sirs,

115
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,310
without your help,

116
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,120
I wouldn't have found Jin.

117
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,150
Thank you very much.

118
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,720
Lu, don't say that.

119
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,590
We didn't do much.

120
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,000
After we part ways today,

121
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,120
no one knows when we can meet again.

122
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,260
Take care.

123
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,140
Lu, take care.

124
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:31,820
Take care.

125
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:44,760
By the way,

126
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,350
I found an important place

127
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,650
in the sinkhole.

128
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,300
I'm afraid what Nanyin wants

129
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,370
is not that simple.

130
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,860
Lock those guys up.

131
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,520
I'll take you there.

132
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:55,790
Okay.

133
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,430
This is where they made research on Head Bane.

134
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,250
When I was running from the mutants,

135
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,450
I found this place by chance

136
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,260
and saw their notes.

137
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,050
Look.

138
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,630
They're prints of ancient murals.

139
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,120
Bug eggs are raised in human skulls.

140
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,100
This is Nanyin's magical technique

141
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,500
of creating Karmic Bugs.

142
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,350
Karmic Bugs raised in skulls

143
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,090
can be divided into mother bugs and child bugs.

144
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,460
By controlling mother bugs,

145
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,140
one can control the child bugs' hosts.

146
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,100
So Karmic Bugs are used to control people.

147
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,510
Head Bane may work the same way.

148
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,260
What does it have to do with Karmic Bugs?

149
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,370
Karmic Bugs were created

150
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,890
by black magic in ancient Nanyin.

151
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,020
That technique

152
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,580
has long been lost.

153
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:22,900
Think about it.

154
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,470
Back then in Nanyin,

155
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,530
only the royal family had one Karmic Bug.

156
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,220
With Nanyin's downfall,

157
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,170
that Karmic Bug went missing.

158
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,590
You mean,

159
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,510
Nanyin people found these murals

160
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,070
which only depicted part of the technique

161
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,290
so the descendants of Nanyin

162
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,350
couldn't fully understand how to make Karmic Bugs.

163
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,330
That's why they tried again and again

164
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,180
and caused those martial art masters

165
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,130
to become uncontrollable monsters.

166
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,140
Yes.

167
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,100
That's also

168
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,960
why Head Bane was a failure

169
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,030
despite ten years of effort.

170
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,200
Nanyin people quit creating it

171
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:00,740
and started searching for

172
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,170
the Karmic Bug the royal family once owned.

173
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,310
Nanyin wants to control martial forces

174
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,340
in the Central Plains through Karmic Bugs.

175
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:07,880
That's why

176
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,480
they need Rama Heavenly Ice.

177
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,130
Elder Shi,

178
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,330
is my guess right?

179
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,690
So it is right.

180
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,270
So what?

181
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,920
You can't get out anyway.

182
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,880
I've informed my master.

183
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,660
She's on her way here

184
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,380
with men from the Jinyuan Alliance.

185
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,220
You found out

186
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,650
the secret of our village

187
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,460
and ruined our Head Bane.

188
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,250
You won't survive today.

189
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,540
The Jinyuan Alliance.

190
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,020
It's your men's doing again!

191
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:49,590
Forget it.

192
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,370
You've been in seclusion for the past decade.

193
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,100
I don't think you know about it.

194
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,020
The Jinyuan Alliance and Nanyin…

195
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,290
Someone from Nanyin

196
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,470
bought gunpowder and blew up

197
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,220
everything you had in the East Sea.

198
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,620
Do you know that Jiao Liqiao is from Nanyin?

199
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,120
What did you mean in the secret letter?

200
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,870
Your master wants me to take control of the Jinyuan Alliance?

201
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,980
What you did

202
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,340
will be found by Di Feisheng sooner or later.

203
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,660
By then, if the Jinyuan Alliance is under your control,

204
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,120
things will be easier for both of us.

205
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,110
Fei.

206
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,340
Are you okay?

207
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,300
I didn't blame you.

208
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,300
Stop pretending.

209
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,020
Wuxin Huai is attacking him again.

210
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,440
Fei. Careful.

211
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,640
I remember seeing the cure

212
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,300
for Wuxin Huai on the murals.

213
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:38,960
Take a look.

214
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,010
Okay.

215
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,350
Here it is.

216
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,110
This painting says,

217
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,640
using a leech raised in Wuxin Huai

218
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,550
to suck out poisonous blood from Taiyuan Acupoint

219
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:58,080
can remove Wuxin Huai from the victim's body.

220
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,780
Leech raised in Wuxin Huai?

221
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,080
You know how to use Wuxin Huai,

222
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,950
so you must have such leeches with you.

223
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,080
I won't give you any

224
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,150
even if you kill me!

225
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:09,600
You…

226
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,730
We won't bother you then.

227
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,080
You guys have been doing evil for so many years.

228
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,540
You can't get away with it.

229
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,070
Just wait to be thrown into

230
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,000
the Baichuan Court's 188 prisons.

231
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,480
Fei.

232
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,320
I need some of your blood.

233
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,540
There's a pond here.

234
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,360
If you cure Wuxin Huai for him,

235
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,830
he'll regain his memory

236
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,460
and may become the old Di Feisheng again.

237
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,190
Are you sure you want to do that?

238
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,240
Never mind.

239
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,400
He opened the device for me.

240
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,660
I'll consider it as returning the favor.

241
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,220
Di Feisheng

242
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,040
has only one opponent,

243
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,610
Li Xiangyi.

244
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,180
Defeating him

245
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:02,910
is all I want.

246
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,180
Sorry.

247
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,510
I can't help you.

248
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,490
No one can defeat you now.

249
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,090
Fei.

250
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:22,700
He's fine.

251
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,500
Wuxin Huai is already out of his system.

252
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,910
He just fainted

253
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,710
from exhaustion.

254
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:42,940
Xiaobao!

255
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:47,600
Run!

256
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,550
Protect Fei.

257
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,500
Granny Blood!

258
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,119
Dragon in Snow?

259
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:30,750
Xiangyi Swordplay?

260
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,220
Back then, Li Xiangyi

261
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,130
saw a unique plum

262
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,280
in Dongfang Qingzhong's plum garden.

263
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,630
He found it so beautiful

264
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,010
that he wanted to pick 17 blossoms

265
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:49,250
for the 17 girls in the Sigu Sect.

266
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,000
Dongfang Qingzhong wouldn't let him

267
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,080
so they fought in the plum garden.

268
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,720
You defeated him

269
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,110
and took the flowers.

270
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,110
You used that move

271
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,780
called Dragon in Snow to defeat him, right?

272
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,040
I was right.

273
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,880
You are Li Xiangyi.

274
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,060
The Shaoshi Sword can slice steel.

275
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,850
The Wenjing Sword can shatter bones.

276
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,620
Sect Leader Li, how have you been?

277
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,190
It's been ten years.

278
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,530
You're still so young and handsome.

279
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,140
Miss Jiao.

280
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,180
Thank you for your compliments.

281
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,360
It's been ten years.

282
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,540
You've aged a lot.

283
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,580
He's really Li Xiangyi.

284
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,390
You're so mean,

285
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,000
even more annoying than ten years ago.

286
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,670
I thought you were disabled by the Bicha Poison.

287
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,770
The Bicha Poison

288
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,320
is far from enough to ruin me.

289
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,880
You're right.

290
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,700
I've been practicing martial arts so hard for ten years

291
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,990
in order to defeat you.

292
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,470
I must kill you today.

293
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,630
I won't fight you today.

294
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,140
Saving Director Di is more important.

295
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,600
I'll settle the score with you in the future.

296
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,780
You're awake.

297
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,030
Li Lianhua.

298
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:39,620
No.

299
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:43,600
I should call you

300
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,570
Li Xiangyi, right?

301
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:51,940
Yes.

302
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,580
You can use Yangzhouman.

303
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,810
You've been involved with Di Feisheng.

304
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,840
You know so much about my father.

305
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,630
You always want to ditch me

306
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,320
because you don't want me to find out who you are.

307
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,840
You're also the guy in white who helped me,

308
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,500
aren't you?

309
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,980
You hid it from me for so long.

310
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,400
I was kept in the dark

311
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,220
and so worried about your safety.

312
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:22,820
Fang Xiaobao,

313
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,350
I didn't mean

314
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,410
to hold out on you.

315
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,560
You didn't mean it?

316
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,320
How do you explain

317
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,080
why you have the Wenjing Sword?

318
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,900
Back then, my father asked the Shi family of the Tiejia Sect

319
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,760
to forge weapons with cloud iron.

320
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,250
They made body armor

321
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,200
and a soft sword for him.

322
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,540
When we moved my father's grave,

323
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,380
we all saw

324
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,390
my father in that body armor.

325
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:47,630
Do you know

326
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,220
that cloud iron is hard and flexible

327
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,190
and the only thing that can pierce that body armor

328
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,160
is that soft sword made of cloud iron too?

329
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,890
And that is your Wenjing Sword!

330
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,780
Cloud iron has a blue glow when stained with blood.

331
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,450
What else do you have to say?

332
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,760
You mean,

333
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,270
the Wenjing Sword has a blue glow

334
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,090
because it's made of cloud iron?

335
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,460
Your inner power is fierce.

336
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,660
This soft sword may suit you.

337
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,140
In a few days,

338
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,510
you'll turn eighteen.

339
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,750
I give you this soft sword

340
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,170
as your birthday gift.

341
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,960
This sword is flexible

342
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,990
and can easily slice your enemies' throats.

343
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,650
You'll be invincible with it.

344
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,770
What an amazing sword.

345
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:40,570
Sharp

346
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:41,850
yet soft.

347
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,420
Since it's a gift from you,

348
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,630
I'll take it as a token of our friendship.

349
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,910
We'll hold together through thick and thin.

350
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,140
I'll call it the Wenjing Sword.

351
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,470
Is my Wenjing Sword

352
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,810
made of the cloud iron from the He family?

353
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:06,160
Were the He brothers killed by…

354
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,940
You said you don't know about cloud iron.

355
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,370
Then why do you have a sword made from it?

356
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,240
There's more to this story.

357
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,570
It's not what you think.

358
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,800
Then tell me about it.

359
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,500
I'll make my own judgment.

360
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,530
I didn't know this sword

361
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,310
was made of cloud iron.

362
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:35,180
Originally,

363
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,060
the He family planned to use cloud iron to…

364
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:41,320
What?

365
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:44,780
I saw through your lie

366
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,440
and you don't know what to say?

367
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,570
Or do you

368
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,920
even not care to lie to me now?

369
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,540
Xiaobao.

370
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,740
There are many things I haven't figured out yet.

371
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,800
I don't want you to harbor resentment

372
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,070
because of what I say.

373
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,910
Please give me more time.

374
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,700
Li Lianhua!

375
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:13,770
No.

376
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,560
I should call you Li Xiangyi.

377
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:20,710
All this time,

378
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,150
I've seen you as my best friend,

379
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,210
but what did you do?

380
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,800
You promised to be honest with me

381
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,460
but are actually full of lies!

382
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,670
In terms of calculation,

383
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,440
no one can be your match, Sect Leader Li.

384
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,200
I was wrong about you.

385
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:39,130
If you can't explain yourself today,

386
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,460
I'll kill you

387
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,790
to avenge my father now!

388
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,430
Forget it.

389
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,530
I don't know what to believe.

390
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:19,930
You and I

391
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,630
are like this flute.

392
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,260
In the future,

393
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,810
we'll be strangers.

394
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,810
If one day,

395
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,490
I find that my father's death

396
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,630
was related to you,

397
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,010
I'll find you

398
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,820
and fight you to the dead.

399
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,720
Let's put an end to our past.

400
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:21,660
Here.

401
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,570
To my new friend.

402
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:25,860
New friend?

403
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,440
My best friend.

404
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:11,460
[Shishou Village]

405
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,590
[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

406
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:47,400
My Lord.

407
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,550
You're awake.

408
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,620
Where am I?

409
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,580
My Lord,

410
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,760
I did all this for you.

411
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,400
Please forgive me.

412
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,750
Forgive you?

413
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,720
You've been my Guardian for ten years.

414
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,390
What should I forgive you for?

415
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:37,740
Are you talking about

416
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,940
me ending seclusion by force

417
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,660
and almost losing my sanity?

418
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:47,430
Yu Hongzhu failed in her duty as my Guardian.

419
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:49,210
My Lord,

420
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,950
you mean

421
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:54,580
you just ended seclusion in Yu City yesterday?

422
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:55,840
Didn't I?

423
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,530
My Lord, please forgive me.

424
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,930
I was not with you.

425
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,100
What happened?

426
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,110
I only remember lots of noises.

427
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,160
Men from the Baichuan Court seemed there.

428
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,890
I stopped cultivation by force

429
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,380
and my power backfired.

430
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,600
I was relieved when you arrived.

431
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,270
Get in!

432
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,100
Come in.

433
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,080
My Lord.

434
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,680
I was in seclusion for ten years.

435
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,220
It's been long since the last time I saw so many people.

436
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:49,930
Why were you hiding outside?

437
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,080
My Lord,

438
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,350
Saintess asked us

439
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,250
to protect you outside.

440
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,110
My Lord, you just ended seclusion.

441
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,480
How are you feeling?

442
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:08,570
My head aches.

443
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,740
Let me make you feel better.

444
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,220
Okay.

445
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,290
You may leave.

446
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,080
Yes.

447
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,300
It's been ten years.

448
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:44,310
You're still so beautiful.

449
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,430
Thank you for everything you did these years.

450
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,520
My Lord.

451
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,100
I'm glad you're back.

452
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,440
Ten years is nothing.

453
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,540
For you,

454
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,490
I'll do anything.

455
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,660
Then tell me

456
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,090
what you will do for me.

457
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,630
I'm preparing a big gift for you.

458
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,540
A gift that can make you invincible

459
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,560
in the martial world.

460
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,620
But I haven't gotten it yet.

461
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,110
After I succeed,

462
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,480
I'll give you a surprise.

463
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:36,650
Okay.

464
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,250
I'll wait for you.

465
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:40,580
I heard

466
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:43,700
that he lost all his memories

467
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,870
when he was with Li Lianhua.

468
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:51,240
Wuxin Huai is so powerful.

469
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:13,480
Mr. Li.

470
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:16,300
You've been unconscious for three days.

471
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,460
What happened?

472
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,620
I came to see you

473
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:23,510
and found you unconscious outside the Lotus Tower.

474
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,320
Don't worry.

475
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:25,800
Look.

476
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:26,920
I'm tough.

477
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,580
I won't die.

478
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,450
I'm fine now.

479
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,310
Are you really okay?

480
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,760
The monk said the poison

481
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,870
will attack me every three days.

482
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,560
As time passes by,

483
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,160
I'll faint more and more often.

484
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,930
I must hurry up.

485
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,130
It's strange.

486
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:49,800
Li Lianhua.

487
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:50,890
Weren't you

488
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,560
always with Fang Duobing?

489
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:54,600
You're sick now.

490
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,060
Why is he not here?

491
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:00,360
Careful.

492
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:08,360
Fang Xiaobao has gone home.

493
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,850
These matters have nothing to do with him.

494
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,930
He shouldn't be involved.

495
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,860
What are you talking about?

496
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:19,700
Nothing.

497
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,860
What brought you here?

498
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:22,650
Li Lianhua.

499
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,940
My grandpa found something about Rama Vessel.

500
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,100
Rama Vessel is used

501
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,360
to keep Karmic Bugs, isn't it?

502
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,330
Yes.

503
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:33,270
There are two types of Karmic Bugs: mother bugs and child bugs.

504
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,510
There are only child bugs in Rama Vessel.

505
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,040
Mother bugs have been lost.

506
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,430
I'm confused about one thing.

507
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,320
If Jiao Liqiao is from Nanyin too,

508
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,520
why is it so hard for her to gather the four pieces of Heavenly Ice?

509
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,190
I think

510
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,560
those four people brought Heavenly Ice

511
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,780
to the Central Plains to restore Nanyin

512
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,340
but their descendants

513
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,940
gradually got used to the luxurious life here.

514
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:57,980
As a result,

515
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,650
they quit restoring Nanyin

516
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,280
and hid their identities.

517
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:07,240
So it's hard to gather those four pieces of Heavenly Ice.

518
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:08,500
Besides,

519
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:10,350
my grandpa has also found

520
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:12,290
that mother bugs

521
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,920
can live in their hosts for thousands of years

522
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,210
and the child bugs

523
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:17,940
can sense the locations of the mother bugs.

524
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,830
You mean,

525
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,949
they took Rama Vessel

526
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,449
not just for the child bugs?

527
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:27,630
They want to find where the mother bugs are.

528
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,429
Yes.

529
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:31,199
Once they find the mother bugs,

530
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,540
they can create tens of thousands of child bugs.

531
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,460
That'll be a disaster.

532
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,170
This matter

533
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,260
is much more serious than I thought.

534
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,300
I need to go to…

535
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,230
No matter what you need to do,

536
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:50,030
you need to be in good health to do it.

537
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:50,940
You look like

538
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,760
you may faint again anytime.

539
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,659
Let's eat something first.

540
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,770
They look great.

541
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:06,640
Miss Su,

542
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,140
thank you.

543
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,810
You're welcome.

544
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,310
I took them from the Shishou Village.

545
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,050
Eat up.

546
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,490
By the way,

547
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:21,450
that village is so remote.

548
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,690
How did the Wansheng Clan find it?

549
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,330
They sent lots of food to the villagers.

550
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,700
The Wansheng Clan?

551
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,080
How did you know the food was from the Wansheng Clan?

552
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,480
It's written on the grain bags.

553
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,080
I took them from the village.

554
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,520
That mark

555
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,510
looks very familiar.

556
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,130
That mark is solely used by the Wansheng Clan

557
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,820
for internal communication.

558
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,920
The Wansheng Clan. The cloud iron armor.

559
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,300
Wuxin Huai.

560
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,560
No wonder the Sigu Sect

561
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:13,520
and the Jinyuan Alliance suffered great losses from the showdown ten years ago.

562
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,180
The Wansheng Clan benefited the most from that.

563
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:17,860
Ten years ago.

564
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,790
Ten years later.

565
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,940
What is the conspiracy behind all this?

566
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,240
Senior.

567
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,940
Look where your lies have got me.

568
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,950
All these years,

569
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,480
what role have you played

570
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,890
in this game?

571
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,270
Director Di only remembers

572
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:42,270
what happened after he left Yu City.

573
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:43,760
He's completely forgotten

574
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,020
what we've done.

575
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,890
Wuxin Huai is so amazing.

576
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,470
It didn't damage his martial art skills

577
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,800
but damaged his memory.

578
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:53,080
The wind is in my sails!

579
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,510
Maid,

580
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:57,930
go get me some tonics.

581
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:59,670
If Director Di summons me,

582
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,220
I need to be at my very best.

583
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:08,470
Saintess,

584
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,600
I think Director Di is very weird.

585
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,310
He's never interested in women.

586
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:19,580
Why is he suddenly so fond of you?

587
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,280
We don't know if he's really lost his memories.

588
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,940
Maybe he was just pretending.

589
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,260
What if he wants to deceive you?

590
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:29,370
In my opinion,

591
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,600
you should

592
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,620
be careful around him.

593
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,320
That's impossible.

594
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:38,110
I know him very well.

595
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:41,670
He's too proud

596
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,130
to pretend.

597
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:45,130
If he cares to act,

598
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,520
he's not the Di Feisheng we know.

599
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,520
He spent lots of time with Li Lianhua.

600
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,220
Maybe he picked up tricks

601
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,760
from Li Lianhua.

602
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,980
Snow Master is right.

603
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,900
This is strange.

604
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,620
Don't let him

605
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,390
get in our way again.

606
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,780
If he's really lied to me,

607
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,710
I'll cut off his limbs,

608
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,070
lock him in a room,

609
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,150
and make him unable to live without me.

610
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,010
However,

611
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,300
he's my man.

612
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,480
I'm the only one who can hurt him.

613
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,820
Don't you dare lay a finger on him.

614
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:33,570
I'm not interested in Di Feisheng at all.

615
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,520
I've read the secret letter

616
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,330
you sent me.

617
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,100
Are you sure

618
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,680
that Li Lianhua

619
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:42,340
is Li Xiangyi?

620
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,360
Yes.

621
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,980
That guy is such an annoyance.

622
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,340
Ten years ago,

623
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,800
Director Di was obsessed with defeating him

624
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,940
and didn't care about anything else.

625
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,810
Ten years later,

626
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,940
he appeared around Director Di again.

627
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:58,820
The Bicha Poison is said to be the deadliest poison in the world.

628
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,110
Why didn't it kill him?

629
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,720
Why is he still alive?

630
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:08,320
Li Xiangyi can't be killed so easily.

631
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:15,180
I think it's Yangzhouman that saved him.

632
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,710
Although he's only left with ten percent of his power,

633
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,310
he's still hard to deal with.

634
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:23,860
Should we…

635
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,060
No.

636
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,400
He's a wreck now

637
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,270
and can't threaten us.

638
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,310
I've gotten bored

639
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:38,300
of traveling at night.

640
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,730
I don't need to do that anymore.

641
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:44,810
It's God's will that he survived.

642
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:48,880
He'll be able to witness my success.

643
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:52,850
But if we don't kill him,

644
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,780
he may keep getting in our way.

645
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:55,830
Besides,

646
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:57,980
he has Yu Louchun's Rama Heavenly Ice.

647
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,380
We need all the four pieces of Heavenly Ice

648
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,730
to open Rama Vessel.

649
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,810
We don't need to deal with him ourselves.

650
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:07,100
Didn't you plant

651
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:08,930
lots of spies in the Sigu Sect?

652
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,690
Snow Master,

653
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,710
send a letter to the Sigu Sect immediately.

654
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,810
Xiao Zijin is petty

655
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,900
and narrow-minded.

656
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,260
He can't amount to much.

657
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,750
You just need to

658
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:21,790
give him a little bit of information

659
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,830
and he'll try desperately to seize this chance.

660
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:44,340
My Lord.

661
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:45,900
My Lord.

662
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,190
I never thought

663
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:48,290
that Jiao Liqiao

664
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,560
would plot with outsiders against you.

665
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,950
Thank god you survived.

666
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:54,520
Jiao Liqiao.

667
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,670
What can she do to me?

668
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:58,890
It's just that I was in seclusion for ten years

669
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,120
and the whole Jinyuan Alliance

670
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,210
answers to her now.

671
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,500
I underestimated her.

672
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,230
My Lord, don't worry.

673
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,660
There are still people loyal to you in the Alliance.

674
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,790
After we leave here,

675
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,370
we'll take the Jinyuan Alliance back for you.

676
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:13,550
No hurry.

677
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,510
Whatever she did to me,

678
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,870
I'll do worse to her.

679
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,140
I'm very interested in the thing

680
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,460
in her Rama Vessel.

681
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:28,270
They want to tear each other down.

682
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:32,080
I just need to sit back and watch.

683
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:39,900
[Pudu Temple]

684
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,060
Bhante Wuliao is meditating.

685
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,580
Please come another time.

686
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,930
Is he meditating

687
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,370
or avoiding me?

688
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,070
Fine.

689
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,390
Since you're meditating,

690
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:12,800
I'll wait for you to come out right here.

691
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,410
We caught a spy tonight.

692
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:50,900
He's from the Jinyuan Alliance

693
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,300
and got into the Pudu Temple disguised as a visitor.

694
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:53,900
He came

695
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:55,550
for the map of the 188 prisons.

696
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:57,810
Who told you the map is in the Pudu Temple?

697
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:04,500
Tell us.

698
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:05,500
Who's it?

699
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:07,440
I heard Saintess say

700
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:09,770
that she got the news from the Lotus Tower.

701
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:10,770
That's all I know.

702
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,500
I'm telling the truth.

703
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:17,810
Li Lianhua?

704
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:22,870
The Sigu Sect just received an anonymous letter

705
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:25,300
informing on Li Lianhua.

706
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:41,490
It's been six days.

707
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,280
I can't wait any longer.
