00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Ask

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
After four thousand times

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Thousands of times

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The most reluctant

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Is that moment

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
On the earth

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A thousand miles of madness

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who doesn't wander

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
On the edge of the cliff

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
On the earth

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The youth is wild

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The youth is drunk like a cup of wine

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
A journey through the world

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Like a dream

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
On the earth

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
A thousand miles of madness

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Who doesn't wander

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
On the edge of the cliff

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
On the earth

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The youth is wild

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The youth is drunk like a cup of wine

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
A journey through the world

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Like a dream

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
On the earth

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hey

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Can someone

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Surround yourself so exaggerated

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We have to find a reason

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Keep staying

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That Guo Kun

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Always carrying an armchair

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Run around

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Have you ever thought

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Where did he carry that armchair from?

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Did it come from the lotus pond?

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
This should not be a coincidence

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
go

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Let's go talk to Guo Guo

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You go

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I don't care if I say I don't care

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
go

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Xiao You really said no

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Oh, it's bitter

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
After all, it's wrong

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Guo Kun

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Do you know this?

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Do you like it

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Women in brown clothes

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Wear this

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Where to run

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Where to run

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I felt strange yesterday

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Since Guo Kun

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Where to run

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
See people in brown clothes

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Will go crazy

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Then why in the room

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Still have to hang brown caps

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Why do i still have to hang brown caps

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Actually

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
He won't care about this

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Fake

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Why are you carrying an armchair all day?

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Tell me

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'll return it to you

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You bastard

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Why are you here?

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The day before yesterday

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yesterday the sixth

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Today is the seventh

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Today is the seventh

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I want to play with my heart

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I can't ask anything with this crazy

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Go

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Wait

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Guo Kun

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Who is this bastard?

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Monster

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Monster

83
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Monster

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Since Guo Kun is not sensitive to the bride

85
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Why don't you try another person?

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Try

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Lost soul

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Do you remember me

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Bastard

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You can't run away

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
All die for me

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Like yesterday

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
One palm first

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
But weak

95
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:04,260
Guo Kun practiced the

96
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,000
The gossip door

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Guo Qian's sect

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It seems that Guo Kun imitates his brother

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I also turned a scroll last night

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
When those three women died

101
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
There are no signs on my body

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Then this palm

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Who did you hit?

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
When Xu Niangzi died

105
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The lost soul should be there

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I haven't eaten anything since last night

107
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm starving

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Is the medicine for the second master ready?

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Why did you cook according to yesterday's prescription?

111
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Wrong

112
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Hurry up

113
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Hurry up

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Guo Kun

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Guo Kun

116
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Guo Kun

117
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Guo Kun

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Guo Kun

119
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He can't

120
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Guo Kun

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Guo Kun

122
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I don't blame it

123
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I don't blame it

124
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Watch the house, Granny

125
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I will be late today

126
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I will be late today

127
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Go

128
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Go

129
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Guo Kun

130
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Guo Kun

131
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Go

132
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Go

133
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Go

134
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Go

135
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Go

136
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Go

137
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,160
Today is the death anniversary of my wife.

138
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,520
Cai Lian Zhuang's second and third child are born.

139
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,120
I'm so angry.

140
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,360
I'll burn more paper for her.

141
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,520
I'm so sorry.

142
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,680
I'm so sorry.

143
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,280
Death anniversary?

144
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,520
That means the second murder

145
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,400
happened in Cai Lian Zhuang seven years ago.

146
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,080
I was born on the fifth day of the first month.

147
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,680
I was born on the sixth day of the sixth day.

148
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,280
Today is the seventh day.

149
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:49,720
I'm going to play with the fox stars.

150
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,680
Fox stars.

151
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,360
Little brother, are you looking for Mr. Guo?

152
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,520
Who are you?

153
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,760
Are you from Linghua Village?

154
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,680
What are you waiting for him for?

155
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,160
Today is my birthday.

156
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,080
Every year on my birthday,

157
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,840
Mr. Kun will come to play with me.

158
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,160
We will learn to sing together.

159
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,840
But why didn't he come today?

160
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,560
Did his brother lock him up again?

161
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,400
Birthday every year?

162
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,040
Today?

163
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,040
Little brother,

164
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,520
have you known Mr. Guo for a long time?

165
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,360
Seven years ago.

166
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,720
You remember so clearly

167
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,480
without even thinking about it.

168
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,560
Of course.

169
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,680
Because it was the night of my dad's birthday.

170
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,360
My family and I were separated.

171
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,760
I was crying alone in the alley.

172
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,720
Mr. Kun also sneaked out to play.

173
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,920
He saw me crying.

174
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,320
He came to play with me.

175
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,320
It was almost dawn.

176
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,600
My family found me and he left.

177
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,400
So,

178
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,360
when Mrs. Wang died,

179
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,760
Guo Kun

180
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,320
was not in Cai Lian Zhuang at all.

181
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,840
What are you doing here?

182
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,360
I know you haven't eaten anything

183
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,040
since last night.

184
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,440
Eat up.

185
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,520
You are kind.

186
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,320
Don't think that you can make me angry

187
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,360
with this chicken.

188
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,960
I am a chicken.

189
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,440
You can make me angry.

190
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,040
I can't be wrong.

191
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,040
Fei is not easy to come.

192
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,680
I don't know how much you know him.

193
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,120
But it's always good to

194
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,920
travel the world.

195
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,840
You are a child who is always busy.

196
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,800
You should come to me when you are free.

197
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,560
My biggest advantage is that I have a memory.

198
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,560
I can see and know things.

199
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,600
I remember everything

200
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,200
that I have been told.

201
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,200
You are

202
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,600
a good person

203
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,200
except for being a little bit

204
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,320
stingy and stingy.

205
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,600
You are also a good person.

206
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,200
You are also the first friend

207
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,000
I made when I was walking in the martial arts world.

208
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,640
I don't want you to be in danger.

209
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,840
Okay.

210
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,480
I will be more careful

211
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,360
in everything.

212
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,240
This chicken is not for nothing.

213
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,560
If the case of Cailian Village

214
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,200
is not done by Fang Xintan,

215
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,480
there is no way to investigate it.

216
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,920
Since you have said it,

217
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,160
I will help you.

218
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,560
Are you also wondering

219
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,040
why Guo Kuan suddenly

220
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,520
did this to you last night?

221
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,600
Yes.

222
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,520
He is a good person.

223
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,160
He is a good person.

224
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,720
He suddenly did this to you.

225
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,920
This is the medicine bag Guo Kuan had yesterday.

226
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,520
I checked his house.

227
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,800
You are the one

228
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,000
who ordered the servants to change his medicine.

229
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,040
He is his brother.

230
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,960
The country is bright and bright.

231
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,200
Ten miles of land and half a house.

232
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,160
The sand is a forest.

233
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,000
The flowers are in full bloom.

234
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,000
That's right.

235
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,800
It's a good poem.

236
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,840
I didn't expect that this Doctor Li

237
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,440
has some literary talent.

238
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,520
Wait.

239
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,880
Father.

240
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,440
This seems to be a poem

241
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,440
about hiding.

242
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,040
The country is bright and bright.

243
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
The country is bright and bright.

244
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,440
Master, bad news.

245
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,640
I saw Lady Xu's kitchen again.

246
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
She is in the back yard of my Tailian Manor.

247
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,320
She doesn't take me seriously.

248
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,520
If that's the case,

249
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,800
don't blame me for being rude.

250
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm rude.

251
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You...

252
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You sent people into this room

253
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,200
just to see this?

254
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,200
The moon shines in the dark.

255
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
The mirror is empty.

256
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,200
The mirror is empty.

257
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,200
The mirror is empty.

258
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,200
The mirror is empty.

259
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,200
The mirror is empty.

260
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,200
The mirror is empty.

261
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,200
The mirror is empty.

262
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,000
Master Guo.

263
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
If I'm not wrong,

264
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
this must be a letter from Lady Xu.

265
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,800
They are all in the manor.

266
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Why did you two

267
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
arrange this meeting in such a secret way?

268
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,200
What did you do to them?

269
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,400
How would I know what's going on?

270
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,000
Maybe they are colluding

271
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,200
and secretly meeting.

272
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,200
They happened to meet my crazy second brother

273
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,200
and killed them.

274
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,600
It's safe to blame a lunatic.

275
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,000
But seven years ago,

276
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,400
on the night of Lady Wang's death,

277
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,000
Guo Kun wasn't in the manor.

278
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,200
Young Master Liu from the town can prove

279
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,200
that he wasn't there.

280
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,000
When Lady Wang died,

281
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,600
Guo Kun was not there.

282
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,800
But it can't prove

283
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,800
that Lady Xu wasn't killed by him.

284
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,400
You really don't see the coffin and tears.

285
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,600
Master Guo,

286
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,200
do you still recognize these two bottles of medicine?

287
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,400
One of them

288
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,600
is the medicine that Guo Kun used to take

289
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,000
to cure his illness.

290
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,400
And this one

291
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,400
is the one I found in the coffin.

292
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,200
I've already shown it to the doctor.

293
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,800
These two bottles are completely different.

294
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,600
Yesterday, this one was clearly not right.

295
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
Drinking it will make you more crazy.

296
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,800
That's why Guo Kun came out last night to scare people.

297
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,400
It's because you want Guo Kun to be the scapegoat.

298
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,400
Am I right, Master Guo?

299
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
Master Guo,

300
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
the corpse was in the manor

301
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
for a long time.

302
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,400
The corpse in the coffin is the best proof.

303
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,400
But you said that it only lived for three days.

304
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,800
If it wasn't for the ghost in your heart,

305
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,800
why did you lie about this?

306
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,400
What corpse?

307
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

308
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,400
Do you know the corpse

309
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,200
that has been missing for ten years?

310
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,400
Do you want me to help you remember

311
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,800
or teach someone to dig a hole in the ground?

312
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,200
Even a fool

313
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,200
can't learn from anyone.

314
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,800
What he can learn

315
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,000
is the closest person to him.

316
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So the nonsense that Guo Kun said

317
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,800
is not a lie.

318
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,000
He's imitating what you said on the spot.

319
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,600
Uncle.

320
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,000
You can't run away.

321
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,800
You can't run away.

322
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,600
Uncle.

323
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,000
Let's go.

324
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'll see where you can run.

325
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
The battle that Guo Kun fought against Fang Du Bin

326
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
is the one you fought against the corpse.

327
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,300
Why did Lady Xu die in the

328
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,200
Cang Lian Manor instead of leaving?

329
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,200
Master Guo.

330
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Don't you want to tell me?

331
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
If you don't want to tell me,

332
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,400
let me tell you.

333
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,600
I guess this is the truth.

334
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,400
Ten years ago,

335
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,200
the corpse accidentally fell into your lotus pond

336
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,600
and was saved by Lady Xu.

337
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,600
The corpse suffered a lot because of this appearance.

338
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,200
So it was very timid.

339
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,200
But Lady Xu was kind.

340
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,800
She didn't treat it as a monster.

341
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,200
She took it in.

342
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,200
They also fought for love.

343
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,200
Okay.

344
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,600
Thank you.

345
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,600
You were suspicious.

346
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,800
You wanted to be harsh on Lady Xu.

347
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,400
The corpse ran away with Lady Xu.

348
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,200
But you found out the secret in this painting.

349
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
So you killed my son with a fierce rage.

350
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,200
Go to hell.

351
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,600
That night,

352
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,600
I was witnessed by Master Guo

353
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,600
the whole process of your killing.

354
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,200
Master Guo recorded the moves of your fighting against the corpse.

355
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,600
He also saw you hiding the corpse.

356
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,200
So he ran around with the corpse.

357
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Who would care about a crazy behavior?

358
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,600
But you know,

359
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,600
all his actions

360
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,000
are imitations of your killing.

361
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,800
You're afraid that things will be exposed

362
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,600
and you'll be in a hurry.

363
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,000
So you just put the blame on your crazy brother.

364
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,400
Am I right?

365
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,400
No.

366
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,400
No.

367
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,200
It's not the people my father killed.

368
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,200
No.

369
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,600
It's just your guess.

370
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,000
No evidence.

371
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Do you, the Baichuan Courtyard,

372
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,200
want to put the blame on me?

373
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,800
You want evidence?

374
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,000
Simple.

375
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,200
What do you want?

376
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,200
The way people talk.

377
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,200
I have the way.

378
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,200
You still don't want to say it?

379
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,200
Father! Father!

380
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Fei!

381
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,200
You're just trying to frame me!

382
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,200
You want to frame me and frame me up!

383
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,200
If you say so,

384
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,800
I'll throw you into the pool

385
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,200
and make you a fertilizer for the flower.

386
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,200
Fei!

387
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,200
I'll say it! I'll say it!

388
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,800
I killed the corpse you wanted to find.

389
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,800
I killed Guo Kun's demon.

390
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,200
Back then,

391
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,200
Lady Xu saved that weirdo.

392
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,600
I didn't expect that weirdo

393
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,400
to fall in love with Lady Xu.

394
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,600
He used his servant's identity to get into my Zhailian Village

395
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,400
and used his secret magic to keep me company.

396
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,400
I made Lady Xu happy.

397
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,000
Because he saw me being rude to Lady Xu,

398
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,600
he called Lady Xu to leave me

399
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,000
and took advantage of my wedding night to escape.

400
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,200
You're here.

401
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,600
While there are many people,

402
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,200
hurry and go to the back.

403
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,000
Fortunately, I found him.

404
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,800
Just because of that, you want to kill someone?

405
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,000
I was so angry that I killed that weirdo.

406
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
As for that bitch,

407
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,800
she was too scared to take the poison

408
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,200
and drowned herself in the pool.

409
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,600
But that bitch deserved to die.

410
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,800
She's a noble woman.

411
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,000
That bitch is a man of nature.

412
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,200
She's a man of character.

413
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,000
She doesn't deserve to be in love with anyone.

414
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,400
She's a woman of honor.

415
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,800
How can you use your own grudge to kill someone?

416
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,600
You keep saying that you love someone.

417
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,000
Are you worthy?

418
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,800
There's one more thing.

419
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,800
Where are the corpse and the relic?

420
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,000
That weirdo

421
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
was thrown into the pool by me

422
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,200
and turned into a flower.

423
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,200
Okay.

424
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,400
You all go into the water.

425
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,800
Get all the corpses.

426
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,200
Even if you turn the pool over,

427
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,400
you have to find a corpse with six fingers.

428
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,400
Go into the water!

429
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The lotus is a noble thing.

430
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,600
But it's broken into pieces.

431
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,200
I found it!

432
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,600
There's nothing here.

433
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,000
Didn't you say that the corpse's body is never broken?

434
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,600
It's been in the water for so many years.

435
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,400
If there's really anything on it,

436
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,600
it would have been ruined long ago.

437
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,200
The corpse's body is made of natural treasure.

438
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,400
It's not broken into pieces.

439
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,400
Since it's here,

440
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,800
and the body is not on it,

441
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,200
it must still be in the tomb.

442
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,600
Chief, let's go find it.

443
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,800
Where are you going?

444
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,000
Where are you going?

445
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,400
We didn't find the relics on the top and bottom of the Cailin Village.

446
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,200
You take the two people back to the Baishan Mountain.

447
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,000
I'll think about the corpse later.

448
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,400
Okay.

449
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,400
I'll go back to the Cailin Village.

450
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,600
I'll think of other ways to find the relics.

451
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,200
Let's go.

452
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,000
When you killed Xu Niangzi,

453
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,800
because she wanted to die with her corpse,

454
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,600
why did you kill the second and third?

455
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,200
I killed the person who turned the wheel.

456
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,400
Why did I kill her?

457
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,400
Is it important?

458
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,600
Coriander and beef.

459
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,400
I'm sorry, sir.

460
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
We sold out the coriander today.

461
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,200
We changed to a new batch of coriander and beef.

462
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,200
I just went to the town

463
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,000
to buy some famous coriander and meat.

464
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,200
Would you like to try one?

465
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,200
There are two here.

466
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,200
Come on.

467
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,800
Thank you.

468
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,800
No need.

469
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,600
Miss.

470
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,800
I took the wedding shoes that Madam gave you.

471
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,800
But why did this wedding

472
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,800
turn into a funeral?

473
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,400
Miss.

474
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,200
Miss.

475
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,400
Miss.

476
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,200
Miss, sorry.

477
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,800
May I ask you,

478
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,000
why does your lady use plain colors?

479
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,800
Doesn't she like other colors?

480
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,400
Because...

481
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,600
Because my lady has a color disorder.

482
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,200
She can't tell the colors clearly in the ordinary days.

483
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,600
So she just used plain colors.

484
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,400
My lady usually

485
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,000
doesn't let us tell her.

486
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,400
No, turn around.

487
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,400
Hurry up.

488
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,000
Hurry up.

489
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,600
Don't run.

490
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,600
Let's go.

491
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,600
Hurry up.

492
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,800
Young Master Guo.

493
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
Young Master Guo.

494
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,200
Where are you in such a hurry?

495
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,000
Lianhua.

496
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,400
Didn't you leave?

497
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,600
I did leave.

498
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,200
I had a problem on the way.

499
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,400
I didn't figure it out.

500
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,600
So I came back to ask Young Master Guo.

501
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,800
The lady from the security escort

502
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,600
said that the wedding dress

503
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,800
was an ominous color.

504
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
And she was very reluctant to wear it.

505
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,200
Why did she suddenly come back

506
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,200
and wear it when she died?

507
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,800
I don't understand.

508
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,200
Young Master Guo.

509
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,000
The same purple wedding dress.

510
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,600
I found it in your room.

511
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,400
Can you explain it to me?

512
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,600
Young Master Guo.

513
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,000
You're embarrassed to say it.

514
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,200
Let me help you.

515
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,800
I have also asked

516
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,400
the bride's servant maid.

517
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,000
The lady is born with a pale color and thin skin.

518
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,200
The natural flaw

519
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,400
won't let outsiders know.

520
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
She only told her future husband,

521
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,000
which is Young Master Guo.

522
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,400
And I heard from Pu Ren

523
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
that Young Master Guo

524
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,000
once prepared a new wedding dress for her.

525
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
But this wedding dress

526
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
was never seen

527
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
by anyone except the bride's servant maid.

528
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,200
Young Master Guo said that

529
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,200
the bride's servant maid

530
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,200
would give everyone a surprise

531
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,800
on their wedding day.

532
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,200
But just a few days ago,

533
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,800
the bride's wedding dress

534
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,000
suddenly disappeared.

535
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
He asked his maid to go back to her house

536
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,200
and get another one.

537
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,600
The maid left.

538
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,200
You secretly changed the dress

539
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
of the 16-piece wedding dress

540
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,600
in brown and purple.

541
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,600
Here.

542
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,480
I let the bride's person

543
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,480
put this brownned 16-piece dress

544
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,600
on the wedding dress.

545
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,600
Why are the two

546
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,600
red shoes you found

547
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,000
in your room

548
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,400
is the same as the pair that the maid took back.

549
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,040
Because the so-called red shoes are lost,

550
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,960
it's your intention to do it.

551
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,520
In order to make the maid beside the bride,

552
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,240
so that she can't distinguish the colors.

553
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I thought I had successfully deceived you.

554
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,360
I didn't expect you to come back.

555
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,240
You still found out all this.

556
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,240
Not only did I find out all this,

557
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,320
I guess Young Master Guo,

558
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,960
all you did

559
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,560
was for Miss Lv Rou, right?

560
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,920
Young Master Guo is fond of Miss Lv Rou.

561
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,200
But Master Guo insisted

562
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:18,240
to let you marry the daughter of the

563
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,360
red shoes.

564
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,240
She didn't change the color of the incense on your table.

565
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,800
Am I right, Miss Lv Rou?

566
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,040
Master.

567
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,920
We always thought

568
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,400
the same murderer killed three people.

569
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,360
After we found out the first case,

570
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,840
we naturally thought that the other two pairs

571
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,360
looked like the same murder case.

572
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,800
It was all Master Guo's doing.

573
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,520
In fact, it's also a misunderstanding.

574
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,160
Young Master Guo,

575
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,320
you did it on purpose, right?

576
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,560
It's all my fault.

577
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,640
It's none of his business.

578
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,160
I forced Guo Lang to marry me.

579
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,160
If you don't know, just find me.

580
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,320
Please let him go.

581
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,440
Get up.

582
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,040
Lv Rou.

583
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,360
One does what he should do.

584
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,680
I killed the person.

585
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,640
It's none of Lv Rou's business.

586
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,480
Why are you showing your kindness here?

587
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,600
Those people who were killed by you are innocent.

588
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,120
I killed the daughter of the red shoes.

589
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,960
Not only because I love Lv Rou,

590
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,320
but also because I hate Guo Qian.

591
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,120
I hate everything he arranged for me

592
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,720
and controlled me.

593
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,720
My father, Guo Qian,

594
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,760
he likes to take everything

595
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,640
under his control.

596
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,440
He can't tolerate others.

597
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,320
He doesn't obey his will at all.

598
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,120
My mother

599
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,640
was forced to die by him.

600
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,920
And I...

601
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,920
And I was almost suffocated by him.

602
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,320
I was almost suffocated by him.

603
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,120
So,

604
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,520
I will never let him control me.

605
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,720
Never.

606
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,120
Guo Lang.

607
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,600
Do you think

608
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,120
Lady Xu had a private relationship with Shi Hun?

609
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,520
Actually, Lady Xu

610
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,920
was tortured and abused by Guo Qian.

611
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,320
Shi Hun wanted to save him.

612
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,920
But they failed.

613
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,920
He died in Guo Qian's hands.

614
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,320
But it's good.

615
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,120
Lady Xu fell down

616
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,520
in the lotus pond in her 16th dress.

617
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,920
It's a good way to kill people.

618
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,320
A good way to kill people?

619
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,920
So you designed the mirror

620
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,920
and the mirror stone outside the house, right?

621
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,320
You're still talking.

622
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,920
And the stone and the half-legged stone

623
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,320
were also put on purpose.

624
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,920
I also found Mr. Feng Shui.

625
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,320
It's all Guo Qian's fault.

626
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,120
He believed everything.

627
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,120
Young Master Guo.

628
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,320
You killed your wife and husband.

629
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,920
You just want to get rid of your father's control.

630
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,120
He is your father's second wife.

631
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,920
It has nothing to do with this.

632
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,920
Why did you do so little to him?

633
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,520
So what?

634
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,120
He forced my mother to kill him and ruined my life.

635
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,920
Do you think I will let him live well?

636
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,320
What does he want?

637
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,920
I won't let him live well.

638
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,520
Young Master Guo.

639
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,120
Your father already knew

640
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,520
everything you did.

641
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,920
He didn't give you out

642
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,920
because he still wanted to protect his son.

643
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,320
Ridiculous.

644
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,320
Even if he gave me out,

645
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,720
he couldn't avoid his guilt.

646
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,520
He was just the last step of the schemer

647
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,920
who wanted me to save him.

648
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,120
But he never thought

649
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,720
I would want him to die.

650
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,720
You want to get rid of the evil and make a thousand ways.

651
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,120
Why do you choose to become a more evil person?

652
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,520
You want to take revenge.

653
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,720
Why do you pull innocent people to fill your sweat?

654
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,120
You haven't experienced my life and my pain.

655
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,520
You have no right to teach me.

656
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,320
I know.

657
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,720
You want to find the thing that the soul lost.

658
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,920
The soul lost back then

659
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,120
hid his belongings in a place

660
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,320
in order not to expose that he was the son of Golden Fist Alliance.

661
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,920
And I happen to know this place.

662
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,320
As long as you let me go,

663
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,920
I will tell you.

664
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,320
Guo Lan.

665
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,720
I hate being threatened by others.

666
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,320
If you don't tell me,

667
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,320
I will break your neck.

668
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:51,920
Okay.

669
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,320
As long as you let me go,

670
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,920
I will tell you where you are.

671
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,320
Go.

672
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,320
Don't run.

673
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,720
The cloth of Golden Fist Alliance.

674
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,320
This is the soul lost.

675
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,320
The soul lost is still in the wound.

676
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,920
But the leader's order is not yet finished.

677
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,120
He doesn't dare to take the responsibility.

678
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,120
So he will leave the world to the demon.

679
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,320
He will keep the body intact.

680
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,720
He will hide the body of Cai Nian Zhuang for a while.

681
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,520
He will kill him.

682
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,920
Senior.

683
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,120
I finally found you.

684
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
I told you.

685
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,720
No one can escape from me.

686
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,720
Those two people have been trapped by me.

687
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,120
Li Lian Hua, what are you doing?

688
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,720
Whose tomb is this?

689
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,320
Cao Luobing.

690
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,120
This is the remains of your uncle Shan Gu Dao.

691
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,520
In fact, we have been looking for him.

692
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,120
Come.

693
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,120
Come and visit your uncle.

694
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,720
It's you.

695
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,120
Is the flower beautiful?

696
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,320
You want to kill me?

697
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,320
Are you willing to?

698
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,520
Besides,

699
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,520
you are not my opponent at all.

700
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,120
What else do you want?

701
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,120
I have already hurt the leader for you.

702
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,320
For the past ten years,

703
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,720
I have spent all my efforts

704
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,720
and have nothing.

705
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,920
You don't have nothing.

706
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,120
You still have me.

707
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,120
Mr. Yin,

708
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,920
it's been a long time.

709
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,920
Do you miss me?

710
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,720
Don't lie to yourself.

711
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,120
Ten years ago,

712
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:22,120
you had no resistance to me.

713
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,120
Looking at you now,

714
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,320
I feel very sad.

715
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,920
You have to live on

716
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,320
for me.

717
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,120
I am here to ask you for a favor today.

718
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,720
What favor?

719
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,120
I want the remains of the 188th prison.

720
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,520
I want to take the remains of the 188th prison

721
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,300
to the

722
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,720
Imperial College.

723
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,120
Di Feisheng is back.

724
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,120
You are going to start planning for him again, right?

725
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,120
Yes.

726
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,320
All the sects in the Jianghu

727
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,320
have your admirers.

728
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,920
I am just like them.

729
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,320
They are all your tools

730
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,720
to conquer the Jianghu.

731
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,120
Mr. Yin,

732
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,920
I am not here to conquer the Jianghu for myself.

733
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,920
It's boring to conquer the Jianghu.

734
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,320
But some people

735
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,120
are destined to conquer the Jianghu.

736
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,120
Don't worry.

737
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,120
When I make it to the Great Ye,

738
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,520
I will have a place for you

739
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,320
by my side.

740
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,120
I...

741
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,720
I can't get all of them.

742
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,920
They will be wary of me.

743
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,520
Don't worry.

744
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,120
We will

745
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,920
take our time.

746
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:09,920
You

747
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,120
know my uncle?

748
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,320
We have a long history.

749
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,120
Your uncle said

750
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,520
he was dead.

751
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,720
He was buried in the snowy Cloud Mountain.

752
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,720
I just want to break the old man's wish.

753
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,720
You go to Cloud Mountain with me

754
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,720
to bury him.

755
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,720
Send him off with your family.

756
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,720
It's a good thing.

757
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,120
Brother Chi,

758
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,720
be my partner.

759
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,720
I will be with you

760
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,720
as soon as possible.

761
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,320
Li Lianhua,

762
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,120
can you tell me

763
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,920
the past of my master and my uncle?

764
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,520
You can bury my uncle

765
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,120
next to his master's tomb.

766
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,120
You must know their past.

767
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,920
Although they are my family and master,

768
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,520
I can only

769
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,320
hear about their story from Jiangwu's history.

770
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,120
I really don't know anything about it.

771
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,720
Just tell me.

772
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,720
I was ten years old

773
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,320
when I was killed by a knife.

774
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,520
I was forced to live on the street

775
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,720
without any support.

776
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,120
I found my four-year-old son,

777
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,120
Li Xiangyi.

778
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,320
It's cold.

779
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,320
Eat it.

780
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,920
Brother, you eat too.

781
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,320
I'm not hungry.

782
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,720
You eat too.

783
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,320
Eat.

784
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,920
Sir, this is the new girl.

785
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,920
Look. Look.

786
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,720
It's her.

787
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,120
What are you doing?

788
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:07,720
Don't be afraid.

789
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,720
Beat her.

790
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,320
If it weren't for Master Qi Mushan

791
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,520
taking them back to take care of them,

792
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,920
I don't know how long

793
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,520
they would live.

794
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,320
My master must be grateful to his uncle.

795
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,320
Li Xiangyi

796
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,320
should be grateful.

797
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,320
But he was born

798
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,120
with no shame.

799
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,320
He's a coward.

800
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,320
Since he was a kid,

801
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,720
his senior treated him so well.

802
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,720
But after he grew up,

803
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,520
he became more and more inhumane.

804
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,320
He made his senior angry

805
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,720
and hurt his heart.

806
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,920
He's the best in the world.

807
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,720
He's the master of the four ancient sects.

808
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,720
He's just

809
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,120
a heartless and ungrateful person.

810
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,320
What are you talking about?

811
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,720
My master isn't that kind of person.

812
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,320
If he wasn't there,

813
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,120
I'd be a useless person

814
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,520
who's just a scoundrel.

815
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,120
Everyone used to laugh at me and kiss me.

816
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,720
Only my master encouraged me to learn martial arts.

817
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,320
He treated me so well.

818
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,920
How could he be so cold to his senior?

819
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,520
Not to mention that everyone knows

820
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,120
he fought with Golden Thread Embroidery

821
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,720
because of the death of Shan Gu Dao.

822
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,920
Their relationship is good.

823
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,520
Don't talk nonsense.

824
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,320
Today,

825
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,120
the four ancient sects will be established.

826
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,320
The red and the red are the best.

827
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,320
Heaven will be happy.

828
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,120
Junior,

829
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,920
you're the sect leader today.

830
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,920
Why are you still like a kid?

831
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,720
Senior,

832
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,720
you're also the sect leader.

833
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,720
From now on, our senior and the first-in-class

834
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,720
will be in charge of the martial arts world.

835
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,920
Good.

836
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,520
The martial arts world

837
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:55,920
is a place where

838
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,920
there are four ancient sects and me.

839
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,920
If we are evil and evil,

840
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,120
we will definitely be killed.

841
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,920
We will follow the sect leader until we die.

842
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,320
Four ancient sects, listen to my order.

843
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,920
Follow me to destroy Golden Thread Embroidery.

844
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,520
Destroy Golden Thread Embroidery.

845
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,920
Destroy Golden Thread Embroidery.

846
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,320
Set out.

847
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,520
Yes.

848
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,120
No, Senior.

849
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,720
Junior,

850
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,520
what do you mean?

851
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,120
The sect leader is here.

852
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,520
All four ancient sects are not at my command.

853
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,320
Don't act rashly.

854
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,320
Golden Thread Embroidery is evil and evil.

855
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,120
Why can't we kill it?

856
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,720
One year ago,

857
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,720
the four ancient sects eradicated the evil sects of Mobei

858
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,720
and caused great damage.

859
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,520
Now, Golden Thread Embroidery is more powerful.

860
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,720
I made a peace agreement with Di Feisheng.

861
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,320
We won't interfere with each other within five years.

862
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,320
We won't fight.

863
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,520
Now, the martial arts world has been in turmoil for too long.

864
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,320
It's rare to have five years of peace.

865
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,720
Why do we have to break it?

866
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,920
You signed such an important agreement.

867
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,920
You didn't tell me about it.

868
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,920
It's the best choice to know or not to know.

869
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,720
Okay.

870
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,920
I don't need the martial arts world to help me.

871
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,920
The court has promised me to help.

872
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,520
You put your seal on this secret letter.

873
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,520
Tomorrow, the court will send the army

874
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,720
to destroy Golden Thread Embroidery.

875
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,720
Senior,

876
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,120
are you confused?

877
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,320
What?

878
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,920
If the four ancient sects are controlled by the court,

879
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,320
what's the difference between them and the government?

880
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,320
Don't forget that

881
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,520
when we founded the four ancient sects,

882
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,920
we wanted to make the world

883
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,120
have a justice and justice existence.

884
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,720
Senior,

885
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,120
don't forget your true nature.

886
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,920
You forget your true nature, not me.

887
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,320
You said you would fight with me.

888
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,320
Now you're hiding from the outside world.

889
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,120
You're so arrogant and ignoring me.

890
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,520
You even signed an agreement with them.

891
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,320
You're hiding us all from the outside world.

892
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,920
It's settled.

893
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,520
No need to worry about it.

894
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,320
Xiang Yi,

895
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,720
the four ancient sects

896
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,920
were founded by you and me.

897
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,720
It's not your Yiyan Hall.

898
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,720
As long as it's beneficial to the four ancient sects,

899
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,920
Yiyan Hall is a good place.

900
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,520
Xiang Yi,

901
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,320
do you think

902
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,320
what you said is always right?

903
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,320
It's all true.

904
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,120
The four ancient sects can't do without you.

905
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,120
Yes.

906
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,920
I've proven it all these years.

907
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,120
That's right.

908
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,520
In the four ancient sects,

909
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,120
no one can do it.

910
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,320
No one can.

911
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,120
Without Li Xiangyi,

912
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,120
it's not possible.

913
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,920
The world is too hasty.

914
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,120
Can't wait for the old days.

915
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,320
There are so many things to do.

916
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,320
Let's make a wish.

917
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,120
The world is too hasty.

918
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:39,320
The journey is long.

919
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,720
Who doesn't want to

920
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,320
have a walk?

921
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,520
The world is too hasty.

922
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,120
Can't wait for the old days.

923
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,520
There are so many things to do.

924
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,920
Let's make a wish.

925
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,720
The world is too hasty.

926
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:05,920
The journey is long.

927
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,920
Who doesn't want to

928
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,520
have a walk?
