YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Kissing myself thousands of times

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The most reluctant moment is that moment

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Live in the world

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A thousand miles of madness

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who doesn't follow the flow

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
On the edge of the cliff

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Live in the world

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
A thousand times of youthfulness

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not drunk like a grudge

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
A journey through the world

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Like a dream

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Live in the world

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
A thousand miles of madness

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Who doesn't follow the flow

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Who doesn't stand by the faraway clouds

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
On the edge of the cliff

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Live in the world

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
A thousand times of youthfulness

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm not drunk like a grudge

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
A journey through the world

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Like a dream

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000

Episode 16

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The Night Empress

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It turns out that

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I've been looking for the Night Empress for so long

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
She's actually in the palace

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It just helped me save some trouble

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Father, are you sure you didn't see it wrong?

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The pattern on the skin of the sculpture

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's completely different from the painting of the emperor

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The beginning of the Daxi Dynasty

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It was used as a palace in the previous dynasty

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So it has been built over and over again over the centuries

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The palace today

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's a lot different from a hundred years ago

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So the skin means

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's Mutan in the palace

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
If so

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The goal of the valley

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It must be in the palace

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I have the blood of the South Night Emperor and the current emperor

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What I'm planning is what I should belong to

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Is he looking for the Night Empress?

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
To kill the emperor

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Lord Fang

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I wonder if you can report to the emperor

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Let the Imperial Secretariat make an excuse in the palace

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Mr. Li

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Mr. Li

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Without solid evidence in hand

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The emperor will not believe this

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Even angry

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Instead, I think this is a rumor

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Because something similar happened many years ago

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's full of rain and wind

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
As a result, it's all a waste of time

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But this is a serious matter

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Isn't there any other way?

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I have some connections with the Imperial Secretariat

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I can only write to the Imperial Secretariat privately

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Let them be careful in secret

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm not worried about the security

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Lord Wang

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Do you have a way to send me to the palace?

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I must be in the mountains before I can't get there

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Find the Night Empress Mutang to stop her

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Young Master

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The secret agents went to investigate a few days ago

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Have you found out

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The secret agents are back

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That Wang Chunhua can indeed make people re-summon the golden bone

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Remove the hidden poison

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So to speak

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
There is no way to save her

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
According to the secret agents

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
There are two types of grass on the same tree

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The ten-leaf grass can repair the meridians

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Make people instantly full of vitality

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
But it will soon die

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Only the yin and yang grass can save people

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yin and yang grass at the same time

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The Qingyuan Alliance has been looking for the whereabouts of Wang Chunhua

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Because the Yang grass of Wang Chunhua is made of Yang and steel

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Compared with the Beifeng Baiyang practiced by Di Feisheng

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Di Feisheng wants to use the Yang grass

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
To break through the highest level of Beifeng Baiyang

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Di Feisheng

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What's wrong

95
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Did you find out where Wang Chunhua is

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Mr. Li

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Xiaobao told us

98
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Must keep you in Tianji Villa

99
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Wait for him to find you the medicine

100
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
He also wants us to tell you

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
There is nothing in this world that is not impossible without you

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So you have to live well

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Do you know where he went

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That boy just said he went to help you find the medicine

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
We don't know exactly where he went

106
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Mr. Li

107
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Now Fang Xiaobao is doing things in his heart

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You can rest assured to stay here and wait for him to come back

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I appreciate your kindness

110
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But the situation is urgent

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I need to enter the capital immediately

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I need to enter the capital immediately

113
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Fang Xiaobao is afraid to blame you

114
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I will explain to him later

115
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Mr. Li, I know in my heart

116
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
People like you

117
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Have your own persistence and choices in your heart

118
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Even if I force you to stay in Tianji Villa today

119
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You haven't finished your task in your heart

120
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The burden has not been released

121
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I will blame myself in the future

122
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm so angry

123
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I and Xiaohui are most reluctant to see heroes bow

124
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So I won't stop you

125
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Thank you

126
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Mr. Fang

127
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I don't know how you are doing before this

128
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Forget it

129
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I will go to the letter and set up for the capital

130
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
When you get to the capital

131
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Someone will arrange it

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Thank you

133
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I still have work to do

134
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I haven't been ordered to enter the capital for the time being

135
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Mr. Li, be careful

136
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Mr. Li, don't worry

137
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I will not leak your identity out of Tianji Villa

138
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Ok

139
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Goodbye

140
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Li Chong

141
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'll see you out

142
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
No need

143
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
See you later

144
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Be careful

145
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The trap must be half a inch deep

146
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes

147
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Go

148
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Go

149
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Stop fighting

150
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Stop fighting

151
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Stop fighting

152
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You are a little capable to get in here

153
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You are my son

154
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
But it's easy to get in and out of Wanshengdao

155
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's hard to get out

156
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Don't stand there

157
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Sit down and have a drink with me

158
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You want to get the flower

159
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
To save Li Xiangyi

160
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You used to want it

161
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Senior brother

162
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I don't want it

163
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I don't want it

164
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You used to want your senior brother

165
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
To attack me

166
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
To get into the martial arts world together

167
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Why do you want to kill him for your own ambitions?

168
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Ambition

169
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
All of this should belong to me

170
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But you call him ambitious

171
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That year, Li Xiangyi always wanted to suppress me

172
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And now I

173
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Even my own son

174
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I want to stand with him

175
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Just for these false things

176
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:29,580
You can force your brothers of the private

177
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
This Pacific Saint has nothing to do with me

178
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What I want is mine

179
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm the Pacific Saint of Shanggu Dao

180
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And you are my own flesh and blood

181
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I hope you can open up this land with me

182
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Everything in my future is yours

183
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I don't agree with what you did

184
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's impossible to stand with you

185
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But you are always my biological father

186
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I have a deep love for you

187
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
This wine

188
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I toast you

189
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Today, I cut my finger and gave you this gift

190
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
From now on

191
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I will be your brother

192
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I will be your brother

193
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Never see you again

194
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Great

195
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Since you are so heartless

196
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Don't blame me

197
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I have no heart

198
00:12:40,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Meng

199
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Master

200
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,840
Of course.

201
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,920
You got the

202
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:05,960
Seven-leaf Mountain and changed the

203
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,960
Qianjun Guiyuan Formation.

204
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,160
No one has been able to

205
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,600
break out alive.

206
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,880
He chose it himself.

207
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,320
He is the only family in the world.

208
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,320
I've been thinking about it.

209
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,440
And he

210
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,960
is still against me

211
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,400
in front of others.

212
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,760
If he can't get out of this formation,

213
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,400
it's the destiny of the heaven.

214
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,120
No wonder.

215
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:54,880
The

216
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,400
pm.

217
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,740
Zhang Zhen, eat his meat!

218
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,280
I'm waiting for the illusion to come back.

219
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,440
That's right.

220
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,960
It's an illusion.

221
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,840
I heard that you came here

222
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,920
for the famous doctor.

223
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,600
You can cure any disease.

224
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,880
That's right.

225
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,240
I have a distant brother.

226
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,360
When the Iron Armor Gate was being built,

227
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,800
the young master died.

228
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,440
This doctor saved him.

229
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,160
That's amazing.

230
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,000
Yeah.

231
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,200
You've thought about

232
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,120
the one queuing there?

233
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,360
They probably can't.

234
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:23,320
My

235
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,040
Dr Li.

236
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,840
The Achor hasğı

237
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,400
ordered me longer

238
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,200
from the capital

239
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,080
to promote

240
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,680
the exam work of Dr Li's doctors all over the world.

241
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,240
Dr. Li но

242
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,840
I believe that there will be news in the palace soon.

243
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,040
Lord Fang is indeed a man of great talent.

244
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,440
The imperial decree has arrived!

245
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,440
Physician Li,

246
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,240
it's the inner palace inside.

247
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,240
It's not far from that noble palace.

248
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,240
When we arrive,

249
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,640
we'll meet with other doctors

250
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,040
to discuss the matter with the noble lady.

251
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,040
May I ask, Eunuch Wang,

252
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,640
which noble lady is in good health?

253
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
Physician Li, please follow me.

254
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,440
Everyone,

255
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,640
this is the famous Physician Li

256
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,640
who has just arrived in the capital.

257
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,640
Nice to meet you.

258
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,240
Nice to meet you.

259
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,240
This is...

260
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,640
This is...

261
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,640
That's great.

262
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,440
Please wait for a while.

263
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,240
When the Western State Preceptor arrives,

264
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,240
we can go in and meet him together.

265
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,840
May I ask, Eunuch Wang,

266
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,240
who is the Western State Preceptor?

267
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,440
Why do we have to wait for him?

268
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,840
The Western State Preceptor is highly skilled in selection.

269
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,040
He is highly respected by the Empress Dowager.

270
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,840
Recently, he finally came to the Western State.

271
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,440
He has been a guest in our court.

272
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,240
It's our honor

273
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,240
to meet with the State Preceptor

274
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,440
to discuss the matter with the noble lady.

275
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,640
I see.

276
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,240
The Western State Preceptor is here.

277
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,440
It's actually the Wooden Sword and Wooden Song.

278
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,240
I've been looking for it for a long time.

279
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,640
It seems that the Wooden Sword is in the palace.

280
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,840
The Wooden Sword and Wooden Song

281
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,240
has actually deceived the Empress Dowager.

282
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,240
I have to deal with it first.

283
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,240
State Preceptor,

284
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,640
we've been waiting for you for a long time.

285
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,040
Since you're here,

286
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,640
the meeting will begin now.

287
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,640
Wait a moment.

288
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,640
Is it possible for any Zhang Shu

289
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,640
to enter the palace in the Western State?

290
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,440
State Preceptor, there may be some misunderstanding.

291
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,240
Mr. Li is the doctor of the Capital of Ming Dong.

292
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,440
The Empress Dowager sent him here.

293
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,840
His name is Li Lianhua.

294
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,840
It's not a few days

295
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,640
since he's been

296
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,440
making false rumors about the doctor.

297
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,240
Today, I'm here to have a meeting with him.

298
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,240
Are you looking at me

299
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,640
or the Western State?

300
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,240
The Western State Preceptor who is far away

301
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,640
will actually care about a person

302
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,040
who is so suspicious of the Jianghu.

303
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,840
Eunuch Wang,

304
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,840
Eunuch Wang,

305
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,240
did you read

306
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,440
the passbook of this person?

307
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,440
Can you check it carefully?

308
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,640
You are all

309
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,440
the distinguished guests invited by the Empress Dowager.

310
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,440
If there is any mistake in the past,

311
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,240
can you take it over

312
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,440
in front of the Empress Dowager?

313
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,440
It's more important to treat the Noble Lady.

314
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,040
It's impossible for me to

315
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,640
have a meeting with such a person.

316
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,440
If this person stays,

317
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,640
I'll take my leave.

318
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,840
Take care.

319
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,840
State Preceptor,

320
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,840
State Preceptor,

321
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,840
don't make it difficult for me.

322
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,440
Since State Preceptor and I can only keep one,

323
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,240
why don't we make a bet

324
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,240
who will stay and who will go?

325
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,640
What do you want to bet?

326
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,040
State Preceptor

327
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,440
is also here to treat the Noble Lady.

328
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,240
Why don't we bet

329
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,240
who can cure the illness of the Noble Lady?

330
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,440
If you want to bet, then bet.

331
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,640
I'm afraid of you.

332
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,840
But if you lose,

333
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,040
you have to add another one

334
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,700
to punish the other country's

335
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,040
unholy past.

336
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,040
Eunuch Wang,

337
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,640
take me to treat the Noble Lady.

338
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,640
Yes.

339
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,840
But...

340
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,240
Get out!

341
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,640
I don't want to see anyone!

342
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,040
I'm not going to see anyone.

343
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,040
I'm not going to see anyone!

344
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,440
State Preceptor,

345
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,440
State Preceptor, don't be anxious.

346
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,240
The Noble Lady has a strange disease.

347
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,840
She's in a coma and has a bad mood.

348
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,040
She doesn't want to see a doctor.

349
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,240
As long as she steps into the hall and wants to cure the illness,

350
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,440
she'll be beaten out.

351
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,240
It's okay.

352
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,040
Just treat her as she's learned.

353
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,240
Never!

354
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,640
Noble Lady is noble.

355
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,840
Don't offend her.

356
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,040
What's the point of not seeing a doctor?

357
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,440
Are you playing tricks on me?

358
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,440
Eunuch Wang,

359
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,640
why don't you let me try?

360
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,640
Mr. Li.

361
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,240
I learned the art of treating a doctor.

362
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,640
Like the night of the incense and the autumn,

363
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,840
you're the most polite.

364
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,640
You won't be hard on me, will you?

365
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,040
Come in.

366
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,640
Li Tianhua, it's really you.

367
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,640
Why are you here?

368
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,240
Your Highness, it's been a long time.

369
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,640
I'm here to see you.

370
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,040
You said that the Noble Lady has a disease.

371
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,240
How did you know it was me?

372
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,840
I didn't know it before.

373
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,840
But

374
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,840
I knew it was a trick

375
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,240
on the door.

376
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,440
Your Highness,

377
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,840
why are you pretending to be sick?

378
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,040
It's just a preventive measure.

379
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,840
Your Highness, you're pretending to be sick

380
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,840
to see a doctor

381
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,640
because you want the Empress Dowager to promise you

382
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,240
to go out and see Fang Xiaobang.

383
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,840
You're so smart.

384
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,840
You guessed it right.

385
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,840
But the Empress Dowager refused.

386
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,640
Instead, she hired a lot of doctors

387
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,240
to treat the patients.

388
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,240
I can't keep it anymore.

389
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,440
But you're here, Li Tianhua.

390
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,840
Go tell them

391
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,440
that I'm going out of the palace to treat the disease.

392
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,840
Let's go to see Fang Duobing right away.

393
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,640
Your Highness, don't worry.

394
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,840
I have some important things

395
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,040
to do in the palace.

396
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,640
I can't leave for now.

397
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,640
Come to see him?

398
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,040
Smart.

399
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,440
Recently,

400
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,840
several Jiangyang bandits

401
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,640
have been mixed up in the palace.

402
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,640
I have to

403
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,040
catch them.

404
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,840
It's cured. Come in.

405
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,640
Your Highness.

406
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,240
Eunuch Wang.

407
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,040
The doctor Li cured my disease.

408
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,640
I'm very hungry.

409
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,840
Tell the kitchen to make more food and drinks.

410
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,440
It's good that you're healthy.

411
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,840
I'll go prepare now.

412
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,840
I have to report to the Empress Dowager.

413
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,640
She must be happy.

414
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,840
Wait.

415
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,640
What else do you want to say?

416
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,240
I heard that someone bullied the doctor Li.

417
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,840
I'm stupid.

418
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,840
I didn't know that the one who was sick was the Princess.

419
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,240
I was reckless and offended you.

420
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,040
Li Tianhua and I are not a match.

421
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,240
We made a bet.

422
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,040
I hope you don't misunderstand.

423
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,240
A bet?

424
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,240
What bet?

425
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,040
I made a bet with her.

426
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,440
Whoever cures the Princess first,

427
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,840
the other one

428
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,240
will leave the palace.

429
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,440
Why hasn't the State Preceptor left the palace yet?

430
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,840
Eunuch Wang.

431
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,640
You're sending him out of the palace?

432
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,240
Who's going to drive my benefactor away?

433
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,440
Greetings, Your Highness.

434
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,840
Grandmother.

435
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,440
Grandmother.

436
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,640
Your legs are fine.

437
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,040
It's all thanks to the blood of the State Preceptor

438
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,840
that I got the medicine.

439
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,440
Your grandmother was on the bed.

440
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,240
She's been sitting for four or five years.

441
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,240
Finally, she can walk on the pulse.

442
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,040
Zhao Ling.

443
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,040
Are you feeling better?

444
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,440
Yes.

445
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,640
I'm cured by the doctor Li.

446
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,040
Then why did you drive the State Preceptor away?

447
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,040
I didn't drive him away.

448
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,840
He lost the bet.

449
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,640
He lost the bet.

450
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,640
He's not a shameless dog.

451
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,240
Of course he has to leave.

452
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,640
Your Highness.

453
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,240
I'll take my leave.

454
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,040
Don't worry, State Preceptor.

455
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,040
This is Mr. Li, right?

456
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,440
Greetings, Your Highness.

457
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,040
Please rise.

458
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,040
Zhao Ling's illness

459
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,440
has been cured.

460
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,840
It's all thanks to Mr. Li's help.

461
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,240
I thank you on behalf of His Majesty.

462
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,440
You're welcome, Your Highness.

463
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,440
A doctor's duty is just to do what he should do.

464
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,640
You're a kind-hearted man.

465
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,040
You two are both my benefactors.

466
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,240
I haven't repaid your kindness yet.

467
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,640
How can I leave you so soon?

468
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,240
I hope you can

469
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,040
consider my old woman's reputation

470
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,240
and not take the bet anymore.

471
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,840
Your Highness.

472
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,640
I'm just betting on State Preceptor.

473
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,240
Don't worry.

474
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,840
I'll still keep State Preceptor.

475
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,840
Thank you, Doctor Li.

476
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,240
His Majesty will hold a banquet tomorrow.

477
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,840
Please attend it.

478
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,640
It's an official thank you.

479
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,040
Please don't refuse.

480
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,240
It's my honor.

481
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,240
Thank you, Your Highness.

482
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,840
But Your Highness,

483
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,240
Her Highness's illness

484
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,240
needs to be cured for a while.

485
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,440
I'll take Her Highness to the palace

486
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,640
to find a place to ventilate.

487
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,440
Only then can she learn to read and sell.

488
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,840
Please be kind, Your Highness.

489
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,840
Yes, Grandmother.

490
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,240
My head still hurts.

491
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,040
In that case,

492
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,240
please listen to Mr. Li's arrangement.

493
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,040
If you need anything,

494
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,040
just tell them.

495
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,240
Thank you, Your Highness.

496
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,240
Li Lianhua,

497
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,840
that State Preceptor is a bad person.

498
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,040
But how did he cure Grandmother's leg?

499
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,040
There's a rare thing in the northwest

500
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,640
called the Golden Pillar.

501
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,040
It can be cut off and re-cured.

502
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,240
It's said to be a rare treasure.

503
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,040
I guess the State Preceptor

504
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,640
used this Pillar

505
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,040
to cure Her Highness's illness.

506
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,640
What do they want?

507
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,240
They even want to lose a national treasure.

508
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,040
The Imperial Treasury?

509
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,240
Grandmother always said that

510
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,840
the royal family spent money to buy the Imperial Treasury.

511
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,840
The Imperial Treasury must have a lot of treasures.

512
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,840
They're so bold.

513
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,840
Li Lianhua, you asked me to come out.

514
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,440
Did you think of how to catch them?

515
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,840
Your Highness is really smart.

516
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,440
Look.

517
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,240
This is the secret weapon of the Purple Silver Man.

518
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,640
It's said that

519
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,240
there's the same symbol in the palace.

520
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,040
Have you seen it before?

521
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,440
No.

522
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,840
But the palace is big.

523
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,440
It's possible that I didn't notice it.

524
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,840
How about this?

525
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,240
I'll take you to the palace.

526
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,240
You must catch these thieves.

527
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,040
Okay. Thank you, Your Highness.

528
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,440
It's so close.

529
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,640
I didn't take this sword as an illusion.

530
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,440
What a perfect formation.

531
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,240
Is this the Guiya Sword

532
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,240
that the Tian Daoist Master had?

533
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,840
Li Lianhua.

534
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,240
Is that symbol reliable?

535
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,840
I've searched the whole palace.

536
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,640
There's no other clue.

537
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,840
It seems that

538
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,440
there's no other clue.

539
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,640
But Your Highness,

540
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,440
have you found

541
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,440
any unusual people in the palace?

542
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,040
Xu Yanxiao is the bad guy.

543
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,840
What's wrong?

544
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,840
He's the governor of the Imperial City.

545
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,840
A few days ago,

546
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,440
he said that the imperial guards

547
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,040
and the unknown people were going to the palace.

548
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,240
I didn't leave any of the servants

549
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,240
who were in charge.

550
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,840
I think he's unusual.

551
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,640
Is there something wrong with Xu Yanxiao?

552
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,040
He's just a bit more strict.

553
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,640
There's nothing wrong with him.

554
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,840
That's not right.

555
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,640
The sun is almost setting.

556
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,840
I'm so tired.

557
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,840
Your Highness,

558
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,040
I think it's getting late.

559
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,840
Why don't you go back and rest?

560
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,040
Okay.

561
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,440
This is for you.

562
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,440
If you encounter any trouble,

563
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,840
take him to the Imperial Gate

564
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,040
and ask the commissioner for help.

565
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,240
He's a close friend of our family.

566
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,640
He'll help you.

567
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:16,840
I'm leaving.

568
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,040
Take care, Your Highness.

569
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,440
The imperial minister said that

570
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,840
there must be a lot of cases

571
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,840
that are related to this patient.

572
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,040
So he can only let me

573
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,240
see a strange person in the palace.

574
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,040
Mr. Li, long time no see.

575
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,840
You've only been in the private world.

576
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,040
I didn't expect to see you here.

577
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,840
Mr. Yang,

578
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,440
you've heard

579
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,240
what I said to the princess.

580
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,440
I did come to the palace for another reason.

581
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,840
But the Imperial City Bureau

582
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,840
knew about it.

583
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,640
So the warning you received

584
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,040
was from Mr. Li.

585
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,440
Since the ancient road

586
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,440
has been extended to the palace,

587
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,240
I can only solve it myself.

588
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,840
But Mr. Yang,

589
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,640
you're the supervisor.

590
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,040
Why are you here?

591
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,640
My family is the capital of the Imperial City Bureau.

592
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,240
I was transferred to the Imperial City Bureau a few days ago.

593
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,240
That's why Mr. Li told me to come.

594
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,840
But the suspect

595
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,240
has been taken away from the palace.

596
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,840
It was not dangerous at that time.

597
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,440
The Imperial City Bureau

598
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,440
has cleared a lot of cases.

599
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,840
But it's such a big trouble.

600
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,840
The west

601
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,840
has been suspicious

602
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,840
of the country of the west for a long time.

603
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,040
So the Wu Jian and the Demon Monks

604
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,840
have entered the palace very clearly.

605
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,240
The plan

606
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,040
must be related to the country.

607
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,040
I still need Mr. Yang to remind the supervisor again.

608
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,440
No need.

609
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,640
Master.

610
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,040
Master.

611
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,040
We are disciples in private.

612
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,040
Now we are in the palace.

613
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,040
Yes.

614
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,440
Greetings, Governor.

615
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,440
When is the day

616
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,240
when the palace is not in danger?

617
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,440
If everything is in vain,

618
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,040
I'm afraid the Imperial City Bureau

619
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,040
has been caught.

620
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,240
I didn't expect

621
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,840
the Imperial City Bureau

622
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,440
to be so reckless.

623
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,440
I knew the danger was at hand.

624
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,440
But I'd rather not go in.

625
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,840
I'm so sorry.

626
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,640
Mr. Li, you worry too much.

627
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,640
No matter what the purpose of the Western State Preceptor is,

628
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,840
as long as he doesn't do anything,

629
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,640
he is still a preceptor.

630
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,240
He is the emperor's superior.

631
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,240
Just like Mr. Li.

632
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,840
He is a doctor in the palace.

633
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,640
Just be a good doctor.

634
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,440
Don't worry about other things.

635
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,640
The defense in the palace is very good.

636
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,440
Everything is under my control.

637
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,640
You are not a doctor.

638
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,840
Yun Chun,

639
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,040
send Mr. Li back to his room.

640
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,240
Governor.

641
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,840
Do you remember

642
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,040
the Mid-Autumn Festival banquet in the palace ten years ago?

643
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,640
It's really Meiji.

644
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,240
Who dares to come to the palace and tell me?

645
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,440
The Tang Pahui is indeed a well-known legend.

646
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,840
I'm leaving.

647
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,040
You broke into the imperial city that year.

648
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,040
The real master of the Western State Preceptor

649
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,440
is Wan Shen Dao Shan Gu Dao.

650
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,840
He is the first emperor of the Western State Preceptor.

651
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,640
He is the master of the great Wan Shen Dao.

652
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,640
Governor.

653
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,240
If you do something bad,

654
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,040
I'm afraid you will only fall into the lower realm.

655
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,440
So you are Li Xiangyi.

656
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,640
Although I haven't left the palace for decades,

657
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,640
I have heard about your name.

658
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,440
You were dead ten years ago.

659
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,840
Ten years later, you came back to life

660
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,440
and ran into the palace to slander Wan Shen Dao and Shan Gu Dao.

661
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,440
What's your purpose?

662
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,040
I don't want to get used to being slandered by you.

663
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,000
It seems that the rumors around you

664
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,640
are so honest.

665
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,640
Wan Shen Dao spent all these years

666
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,840
working for the court.

667
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,000
He was very loyal.

668
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,040
Shan Gu Dao helped out analey bitch.

669
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,640
He was a bad guy

670
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,840
who saved me from the Xuan Xuan family.

671
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,840
You instead

672
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,840
I won't kill you, considering you are the Empress Dowager's guest.

673
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,840
Don't let me catch you.

674
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,840
Otherwise, the prison of the Imperial City Bureau

675
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,840
will be more suitable for the Li family.

676
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,840
A master like Xuan Yin Xiao is not a good person.

677
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,840
Senior Brother's plan is really important.

678
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,840
It seems that there is only one way to stop Senior Brother.

679
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,840
Tomorrow night, we must get the royal star.

680
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,840
Today is a family banquet to thank the State Preceptor and Mr. Li.

681
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,840
No need to be so courteous. Just drink.

682
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:16,840
Your Majesty, the Western Regions are beautiful and beautiful.

683
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,840
Your Majesty is the King of Heaven.

684
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,840
You are very talented.

685
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,840
Your Majesty is the King of Heaven.

686
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,840
I must toast to Your Majesty for this first cup.

687
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,840
This is my fortune, not my credit.

688
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,840
Thank you, State Preceptor.

689
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,840
Toast to Your Majesty.

690
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,840
I will toast to the Empress Dowager for the second cup.

691
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,840
Toast to the Empress Dowager for the third wedding.

692
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,840
I and Zhao Lin are in the second wedding.

693
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,840
Why the third wedding?

694
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,840
Half a month ago, the Empress Dowager and I discussed

695
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,840
about building a temple in the palace.

696
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,840
Now everything is ready.

697
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,840
As long as Your Majesty and the Empress Dowager agree,

698
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,840
today we can build a temple.

699
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,840
Mother, why are you suddenly building a temple?

700
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,840
I am just a former servant of Emperor Guang Qing a hundred years ago.

701
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,840
I am just a former servant of Emperor Guang Qing a hundred years ago.

702
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,840
A hundred years ago, Emperor Guang Qing built a temple in the palace

703
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,840
to give birth to a prince.

704
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,840
The palace records are not recorded.

705
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,840
And the temple is not there.

706
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,840
This is just a legend.

707
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,840
Mother, you don't have to take it seriously.

708
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:41,840
Since it's a legend, it might be true.

709
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,840
Although Emperor Guang Qing is still young,

710
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,840
Zhao Lin is the only daughter of the Western Regions.

711
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,840
It's a big trouble.

712
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,840
How can I not be anxious?

713
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,840
Alright, I'll listen to you.

714
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,840
Call.

715
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:09,840
Call the black tower craftsman to the hall.

716
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,840
Greetings, Your Majesty.

717
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,840
Please rise.

718
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,840
Thank you, Your Majesty.

719
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,840
Your Majesty,

720
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,840
this is the map of the black tower

721
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,840
that the soldiers from Lan Zhu are learning.

722
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,840
Please take a look.

723
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,840
I am afraid that the black tower is not the one

724
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,840
that you are looking for.

725
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,840
I have already got it.

726
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,840
I will go find it.

727
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,840
Go.

728
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,840
It's indeed a harmonious auspicious tower.

729
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,840
Are you the soldiers that State Preceptor ordered?

730
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,840
Why do I look familiar?

731
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,840
Your Majesty,

732
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,840
I am a descendant of the Wansheng Dao.

733
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,840
When I was in a panic,

734
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,840
I donated some money and food.

735
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,840
I was fortunate to receive Your Majesty's invitation and reward.

736
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,840
Your Majesty,

737
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,840
these are the soldiers that State Preceptor ordered

738
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,840
to recruit from Lan Zhu.

739
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,840
I think that

740
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,840
His Majesty and Her Majesty will be satisfied.

741
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,840
No wonder you are so kind.

742
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,840
You are indeed a man of great merit.

743
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,840
If that is the case,

744
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,840
then you can choose a place

745
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,840
in the palace to build a tower.

746
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,840
It seems that the plan of the ancient swordsman is like this.

747
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,840
I will just build a tower and look for the black tower.

748
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,840
It will be easier to find the black tower in the palace.

749
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,840
Your Majesty,

750
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,840
I think that there is something wrong.

751
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,840
The Imperial Palace is the most important place.

752
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,840
Isn't building a black tower

753
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,840
the main thing?

754
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,840
Moreover,

755
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,840
if the black tower is built outside the city wall,

756
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,840
then it is more suitable.

757
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,840
The world is vast.

758
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:22,840
Why would it be built in this palace?

759
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,840
You go first.

760
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,840
I will go first.

761
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,840
What you said makes sense.

762
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,840
Your Majesty,

763
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,840
it is fine to build an ordinary black tower,

764
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,840
but the black tower that we built

765
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:45,700
must have a

766
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,840
Liu Guang She.

767
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,840
Liu Guang She?

768
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,840
The late emperor was stolen Liu Guang She?

769
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,840
Exactly, Your Majesty.

770
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,840
This treasure is

771
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,840
bought by us from Lan Zhu

772
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,840
with a lot of money.

773
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,840
Knowing its importance,

774
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,840
I came to present it to Your Majesty.

775
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,840
Bring it up.

776
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,840
What treasure is this?

777
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,840
Father is so happy.

778
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,840
This treasure is the most important treasure of the late emperor.

779
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,840
When I was in the palace,

780
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,840
the west was in a bad situation for ten years.

781
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,840
It was not in good condition.

782
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,840
This treasure is very useful.

783
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,840
As for the construction of the tower in the palace,

784
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,840
it will be like the late emperor's.

785
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,840
It will protect the people of the west.

786
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,840
The late emperor was so sad

787
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,840
when the treasure was stolen.

788
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,840
Today,

789
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,840
it is a good sign to get it back.

790
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,840
Alright.

791
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,840
I allow you to

792
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,840
make a choice in the palace.

793
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,840
Build the Jixiang Tower immediately.

794
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,840
Put this treasure in the tower.

795
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,840
We will not let you down.

796
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,840
This is a great thing.

797
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,840
Your Majesty,

798
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,840
building the tower with a choice

799
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,840
is a right choice.

800
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,840
If there are too many people,

801
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,840
it will disturb the spirit.

802
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,840
Doctor Li is a precious guest.

803
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,840
Please allow her to

804
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,840
stay outside the palace.

805
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,840
Your Majesty,

806
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,840
I know some tricks.

807
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,840
It is a good thing

808
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,840
to choose a person with you.

809
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,840
I may not need to go out of the palace.

810
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,840
Doctor Li just said

811
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,840
it was not appropriate to see her in the palace.

812
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,840
Now you say that.

813
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,840
I think you are playing tricks on His Majesty.

814
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,840
Of course I dare not.

815
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,840
But I really want to help.

816
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,840
You are a foreign guest.

817
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,840
You are so sincere to help His Majesty.

818
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,840
As a citizen of Daxi,

819
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,840
you should be more careful.

820
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,840
Doctor Li,

821
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,840
you dare to say that in front of His Majesty.

822
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,840
I think you have a very deep

823
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,840
knowledge of mystery.

824
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,840
How about this?

825
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,840
You can use mystery to calculate

826
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,840
how many pieces of crystal are in my pouch.

827
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,840
I think this kind of trick

828
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,840
is a gift for you.

829
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,840
You can calculate it.

830
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,840
You can use mystery in front of my father.

831
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,840
It is rude.

832
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,840
It is okay.

833
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,840
It should not be a big deal.

834
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,840
But it is a mystery.

835
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,840
It is too obvious

836
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,840
to guess the jade pearl.

837
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,840
It is better to guess something bigger

838
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,840
to be more obvious.

839
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,840
I am sorry.

840
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,840
I will calculate your recent

841
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,840
concern about the star.

842
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,840
Okay.

843
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,840
Doctor Li, please start.

844
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,840
The way I start the star

845
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,840
is different.

846
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,840
It is called the flower-shifting star.

847
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,840
Please pick a flower.

848
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,840
The flower that His Majesty has folded

849
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,840
has not bloomed yet.

850
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,840
It is the image of water.

851
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,840
The recent concern of His Majesty

852
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,840
is that the water is bad.

853
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,840
The great Han of Yuzhou

854
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,840
is worried about this.

855
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,840
This is the most important thing

856
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,840
in the world.

857
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,840
I think it is a good thing.

858
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,840
I think it is a good thing.

859
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,840
I think it is a good thing.

860
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,840
I think it is a good thing.

861
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,840
I think it is a good thing.

862
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,840
This is something that everyone in the world knows.

863
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,840
What Doctor Li said

864
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,840
is the magic of the world.

865
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,840
I only said the beginning

866
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,840
and not the end.

867
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,840
Please look.

868
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,840
The inner ring of this flower bag has formed.

869
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,840
It can bloom in less than ten days.

870
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,840
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

871
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,840
Your Majesty,

872
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,840
the matter of the worry is soon to be resolved.

873
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,840
Report!

874
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,840
Your Majesty,

875
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,840
an urgent report from Yuzhou.

876
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:36,840
Yesterday, the sky fell and the drought was resolved.

877
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,840
Doctor Li is so capable.

878
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,840
I admire him.

879
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,840
Okay, from today on,

880
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,840
Doctor Li will be promoted to the imperial tutor in the palace.

881
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,840
Yes.

882
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,840
Yes.

883
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,840
I am here.

884
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,840
I am here.

885
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,840

00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,840
I am here.

00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,840
I am here.

891
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,840
I am here.

892
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,840
I am here.

893
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,840
I am here.

894
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,840
I am here.

895
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,840
I am here.

896
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,840
I am here.

897
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,840
I am here.

898
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,840
I am here.

899
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,840
I am here.

900
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,840
I am here.

901
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,840
I am here.

902
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,840
I am here.

903
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,840
I am here.

904
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,840
I am here.

905
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,840
I am here.

00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,840
I am here.

907
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,840
I am here.

908
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,840
I am here.

909
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,840
I am here.

910
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,840
I am here.

911

I am here.

913
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,840
I am here.

914
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,840
I am here.

915
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,840
I am here.

00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,840
I am here.

922
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,840
I am here.

923
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,840
I am here.

924
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,840

926
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,840

927
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,840

928
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,840
I am here.

929
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,840
I am here.

930
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,840
I am here.

931
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,840
I am here.

932
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,840
I am here.

933
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,840
I am here.

934
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,840
I am here.

935
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,840
I am here.

936
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,840
I am here.

937
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,840
