Miss claro

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,900
I used to read about Tom and Jerry

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,180
Not long ago, our eyes met

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:23,480
Miss claro

I'm sorry.

22
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm sorry.

94
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm sorry.

95
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm sorry.

96
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm sorry.

98
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm sorry.

101
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
My Young Master Violet.

103
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,980
We sent out a delegation of our

104
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,100
spy team.

105
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:14,160
You won't believe what we discovered.

106
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,640
It is inspector Fang and Xiao Ye.

107
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,460
This is SeniorSPEAKING Director.

108
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,240
Get out of the way.

109
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,240
Go.

110
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,600
Do you not know that?

111
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
Out of my way?

112
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Guanyin Hammer.

113
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Give me the Guanyin Hammer.

114
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
You want to die?

115
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,600
You want to die?

116
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
I want to die.

117
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,600
I want to die.

118
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
I want to die.

119
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,600
I want to die.

120
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
It's rare for someone to catch me.

121
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,600
But it's a pity.

122
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
So this is what you want.

123
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Goodbye.

124
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
I don't want it.

125
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
I don't want it.

126
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
I don't want it.

127
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,600
I said, it's you, Gu Xiaoye.

128
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,600
I don't want it.

129
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Guanyin Hammer didn't keep its name.

130
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
It finally got its money.

131
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
But it's not worth it.

132
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,600
I hope I can use the Suogu skill to hide the identity.

133
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Li Xiangyi, I'll go with you.

134
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
It's been ten years.

135
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,600
How are you, Li Xiangyi?

136
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Chief Di,

137
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,600
you're still so annoying after ten years.

138
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
So you recognized me in the stomach.

139
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
What else?

140
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
I want to fight with you every day for ten years.

141
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
But they said you were dead.

142
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,600
I'm not dead. Why are you so happy?

143
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Sorry, I'll excuse myself.

144
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
I have to go back and cook.

145
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Go.

146
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Why do you have only one skill left?

147
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,600
You hit my Mingyue Chen Xihai.

148
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
I also hit your Beifeng Cui Bahuang.

149
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,600
It's normal to get hurt.

150
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,600
I have 60% of the power before I took Guanyin Hammer.

151
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
What have you done in these ten years?

152
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
To be honest,

153
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
I've been busy these ten years.

154
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
I'm busy taking care of myself.

155
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,600
I'm busy living a good life.

156
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,600
And I also learned to cook.

157
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Cook?

158
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Yes, cook.

159
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
It's good.

160
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,600
Li Xiangyi, the chief of the four sects,

161
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,600
is the first person in the martial arts world.

162
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
It's been ten years.

163
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
How can you do such a boring thing?

164
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Chief Di, you're so insolent.

165
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,600
This Chai Mi You Yan is harder than practicing martial arts.

166
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,600
I tell you,

167
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
cooking is even harder.

168
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,600
While cooking a good dish,

169
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,600
the quality of it is very good.

170
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
If you don't believe me, try it.

171
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
I don't want to listen to your nonsense.

172
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
Go with me to find the medicine now.

173
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Wait.

174
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
If the tonic is really useful,

175
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,600
why do you use the bone-in tool to find Guanyin Hammer?

176
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,600
It's useless.

177
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,600
Moreover,

178
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,600
I'm too lazy to use it now.

179
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
Besides,

180
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
I'm pretty good now.

181
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
You're younger than before.

182
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,600
I really didn't expect that you lived like a dog for ten years.

183
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,600
You're a dog.

184
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,600
You want to be a loser?

185
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Okay, I'll grant you.

186
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
I'll take you to the Baichuan Courtyard now.

187
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
Let your subordinates see

188
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,600
what Li Xiangyi has become in the four sects.

189
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
If you don't want dignity,

190
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,600
I'll make you have no dignity.

191
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,600
Slow down, slow down.

192
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
No, no.

193
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
I'm going to throw up.

194
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,600
Throw up?

195
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,600
I just lied to you to stop.

196
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,600
You flew too high.

197
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,600
The inner force will fall badly.

198
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
What do you mean?

199
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,600
My inner force?

200
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
Don't try it.

201
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,600
The inner force is sealed.

202
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,600
I'm going to throw up.

203
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
I'm going to throw up.

204
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,600
I'm going to throw up.

205
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
I'm going to throw up.

206
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
I'm going to throw up.

207
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
I'm going to throw up.

208
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,600
I'm going to throw up.

209
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,600
Guanyin Hammer.

210
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,600
Smart.

211
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,600
You poisoned me.

212
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
Don't come over.

213
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
This gentleman doesn't fight.

214
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
It's a pomegranate in a grave.

215
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,600
Three secret pomegranate trees in Nanying.

216
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
Not bad.

217
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
The leader of the enemy is really good at it.

218
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
The one in the tomb,

219
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Princess Nanying,

220
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,600
is not suitable for the body for a hundred years.

221
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
She's the one who has pomegranate in her body.

222
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Just now,

223
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,600
I took a little grass from her.

224
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,600
I put it in this Guanyin Hammer.

225
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
This thing is blood-sucking.

226
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Now the pomegranate has sealed your meridians.

227
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Li Xiangyi.

228
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,600
Did you calculate all this long ago?

229
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,600
I just went to Yucheng.

230
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
I knew you weren't dead.

231
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,600
Then you must find a medicine to heal your wounds after you leave the coffin.

232
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
I only have this Guanyin Hammer.

233
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,600
I heard some old stories before.

234
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
This Guanyin Hammer is the burial of Prince Fang.

235
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
You said it's a coincidence.

236
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,600
There are some strange things happened in Putu Mountain.

237
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Then I want to go out and meet luck.

238
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
Have some fun.

239
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
I didn't expect that

240
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
I would see a child carrying a big knife.

241
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
This famous man has a bad temper.

242
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
It's been so many years.

243
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
You still haven't done it.

244
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
I still can't see it.

245
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
Li Xiangyi.

246
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
You don't practice kung fu.

247
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,600
You have a better skill.

248
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Master.

249
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,600
You want to kill me with pomegranate.

250
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Before that,

251
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
do you believe I'll kill you first?

252
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,600
You think too much.

253
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,600
I just want to ask you for help.

254
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
You threatened me.

255
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
How could I threaten you?

256
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
We didn't meet each other on the first day.

257
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
I don't know you.

258
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,600
You are the least threatened.

259
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Well,

260
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,600
let's talk about it later.

261
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
After the ceremony,

262
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
I'll give you a gift.

263
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Wash the gold and water with the blood.

264
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Your master's best skill?

265
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Yes.

266
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,600
This skill can reverse the heart.

267
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
It can remove the pomegranate from the body.

268
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
It can restore your inner power.

269
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Of course,

270
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
if you don't agree,

271
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,600
you can't force it.

272
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,600
You can just use the knife to kill me.

273
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
What's the plan?

274
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
It's simple.

275
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
First,

276
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,600
you keep the secret of my identity.

277
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Second,

278
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,600
where is my brother's remains?

279
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
I thought you wanted me to disband the Golden-Pomegranate.

280
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Or not to hurt the people in the martial arts world.

281
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
First, I can help you.

282
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
You can help yourself.

283
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
I don't care.

284
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
I can't help you with the second thing.

285
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Your brother died for ten years.

286
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
The martial arts world is in chaos for ten years.

287
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
I can't find his body.

288
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
That year, the Golden-Pomegranate Alliance

289
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
killed my brother and took his remains.

290
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
I fought with you in the East China Sea.

291
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,600
For ten years,

292
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,600
I've been looking for his remains.

293
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,600
But I never found it.

294
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
With your power,

295
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,600
you can summon the Golden-Pomegranate Alliance

296
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
to investigate the old things

297
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,600
and help me find my brother.

298
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,600
It's impossible for your brother to be eaten by a wild dog.

299
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
You want me to kill all the wild dogs

300
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
to find your brother's bones?

301
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
If so,

302
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,600
I'm afraid I have to say goodbye to your high-level martial arts.

303
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
Li Xiangyi.

304
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Do you really think I won't try my best to force you to detoxify?

305
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Yes.

306
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
Of course you will.

307
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
You know I'm dying.

308
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
You know I'm dying.

309
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,600
You're a person who wants to die.

310
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
What's the point of doing this?

311
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Don't waste your time.

312
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Otherwise, I haven't found my brother yet.

313
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,600
If I die,

314
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
you'll waste your energy.

315
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,600
Wu Yan, I'm here to see you.

316
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Which martial artist has checked the body of the dead man

317
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,600
who stabbed him ten years ago?

318
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
Master,

319
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,600
the martial artist in the Alliance

320
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
is the best at soul-losing skills.

321
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
He must have done what you asked him to do.

322
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
Where is he now?

323
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,600
The battle ten years ago

324
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
was closed by the Golden-Eagle Alliance.

325
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,600
The identity of the martial artist

326
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
has long disappeared and has been hidden in the martial world.

327
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
I'm afraid I can't find him.

328
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
I'm afraid I can't find him.

329
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
I'm afraid I can't find him.

330
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
I'm afraid I can't find him.

331
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,600
But I remember that

332
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,600
when the soul-losing soul was young,

333
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,600
it was adopted by the monk of Pudu Temple.

334
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
Maybe he went back to Pudu Temple

335
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
after he left the Alliance.

336
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
Master, do you want me to check it out?

337
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
No need.

338
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,600
Pudu Temple, Baichuan Hospital, Tongshan.

339
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
I'll go there myself.

340
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
Don't mention this to anyone else.

341
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
Tell the Alliance that I have something to deal with.

342
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
Tell them not to bother me.

343
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Yes.

344
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
Let's go, Pudu Temple.

345
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,600
You don't dare to go?

346
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,600
Are you afraid that the subordinates of Baichuan Hospital

347
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
will see you like this?

348
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,600
No.

349
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
Before I leave,

350
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
I have to take someone with me.

351
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
Fang Dubin?

352
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,600
Smart.

353
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
You're really troublesome now.

354
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
I'm afraid I can't find him.

355
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
You're troublesome.

356
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
I'm going.

357
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
Fang Dubin.

358
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
Fang Dubin.

359
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
Lin Tianhua.

360
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
Are you okay?

361
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
Don't be agitated.

362
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
Don't worry.

363
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,600
I'm fine.

364
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
I'm good at escaping.

365
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600
This bastard.

366
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
He's so good at martial arts.

367
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,600
By the way,

368
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,600
where's that little thing?

369
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,600
Where is he?

370
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,600
He's gone.

371
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,600
He's gone?

372
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
What about the spring?

373
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,600
Hurry up and chase him.

374
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
Don't be agitated.

375
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
Don't be agitated.

376
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
Your injury hasn't healed yet.

377
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
I've told you.

378
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,600
He took you away.

379
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
This bastard.

380
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,600
He's trying to plan all this.

381
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
He's trying to plan all this.

382
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,600
Actually,

383
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,600
he's trying to cure his illness.

384
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,600
So,

385
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,600
I used this Guan Yin Hammer

386
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,600
to make him never do evil again.

387
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
He agreed.

388
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,600
That simple?

389
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,600
It's not simple at all.

390
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
I was so upset

391
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,600
to convince him.

392
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,600
But that bastard

393
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,600
is a man of promise.

394
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,600
He's just a little rude.

395
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
What are you going to do?

396
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,600
Without Guan Yin Hammer,

397
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,600
your heart is...

398
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,600
It's not a big deal.

399
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,600
It's been so many years.

400
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,600
It's just a passing by.

401
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,600
Don't worry.

402
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,600
He won't die.

403
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,600
Since you can convince that bastard

404
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
to stop hurting people,

405
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
you can take all this

406
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,600
and you'll know.

407
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
You're a little narrow-minded.

408
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
Don't worry.

409
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,600
I've already thought of you as my partner.

410
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
Even if you're anxious,

411
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,600
you can find a way to get the world back.

412
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,600
I'll help you find it.

413
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,600
As for

414
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
whether you think I'm your partner,

415
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
I don't care.

416
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,600
What can I do if I don't recognize you?

417
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
I can't get rid of you anyway.

418
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
Here.

419
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
Listen.

420
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:24,140
Now that the entrance of the

421
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,420
The

422
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
Who's the person who got it?

423
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
He's one of us.

424
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,600
He's the one with the iron head suit

425
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
and the iron head slave with his head on it.

426
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,600
Do you remember?

427
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,600
Iron head slave?

428
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,600
No wonder he looks so cold.

429
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,600
When did Iron Head become one of us?

430
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,600
His name is Fei.

431
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,600
He's from the South.

432
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,600
I met him many years ago.

433
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,540
Later, he was caught by the

434
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,600
spy of the disguise.

435
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
He was taken as an iron head slave.

436
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,600
He's really pitiful.

437
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,600
I

438
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,600
thought he was homeless.

439
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,600
So

440
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
I'm going to take him for a while.

441
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
You can take this

442
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,600
to the night club.

443
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
I'll take him to the temple

444
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,600
to find another girl.

445
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,600
You talk too much.

446
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
Who are you scolding?

447
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
You're so rude.

448
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
What's the good in being with him?

449
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,600
It's not your identity.

450
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,600
No.

451
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,600
You must set the rules.

452
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,600
Who are you?

453
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,600
I'm hungry.

454
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,600
Let's go back and eat something delicious.

455
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
Wait for me.

456
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,600
Slow down.

457
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,600
Wait for me.

458
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,600
I'm hungry.

459
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,600
What should I eat?

460
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,600
Chief Feng,

461
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
ask your master

462
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
if I, the head slave,

463
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,600
can be with him.

464
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
Luomuoding.

465
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,600
Isn't it Luomuoding?

466
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Di Fesheng is Di Fesheng.

467
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
He broke a grave when he touched it.

468
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
The Saintess is really good at scheming.

469
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,600
Even the best Di Fesheng in the world

470
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,600
was fooled by you.

471
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,960
The

472
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Master must be very happy

473
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
to see Luomuoding.

474
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,600
The two families are united

475
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,600
and the wedding will be a success.

476
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,160
Let's have a fresh start.

477
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,600
Okay?

478
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,560
Who are you?

479
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,120
The look in your eyes

480
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,400
is the most odd as a。」

481
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,480
I swear to you.

482
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,480
You...

483
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,000
habitually

484
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,240
showing you the best,

485
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,640
I'm telling you, Si Dakhuang.

486
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,560
You have a good foundation.

487
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,960
Why don't you call me master?

488
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,520
Call me master

489
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,120
so that I can teach you

490
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,680
so that you won't get beaten up every day.

491
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You're not that brave

492
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,280
in martial arts.

493
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:38,880
Ridiculous.

494
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,680
My master is the leader of the four ancient sects

495
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,360
of the Wei Zhen Wulin, Li Xiangyi.

496
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,320
You're the number one disciple in the world.

497
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,520
Just enjoy it.

498
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,120
He even has a disciple.

499
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,600
It seems that his brain is broken

500
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,200
to accept a bad student like you.

501
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,840
Don't be stubborn.

502
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,360
Let's talk about it after you win your master.

503
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,080
I'm not hungry.

504
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,240
Let's eat.

505
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,120
Li Lianhua,

506
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,400
are you really going to

507
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,520
keep him in Lotus Pavilion?

508
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,840
Let me remind you.

509
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,880
Si Dakhuang

510
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,720
has a good foundation.

511
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,720
He will get you into trouble.

512
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,960
You're so talkative.

513
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,920
What's the smell?

514
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,960
What's this?

515
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,960
You're studying new vegetables again?

516
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,760
The braised salmon I made for you yesterday

517
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,960
was very good, right?

518
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,880
That dish is already very delicious.

519
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,400
Of course I have to study new vegetables.

520
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,960
I'll go pick some green onions outside.

521
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:49,700
Bring me the

522
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,600
green onions.

523
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,000
It smells so good.

524
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,360
Si Dakhuang,

525
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,240
do you want to try

526
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,360
the new vegetables made by Li Lianhua?

527
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,320
If you dare to

528
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,560
eat it up in one go,

529
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,840
I'll give you a hard time.

530
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,600
You must not

531
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,720
return your hand today.

532
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,920
Okay.

533
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,640
No.

534
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,200
You...

535
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,240
You finished eating?

536
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,240
This is a three-day meal.

537
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:32,840
It's her.

538
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,920
She ate it all by herself.

539
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:37,960
No.

540
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:39,760
It's her.

541
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,640
It's her.

542
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,520
It's her.

543
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,440
It's her.

544
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,360
It's her.

545
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,160
It's her.

546
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:44,840
It's her.

547
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,720
It's her.

548
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,600
It's her.

549
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,440
It's her.

550
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,120
It's her.

551
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:48,920
It's her.

552
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,640
It's her.

553
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,520
Didn't you say you didn't have taste?

554
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,280
I've always been a rice eater.

555
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,480
I eat the same thing.

556
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,680
Listen,

557
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,800
I'm not your foodie.

558
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,760
Xu Nan, are you eating or not?

559
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,200
Are you trying to praise me?

560
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,480
You asked me to eat.

561
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,280
I...

562
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,960
This is

563
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,360
30 yuan.

564
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,080
Take a break.

565
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,680
There's only one living room upstairs.

566
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,360
Come and go first.

567
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,320
The second floor is the biggest.

568
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,240
It's for you to live together.

569
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,160
Impossible.

570
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,280
Hurry up.

571
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,920
Hurry up.

572
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,720
Hurry up.

573
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,360
Hurry up.

574
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,080
Hurry up.

575
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,680
Be careful.

576
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,760
Don't let the fire go out.

577
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,480
It's dangerous.

578
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,120
Be careful.

579
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,160
Be careful.

580
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,040
Don't let the fire go out.

581
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,560
Yes.

582
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,320
Be careful.

583
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,120
Don't let the fire go out.

584
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,040
Don't let the fire go out.

585
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,640
expected

586
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,520
Attendant J.

587
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,280
Kaven and Qingyi

588
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,960
met at night.

589
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,880
I'm here.

590
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,160
Master,

591
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,320
it's the news of Yinpin striving.

592
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,040
I knew you'd sent it to you at once.

593
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,240
I didn't dare to be late.

594
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,880
A Ge Pan is work under my wing.

595
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,920
However, the young master of Tianji Hall, Mr. Fang,

596
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,480
and the owner of Lotus Pavilion, Li Lianhua,

597
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,360
have found out the truth.

598
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,600
They are on their way to the White-Wall Courtyard

599
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,800
to take the throne.

600
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,920
He should take the responsibility.

601
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,560
It's Li Lianhua again.

602
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,280
I met Di Feisheng, who had been hiding for ten years,

603
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,600
before.

604
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,640
Now I meet

605
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,880
Poxi Ling, who took away Guanyin Shui Lei.

606
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,680
What role

607
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,240
does Li Lianhua play?

608
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,160
I'm looking for someone to secretly watch over Lotus Pavilion.

609
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,480
Don't waste your time here.

610
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,800
Isn't he coming?

611
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,680
There's a chance to investigate him.

612
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,320
Inform me when he arrives at the White-Wall Courtyard.

613
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,240
Yes.

614
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,640
We should listen to the master's arrangement

615
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,960
and let the young masters

616
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,960
watch over the action of the Golden Abyss Alliance.

617
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,320
Di Feisheng took Guanyin Shui Lei.

618
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,160
I'm afraid

619
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,160
there will be another storm in the world.

620
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,880
The King's Avatar

621
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,880
Episode 16

622
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:58,960
What are you doing?

623
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,520
Are you playing a trick?

624
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,200
You even wear a mask.

625
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,560
Li Lianhua said you dare not show your true face.

626
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,680
Why do I believe it?

627
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,320
You're so arrogant.

628
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,600
Are you afraid of people?

629
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,640
Why are you so slow?

630
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,960
Do we still have to climb up the White-Wall Courtyard?

631
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,360
I can't.

632
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,080
Take someone up there first.

633
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,440
I'll ask Fei to take me to the Pudu Temple

634
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,480
to have a rest.

635
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,240
You're too weak.

636
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,360
Eat some meat to nourish your body.

637
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,760
It's been more than ten days.

638
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,160
You don't even have a meat soup.

639
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,760
Zi Da Huang.

640
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,120
Take him to the Pudu Temple to have a rest.

641
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,760
And burn a incense for yourself.

642
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,200
Thank him for blessing you to live until now.

643
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,760
Go. Go. Go.

644
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,040
Go.

645
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,240
With the power of Yang Zhou Man,

646
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,640
you won't have to climb such a mountain.

647
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,120
I can't walk anymore.

648
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,160
Come on, pull me.

649
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,200
You lost to me in the East Sea War ten years ago.

650
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,040
The four ancient gates collapsed.

651
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,360
You're in a state of shock.

652
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,720
I was wrong about you.

653
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,960
Life is impermanent.

654
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,800
It's entangled and meaningless.

655
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:15,760
Look.

656
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,680
The scenery is beautiful now.

657
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,240
You can think of me as having nothing to ask for.

658
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,760
I just want to find my senior's body now.

659
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,840
We'll go separate ways later.

660
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,520
You go to investigate the whereabouts of the four monks of Pudu Temple.

661
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,040
I'll go and see if there are any records on the list.

662
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:33,920
Thank you.

663
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,640
Come on, pull me.

664
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,840
I really can't walk anymore.

665
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,280
Does this watch still work?

666
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,280
You ask yourself that before you went here,

667
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,720
why there are only those men in the temple.

668
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,600
I've just been told that

669
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,760
the leadership of the relaxation order is to ensure

670
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,920
a good life for all announcement monks

671
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,640
and soooo many good route report.

672
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,920
Ifспоs and sanking clamps

673
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,600
my orders,

674
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,420
as for floods and lightnings,

675
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,380
My dad

676
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,380
Såbu

677
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:37,020
pe vi

678
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,020
You've been through so much.

679
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,620
No matter how good your cultivation is,

680
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,380
you've been abandoned by your three-storied fire.

681
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,860
Do you know your condition?

682
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,220
That's why I'm anxious.

683
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,020
Chief, if you can't find your soul,

684
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,420
I can't find my senior's remains.

685
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,340
How can I have the honor to see my master?

686
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,580
Besides,

687
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,460
I'm afraid I'm going to be a lonely ghost.

688
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,540
You've thought it through.

689
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,460
That's why I'm really anxious.

690
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,300
Don't be so stubborn, okay?

691
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,500
Who dares to be stubborn in front of Master Li?

692
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,380
I thought you'd come back after you thought it through.

693
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,300
I didn't expect you to leave for ten years.

694
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:21,620
I wrote you a letter when I smelled it.

695
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,700
Where's the letter?

696
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,780
Did you write it in your stomach?

697
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,020
Letter.

698
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,460
Who wrote me a letter?

699
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,140
You.

700
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,420
Where's the letter?

701
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,180
Is it you?

702
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,420
Your Majesty,

703
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,780
I'm not sure about this.

704
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,740
I'm afraid I lost my memory.

705
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,780
You're being too willful.

706
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,580
I saved you from death for ten years.

707
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,900
Now you should be a doctor for ten years.

708
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,500
But your pulse is much weaker than I expected.

709
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,020
It's not even a year old.

710
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,820
You should have gone back to Baichuan Courtyard.

711
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,740
Zheng Qiao,

712
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,140
it's crowded there today.

713
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,980
The four ancient doors are all here.

714
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,700
I'll take you back and tell you who you are.

715
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,740
The martial arts world is great.

716
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,140
Everyone's power will save you.

717
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,580
Why are you fighting with me?

718
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,780
Be careful.

719
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,020
Your master said

720
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:45,640
the

721
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,100
Flaguered House wasicia book is too good.

722
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,860
It...

723
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,980
It despoils the entire pineapple valley.

724
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,340
There're nine of them.

725
00:30:59,020 --> 00:30:59,740
Ten years!

726
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,780
Ten years is too much!

727
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,420
There're nine of them

728
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,500
even the palm trees have no fruit.

729
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,380
Now-alright мас circle

730
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,020
turns to soul

731
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,780
and pay AW chicken

732
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,420
Yes.

733
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,380
Slave.

734
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,020
Go to the maidservant and conversations.

735
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:22,940
Be quick.

736
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:26,900
It's late now.

737
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,460
They must be pretty hurt.

738
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,340
Hurry.

739
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,060
Something happened to Bai Chuan Courtyard.

740
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:50,100
I thought you were already determined

741
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,300
and had soaked the past in the water.

742
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,300
You still care about them.

743
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,980
I heard that

744
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,420
Yun Bi Qiu has been self-harm

745
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,340
for ten years.

746
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,660
I guess

747
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,380
he was the one who poisoned

748
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,180
Bai Chuan Courtyard's poison.

749
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,740
After you were killed,

750
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,220
Yun Bi Qiu regretted it.

751
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,860
He went to the East Sea

752
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,380
to find you for months.

753
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,740
When Master Bai found him,

754
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,700
he had no intention to resist.

755
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,900
He was killed by Master Bai.

756
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:30,180
Fortunately, Master Qi found out in time

757
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,940
that he was a traitor

758
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,020
and didn't mean to harm you.

759
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,140
So he sent someone to save him

760
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,140
and let him stay.

761
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,780
But Yun Bi Qiu has been

762
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,620
self-harm for ten years

763
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,460
and refused to forgive himself.

764
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,140
Let me guess again.

765
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,500
Master Li couldn't let go of his heart

766
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,060
for this reason.

767
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,620
After all, the past

768
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,620
was a matter of time.

769
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,620
Someone had to let it go first.

770
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,500
Your Majesty.

771
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,100
You're really good at guessing.

772
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,380
But don't talk nonsense again.

773
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,100
Tell me.

774
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,460
Did something happen

775
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,340
to Bai Chuan Courtyard?

776
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,740
Don't worry. Bai Chuan Courtyard is fine.

777
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,500
It's because Bai Chuan Courtyard

778
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,260
has just received a sword.

779
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,580
So they sent an invitation

780
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,580
to the old friend of the four-door sect

781
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,460
to hold a sword-gathering party.

782
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,140
This sword

783
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:37,460
is the personal sword of Master Li

784
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,060
Shao Shi.

785
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:45,220
Shao Shi fell into the Eastern Sea.

786
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,060
A few years later,

787
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,780
someone in the Eastern Sea caught the fish

788
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,020
and got this sword.

789
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,700
After that, this sword was sold out.

790
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,300
When it was returned to Bai Chuan Courtyard,

791
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,100
it had already gone through 43 battles.

792
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,460
The name of the sword

793
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,380
is the name of the sword.

794
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,980
Don't you think

795
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,900
this sword should be returned to its master?

796
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,300
This is a private sword.

797
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,780
Of course,

798
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,260
I will find a good master.

799
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,460
What about the person?

800
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,780
For the time being,

801
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,460
you have to meet someone.

802
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,420
The heroine Qiao

803
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,020
is also in Bai Chuan Courtyard.

804
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,180
For so many years,

805
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,100
she has been praying for you in the temple every year.

806
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:38,060
But she never lights the lantern.

807
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,500
Because she doesn't believe

808
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,140
that you are dead.

809
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,820
For these years,

810
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:49,740
Hero Xiao has been waiting for you.

811
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,340
But you don't want to come back.

812
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,060
Don't you want to

813
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,700
solve this problem?

814
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,900
If I don't go into the problem,

815
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,820
it will be the best ending.

816
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,220
But it's a pity.

817
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,420
In life,

818
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,500
everything is a pity.

819
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,140
For ten years,

820
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,940
there is nothing that can't be let go

821
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,020
and nothing that can't be solved.

822
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,740
I am a useless person

823
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,460
who doesn't know how to think.

824
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,180
Monk,

825
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,220
can you answer my question?

826
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,500
The corpse of the Golden Fence Alliance?

827
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,180
Yes.

828
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,860
She was indeed

829
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,060
a member of the Pudu Temple.

830
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,460
After the East Sea,

831
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,700
did the abbot have any news of the corpse?

832
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,420
When Bai Chuan Courtyard was new,

833
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,020
she caught the cruel body of the Golden Fence Alliance.

834
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,660
She was imprisoned in prison for thousands of years.

835
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,580
After the proposal of Hero Qiao,

836
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,820
she released a group of

837
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,940
ungrateful ordinary people.

838
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,140
The list of released people

839
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,540
was decided by Hero Qiao.

840
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,060
She must know

841
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,500
who Li Shizhu is looking for.

842
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,980
The world is so mysterious.

843
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,540
You have to meet someone you don't want to meet.

844
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,980
At this point,

845
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:45,720
you should either

846
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,060
protect and address the local regent

847
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,580
or transfer the funds

848
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,940
from him to that person and

849
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,660
we will reach an agreement.

850
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,140
Defeating someone

851
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,660
is the most prime goal of a miracle.

852
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:02,020
Monk, you guys are new cooks.

853
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,020
Are you stealing food?

854
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,020
I won't eat anymore.

855
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,020
Goodbye.

856
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,020
How's the investigation going?

857
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:18,020
There's no record of a soul-losing soul in the last ten years.

858
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,020
The only clue is outside the bridge.

859
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,020
If you don't want to go, I'll go.

860
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,020
Hey.

861
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:29,020
Don't worry. You'll definitely find out.

862
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:32,020
Chief Li, your internal strength is all gone.

863
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,020
You should be more low-key.

864
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,020
You're so shy.

865
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,020
Today, the Baichuan Academy Awards Ceremony

866
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,020
requires a invitation or a guide to enter.

867
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:49,020
Lin Lianhua, you're still here.

868
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:53,020
Yeah, it's a awards ceremony.

869
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,020
Fei is here to take the job.

870
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,020
Oh, right. This is my friend.

871
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,020
He's been doing well lately.

872
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,020
The owner of Lianhua House, the god of medicine, Li Lianhua.

873
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:07,020
And this is the one he smashed.

874
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,020
I'll be the recommender and take them in.

875
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,020
Let's go. I'll take you to a place.

876
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,020
Let's go.

877
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,020
Come on. Before the awards ceremony,

878
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,020
I'll introduce someone to you.

879
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:27,020
This is my master, Li Xiangyi's portrait.

880
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,020
It looks pretty ordinary.

881
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,020
But it's really sharp.

882
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,020
How do you talk?

883
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,020
Pay attention.

884
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,020
When the Baichuan Academy was established,

885
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,020
his portrait was hung here.

886
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,020
It's been ten years.

887
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,020
No one can forget him.

888
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,020
Oh, right. You have candy on you.

889
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,020
Give me two.

890
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,020
What are you looking at?

891
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,020
I know you like candy.

892
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,020
Stop crying. Hurry up.

893
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,020
One more.

894
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,020
Only one. Do you want it or not?

895
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:45,020
I always bring him something every time I come.

896
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,020
In everyone's eyes,

897
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:52,020
he is the owner of the temple, Li Xiangyi.

898
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,020
He is the support of many people.

899
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:57,020
He is the target of many people's desire.

900
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:03,020
But not many people really care about his hobby.

901
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,020
Let me tell you secretly.

902
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:10,020
I've seen him avoid everyone and eat candy secretly.

903
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,020
Who would have thought that

904
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,020
the best Li Xiangyi

905
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:18,020
would eat candy happily like a child.

906
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:21,020
Li Xiangyi

907
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,020
Stop talking.

908
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,020
It's not that...

909
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,020
You and my master want this...

910
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:49,680
it means the

911
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,880
East sea battle li Xiangyi

912
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,320
lost, he should second

913
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,540
you said brush just lost to

914
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,520
Di Feisheng

915
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,480
you saw

916
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,960
they were fought on the sea

917
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,720
where are you

918
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,000
you are a jewel or a lens

919
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,960
don't wet

920
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,400
heard not

921
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,440
go

922
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,920
to say

923
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:21,100
After ten years of

924
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:22,860
generation,

925
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,840
the young master

926
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,900
can be re-climbed at will!

927
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:26,780
thanks to

928
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,900
the fraternal friends of the world

929
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,820
and to the two old boat guys?

930
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:36,740
So it is Miss Qiao

931
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:37,500
and Miss Xiao

932
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,540
who followed the young master to get the sword.

933
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,540
Don't look at the stars

934
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:13,540
It's clear that there are ups and downs

935
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,540
How many heroes have been able to

936
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:21,540
Read the love and hate of the trees in their lifetime

937
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:25,540
Ask a lotus heart

938
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:29,540
Cut a cold flag into the heart

939
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:32,540
Talk about heart and body

940
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:36,540
Not subduing the feelings of the people

941
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:43,540
So many years

942
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:46,540
We have never seen

943
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:49,540
The young master who could find the young master

944
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:52,540
That Xiang Yi had never given up on

945
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:56,540
Today, I hope that the people of the martial arts world

946
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,540
Don't forget the ideals of good and evil

947
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,540
And the world's peace

948
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,540
Don't let Xiang Yi down

949
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,540
What he wishes for

950
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:13,540
The mortal world is too impetuous

951
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:16,540
Waiting for the old heaven

952
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,540
The future will be changed

953
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:21,540
Change a immortal wish

954
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:24,540
The mortal world is too impetuous

955
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:28,540
Blue and green mountains and green fields

956
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:32,540
Who is not a lonely person

957
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:36,540
Waiting for the old heaven

958
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,540
The future will be changed

959
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:41,540
Change a immortal wish

960
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:44,540
The mortal world is too impetuous

961
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:49,540
Blue and green mountains and green fields

962
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:56,540
Who is not a lonely person

963
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:01,540
The mortal world is too impetuous

964
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:04,540
Waiting for the old heaven

965
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:06,540
The future will be changed

966
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,540
Change a immortal wish

967
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,540
The mortal world is too impetuous

968
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:17,540
Blue and green mountains and green fields

969
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:20,540
Who is not a lonely person

970
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:24,540
Let's go

971
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:36,540
The mortal world is too impetuous
