[Episode 20]

4
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,830
Wansheng Clan.

5
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,330
Feng Qing.

6
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,220
Back then, Jiao Liqiao secretly purchased thundering fire bombs.

7
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,020
All the funds came from the Wansheng Clan.

8
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,380
My Lord, your plan is good.

9
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,450
You knew that there must be someone who secretly helps Jiao Liqiao

10
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,979
and let the cat out of the bag.

11
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:05,539
Besides,

12
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,710
when I was investigating Jiao Liqiao,

13
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:09,710
I also accidentally found

14
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,420
that Jiao Liqiao has been secretly intercepting the clues about the Styx Flower.

15
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,950
I don't know her intention.

16
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,100
Keep an eye on the Styx Flower.

17
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,360
Jiao Liqiao.

18
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,990
I'll investigate her myself.

19
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:20,770
Yes.

20
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,630
What do you mean by the secret letter?

21
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,720
Your master asked me to seize power in the Jinyuan Alliance?

22
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,850
Saintess Jiao, why are you so nervous?

23
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,710
My master just wants you to think about it.

24
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,060
Sooner or later,

25
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,620
Di Feisheng will know what you've done.

26
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,680
By then, if you're in charge of the Jinyuan Alliance,

27
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,170
it'll benefit both of us.

28
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,660
Tell me.

29
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,800
Who is your master?

30
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,010
Ask him to come out to see me.

31
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,000
My Lord.

32
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,120
I...

33
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:25,980
My Lord.

34
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,360
I don't need people who betray me.

35
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,980
My internal power...

36
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,180
Wuxin Huai.

37
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,410
You put Wuxin Huai into his body?

38
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,820
The medicine can only be used a little.

39
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,620
Otherwise, he'll lose his mind.

40
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,600
When he made an attempt on your life,

41
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,440
he didn't hesitate at all.

42
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,970
That's a matter between me and him.

43
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,950
If Master hadn't rescued you in time,

44
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,079
you would have died.

45
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,790
Don't flatter yourself.

46
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,060
I've already placed Wuxin Huai in his room.

47
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,680
He smelled it for days.

48
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,290
In a few days,

49
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,810
he'll definitely be addicted to it.

50
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,380
Or what?

51
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,150
His limbs and internal power

52
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,010
are weak today.

53
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,740
Otherwise,

54
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,140
you couldn't have harmed him.

55
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,350
In that case,

56
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,020
consider it as a help.

57
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,460
Don't worry.

58
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,240
I know you want to keep him.

59
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,140
The Wuxin Huai I put into his body can't kill him.

60
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,230
He's just injured.

61
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,210
As for how you're going to explain to the Jinyuan Alliance when you go back,

62
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,220
you can only rely on yourself.

63
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:11,880
Are you forcing me to turn against my lord?

64
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,560
It's been ten years.

65
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,390
The game rules should be changed.

66
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:36,800
Master.

67
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,700
Since he found out about us,

68
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,030
we can't keep him alive.

69
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,330
The doseage of the Wuxin Huai

70
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,900
is high enough to ruin his martial art skills.

71
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,020
He's useless.

72
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:48,260
What's there to worry about?

73
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,600
The effect of the knockout incense is so strong.

74
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,780
Hot steamed buns.

75
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,510
Are they freshly steamed buns?

76
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,300
-Have a look.
-I'll buy them later.

77
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,920
Have one.

78
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,830
I just bad-mouthed Li Xiangyi.

79
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,380
Why are you so angry?

80
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,230
What's there to be angry about?

81
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:45,980
Is Liu Rujing here?

82
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,340
Are you looking for Liu Rujing?

83
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,740
Blind Liu quit long ago.

84
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:49,650
He quit?

85
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,580
Blind Liu?

86
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,360
May I ask

87
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,400
how Liu Rujing went blind?

88
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,880
Ten years ago, one of his eyes was damaged

89
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,030
in the great battle.

90
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,830
His other eye also became useless during these two years.

91
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,410
You kicked him out because he went blind?

92
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,770
You're so heartless.

93
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,230
We didn't kick him out.

94
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,480
He didn't want to stay here for free.

95
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,660
But he uses dead people to do business now.

96
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,890
The money he makes is much more than the money he made when he was a guard.

97
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,690
What kind of business does he do?

98
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,460
This place is not safe.

99
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,330
There are always people who seek revenge.

100
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,970
They don't care whether or not their enemies are dead.

101
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,340
No one dares to deal with those corpses.

102
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,350
Blind Liu

103
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,180
used to belong to the Sigu Sect.

104
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,550
No one dares to make trouble for him even if he deals with corpses.

105
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,830
If you want to find him,

106
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,260
go to an inn in the suburbs

107
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,510
when you see the moon.

108
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,170
If a ghost lantern is lit,

109
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,910
it means that he's doing business tonight.

110
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,170
You'll see him inside.

111
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,370
Thank you.

112
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,850
Ghost lanterns.

113
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,790
He should be here.

114
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,150
Blind Liu, you screwed me over.

115
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,580
Damn you!

116
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,060
You want to sell the person who feigned death

117
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,380
for 100 taels of silver?

118
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,250
Wait and see.

119
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,040
This...

120
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:00,980
Let go of me!

121
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,470
Let's go.

122
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:13,460
Di...

123
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:21,580
Why are you here?

124
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:22,810
You know me?

125
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,700
Who are you?

126
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,430
Don't you remember us?

127
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,100
Don't you know who you are?

128
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,100
Who am I?

129
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,220
You almost died.

130
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,880
You forgot who you are.

131
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,100
I saved you from the river.

132
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,660
You're the husband I matched to the dead woman,

133
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,920
Yi Cunhong.

134
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
I'm your friend.

135
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,540
I'm your good friend.

136
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,180
Friend?

137
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:59,980
That's impossible.

138
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:10,960
This...

139
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,980
What happened?

140
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,300
I haven't gotten even with you.

141
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,590
Look for Li Lianhua.

142
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,700
His illness is not fatal,

143
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,410
but he needs to be treated as soon as possible.

144
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,590
It's hard to return the final boss's favour.

145
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,390
Are you Liu Rujing?

146
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:42,980
Tell me.

147
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,010
Who do you want to buy?

148
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,620
Yi Cunhong or Xue Lijian?

149
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,340
Let me make it clear.

150
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,300
Xiao Feidao has been chopped into 18 pieces by someone.

151
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,760
I only found three pieces.

152
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,130
But I can give you a discount.

153
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,210
We're not here to buy corpses.

154
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,930
I'm already blind.

155
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,710
I don't know who killed them.

156
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,180
It's none of my business either.

157
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,930
If you want to look for someone or seek revenge,

158
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,750
don't disturb me when I'm doing business.

159
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,480
We're not here to seek revenge.

160
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,000
We are detectives from the Baichuan Court.

161
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,400
Get lost.

162
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,010
Mr. Liu.

163
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,490
I know you used to work

164
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,660
for Shan Gudao.

165
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,330
We are colleagues.

166
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,510
Colleagues?

167
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,920
My colleagues have all died.

168
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,210
When I left the Sigu Sect,

169
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,100
I said because the Sigu Sect split,

170
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,100
I'd think of them all as dead people.

171
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:32,730
In my life,

172
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,420
if anyone dares to mention the Sigu Sect in front of me again,

173
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,500
I won't be polite.

174
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:38,490
You...

175
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:41,820
Mr. Liu.

176
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,230
We can leave.

177
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,530
But this person is still alive.

178
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,190
You can't sell him as a corpse.

179
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:47,740
You...

180
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,340
That's right.

181
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,700
He's a criminal on the blade list of the Baichuan Court.

182
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,940
I have to take him back.

183
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,820
So what?

184
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,880
This bastard has lain here for five days.

185
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,110
I failed to sell him.

186
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,600
He also ruined my plan.

187
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,970
Even if I don't sell him as a corpse,

188
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,080
I'll ruin his martial art skills

189
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,120
and let him do everything for me.

190
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,520
This...

191
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,920
He's seriously injured.

192
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,810
If he doesn't get treated soon,

193
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,400
he'll really die.

194
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,060
We'll pay 100 taels of silver.

195
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,700
If you were not from the Baichuan Court,

196
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,240
100 taels of silver would be acceptable.

197
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,240
But you're from the Baichuan Court.

198
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:28,980
1,000 taels of silver.

199
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,090
1,000 taels of silver?

200
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,820
Why don't you go and rob people?

201
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,770
Are you going to give it or not?

202
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,400
-No.
-Yes.

203
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,020
Didn't you bring money?

204
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,850
You want to spend 1,000 taels of silver ransoming him?

205
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,600
You know I...

206
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,230
I owe you a favour.

207
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,200
I'll explain to you later.

208
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,460
Ransom him first.

209
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,120
That's all I have.

210
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,020
Move over.

211
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,190
I smell of corpses.

212
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,880
You'd better give me a reasonable explanation.

213
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,070
He was poisoned with a lot of Wuxin Huai.

214
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:22,680
So?

215
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,840
Isn't it satisfying?

216
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,220
Wait.

217
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,070
Once someone is poisoned with Wuxin Huai,

218
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,920
they can't use their internal power anymore.

219
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,770
It's the top incense which can ruin people's martial art skills.

220
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,810
Why does he still have martial art skills?

221
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,360
Look.

222
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,570
He pierced his Laogong acupuncture point first.

223
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,900
He let his Genuine Qi out

224
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,100
to prevent the Wuxin Huai from going into his internal organs.

225
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,910
Then he used his internal power to reverse his meridians

226
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50,980
and forced the Wuxin Huai to go into the Baihui acupuncture point behind his head.

227
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,290
Apart from Di Feisheng,

228
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,810
no one can think of this method.

229
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,700
So,

230
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,420
the reason why he didn't lose his martial art skills

231
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,340
is that the Wuxin Huai went into his Baihui acupuncture point.

232
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,400
He also lost his memory because of it.

233
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:03,760
Even so,

234
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,400
this is not the reason we should save him.

235
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,820
Because the final boss lost his memory,

236
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,820
should we forget

237
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,950
his evil deeds?

238
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,190
In my opinion,

239
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,460
we should take him

240
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,660
to the Baichuan Court

241
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,000
and put him in the 188 prisons immediately.

242
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,290
Actually, I've found the evidence before.

243
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,370
Di Feisheng didn't kill Shan Gudao.

244
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,340
When Shan Gudao died,

245
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,990
there was half a stick of Wuxin Huai beside him.

246
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,590
Di Feisheng was also poisoned with Wuxin Huai.

247
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,800
What a coincidence!

248
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,130
Besides, Di Feisheng's martial art skills are unpredictable.

249
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,250
Who could

250
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,780
plot against him?

251
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,270
You mean there's an internal conflict in the Jinyuan Alliance?

252
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,340
The person who killed your father

253
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,620
used this as bait

254
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,870
to start a battle between the Jinyuan Alliance and the Sigu Sect.

255
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,330
The Sigu Sect was damaged.

256
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,890
It didn't benefit the Jinyuan Alliance much either.

257
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:55,400
In the great battle at the East Sea,

258
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,320
the Jinyuan Alliance suffered a great loss.

259
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,620
Di Feisheng wouldn't do things

260
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,820
that hurt others and don't benefit himself.

261
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,440
I guess

262
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,340
someone in the Jinyuan Alliance is colluding with outsiders

263
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,540
to scheme something.

264
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,910
Wuxin Huai and the ice shards can prove it.

265
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,380
These people haven't stopped during these ten years.

266
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,510
Why don't we keep him

267
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,750
and find a breakthrough from him?

268
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,240
But he lost his memory.

269
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,060
It seems that he can't provide us

270
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,220
with any clues.

271
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:20,750
That's temporary.

272
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,760
With the help of his power,

273
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,220
he'll recover gradually.

274
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,210
Di Feisheng is like a good knife.

275
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,190
It'll be a pity if we break him.

276
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,740
I'm afraid he's a snake.

277
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,700
A frozen snake.

278
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,700
He'll bite you if he's awake.

279
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,640
Think about it.

280
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,890
If he really wants to kill someone,

281
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,510
he won't stop.

282
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,460
Besides,

283
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,740
he wants to get even with the people who betrayed him

284
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,900
in the Jinyuan Alliance.

285
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,770
What about now?

286
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,530
How are you going to use this broken knife

287
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,820
that always wants to kill people?

288
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,580
Don't worry.

289
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,360
This is the most powerful helper in the world.

290
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,750
When the sun rises tomorrow,

291
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,760
among the twenty people,

292
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,960
only one of you can walk out of this door.

293
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,190
Why do you make us kill each other again and again?

294
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,730
Because only in this way

295
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,410
can you remember the desire

296
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,700
to win

297
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,510
and

298
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:19,560
become the best killers.

299
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,079
Don't listen to him.

300
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,040
It's useless.

301
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,170
They planted that kind of thing in our bodies.

302
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,170
We will always submit to the family.

303
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,460
We can't escape.

304
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,550
It's inappropriate for you to treat your master like this.

305
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,460
Since you're awake,

306
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,520
take the medicine.

307
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,460
Who are you?

308
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,850
Look at your palm.

309
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,790
You can read your own handwriting, right?

310
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,900
The person you're looking for

311
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,820
is Li Lianhua.

312
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,260
That's me.

313
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,670
Look outside.

314
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,530
[Lotus Tower Medical Center]

315
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,040
You must want to ask

316
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,270
who you are.

317
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,900
Your name is Fei.

318
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,310
You're a spy from the Baichuan Court.

319
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,240
Baichuan Court?

320
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,540
Spy?

321
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,480
Give me more details.

322
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,130
The Baichuan Court is the court of the martial arts world.

323
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,770
It specializes in judging cases in the martial arts world.

324
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:22,370
Recently,

325
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,180
I've been investigating an old case which happened ten years ago.

326
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,300
So I asked you to infiltrate the enemy as a spy.

327
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,180
I didn't expect you

328
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,180
to be found out and plotted against.

329
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,380
It's my fault.

330
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,600
Then why did you say you are my master?

331
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,230
You used to be an abandoned disciple of the Nanhai Sect.

332
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,090
You were caught

333
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,830
as Iron Head Slave before.

334
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,510
I ransomed you.

335
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,700
You were grateful to me.

336
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,100
So you wanted to repay me.

337
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,500
But I'm not a person who helps people to be repaid.

338
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,020
So I advised you

339
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,130
to work in the Baichuan Court.

340
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,260
You helped the weak, eradicated violence,

341
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,120
and helped me investigate cases.

342
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,460
I helped the weak

343
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,600
and eradicated violence?

344
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,460
I only remember

345
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,010
I killed people.

346
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,500
You said I saved people.

347
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,210
I won't kill you.

348
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,270
I don't believe you either.

349
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,530
Do you think I'm a fool?

350
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,500
You're not a fool.

351
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,700
At least you saved one person before.

352
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:26,700
Who?

353
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:27,890
Me.

354
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,630
Your pulse is a mess.

355
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,140
You were poisoned.

356
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,410
Examine me again.

357
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,130
You have my internal power

358
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,510
in your body.

359
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,010
I'm dying.

360
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,700
You tried to save me before.

361
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,580
You have my internal power.

362
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,740
But why hasn't your condition improved?

363
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,900
Because I've been poisoned with the deadliest poison.

364
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,900
I'll die for sure.

365
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,590
You cried

366
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,370
and transferred your internal power to my body before.

367
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,860
You tried to cure me at all costs, but you failed.

368
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,510
Now I'm dying.

369
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,900
I'm not lying, right?

370
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,150
Do you believe me now?

371
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,750
It seems that you're really important to me.

372
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,020
Are you really...

373
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:17,990
Your master.

374
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,980
I don't think I can say these two words.

375
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:26,360
Never mind.

376
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,000
It doesn't matter.

377
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,290
What matters is

378
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,690
that you want to stay alive and repay me.

379
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,840
If you leave now,

380
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,010
there will be many people who want to kill you.

381
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,040
You don't know them,

382
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,080
but they know you.

383
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,480
Should I be afraid?

384
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,700
You're not afraid of fighting.

385
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,050
But it's not easy to avoid being plotted against.

386
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,290
If you die,

387
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,350
who will pay me back?

388
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:50,810
Let's count.

389
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:51,970
When I ransomed you,

390
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,020
I spent 1,000 taels of silver

391
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,070
and asked you to be a spy.

392
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,130
But you found nothing.

393
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,590
Instead, you were taken to a mortuary.

394
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,340
So

395
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,670
I spent 10,000 taels of silver

396
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,430
and ransomed you from Blind Liu.

397
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,310
If you die,

398
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,840
who will pay me back?

399
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,390
What do you want?

400
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,140
Keep investigating cases for me.

401
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,170
Each case is worth 1,000 taels of silver.

402
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,610
You can leave

403
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:14,760
when you pay me back.

404
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:16,980
It's strange.

405
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,670
You're dying.

406
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,380
You should think about how I can save your life.

407
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,190
Many things are more important than being alive.

408
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,740
You just said there are many things that haven't been dealt with.

409
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,900
Why were you poisoned?

410
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,220
Why was I plotted against?

411
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,680
What kind of opponent is the Jinyuan Alliance?

412
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,220
Why do you have so many questions?

413
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,020
No reason.

414
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,120
When you pay me back,

415
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,760
you'll know everything.

416
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,090
Here.

417
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:43,750
It's a deal.

418
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,090
You're awake.

419
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,030
Can we eat now?

420
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,660
Even Fox Spirit is hungry.

421
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,700
Who is he?

422
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,390
Your colleague.

423
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,120
Colleague?

424
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,620
Are people from the Baichuan Court so bad at martial arts?

425
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,590
What did you say?

426
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:01,500
If it weren't for me,

427
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,280
you would still be lying in the coffin with Yi Cunhong

428
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,890
who has maggots on her body.

429
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:05,570
Right.

430
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,940
You caught me off guard

431
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,780
before.

432
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,110
But today,

433
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,740
my Erya Sword is very lonely.

434
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,930
Let's have a battle.

435
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,170
Enough.

436
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,570
I cooked a new dish today.

437
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:15,140
Let me take you to try it.

438

It seems that Li Lianhua is not my enemy.

441
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,020
But he's hiding something.

442
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,490
I'll get the truth out of him sooner or later.

443
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,090
Do they smell good?

444
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,450
Look at you.

445
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,100
I created two new dishes.

446
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,250
Have a taste.

447
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,120
What a spread.

448
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,310
There are four dishes today.

449
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,500
Were all these dishes cooked by you?

450
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,100
No.

451
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,020
This one was bought at the market.

452
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,590
In that case,

453
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:53,940
you eat first.

454
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,210

Okay.

Try this one.

460

It tastes terrible.

461
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,110
I'm not blaming you.

462

Even the person who has no sense of taste

463
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,830
thinks the dishes you cooked taste terrible.

464
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:35,980
Wait.

465
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,350

00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,720
It tastes good.

470
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:37,780
Fine.

You do care about him.

480

Does he know

481
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,280
you were poisoned?

you can keep this secret for me.

I have a feeling.

487
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,310
Regardless of whether what you said in the room

488
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,710
is true,

489

there is one sentence I believe is true.

490
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,360
You said I want you to be alive. I believe it.

491
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,560
You said you only remember how to kill people.

492
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,490
Did you remember

493

something which happened in the past?

00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:22,900
Mr. Liu.

512
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,670
We're here to ask you

513
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,230
about the Sigu Sect.

514
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,270
The Sigu Sect again.

515
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,990
The Sigu Sect no longer exists.

516
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,390
Although you said so,

517
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,410
you still hung a token

518
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,460
of the Sigu Sect on your waist.

519
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:38,900
Mr. Liu.

520
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,740
Since you still think about the Sigu Sect,

521
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,170
why are you so hostile

522
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,430
to the Baichuan Court?

523
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,410
Ten years ago,

524
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,350
since the Sigu Sect split,

525
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,480
it has no longer been in existence for me.

526
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,090
When Sect Leader was in trouble,

527
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,870
they all had their own schemes.

528
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,550
No one protected the sect for Sect Leader.

529
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,260
Baichuan Court, the court of the martial arts world?

530
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,050
In my eyes,

531
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,400
it's nothing.

532
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,190
In the world, it's the trend

533
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,050
that things which separate for a long time will unite

534
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,210
and that things which unite for a long time will separate.

535
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:07,290
The Sigu Sect was resurrected.

536
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,220
Your old colleagues are all there.

537
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,330
If you want,

538
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,560
you can go back too.

539
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,160
You don't understand.

540
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,710
There's only one Sigu Sect.

541
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,530
That's Li Xiangyi's Sigu Sect.

542
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,310
Sect Leader is gone.

543
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,380
They threw mud

544
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,500
at Sect Leader.

545
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,690
Xiao Zijin is one of them.

546
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,690
I won't accept him as the sect leader

547
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:27,690
unless I die.

548
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,340
They all said it was because Li Xiangyi

549
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,700
wanted to take revenge on the Jinyuan Alliance for Shan Gudao's death

550
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,390
that he was trapped.

551
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,920
But the matter is not that simple.

552
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,400
Why am I telling you these?

553
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,460
Leave now.

554
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,080
Mr. Liu.

555
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:43,630
Hurry up.

556
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,330
We're here for this matter.

557
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,030
Actually, this young hero

558
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,920
is Sect Leader Li's disciple.

559
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:51,080
Shan Gudao is his birth father.

560
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:51,850
What?

561
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:57,330
Mr. Liu.

562
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,210
Here.

563
00:27:59,090 --> 00:27:59,850
Feel it.

564
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:01,750
This is my father's token.

565
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,860
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

566
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,860
You didn't give me a chance to say it.

567
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,690
Mr. Liu.

568
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,790
You said there's something wrong with my father's death.

569
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:17,830
Before he died,

570
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,410
did you notice anything unusual?

571
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:20,910
Or did he offend anyone?

572
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:22,390
Follow me.

573
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:35,600
[Jin Banshan]

574
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,710
What is this?

575
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,890
Before Second Sect Leader died,

576
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,800
I found

577
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,460
Xiao Tianhu, who was one of Four Tigers with Silver Spears,

578
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,780
was gathering information.

579
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,660
But back then,

580
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,770
it was I who was in charge of collecting information

581
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:49,230
in the martial arts world.

582
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:51,300
I found he did it behind my back.

583
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,310
I was worried that he betrayed the Sigu Sect.

584
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:55,410
So I followed him several times.

585
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,060
But in the end,

586
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,870
I found it was Second Sect Leader

587
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,260
who ordered Four Tigers with Silver Spears to do it together.

588
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:01,990
To be honest,

589
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,880
I was a little unhappy.

590
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,410
I thought Second Sect Leader

591
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,160
didn't consider me as one of them.

592
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,020
But that night,

593
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,230
he called me

594
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,440
and told me a secret.

595
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,430
What secret did he tell you?

596
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,420
He said he was worried

597
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,690
that the Jinyuan Alliance secretly supported Nanyin's plan to resurrect the country

598
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:21,220
and harmed Central Plains.

599
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,540
Didn't Nanyin

600
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,390
disappear a couple of hundred years ago?

601
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,780
I had the same reaction.

602
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,880
But Second Sect Leader told me

603
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,230
that

604
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:35,950
it has always been the Nanyin people's ambition to resurrect their country.

605
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,430
In the past few centuries,

606
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,540
they've successively

607
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,540
sent many people to Central Plains.

608
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,800
The most important people

609
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,060
are these four people.

610
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,060
These four rich Nanyin merchants

611
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,460
brought countless treasures and four magic weapons

612
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,180
from Nanyin.

613
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:53,990
It's said that there is one weapon that can destroy the world.

614
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,230
But somehow something went wrong.

615
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,590
These four people didn't take action.

616
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,420
They stayed in Central Plains instead.

617
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:04,280
Their descendants who are currently alive are the third generation.

618
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:05,960
Liu Rujing.

619
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,340
I want to stop them.

620
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,560
For some unknown reason,

621
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,750
Second Sect Leader found they were colluding with the Jinyuan Alliance.

622
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,220
They were ready to do something.

623
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,300
So he wanted to use this opportunity

624
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,620
to find the descendants of these four people.

625
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,550
Unfortunately,

626
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,380
he only found the Nanyin names

627
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,300
of the four rich merchants.

628
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,700
He couldn't find the third generation of their descendants.

629
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:30,860
I think

630
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,690
it was because Second Sect Leader

631
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:33,740
alerted the Jinyuan Alliance

632
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,460
when he was looking for these four people

633
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,740
that he was killed.

634
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,540
Why are you looking at me?

635
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,120
I also went undercover and investigated it.

636
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,660
You mean

637
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:55,370
that what Deputy Sect Leader Shan showed you

638
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,930
was one of the four names?

639
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,060
Yes.

640
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,940
After he wrote it down and showed it to me,

641
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:02,900
I burnt it.

642
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,570
I wanted to help him.

643
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,850
So I wrote it down from memory.

644
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,070
Unfortunately,

645
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,390
I only remember one of them.

646
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,820
Do you still remember

647
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:16,550
Deputy Sect Leader Shan asked you to go to the Yipin Tomb?

648
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,600
How did you know?

649
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:22,030
Because the one buried in the Yipin Tomb

650
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:26,590
was the last princess of Nanyin who was sent here to get married.

651
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:30,520
There was Bagua Formation outside the Yipin Tomb.

652
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,460
Even though he knew the general location,

653
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,540
Second Sect Leader failed to enter the Yipin Tomb.

654
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,040
Then he died.

655
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:38,650
No wonder.

656
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,130
Fang Xiaobao.

657
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,180
Do you still remember the box

658
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,010
lost in the Yipin Tomb?

659
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,610
Yes.

660
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,740
What's wrong?

661
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,530
Now that I think about it,

662
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,110
that box is the secret treasure

663
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:54,810
which the descendants of Nanyin are trying to find.

664
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:57,380
It can overthrow the martial arts world and the court.

665
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,140
Weeping Guanyin was just the bait

666
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,470
which was used to attract Di Feisheng

667
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,790
to open the Yipin Tomb.

668
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,010
Their ultimate aim

669
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,920
is the secret treasure in the box.

670
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,280
It's been seven days.

671
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,860
You still haven't found the whereabouts of Director?

672
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,330
No.

673
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,520
Don't worry.

674
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,690
Director is capable.

675
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:18,480
That bit of Wuxin Huai can't hurt him.

676
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,540
Maybe he is being treated somewhere.

677
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,620
It's not like him.

678
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,330
If he were really fine,

679
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:26,060
he would definitely come back.

680
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:28,740
Saintess.

681
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,280
Some old followers of Director

682
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,000
gathered in the sanctuary.

683
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,360
They complained

684
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:35,010
about Director's disappearance.

685
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:35,890
It seems

686
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,470
that they're going to accuse you again.

687
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:39,580
Give the order.

688
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,740
Lock all the old followers of Director up.

689
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:43,840
If there are people who disobey,

690
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,830
kill them.

691
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,110
I just don't want to hurt Director.

692
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,750
I won't show mercy

693
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,150
to those old men.

694
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,370
Yes.

695
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,320
The next piece of Heavenly Ice...

696
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,280
We can't miss it.

697
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:05,040
Everything I do is for him.

698
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,160
If he wants to be the director of the martial arts world,

699
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,460
I'll help him become the director of the martial arts world.

700
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,480
If he wants to be the number one in the martial arts world,

701
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,560
I'll help him become the number one in the martial arts world.

702
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,890
If he doesn't want them,

703
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,310
I'll become the number one in the world

704
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,310
and make him the husband of the woman who's the number one in the world.

705
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:24,330
When you get four pieces of Rama Heavenly Ice,

706
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:25,530
open the Rama Vessel,

707
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,080
and get that thing,

708
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,650
the whole world will be in your hands,

709
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,210
not to mention

710
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,330
Di Feisheng.

711
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:43,950
Sect Leader.

712
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,930
Do you believe what Li Xiangyi said?

713
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,890
He won't come back to the Sigu Sect?

714
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:51,680
He used to live a great life.

715
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,660
He also had a beauty beside him before.

716
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,860
I don't believe he can let go of the past.

717
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,660
Whether he wants it or not,

718
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,460
I can't give him a chance.

719
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,620
Then

720
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,920
what should we do?

721
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,550
Go and spread the news

722
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,040
secretly.

723
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:14,210
When Li Xiangyi was the sect leader,

724
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,610
he offended many people.

725
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,810
After he died,

726
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,920
people in the martial arts world forgot about it.

727
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,050
I should remind them

728
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,940
what kind of person Li Xiangyi is.

729
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:28,219
[Jin Banshan]

730
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,190
Nanyin script is hard to read.

731
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,980
Even if you eat the words,

732
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,070
you still can't understand them.

733
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,679
Scripts have their origins.

734
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,870
Maybe I'll be enlightened after I copy them a few more times.

735
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:40,460
Forget it.

736
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:42,980
Since you've cooked, let's eat first.

737
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:44,460
When did I cook?

738
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,960
Isn't it the smell of food?

739
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:58,980
Mr. Li.

740
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,150
I've also learnt

741
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:02,300
the dishes you created.

742
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,159
Check if I learnt them correctly.

743
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,139
Why are you here?

744
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,270
I want to learn cooking from Mr. Li.

745
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,260
Is it strange?

746
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,690
It's not strange to learn cooking.

747
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,260
It's strange to learn cooking

748
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,190
from Li Lianhua.

749
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,650
The wound on your face almost healed.

750
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,750
That's great.

751

My sworn brother's Green Jade Beauty Cream

752
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,220
is the best in the world.

753
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,060
I won't

754
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:22,870
have a scar.

755
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:24,810
Mr. Li.

756
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:26,930
You don't admit it,

757
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,910
but you still care about me.

758
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,340
Don't think too much.

759
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,360
If Fox Spirit broke its leg,

760
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:34,910
he would care about it too.

761
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,730
My sworn brother is busy these days.

762
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,660
I'll stay in the Lotus Tower for a few more days

763
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,190
and learn cooking from you.

764
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:44,730
These days,

765
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:45,900
we've been investigating something urgent.

766
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,720
I'm afraid we can't entertain you.

767
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,780
You're investigating Nanyin names.

768
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:52,840
You know it?

769
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,060
He copied the words onto the table for so long.

770
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,120
I happened to read them.

771
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:57,920
I knew it then.

772
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,980
What's the name?

773
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,300
You don't allow me to live here.

774
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,060
But you want me to answer your questions.

775
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,660
It depends on my mood.

776
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,120
I...

777
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:14,730
Who is it?

778
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,220
Don't be afraid, Miss Su.

779
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,350
This is Fei from the Nanhai Sect.

780
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,790
He's not only my servant

781
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:21,740
but also my underling.

782
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,740
He only eats rice.

783
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,310
Why is he wearing a mask?

784
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,580
He has a bad temper.

785
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,510
So he wears a mask to hide his anger.

786
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,060
Miss Su.

787
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,140
How about this?

788
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,230
If you help me read Nanyin script,

789
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,800
you can live in the Lotus Tower

790
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,470
from now on.

791
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:35,690

792
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:37,420
You can't go back on your word.

793
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,020
I won't.

794
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:42,250
I'm the granddaughter of the All-Knowing.

795
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,680
Because you've been investigating things

00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,750
about Nanyin,

797
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:47,360
I learnt a little from my grandfather.

798
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:49,770
Although I learnt it in a short time,

799
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:50,920
it's not hard for me

800
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,170
to read a name.

801
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,950
What's this person's name?

802
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,850
Jin Banshan.

803
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,340
His surname is Jin?

00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,460
I never knew

807
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,140
there is a garden here.

808
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,200
The Nanyin people worship grass and trees.

809
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,230
This garden should be its ancestral shrine.

810
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:33,230
This is the spirit tablet of Jin Banshan.

811
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:36,170
This should be Jin Banshan's memorial tablet.

812
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,090
He's Jin Mantang's grandfather.

813
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,580
The names inscribed onto the other memorial tablets

814
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,730
should be the names

815
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,450
of the Jin family's ancestors.

816
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:45,290
Whether it's ten years ago or ten years later,

817
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:47,350
everything is connected with Nanyin.

818
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,050
The secret treasure which Blind Liu mentioned

819
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,340
that can destroy the world

820
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,680
should be the reason.

821
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:56,000
Then where should we start the investigation of the secret treasure?

822
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,110
Look over there.

823
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:12,370
This is Suiyan, the fiend of Nanyin.

824
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,230
The one he holds in his left hand should be Wuxin Huai.

825
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,870
Asura Grass is in his right hand.

826
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,310
What is on his head?

827
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,320
Burn your body.

828
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:22,380
Release your soul.

829
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,700
Offer sacrifices to Suiyan.

830
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,250
Burn the sky with the searing fire.

831
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,780
Burn your soul.

832
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,820
Isn't it the sentence on the ice shard of Jin Mantang?

833
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,280
Burn the sky with the searing fire.

834
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,250
The secret treasure which can destroy the world.

835
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,500
That means

836
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,740
the fire on the head of the fiend

837
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:41,120
might be the top of Nanyin's Three Magical Techniques,

838
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,460
searing karmic fire.

839
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,980
Searing karmic fire?

840
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,460
That's the king of Gu

841
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,100
and the head of sorcery.

842
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,340
Back then, it was because the ancestors of the Nanyin people

843
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,870
got the searing karmic fire

844
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,810
that they gathered

845
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,200
tens of millions of evil soldiers to wipe out the Southwest Seven States

846
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,600
and established Nanyin.

847
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:58,520
Is it a legend?

848
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,810
That's impossible.

849
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,880
My grandfather

850
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:02,980
never writes things without evidence down.

851
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,820
Let me think.

852
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,130
Searing karmic fire.

853
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,550
My grandfather described it

854
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,650
as not only the sorcery which didn't belong to mortals

855
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,250
but also the root of all evil.

856
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,880
This thing is quite evil.

857
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:15,500
But in the past hundred years,

858
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,840
no one has mentioned it.

859
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,750
I thought they had already disappeared.

860
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,360
The Nanyin people respect grass and trees.

861
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,980
The searing karmic fire is being held at the top.

862
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:22,820
There's "fire" in its name.

863
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,240
Fire burns grass and trees.

864
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,640
I guess the Nanyin people not only respect it but also fear it.

865
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,120
The vessel with the searing karmic fire in it

866
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:32,990
should be the Rama Vessel.

867
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,170
Why does the vessel have such a strange name?

868
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:37,320
This should be right.

869
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,710
The Rama Vessel was made in the Blood Realm Tianqiao Palace a few hundred years ago.

870
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,580
It has mechanisms in it, so it is extremely hard to open.

871
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,940
Only by using four pieces of Rama Heavenly Ice as a key

872
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,060
can it be opened.

873
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,330
My aunt said

874
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,080
Jin Mantang's ice shard

875
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:48,410
is a kind of key.

876
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,420
Could the ice shard be the Rama Heavenly Ice?

877
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,060
So the reason why those people

878
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,130
want to collect four pieces of Rama Heavenly Ice

879
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,800
is that they want to open the Rama Vessel.

880
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,460
There were four Nanyin people

881
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,020
who came to Central Plains.

882
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,480
Each of them had one piece.

883
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:05,590
It seems that if we find the remaining three descendants

884
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:07,290
and the other three ice shards,

885
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:08,570
we can find the person

886
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,310
who's hidden in the dark.

887
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,300
If the searing karmic fire

888
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,830
is really something scary,

889
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,770
we must inform the Baichuan Court immediately.

890
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:16,250
No.

891
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:16,980
Why?

892
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:18,530
Think about it.

893
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,940
Yipin Tomb and Yuanbao Villa.

894
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,780
Every time when we sent the messages

895
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,230
to the Baichuan Court before,

896
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,710
we would be attacked.

897
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:27,860
You suspect

898
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,300
there's a spy in the Baichuan Court?

899
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:30,860
Yes.

900
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,500
So we have to look for the remaining three people

901
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,740
ourselves.

902
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:37,110
But there are three people.

903
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:38,870
We only know one name.

904
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,050
How can we investigate the rest?

905
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,400
Miss Zhiyu.

906
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:44,980
Does Jin Mantang

907
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:47,220
have any friends who he meets regularly?

908
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,660
Not many.

909
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,300
But he goes out for a few days every fall.

910
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,540
He said he went out for a feast.

911
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,830
Feasts in fall?

912
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,000
Could it be Mountains Red?

913
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,180
"Mountains Red" was written on the invitations.

914
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,440
What is Mountains Red?

915
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,620
Aren't you the granddaughter of the All-Knowing?

916
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,550
You don't even know Mountains Red?

917
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,670
No one knows play

918
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,490
better than you.

919
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,750
-Right?
-Of course.

920
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:14,080
Let me teach you something new.

921
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,180
Every year when the color of maple leaves becomes red,

922
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,590
Yu Louchun

923
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,780
invites six strange people to the banquet.

924
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,580
This is called "Mountains Red".

925
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,580
Coincidentally,

926
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,520
Yu Louchun is also fabulously rich.

927
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,300
He doesn't go out of his house

928
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,630
and lives in seclusion.

929
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,750
He's very similar to Jin Mantang.

930
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:31,460
Since we're suspicious of Yu Louchun the most,

931
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,300
why don't we

932
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,450
go and see him?

933
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:35,480
Yu Louchun is not a person

934
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,180
who you can see when you want to.

935
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:37,940
Although

936
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,820
he holds Mountains Red every year,

937
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,660
so far,

938
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,340
no one knows

939
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,840
where he lives.

940
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,140
Only guests who are invited

941
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,290
can see him.

942
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,960
I wonder if he needs a doctor.

943
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,850
He didn't say he's sickly.

944
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,500
Let me put it this way.

945
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,940
If you want to see him,

946
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:56,220
you must become the most famous strange people

947
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,810
in the martial arts world this year.

948
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,970
If you want to be invited, you have to be strange.

949
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:01,170
We have to be strange?

950
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,650
Among us,

951
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:06,980
isn't Fei

952
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,460
the strangest person?

953
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,720
How about we ask him to perform on the street

954
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,980
to attract Yu Louchun?

955
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,070
Don't bother.

956
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,550
Just kill them all.

957
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,340
Don't be afraid.

958
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,620
He likes to talk nonsense.

959
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,970
It seems that if we want to see Yu Louchun,

960
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:29,350
I have to take matters into my own hands.

961
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,430
Are you here

962
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:38,520
for the rumors in the martial arts world

963
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,260
which have a negative effect on the Sigu Sect?

964
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:40,820
Yes.

965
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:43,830
I wonder who spread the rumor

966
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:47,280
that Second Sect Leader Shan died because of Sect Leader Li.

967
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,760
The nonsense

968
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:50,490
is slanderous.

969
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,160
Actually,

970
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,500
I've heard a little about it.

971
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,460
The Baichuan Court sent me here today

972
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,860
to discuss this with you.

973
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,000
What are you going to do?

974
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,390
I've decided

975
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,050
to hold the Sigu Tea Party.

976
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:10,290
The first aim is to invite our friends in the martial arts world

977
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:11,850
and let the former subordinates come back.

978
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:13,320
The second aim is to quash the rumor

979
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,330
and ask everyone to be united.

980
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:16,720
The Sigu Tea Party is Sect Leader Li's private tea party.

981
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,920
Who are you to hold it?

982
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,630
The word "Sigu" in the "Sigu Tea Party"

983
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,250
refers to the Sigu Sect, not Li Xiangyi.

984
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,270
And now,

985
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:27,970
I'm the sect leader of the Sigu Sect.

986
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,170
Can't you just quash it in person?

987
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,980
Why do you want to invite so many people to talk about it?

988
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,300
Rumors are like water.

989
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,980
It's better to give them rational explanation than stop the spread.

990
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:39,700
If Sect Leader Li knows his tea party is used to solve the crisis of the Sigu Sect,

991
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,460
he'll be happy.

992
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:54,120
Wanmian.

993
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,030
I wanted to give you a surprise.

994
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:58,540
I didn't expect you to find it in advance.

995
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,830
All the flowers in the garden

996
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:00,830
were chosen by me.

997
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:01,660
Do you like them?

998
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:02,150
Zijin.

999
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,490
Did you hear the rumors

1000
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:05,900
about Li Xiangyi?

1001
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:09,730
They're just rumors.

1002
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:10,920
But

1003
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,300
you always

1004
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:14,500
pay extra attention about things about him.

1005
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,630
I've investigated.

1006
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,020
Those rumors were spread on purpose.
