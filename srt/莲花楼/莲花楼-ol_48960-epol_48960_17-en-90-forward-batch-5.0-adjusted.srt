Could it be that my Lord knew Li Xiangyi was alive?

16
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,570
Maybe he had met Li Xiangyi.

Why wasn't he surprised?

called Li Lianhua.

But his appearance and age are similar to Li Xiangyi's.

00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,950
He came to Tianji Mountain Manor

174
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,330
and wanted to take you with him.

175
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,650
But you were still young

176
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,590
and sickly.

177
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,300
How could you have roamed the martial world with him?

178
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,360
Of course, your father and I refused.

179
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,320
Xiaobao,

180
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,510
I brought you up

181
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,390
with my own hands.

182
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,180
You are my son.

183
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,070
How can I let others take you away as they please?

184
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,830
Shan Gudao ultimately

185
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,830
respected your mother's last wish.

186
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,900
He never tried to reconnect with you again.

187
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,790
He only told you he was my long-lost brother,

188
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,590
and let you take him as your uncle instead.

189
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,540
Besides,

190
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,580
Shan Gudao was devoted to his status and career.

191
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,510
He can't be a husband

192
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,530
or a father.

193
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,540
What's so good about the people from the martial world?

194
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,260
All of them are indifferent to family

195
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,580
and unpredictable in nature.

196
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,380
Fang Xiaobao,

197
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,340
don't be like them.

198
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,140
Do you hear me?

199
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,880
How could he possibly be like that?

200
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,250
Xiaobao is a good child who cares about his family.

201
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,050
Eldest Sister.

202
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,450
You raised him yourself.

203
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,270
Don't you know he's the most sensible and filial?

204
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,050
Mother.

205
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,830
These are all old matters to me.

206
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,310
I just wanted to understand the truth

207
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,930
to stop making mistakes.

208
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,670
In my heart,

209
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,600
you and my father are my closest kin.

210
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,620
This fact will never change.

211
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,040
It's good that you know it.

212
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,270
Your biological parents are gone.

213
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,190
You are my son.

214
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,130
If I don't care about you, who will I care about?

215
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:55,660
Alright.

216
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,270
Now that we've made it clear,

217
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,950
we'll never talk about it again.

218
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,350
Don't mention this again.

219
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,150
Do you hear me?

220
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,950
And you,

221
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,700
don't try to take advantage of this matter

222
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,760
and act pitifully or throw a tantrum.

223
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,880
Got it, Mother.

224
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,820
Are you still thinking about roaming the martial world?

225
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:18,350
Well...

226
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:19,970
Let me tell you.

227
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,980
I've activated all the major formation

228
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,580
outside the Tianji Mountain Manor.

229
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,610
You want to sneak out?

230
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:25,380
No way.

231
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,540
Just stay at home obediently

232
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,450
and marry the princess later.

233
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,090
That's the right thing to do.

234
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,440
Mother.

235
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,220
Please discipline your sister.

236
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,880
If you think you can, go ahead.

237
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,910
So beautiful.

238
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,400
I used to treat you

239
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,420
as a relative I had never met before.

240
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,070
I never thought of looking into your past.

241
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,560
What did you look like?

242
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,510
What did you like

243
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,810
and dislike?

244
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,300
I have no clue.

245
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,320
Fang Xiaobao.

246
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,480
I knew you would come here.

247
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,010
Did she draw all these?

248
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,290
She liked to draw things she liked

249
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,480
and things that looked interesting.

250
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,880
Have you seen this item before?

251
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,410
It's probably a rare item

252
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,940
your mother saw somewhere.

253
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,070
I don't know what it is, though.

254
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:38,920
I've seen this

255
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,150
ice shard before.

256
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,600
The Jinyuan Alliance seems to really want it.

257
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,290
But where did my mother see it?

258
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,190
It's definitely not from Tianji Hall.

259
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,090
But looking at these teeth marks,

260
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,280
I think they seem to correspond to a lock.

261
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:52,920
A lock?

262
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:57,850
You mean,

263
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,260
this ice shard is actually a key?

264
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,110
It's like a key to some kind of mechanism.

265
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,840
But it's not a technique from the Central Plains.

266
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
I understand now.

267
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,420
What do you understand?

268
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,750
I understand now, Aunt.

269
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,050
Aunt.

270
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,240
You don't need to understand.

271
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,990
Li Lianhua won't understand either.

272
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,190
I'll show him

273
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,060
what a detective of Baichuan Court is capable of.

274
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,990
Show some respect to Physician Li.

278

Back then, Qiao Wanmian refused to leave

279
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,590
after Li Xiangyi died.

280
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,340
Xiao Zijin didn't want to go against her will.

281
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,140
He hoped she could gradually get over her old love.

282
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,810
So he expanded and built the Mumian Villa

283
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,870
in the old residence of the Sigu Sect.

284
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,950
He stayed here with her ever since.

285
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,320
No matter what,

286
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,780
this is the hometown of the Sigu Sect.

287
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,510
Xiao Zijin wants to marry Qiao Wanmian

288
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,040
and hold their wedding here.

289
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,330
How is that appropriate?

290
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,170
Li Xiangyi has been dead for ten years.

291
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,570
The Sigu Sect was long gone.

292
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:00,700
Things have changed.

293
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,430
Be it a relative or a friend, we all need to move on.

294
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,180
Sigu Sect was not an ordinary sect in the martial world.

295
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,980
Li Xiangyi was also the embodiment of justice and chivalry.

296
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,950
I have no intention

297
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,190
of intervening in the wedding.

298
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,720
But if the old residence of Sigu Sect

299
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,530
allows the disbanding of Sigu Sect

300
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,700
and intends to erase traces of Li Xiangyi's legacy,

301
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,980
I will be the first one to refuse.

302
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,790
That's right.

303
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,780
Chaos has yet to descend upon the martial world,

304
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,569
but there are signs of trouble everywhere.

305
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:24,450
Sigu Sect was born out of the passion

306
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,140
to instill justice in the martial world.

307
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,470
It should not be forgotten at this moment.

308
00:17:28,869 --> 00:17:29,730
Have you heard?

309
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,500
Di Feisheng, the villain head of the Jinyuan Alliance

310
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,460
has recovered from his old injuries.

311
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,490
He's establishing his prestige everywhere.

312
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,690
He even declared war on Baichuan Court.

313
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,450
Do you think

314
00:17:36,869 --> 00:17:38,150
the Jinyuan Alliance

315
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,150
will come and mess up the wedding?

316
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,100
Your old injury

317
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,390
doesn't look too bad.

318
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,200
I've prescribed a prescription for removing blood stasis.

319
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,330
You need to let go of your past records.

320
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,030
Ten coins.

321
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,010
Ten coins for a stupid prescription?

322
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,920
Such a lucrative business.

323
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,840
What a coincidence.

324
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,820
This kind of nonsense

325
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,640
is worthless, my friend.

326
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:10,930
Let me remind you.

Don't be fooled again.

331
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:21,940
come and have a look.

332
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,070
Come and have a look.

333
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,330
Come and have a look.

334
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:25,800
Come.

Come and have a look.

336
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,590
This man

337
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,660
calls himself a miracle physician.

338
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,920
But he has no benevolence or compassion.

339
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,420
He lies through his teeth

340
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,410
and deceives you with no remorse.

341
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,070
You'd be a fool to believe him.

when I booked the whole inn?

388

you will pay for the expenses

424

Mr. Li,

I've figured out the Nanyin Script

434
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,760
you asked me to check last time.

435
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,320
But, there are many people here.

436
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,580
Let's go out for a walk.

437
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,270
Wait.

438
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,190
Senior Li.

439
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,210
I have a question for you.

440
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,200
I have a patient

441
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,140
who suffers from poison-induced madness.

442
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,730
He said he saw ghosts in the day

443
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,140
and was often in a panicked state.

444
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,370
He also couldn't sleep at night.

445
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:56,660
Later, he started killing people

446
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,890
and became extremely irritable.

447
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,080
I have prescribed medication for several days

448
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,210
and pierced his acupoints with silver needles.

449
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,380
But even now, there's no sign of improvement.

450
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,860
If the patient is from the martial world

451
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,330
and has decent inner power,

452
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:08,550
you can try to process fresh tiger palms

453
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:10,670
and let the patient eat it.

454
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,660
The tiger palm is extremely poisonous.

455
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,370
It should not be taken without proper preparation.

456
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:15,910
This is undoubtedly a risky gamble of strength

457
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,280
between the poison and the patient's inner power.

458
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,190
Such a gamble is as good as murder.

459
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,980
It's just fighting fire with fire.

460
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,370
If the patient wants to be sober,

461
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,500
they can take a risk.

462
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,980
If the patient lacks inner power,

463
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,310
I suggest consuming the

464
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,450
tiger palm after soaking it in medicinal soup.

465
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,970
Although the tiger palm is highly poisonous,

466
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:31,700
it can delay or shorten the time of frenzy.

467
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,250
When treating people and saving lives,

468
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,860
you can't suggest a treatment you're not certain of.

469
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,760
How can you be sure that

470
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,560
the patient won't die after taking the tiger palm?

471
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,000
I can't be sure of that.

472
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,930
You're disregarding human lives!

Guan,

as long as someone can detoxify the poison with pure inner power,

475
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,550
the patient won't be in danger.

476
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:55,010
How many people in the world have such power?

477
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,160
Pure inner power must be referring to Yangzhouman.

How can he bring Li Xiangyi back to life?

479

This method of using one's life to test the poison

480
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,170
is so cruel and vicious.

00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,940
The people going in and out of Mumian Villa recently

514
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,220
are all from the martial world.

515
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,480
Better safe than sorry.

516
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:41,860
That's right.

517
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:44,330
I heard that the scenery of Mumian Villa

518
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,390
is really amazing.

519
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,260
I just want to see it myself.

520
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,120
I don't know if I can go in.

521
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,360
Why didn't you ask me?

522
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,930
I was about to visit Sister Qiao.

523
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,650
You know Miss Qiao?

524
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,270
Guan is close to Mr. Xiao.

525
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,180
I got to know Miss Qiao when they

526
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,440
brought me to Qingfeng Peak to sightsee.

527
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,020
Back then,

528
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,390
she waited for ten years

529
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,530
to confirm the death of Li Xiangyi.

530
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,760
She even built a cenotaph for him.

531
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,530
Ten years.

532
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,580
That's such a long time.

533
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,180
And yet, Mr. Xiao kept by her side

534
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,440
with such devotion.

535
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,490
It's not easy for them

536
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,660
to finally marry each other.

537
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,330
The person of the past has died.

538
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,270
The living

539
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:34,060
should cherish the present life.

540
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:37,250
By the way,

541
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,630
you mentioned you've figured out the Nanyin Script.

542
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,240
I was looking for a chance to give it to you.

543
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,170
I almost forgot.

544
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,320
Look.

545
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,140
This is the meaning of the Nanyin Script.

546
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:48,880
[Burn your body]

547
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,050
[Suiyan. A mark of a fiend from Nanyin. This mark represents revenge and devour.]

548
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,780
[Statue of the Suiyan fiend]

549
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,870
Burn your body.

550
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,910
It's like a sacrificial text.

551
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,240
Do you know its origin?

552
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,840
Grandpa said the same thing.

553
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:08,550
Unfortunately, there are too few historical records

554
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,610
about Nanyin.

555
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:12,690
He hasn't found anything about its background and origin.

556
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:13,530
However,

557
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,030
look at this.

558
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,670
He found the mark you drew.

559
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,560
This mark is called Suiyan.

560
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,880
It's said to be the mark of a fiend in Nanyin.

561
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,290
This mark represents revenge and devour.

562
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,020
Grandpa said

563
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,270
it's the same as a sacrificial poem.

564
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,940
He's investigating it in this direction.

565
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,150
Revenge and devour.

566
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,600
What does the Jinyuan Alliance want?

567
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,780
What is the connection between the Nanyin Script,

568
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,240
the Nanyin Incense, and the death of Senior?

569
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:48,800
Sister Qiao.

570
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,060
Sister Qiao.

571
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,060
Xiaoyong.

572
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:57,710
Mr. Li.

573
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,510
Why are you here together?

574
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,010
It's Sister Qiao's wedding day.

575
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,780
Of course, I need to come and absorb some festive luck.

576
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,840
Mr. Li is also here.

577
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:05,220
I...

578
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,010
So Mr. Li

579
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:12,310
is the one in your heart?

580
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,300
Mr. Li

581
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,740
is a very good person.

582
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:18,870
Sister Qiao.

583
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,170
Tomorrow is the wedding.

584
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:20,970
Are you happy?

585
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,360
Of course I am.

586
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,530
It's rare to meet your other half.

587
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,190
Congratulations, Miss Qiao.

588
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,260
I brought some wedding candies as a gift.

589
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,320
It's nothing much.

590
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,860
Thank you, sir.

591
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:50,190
It's very considerate of you.

592
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,240
I've heard a lot about this villa's great scenery.

593
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,110
May I

594
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,920
stroll the villa on my own?

595
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:58,900
Sure, Mr. Li.

596
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:01,790
Just leave Xiaoyong here to chat with me.

597
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,230
Sister Qiao.

598
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:13,050
Mr. Li is not good at talking and socializing.

599
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,450
Sister Qiao, please don't be mad at him.

600
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:15,270
The candies

601
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,800
may not be very expensive,

602
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,130
but he must have prepared them sincerely.

603
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,520
I haven't said a thing,

604
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,400
but you're so eager to defend him.

605
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,040
Actually, the wedding candies he gave me

606
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,300
made me feel

607

I kept all his belongings here.

680
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,120
So...

681
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,220
What did you take this time?

682
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,810
Why are you here?

683
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,070
This is

684
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,950
my uncle's old residence.

685
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,330
Is it strange that I came here?

686
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,260
On the contrary,

687
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,790
why did you sneak into

688
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,120
my master's room?

689
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,360
Don't say you were lost again.

690
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,420
It's a rare opportunity.

691
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,310
I'm just here

692
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,240
to enjoy the view of the Sigu Sect.

693
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,980
After viewing the scenery,

694
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,720
it didn't feel that spectacular.

695
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,180
I'm leaving.

696
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,900
You've never been interested in matters of the martial world.

697
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,630
Why are you suddenly interested in the Sigu Sect?

698
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,640
It's a rare opportunity.

699
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,970
It's just a whim.

700
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,860
Can't I do that?

701
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,180
It's strange that you came to Qiao Wanmian's wedding.

702
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,980
You said you were looking for the remains of Shan Gudao.

703
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:07,690
But you knew

704
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,850
Di Feisheng who was missing for ten years.

705
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,710
Now you sneaked here.

706
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,470
This is your real destination.

707
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,400
Li Lianhua.

708
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,060
What do you really want?

709
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,470
Can you be honest?

710
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,400
Are you addicted to solving cases?

711
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,790
I'm not interested in

712
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,220
playing Guess with a kid.

713
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,290
The Jinyuan Alliance must be up to something.

714
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,610
It's related to the Yipin Tomb.

715
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:34,110
[Spirit and Pride]

716
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:31,390
It’s also related to the stolen ice shard.

717
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,850
The death of the Shan Gudao
is also involved.

718
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,170
Don’t think

719
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,350
you're the only one who figured these out.

720
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,760
What do you know?

721
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,380
I know you definitely don't know that

722
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,240
those symbols are not important.

723
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,790
The ice shard is the important one.

724
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,940
You don't know what that is, do you?

725
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,800
Let's make a bet

726
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,490
to see who will find out

727
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,490
the truth behind Jin Mantang first.

728
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:04,510
When did I say I wanted to investigate this?

729
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:05,830
Cut the crap.

730
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:07,530
You...

731
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,480
You're still a kid through and through.

732
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,780
Don't show others

733
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,400
your triumph card so easily.

734
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:15,470
Remember it.

735
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,080
Li Lianhua!

736
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,480
Come back!

737
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,500
You old fox!

738
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:23,370
Xiaoyong.

739
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,350
Can you ask your grandpa to confirm if

740
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,900
this incense is the same as the  Nanyin Incense

741
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,310
from Yuanbao Villa?

742
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,130
This incense remains...

743
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,160
Don't worry.

744
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,450
I can't tell you where the incense remains came from,

745
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,820
but I have no ill intentions.

746
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:44,660
I trust you, Mr. Li.

747
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,620
After we go down the mountain,

748
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,110
I'll pass it to my grandpa with a pigeon.

749
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:47,890
Thank you.

750
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,890
But I have something else

751
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:50,890
to ask you.

752
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,850
I heard that there are thumb-sized items

753
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,920
in Nanyin that looked like ice shards.

754
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,720
It is said that

755
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,680
it's related to

756
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,600
the fiend mark and sacrificial poem.

757
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,330
Have you heard of it?

758
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,600
I'll ask Grandpa about that too.

759
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,620
After the wedding tomorrow,

760
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,820
why don't you stay at Qingfeng Peak

761
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,940
for a few more days?

762
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,350
We can enjoy the beautiful scenery in the mountain

763
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,210
while we wait for Grandpa's news.

764
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,110
Okay.

765
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:23,830
Tomorrow is the wedding.

766
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:26,510
I hope everything goes well.

767
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,469
Congratulations.

768
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,580
Please come in.

769
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,300
Congratulations.

770
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:41,900
Thank you.

771
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,409
Congratulations.

772
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,199
Mr. Xiao.

773
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:07,909
Congratulations.

774
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,200
You came after all.

775
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,440
Come in.

776
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:18,510
Brother Li.

777
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:21,360
Aunt.

778
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,770
Look over there.

779
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:23,900
Li Lianhua.

780
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,230
Mr. Li, how have you been?

781
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,240
Not bad.

782
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,580
He refused to be your wedding company yesterday.

783
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,770
But now he's standing

784
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:32,500
with Miss Su.

785
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,320
He completely disregarded you, the third most

786
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,400
beautiful woman in the Martial world.

787
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,000
-How dare he!
-That’s right.

788
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:38,240
He doesn't know what's good for him.

789
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,420
You have to teach him a lesson.

790
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,550
I won't give up

791
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:41,830
until I get Li Lianhua.

792
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,460
What do you mean get him?

793
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,280
Are you hot, Mr. Li?

794
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,080
Physician Li,

795
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:50,510
I invited you to enjoy the moon and drink with me last night.

796
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,140
But you were already asleep.

797
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,260
Why don't you sit next to me later

798
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,900
and make up for the owed wine?

799
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,020
Ms. He.

800
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,230
I'm not a good drinker.

801
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:03,270
If I got drunk at this banquet,

802
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,590
it would be rude of me.

803
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,420
Mr. Li already said that.

804
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,600
Why are you forcing him, Sister He?

805
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:11,050
Mr. Li, you'd better sit next to me.

806
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:13,290
It's not your turn to talk, Su.

807
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,360
But I want to talk.

808
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,270
Go ahead then.

809
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,530
I said, he must sit with me.

810
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:19,330
-He was going to sit with me.
-Here comes the bride.

811
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,760
She's here.

812
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:56,900
Mian.

813
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,830
You have to be good to yourself.

814
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,300
Come on.

815
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,180
[Peace and Bliss]

816
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,920
Thank you for coming all the way here.

817
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,430
Please forgive me if the reception

818
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:08,630
is not up to standard.

819
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,130
Drink, everyone.

820
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:12,930
Here.

821
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:13,550
Mr. Ji.

822
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:14,750
Happy wedding.

823
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,820
Thank you for coming.

824
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,770
I'll drink to show my respect.

825
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,360
Congratulations.

826
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,830
Brother Ji, have a seat.

827
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,110
Mr. Bai.

828
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,380
Brother Xiao.

829
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,430
Your long-cherished wish has finally come true.

830
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,490
Congratulations.

831
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,440
Brother Bai, you know that

832
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:36,120
Baichuan Court is like a home to Wanmian.

833
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,630
You are like her family.

834
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,970
I don't care what others say.

835
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:41,790
It's enough to receive

836
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,410
her family's blessings.

837
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:44,230
Brother Xiao,

838
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,280
you and Ms. Qiao are a perfect match.

839
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,080
So many people are envious of you two.

840
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,490
Look at all the people who came

841
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:52,420
to celebrate your wedding for you.

842
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,890
You get drunk easily.

843
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,300
Don't drink too much.

844
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:56,860
The wedding wine won't get you drunk. Come on.

845
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,920
That's right.

846
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,280
Have a seat, Mr. Bai.

847
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,970
Miss Shishui.

848
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,020
Look at her.

849
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,580
She has always been impatient.

850
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,940
She even drank the wedding wine first.

851
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:20,030
Miss Shishui has always admired Xiangyi.

852
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:21,440
She doesn't like me.

853
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,500
It doesn't matter.

854
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,370
But Wanmian and I

855
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:25,750
didn't do anything wrong

856
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:26,910
to Xiangyi.

857
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,560
I feel much better today.

858
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,580
Great!

859
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,310
You drink.

860
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:34,550
Here, please.

861
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,070
Have some appetizers.

862
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:37,710
Come on.

863
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,230
Alright, sit down.

864
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,520
Congratulations on your marriage with Ms. Qiao.

865
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:52,230
When Wanmian wrote the invitations,

866
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:53,700
she specifically asked me

867
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,580
to invite you, Physician Li.

868
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,060
She wanted to thank you

869
00:38:57,170 --> 00:39:00,030
for bringing solid news about the death of Xiangyi.

870
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,870
I'm glad too.

871
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,740
-Well…
-Mr. Xiao.

872
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:09,700
Today is a day of celebration

873
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,830
for you and Ms. Qiao.

874
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,870
It has nothing to do with the dead.

875
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:14,400
You should enjoy yourself.

876
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,490
Congratulations.

877
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:19,910
Mr. Xiao,

878
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,290
you're not being very honest.

879
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,970
What do you mean by glad?

880
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,240
What would you have done

881
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:28,450
if Li Xiangyi came back alive?

882
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,700
Please forgive him, Mr. Xiao.

883
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,760
Xiaobao talks nonsense

884
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,070
when he gets drunk.

885
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,930
May you and Ms. Qiao have a long

886
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,080
and happy marriage.

887
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,880
It doesn't matter.

888
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,660
Enjoy yourselves.

889
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,690
Have a seat.

890
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:56,850
Come on.

891
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:57,690
Fang Xiaobao,

892
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:59,370
I know you like Li Xiangyi.

893
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,610
You hate to hear people criticize him.

894
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:01,950
But he's having a wedding.

895
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,550
What are you being so snarky?

896
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,860
To win a beauty's heart, you have to rely on your own ability.

897
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,720
I think you are

898
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,380
just full of mean energy.

899
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,030
Why don't you go outside

900
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,000
and fight in the sparring arena?

901
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,400
Don't make trouble here.

902
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,140
Fine, I don't fancy this wine anyway.

903
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:39,360
Watch your back.

904
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,810
Direct your Qi downward

905
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,370
and turn the tide.

906
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:58,650
Bravo! Bravo!

907
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,880
Good swordsmanship.

908
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:01,490
Good skills.

909
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,620
Di Feisheng is here.

910
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,420
Inform Xiao Zijin immediately.

911
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:20,900
Who is sending messages to help me?

912
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,260
Fang Duobing is fine.

913
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,640
Looks like you've taught him Yangzhouman.

914
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,970
If you had taught him ten years ago,

915
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,440
he could have used his inner power to detoxify you

916
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,500
and save your life.

917
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,220
But now, the Yangzhouman

918
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,240
can only keep him safe.

919
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:53,500
You're not here just to test Fang Duobing.

920
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,830
What are you doing here?

921
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:55,750
I just checked.

922
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:57,960
Prison 188.

923
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,620
The first Heaven Prison is here.

924
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,480
King Xunming of Yama is also here.

925
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:03,050
I'm here to take him away.

926
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:04,910
You can't find the Heaven Prison.

927
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:06,240
You will help me find it.

928
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,720
I don't care how much you love Qiao Wanmian.

929
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,220
I don't kill women.

930
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,370
But I have no problem

931
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:15,810
with killing Xiao Zijin.

932
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,130
I'll take you there.

933
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:25,890
Okay.

934
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:49,690
You may leave.

935
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:50,910
Yes.

936
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,050
Who are you?

937
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:12,710
You're in my way.

938
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,560
I'll draw more cuts on you.

939
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:18,930
Who are you?

940
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:20,720
Sister Qiao!
