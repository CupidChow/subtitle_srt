[Episode 31]

4
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,320
Li Lianhua.

5
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,640
You're awake.

6
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,080
It's indeed effective that Guan Hemeng asked me

7
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,880
to use Yangzhouman on you daily.

8
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,300
How do you feel?

9
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,730
This is Yunyin Mountain.

10
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,700
You should know the way here.

11
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,430
Do you know how to walk up the mountain?

12
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:28,820
I haven't been here for so long that I've forgotten the way.

13
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,640
Let's go. Hurry up.

14
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,500
I have something important to do.

15
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,380
Where are you going now?

16
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,890
Going up the mountain to ask Granny Qin to save your life

17
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,890
is the only important thing for now.

18
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,840
F-Find my master's wife?

19
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,020
Fang Xiaobao,

20
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,050
let me tell you the truth.

21
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,340
I'm going to tell you the truth now,

22
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,540
but you may think I'm lying to you again.

23
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,160
Back then, I was so unfilial

24
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,200
and willful that I pissed my master off, leading to his death.

25
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,040
Now you're taking me to see my master's wife.

26
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,320
What if I infuriate her

27
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,820
when she sees me?

28
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:01,910
Don't fool me.

29
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,579
Guan Hemeng said you...

30
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,470
Guan Hemeng?

31
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,880
Why would you believe Guan Hemeng, that quack?

32
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,360
He might not know the profound theory of Yangzhouman.

33
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,390
Besides,

34
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,810
everyone is afraid of death.

35
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,410
I'm just an ordinary person.

36
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,600
Now you have Yangzhouman to protect you,

37
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,330
and you also know its strength.

38
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,020
Let's go.

39
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,330
The more you talk, the more guilty you are.

40
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,360
I won't believe you no matter what you say.

41
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,850
Now we're at the foot of the mountain.

42
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,240
I've made up my mind to walk up the mountain.

43
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,230
If I can't make it,

44
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,350
I'll just spend my time with you here.

45
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,880
You can't go anywhere else.

46
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,829
The Lord found that I'm a royal member of Nanyin.

47
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:43,520
Also, he asked about the Rama Vessel.

48
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,750
I'm afraid it's only a matter of time for him to find

49
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,960
that I colluded with Wansheng Clan to set him up with Wuxin Huai.

50
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,620
Snow Master, what do you think

51
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,130
the Lord will do to me?

52
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:54,620
Saintess,

53
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,630
aren't you ready?

54
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:57,760
How about

55
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,670
we go the whole hog?

56
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,940
Go the whole hog?

57
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,600
It's been more than ten years.

58
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,430
I'm already exhausted.

59
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,880
He's still not into me.

60
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,750
Send a message to all our people

61
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,330
so that they will take action as soon as I order them to.

62
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,440
As for Zongzheng,

63
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,190
ask him to hand the Rama Vessel to me in person

64
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,470
once he gets it.

65
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:39,980
No one can be trusted.

66
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:40,880
Yes.

67
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,000
Di Feisheng.

68
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,690
You forced me to do this.

69
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,100
Do you think you can win her heart

70
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,860
by stealing the Rama Vessel and Heavenly Ice?

71
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,580
After Jiao Liqiao finishes using you,

72
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,460
you'll only end up being torn apart.

73
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,080
I have no intention of betraying you.

74
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,520
I... I was bewitched by the siren.

75
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,610
For the sake of the close relationship

76
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,330
between the Zongzheng family and the imperial court,

77
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,540
please spare my life.

78
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,300
I've got my people all over the court.

79
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,040
Without you, a traitor,

80
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,210
what's the big deal?

81
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,409
Even if I didn't tell you,

82
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:53,409
you would have already noticed this fool.

83
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:54,300
Of course you won't let him

84
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,980
take action under your nose.

85
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,270
You told me

86
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,010
about the scheme between Zongzheng and Jiao Liqiao.

87
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,020
In other words,

88
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,390
compared to well-matched rivals,

89
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,560
you hate those who betray you more.

90
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,470
I'm just giving them a taste of their own medicine.

91
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,650
You said you want to cooperate with the Wansheng Clan.

92
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,000
Are you trying to

93
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,830
collect the debt from the Wansheng Clan?

94
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,380
The victories and defeats are all in the past.

95
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,910
Since we want to cooperate,

96
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,900
let's not talk about the past anymore.

97
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,140
I established the Jinyuan Alliance for only one purpose.

98
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,530
It is to be the top martial artist.

99
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,550
The top of the martial arts world is what I want

100
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,750
but not what you want.

101
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,320
I'm not interested in what you want.

102
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,460
Now both of us

103
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,040
each has a Rama Heavenly Ice.

104
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,770
Without one of us, no one can open the Rama Vessel.

105
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,090
So you and I are the best partners for now.

106
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:48,970
Okay.

107
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,570
Di Feisheng.

108
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,810
You're the one who cornered me.

109
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,980
Why don't I add more Wuxin Huai

110
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,800
and turn you into a good-for-nothing completely?

111
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,670
Di Feisheng.

112
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,460
Be good and wait for me to arrange everything for you.

113
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,500
What's it like to breathe Wuxin Huai in?

114
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:56,730
My Lord.

115
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,530
I hate being set up the most in my life.

116
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,659
Ten years ago, in the battle at the East Sea,

117
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,159
you attacked the alliance with thundering fire bombs, right?

118
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,290
So you knew it.

119
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,540
The 12 Guardians were all dead.

120
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,410
The Jinyuan Alliance collapsed.

121
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:22,350
I fell into the sea after being seriously injured and stayed in seclusion for ten years.

122
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,050
You then took over the Jinyuan Alliance

123
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,490
step by step.

124
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,020
You have ambitions and means.

125
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:29,690
But today,

126
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,320
it's time to settle the score.

127
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,560
So you recall everything.

128
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,030
You liar!

129
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,300
It was my miscalculation.

130
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,320
Why didn't you ask me the reason I did it?

131
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,210
Why didn't you ask me

132
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,299
who I was scheming so hard for?

133
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,559
Don't say it's for me.

134
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,210
I insist on saying that.

135
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,280
The 12 Guardians

136
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,780
just joined the Jinyuan Alliance before me.

137
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:01,110
Their looks and means

138
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,300
were no match for me.

139
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,300
Why could they get to be around you?

140
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,230
When they looked at you for another glance,

141
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,220
I would like to dig their eyes out.

142
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,210
If I didn't get rid of them,

143
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,700
how could you notice me?

144
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,890
The Sigu Sect and the Jinyuan Alliance had always been well-matched.

145
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,410
But all you cared about was

146
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,170
fighting against Li Xiangyi for the first place.

147
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,900
You knew I hated him the most,

148
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,950
but he was all you remember in this world.

149
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,590
What about me?

150
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,400
So I got rid of the Jinyuan Alliance

151
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,880
and Sigu Sect together.

152
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,660
Also, I got rid of Li Xiangyi for you.

153
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:38,980
Yes.

154
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,710
The arrangement was not perfect.

155
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,970
I wouldn't want you to get hurt.

156
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,420
I would feel the same pain as you if you got hurt.

157
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,310
So I found you immediately and saved you.

158
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,980
When you went into seclusion to heal your injuries,

159
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,380
I found the most precious medicine for you.

160
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,130
I rebuilt the Jinyuan Alliance

161
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,860
and waited for you to come back.

162
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,300
I waited every day,

163
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,840
and I got back

164
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,470
everything you lost.

165
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,670
When the Rama Vessel is opened,

166
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,750
I'll give you the title of the top martial artist

167
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,190
that you want.

168
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,740

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,520
gradually,

340
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,380
Senior did take more and more punishments.

341
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,360
You are so flighty and impetuous.

342
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,280
You are not allowed to practise new moves today.

343
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,160
Go face the wall and ponder about your misdeeds.

344
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,070
Senior.

345
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,460
I won.

346
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,200
Master.

347
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,320
It's the same attack.

348
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,930
You can dodge it without using it.

349
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,570
Why did you do that just now?

350
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,470
Martial arts practitioners value sincerity the most.

351
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,270
If you lose the match on purpose,

352
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,070
you are not only looking down on your opponent

353
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,120
but also yourself.

354
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,620
I don't need you to lose on purpose.

355
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,280
Li Xiangyi.

356
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,740
Don't look down on me.

357
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,410
After that,

358
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,260
I never lost on purpose.

359
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,170
I thought

360
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,980
he wouldn't be angry anymore.

361
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,000
But he has been

362
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,020
hiding his feelings all along.

363
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,950
I just never realised it.

364
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:25,770
After that,

365
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,870
Madam and Master had a fierce fight and didn't give in to each other.

366
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:34,530
So they decided to make a bet

367
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,200
to see who can teach the better disciple.

368
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,620
The two of them drew lots.

369
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:42,990
I

370
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,010
followed Master.

371
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,370
Madam took Senior away.

372
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:51,930
They had a deal.

373
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,540
The deal

374
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,420
was to compete once a month.

375
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,870
Since then,

376
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,030
my father lost to you every time.

377
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:05,350
I'm afraid he hates you even more.

378
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,300
Maybe

379
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,350
I've never been right.

380
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,350
It's not your fault.

381
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,280
Life is about self-deliverance.

382
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,050
Some can see past it,

383
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,680
but some can't.

384
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,860
When I was young,

385
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,850
I met Bhante Wuliao.

386
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:32,490
He always said I had no Bodhisattva tree in my heart.

387
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:34,610
At that time,

388
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,140
I was arrogant

389
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,130
and didn't take his words seriously.

390
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,290
But after thinking deeply, I realised

391
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,150
some people join the martial world

392
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,900
to cultivate their mind.

393
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,610
Some people enter the martial world

394
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,700
to cultivate a meaningful life.

395
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,050
But I don't know

396
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,160
what I really want.

397
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,050
Li Xiangyi is a martial arts genius.

398
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,100
No.1 in the world.

399
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,890
I don't know how others think of him,

400
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,770
but becoming someone like him

401
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,660
has been my dream since childhood.

402
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:15,280
I was shallow and superficial when I was younger.

403
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,380
Naturally the friends around me

404
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,530
were also like that.

405
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,130
But in my heart,

406
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,530
Senior always held a special place.

407
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,750
But at the end of the day,

408
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,440
I never did my best in this relationship.

409
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,650
Then you should blame yourself.

410
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,440
In my opinion,

411
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,250
I should be the one reflecting on myself.

412
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,450
My mother once told me

413
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,060
getting along with others

414
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,060
is like drinking.

415
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,770
Cup after cup.

416
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,980
Each taking turns.

417
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,800
No matter more or less,

418
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:54,540
both parties have to drink to our will to enjoy it.

419
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:55,930
But I forgot

420
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,320
you and I

421
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,820
have already been honest with each other.

422
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,860
There's no need to show every inch of ourselves to each other.

423
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:09,250
That's how people get along as well.

424
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,260
Whether it's being caring,

425
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,530
or drinking together.

426
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,460
I've passed the obstacles and drunk the wine.

427
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,260
I don't think Madam

428
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,120
will be coming back anytime soon.

429
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,350
Instead of just waiting here,

430
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,360
why don't we

431
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:30,830
come another day?

432
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,980
She doesn't live here at all, does she?

433
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,150
Although the place has been kept clean,

434
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,080
there are no traces of anyone living here.

435
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,210
When I first came in,

436
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:47,940
I found pine needles on the ground

437
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,470
that didn't come from here.

438
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,420
I think

439
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:53,380
it must have been left behind by the people who come here to clean.

440
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,220
I did see the woods are full of pine trees

441
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,880
over there by the south peaks.

442
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:57,940
That must be

443
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,920
where Madam Qin really is.

444
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,700
How dare you fool around with something related to your life?

445
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,760
It's getting late.

446
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:07,870

[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

449
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,910
You even know about this place?

450
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,860
The people you have locked up here

451
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,800
are martial artists who have once followed you.

452
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,420
You tested poison on them,

453
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,760
and tested medicine on them.

454
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,950
They were tortured beyond recognition by you.

455
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,210
If I were in your hands,

456
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,250
I would have ended up like this too.

457

You're wrong.

458
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,940
I love you so much.

459
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,670
How could I ever bear to leave you here,

460

with how much I love you?

461

Of course I will

keep you by my side forever.

463

I will feed you my strongest poison

00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:37,680
It's you.

511
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,980
It's really the voice of Xiangyi.

512
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,560
Xiangyi?

513
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,580
This unfilial disciple

514
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,500
greets Madam.

515
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,460
Xiangyi.

516
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,180
Where have you been all these years?

517
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,610
Madam Qin,

518
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,800
Li Xiangyi was badly injured in the fight

519
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,940
with Jinyuan Alliance ten years ago.

520
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,380
Now he's been poisoned by Bicha Poison.

521
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,550
After enduring for all these years,

522
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,280
he doesn't have much time left.

523
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,760
Please help him.

524
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,750
Poisoned?

525
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,970
Let's talk inside. Let's go.

526
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,270
Is this boy your disciple?

527
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,400
He's talented.

528
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,820
Madam, he is not my disciple.

529
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,820
I didn't teach him anything too.

530
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,640
Come, sit down.

531
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:31,980
Xiangyi.

532
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,430
If your master knows, even in the netherworld,

533
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,390
that you came back to Yunyin Mountain,

534
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,050
he would have been very happy.

535
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,150
You are his favorite disciple.

536
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:44,190
When he found out about what happened to you,

537
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,230
he was devastated.

538
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,380
He was in great pain.

539
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,410
He didn't want to see anyone.

540
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:50,860
He locked himself up

541
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,940
and told the public that he was practicing martial arts in seclusion.

542
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,380
But soon after,

543
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:01,630
he lost his mind and passed away.

544
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,610
After I recovered,

545
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,090
I came back once.

546
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,280
I was too ashamed to enter

547
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,400
when I learned the Master passed away.

548
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:18,490
Silly child.

549
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,820
This is the reason you didn't dare come back here?

550
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,720
I'm unfilial

551
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,010
and caused him to suffer.

552
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,080
This is also our fault.

553
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:35,290
I fought with your master for half my life.

554
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,500
Only at the brink of death

555
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,050
did I realise

556
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,250
that I can't bear to leave him.

557
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,760
I can't bear to leave you too.

558
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,650
And Shan Gudao.

559
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,850
When all of you left,

560
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,100
now that I think back on it, I feel so regretful.

561
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,850
I made you suffer so much.

562
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:58,900
Madam,

563
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,820
I'm fine now.

564
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:04,300
That's good.

565
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,530
It's good that you're back.

566
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,200
I won't let you suffer anymore.

567
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,120
I know the method that

568
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,860
Guan Hemeng mentioned.

569
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,590
Don't worry.

570
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:18,110
I'll cure your poison.

571
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:30,420
Please don't think about it.

572
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:33,350
I don't want you to save me with your life.

573
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:36,620
Guan Hemeng told Fang Duobing that you can save me

574
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:38,300
because your inner power

575
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,360
is similar to mine.

576
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,700
But if you force the Bicha Poison

577
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,030
into your own body using your inner power,

578
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:46,820
it's just a life for a life.

579
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:47,970
Madam.

580
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,350
I don't want to do it.

581
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,620
If Master knew about this,

582
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,180
he would never agree.

583
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,860
Come on, child. Get up.

584
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,130
Get up first.

585
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:09,870
Xiangyi, if your master knows in the netherworld,

586
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,240
he would have agreed for me to do it.

587
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,550
Even if he is alive,

588
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,270
he will also save you with his life,

589
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,660
because your parents are his saviors.

590
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,890
I am repaying kindness for your master

591
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:28,460
by saving you today.

592
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,060
Li Xiangyi.

593
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,360
What are you doing?

594
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:43,159
Are you going to kill yourself in front of me?

595
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,120
Madam.

596
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:50,600
Everyone has his own fate.

597
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:54,179
There are things that you don't need to force.

598
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,650
How can I feel at ease?

599
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,659
How can Master feel at ease?

600
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,060
Fine.

601
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,060
If you don't want us to save you,

602
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,050
then stay here and recuperate

603
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,100
and let me take care of you.

604
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:12,739
Madam.

605
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,390
There are still some things

606
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,200
that need to be settled by myself.

607
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:22,260
You need to let me give you some of my Genuine Qi

608
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,780
so that you can protect yourself at critical times.

609
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,460
Also,

610
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:29,410
can you fool

611
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,330
the one standing there?

612
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:34,910
So please

613
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,360
keep it a secret for me.

614
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:53,820
How are you?

615
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,190
I'm fine now.

616
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:05,170
The poison has just been cleared. He is not allowed to fight.

617
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,300
You're alright now?

618
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,380
The poison has been cleared and everything is fine?

619
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,130
It's all thanks to your Granny Qin.

620
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:11,330
Now my inner power

621
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,540
has just recovered twenty or thirty percent.

622
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,340
Yes.

623
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,950
That's why we need to take good care of him.

624
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:19,900
It's my fault.

625
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,900
I was too happy to care about anything else.

626
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,430
Thank you for reminding me.

627
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,440
In my opinion,

628
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,570
since Madam Qin can clear this Bicha Poison,

629
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,430
why didn't you come back earlier?

630
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:33,650
I'm just lucky.

631
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,380
Madam used years

632
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,310
of her power to create an antidote

633
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,430
in her earlier years.

634
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,300
Now the poison was only removed

635
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,630
together with the help of her inner power.

636
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:47,010
That's why I'm recovering well now.

637
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,030
Right, Madam?

638
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:48,580
I see.

639
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:51,900
Yes.

640
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,750
I spent

641
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,380
more than ten years

642
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,880
to make this antidote.

643
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,180
Just this one and you've used it.

644
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,540
Don't forget your promise.

645
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,340
I'll give you one month

646
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,020
to go down the mountain and settle your affairs.

647
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,470
You must come back to inherit the sect afterwards.

648
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,670
No other allowances.

649
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:12,980
Got it, Madam.

650
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:20,150
Why do you need to promise her?

651
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,670
Do you see why I don't come back?

652
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,020
As you can see,

653
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,180
my Madam's temperamental.

654
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,640
She asked me to inherit the sect as soon as I came back.

655
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,500
I have to stay in Yunyin Mountain.

656
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,340
Although I survived,

657
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,030
I lost my freedom.

658
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:36,960
Anyway,

659
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,100
your health always comes first.

660
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,380
As long as you are well, there is still hope.

661
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,020
Besides,

662
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,840
she didn't tell you

663
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,700
that you must stay in Yunyin Mountain forever.

664
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,300
Speaking of the sect.

665
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,410
Fang Duobing.

666
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,290
You are now a descendant of Yunyin Mountain.

667
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:54,000
Why don't you kowtow and serve tea to your Granny Qin,

668
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,410
and me, your master today?

669
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,200
From now on, Yunyin Mountain will depend on you.

670
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,740
It was just a joke when I said I wanted to be your disciple.

671
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,400
How can you take it seriously?

672
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,390
You brat, are you trying to deny it?

673
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,740
I remember you said you were my disciple

674
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,380
when we first met at Lingshan.

675
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,070
What a joke.

676
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,240
Given my age, you want me to kowtow to you?

677
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,100
In your dreams!

678
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,180
Don't try to deny it.

679
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:36,720
What are you doing here,

680
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,980
not resting properly?

681
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,350
Have a taste.

682
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,550
This porridge

683
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:43,460
is made from Tofieldia Thibetica of Yunyin Mountain.

684
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,920
It's good for your injury.

685
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:45,760
Injury?

686
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,520
Just eat it.

687
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,660
Stop talking.

688
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,620
It tastes good today.

689
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,960
When did it taste bad?

690
00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:00,150
Are you really not going back to your past identity?

691
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,510
Fang Xiaobao.

692
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,560
Look at Yunyin Mountain.

693
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:09,110
The young sprouts grow and the new trees grow.

694
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,470
The martial arts world is the same.

695
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,670
Who can explain

696
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,580
what will happen in the future?

697
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,820
There's so much hustle and bustle in the martial arts world.

698
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,680
There will always be new legends.

699
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,160
Young Master Fang,

700
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,850
there are few empty rooms on the mountain.

701
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:40,320
This is where Shan Gudao lived when he practiced martial arts.

702
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,450
Please bear with it.

703
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,620
Madam Qin,

704
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,710
what kind of person is he?

705
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,920
Back then, he and Li Xiangyi founded Sigu Sect together.

706
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,650
But people in the martial world

707
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,740
seem vague on their opinions of him.

708
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:54,600
Shan Gudao looks easy-going on the surface,

709
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,650
but he's willing to hide himself.

710
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,660
He's actually a very competitive person.

711
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,000
He is not quite tolerant of others.

712
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,130
In his fight with Li Xiangyi that year,

713
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,260
he was willing to use

714
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:08,060
whatever it took to win, even unorthodox methods.

715
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:10,040
He passed early.

716
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,220
It's my fault

717
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,770
I didn't bring him to a broader path.

718
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,470
It's getting late.

719
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,500
Rest early.

720
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:18,730
Thank you, Madam Qin.

721
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:40,460
[Yunyin Mountain]

722
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,250
Nanyin's Three Magical Techniques,

723
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,510
Asura Grass, Wuxin Huai, and Karmic Bug.

724
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,030
These were passed down the royal family of Nanyin.

725
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,890
The night before Nanyin was overturned,

726
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,940
Princess Longxuan married Crown Prince Fangji

727
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,340
and became Consort Xuan.

728
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:56,200
Consort Xuan secretly initiated the revival of Nanyin

729
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,130
and plotted using the Rama Vessel.

730
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,730
The imperial clan prince conspired and killed Emperor Xicheng,

731
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:03,180
and the Empress of Prince Fangji declared herself as the Emperor.

732
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:06,510
Consort Xuan was sentenced to be buried with Prince Fangji.

733
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,600
Rama Heavenly Ice and Emperor Guangqing.

734
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,560
These should be my father's handwriting as well.

735
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,340
It seems that he had been investigating

736
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,470
Nanyin when he was in Yunyin Mountain.

737
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:23,300
So, he has been investigating these.

738
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:26,060
The answer is in this box.

739
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,380
There's a lock

740
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,450
and self-destruction mechanism.

741
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:31,380
I dare not try it.

742
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,940
This is Nanyin Script.

743
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,260
Yes.

744
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:43,180
These patterns are the same as the one on Consort Xuan's grave.

745
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,900
It should be her symbol as the Princess of Nanyin.

746
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,900
Since it's her private belongings,

747
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:50,560
try her birthday.

748
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:53,030
[In the year of Ren Yin, Wu Shen month, Geng Jia day, at the hour of Geng Chen.]

749
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:53,030
[Princess Longxuan]

750
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:07,050
There's even a translation manual.

751
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,170
To the magician.

752
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:09,790
This is

753
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,790
a letter from Consort Xuan to magician Feng Ah Lu.

754
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:17,850
Miss Su said

755
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,860
Nanyin magicians are the ones

756
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:22,870
in charge of keeping and controlling the Karmic Bugs.

757
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:29,390
I married the Crown Prince of Fangji with hatred.

758
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,260
I had already settled in the Central Plains,

759
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,890
but I misplaced my trust in the bad guys.

760
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:35,430
The imperial clan prince fought for the crown with Crown Prince Fangji,

761
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:38,190
so I was incarcerated with Crown Prince Fangji

762
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:39,870
and have no chance of survival.

763
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:42,760
I can only try my best to send my son to safety.

764
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,410
I hope that you will think of  continuing the Nanyin royal bloodline

765
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:49,060
and hurry to the bamboo forest outside the city to meet my son.

766
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,860
Contact Jin, Yu, Huang, and Quan

767
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,180
to fulfill my unfinished wish

768
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:55,300
and restore the country of Nanyin.

769
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:58,580
Consort Xuan has been trying to revive Nanyin

770
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,230
and set up such a powerful foundation.

771
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:02,680
But this Feng Ah Lu

772
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:05,040
didn't meet Consort Xuan's son back then.

773
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,240
The wealth acquired to revive Nanyin and the Rama Heavenly Ice

774
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,070
were divided by Jin, Yu, Huang, and Quan.

775
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:11,800
Maybe something happened.

776
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:13,820
But now,

777
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,940
the descendants of Consort Xuan

778
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,260
must have been found by the people of Nanyin,

779
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:21,180
otherwise these letters wouldn't be here.

780
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:22,340
You mean

781
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:26,180
my father is the descendant of Consort Xuan,

782
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,410
the royal bloodline of Nanyin?
