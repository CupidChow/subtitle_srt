00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,950
It doesn't seem like she has been beaten up.

00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,150
But Young Master Guo,

6
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,910
what happened

7
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,310
before the bride died?

8
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,500
Nothing special.

9
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,650
After dinner that night,

10
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,360
Su went back to her room alone to try on the wedding dress again.

11
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,280
After the bride went back to her room,

12
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,930
nobody knew what happened?

13
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,780
Didn't the bride have a maid?

14
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,820
The bride lost the wedding shoes her mom made.

15
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,820
Her maid

16
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,540
went to her parents' home to take the wedding shoes a few days ago.

17
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:22,340
Actually, our Guo family's ancestral wedding dress

18
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,720
is accompanied with wedding shoes.

19
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,170
But according to local customs,

20
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,370
if the bride doesn't wear the wedding shoes her mom made

21
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,810
when she gets married,

22
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,380
it will be inauspicious.

23
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,110
She was not used to being served.

24
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,440
So she didn't ask other maids to serve her.

25
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,170
Who knew

26
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,260
something like this would happen?

27
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,940
How was the body found?

28
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,670
It was found under the bridge in the manor

29
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,440
by a servant.

30
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,980
The bodies of two wives my father remarried

31
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,540
were found there too.

32
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,980
Maybe the pond there is deep.

33
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,070
The long grass makes the shore slippery.

34
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,790
That's why they accidentally lost their footing.

35
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,920
What a coincidence.

36
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,950
These bodies

37
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,579
were found at the same place.

38
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,420
But according to the file, the way the bride died

39
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,780
is the same as the one in this coffin.

40
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,820
However,

41

43
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,340
Didn't the daughter of the escort agency

44
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,420
know how to swim?

45
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,490
Since she knew how to swim,

46
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,180
why did she drown?

47
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,680
The maid said the bride drank some wine that night.

48
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,410
On the night before the wedding,

49
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,670
the bride was drunk in her wedding dress.

50
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,920
Don't you think it's strange?

51
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,530
Why didn't I think of it?

52
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,230
Could it be that she didn't die accidentally

53
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,160
but was killed by someone?

54

But she just came to Cailian Manor not long ago.

are the same.

what we can find in this room.

Look at this.

00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,700
What's wrong?

94
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,270
I'm good at calligraphy and painting

95
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,720
and have read many books.

96
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,070
Let me explain it to you.

97
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,870
Look at this painting.

98
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,760
Its stroke style and ink movement

99
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,830
are basically the same as that one.

100
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,810
So I can conclude

101
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,159
this painting was also drawn by Shi Hu

102
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,010
Besides, the paper used for this painting

103
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,690
is batik rice paper in a moire pattern

104
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,350
interspersed with gold dust.

105
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,780
If I'm not mistaken,

106
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,220
this should be the work of Hanyue Studio.

107
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,620
When I was young, it was popular for a while.

108
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,900
It was about ten years ago.

109
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,540
But the paper was not well dip-dyed by ink washes.

110
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,540
It hasn't been released since then.

111
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,040
So these two paintings

112
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,660
were indeed drawn by Shi Hun at the same time.

113
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,700
It should be in May or June ten years ago.

114
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,440
Because this paper has a name

115
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,970
called May Gold Rice Paper.

116
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,670
That means

117
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,300
when Miss Qiao received

118
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,900
Shi Hun's safe letter,

119
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,360
it was in May ten years ago.

120
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,340
In that case,

121
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,020
Shi Hun has been missing

122
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,980
since then.

123

The mirror is formed.

126

127

What does it mean?

128
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,580
Look.

129
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:00,460
Why are these flowers and trees so messy?

130
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,780
The other painting

131
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,730
is very neat.

132
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,610
Have you found all?

133
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,980
In this room,

134
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,260
only these two paintings are drawn by Shi Hun?

135
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,880
These are the only ones we can find now.

136
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,780
Why are you so rude?

137
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,090
How dare you break into my backyard?

138
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,020
F... F... Father.

139
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,510
You're getting more and more bold.

140
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,980
This is the old residence of my late wife Xu.

141
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,020
I respect you as heroes of Baichuan Academy.

142
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,440
So I treat you well.

143
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,580
I didn't expect you to be so rude.

144
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,409
You're such a liar.

145
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,020
Is this your courtesy?

146
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,810
What do you mean?

147
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,620
Since you've never seen Shi Hun,

148
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:52,150
why do his calligraphy and paintings appear in this room?

149
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:55,810
I remember it now.

150
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,710
So the Shi Hun you're looking for

151
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,570
is that person.

152
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,020
Ten years ago,

153
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,580
before Madam Xu married me,

154
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,590
she saved a person.

155
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,780
But he stayed in Cailian Manor for two or three days

156
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,580
and then left.

157
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,980
It's been a long time.

158
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,270
I almost forgot it.

159
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,220
Master Guo.

160
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,410
He left.

161
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,610
Where did he go?

162
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,700
I don't know.

163
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,660
As for this painting,

164
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,530
he probably drew it

165
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,360
to thank Madam Xu for saving him.

166
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,220
It has been here for so many years.

167
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,289
In that case,

168
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,030
Shi Hun indeed

169
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:35,990
lived in Cailian Manor for a while.

170
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,520
The murders in the manor

171
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,309
have nothing to do with him.

172
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,280
We were wrong about it.

173
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:43,890
Of course.

174
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,620
I told you

175
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,930
these were accidents.

176
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,810
All of you have checked it today.

177
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,480
You should believe it.

178
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,290
We think too much.

179
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,430
I have a favor to ask.

180
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,020
Detective Fang

181
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,940
has never been used to the noise in inns.

182
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,930
May he stay here for a night?

183
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,880
We only serve poets and artists.

184
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,340
What a coincidence.

185
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,100
I love poetry.

186
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,180
I'll write a Lotus poem for Master Guo

187
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,150
for tonight's stay.

188
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,570
Will you say no?

189
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,910
Cailian Manor has always been upright.

190
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,740
We'll open the door to welcome poets.

191
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,460
You can stay here.

192
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,580
Thank you.

193
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,210
Thank you.

194
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,370
Back then, the Thousand Shadows Traceless sect was powerful.

195
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,830
But Shi Hun wasn't that good at martial arts.

196
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,180
He covered it up.

197
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,220
What Thousand Shadows Traceless?

198
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,220
What Shi Hun?

199
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,750
What are you talking about?

200
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,340
Ten years ago,

201
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,340
in the East Sea battle, after Jinyuan Alliance

202
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,370
was defeated,

203
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,820
the Central Plain martial arts world wiped out their force.

204
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,870
Thousand Shadows Traceless

205
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,630
was the most powerful organization.

206
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,820
But I heard from Miss Qiao

207
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,290
that Shi Hun

208
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,130
was targeted by them at that time.

209
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,260
When he was injured,

210
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,550
he just rested for two days and then left.

211
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,590
I think

212
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,200
there must be something wrong.

213
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,330
That means Shi Hun didn't leave at all.

214
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,290
Guo Qian lied.

215
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,650
Yes. Mr. Fang.

216
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,080
You've made progress.

217
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:25,940
Since you know it,

218
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,140
why did you stop me from asking him more?

219
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,870
How could someone who deliberately concealed it

220
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,110
tell you the truth?

221
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:32,880
Wait.

222
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,740
Can you make it clear?

223
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,270
Don't talk in riddles in front of me, okay?

224
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,460
Ignorant.

225
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,930
Who is ignorant?

226
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,500
Calm down. Calm down.

227
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,700
Well.

228
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,940
It was ten years ago.

229
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,100
Back then, you were still young.

230
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,580
It's my fault for not telling you clearly.

231
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,380
It's my fault.

232
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,270
Let's go.

233
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,160
Can't you talk properly?

234
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,790
This is where the three bodies were found.

235
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,620
Besides the long grass on the slippery shore

236
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,400
indeed making it easy for people to fall into the water,

237
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,200
there seems to be nothing wrong.

238
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,990
But after all this time,

239
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,410
if there are any clues,

240
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,020
I'm afraid they've already been gone.

241
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,020
Not necessarily.

242
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,130
For example, when you just arrived at Cailian Manor,

243
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,500
you knew at once people are easy to fall from here.

244
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,490
Then why did people living here

245
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,620
lose their footing one after another?

246
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,040
Let's look around.

247
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,990
[Xueyu Town]

248
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,180
We've searched for a long time,

249
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,840
but didn't find any new clues.

250
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,100
[Cuihua Restaurant]

251
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:53,990
This restaurant.

252
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,360
Don't think about anything.

253
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,420
Let's go eat first.

254
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,940
Why do you only care about eating?

255
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,420
Since we're here,

256
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,260
let's try the local food

257
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,240
and taste local customs.

258
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,420
Maybe we'll find something new.

259
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:02,950
Let's go.

260
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,590
There're the most gossips in teahouses and taverns.

261
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,200
Fei,

262
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,400
you're smarter.

263
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,040
It's just to ask for information.

264
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,900
Everyone can think of that.

265
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,220
Waiter.

266
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:22,780
Sir.

267
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,540
Give us the best private room.

268
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,180
No need.

269
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,160
We sit there.

270
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,300
One meat dish and one vegetable dish. Thank you.

271
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:28,820
OK. OK.

272
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,750
Mr. Fang,

273
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,820
it's the money you earned.

274
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,760
Save it.

275
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,080
I heard that a few more bodies in the suburban graveyard

276
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,400
went missing.

277
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,320
Don't make a fuss.

278
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,470
Newly buried bodies

279
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,700
might have been taken away by some beasts.

280
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,610
It has happened many times these years.

281
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,450
Exactly.

282
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,730
Speaking of strange things,

283
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,370
recently,

284
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,780
another bride died in Cailian Manor.

285
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,980
Do you know it?

286
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,150
It's very abnormal.

287
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:03,340
Brothers,

288
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,180
I heard you mention Cailian Manor.

289
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,220
Yes.

290
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,500
Are you here to see the lotus too?

291
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,060
Yes.

292
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,420
May I ask

293
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,080
if Cailian Manor is hospitable?

294
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,140
Every year,

295
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,820
people come to Cai Lian Manor to see the lotus

296
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,020
in an endless stream.

297
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,230
But sir,

298
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,450
I advise you not to go there recently.

299
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:23,490
There,

300
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,880
someone just died.

301
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,010
Quite abnormal.

302
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,620
No bride

303
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,580
of Cai Lian Manor

304
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,190
can live until the wedding day.

305
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,850
The evil spirit haunts there.

306
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,170
It's so scary.

307
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,960
What evil spirit?

308
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,340
Maybe the lord of Cailian Manor

309
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,220
is meanspirited.

310
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,420
God is punishing him.

311
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,120
The lord has such a bad temper.

312
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,130
All servants in the manor aren't treated as human beings.

313
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,700
If anyone makes the lord unhappy,

314
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,130
he will be beaten to death.

315
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,800
I heard that Master Guo's first wife

316
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,260
was forced to death by him.

317
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,440
He's really bad.

318
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,840
In that case,

319
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,820
why did Madam Xu

320
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,390
marry him ten years ago?

321
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,260
You don't know.

322
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,560
I heard that Madam Xu was a musician.

323
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,940
Someone bought back her freedom

324
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,210
and she can live a luxurious life.

325
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,300
Everyone wants it.

326
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,190
Since then,

327
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,020
the Guo family replaced all the servants.

328
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,290
They may want to hide

329
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,930
something.
I’m sorry.

330
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:15,980
Please spare my life.

331
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,740
Please spare my life.

332
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,750
Beat her up!

333
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,990
Remember this.

334
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:19,960
Yes.

335
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,830
Brothers,

336
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,690
don't talk of people behind their backs.

337
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:24,950
It's not appropriate.

338
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:25,740
What?

339
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,270
I can't talk about that?

340
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,300
Look at the mad man in their family.

341
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,940
I guess the Lord forced him to be mad.

342
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,340
Yes.

343
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,620
I guess his honest son will be so soon.

344
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,000
Master Guo.

345
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,370
You three are here too.

346
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,730
Young Master Guo, are you out for a drink?

347
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,480
My uncle is sick again.

348
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,950
He likes the Eight Treasure Duck here.

349
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,750
So my father asked me to buy some.

350
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,850
I didn't expect to meet you here.

351
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,990
It's better to meet by chance.

352
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,230
Let's eat together.

353
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:11,790
Young Master Guo.

354
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,530
I'm sorry.

355
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,910
The guests said something harsh just now.

356
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:15,970
Please don't mind.

357
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,100
These dishes are

358
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,760
to apologize on their behalf.

359
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,400
It doesn't matter.

360
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,140
We didn't treat you well today.

361
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,690
Don't mention it.

362
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,630
After such an accident,

363
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,980
Young Master Guo is the saddest.

364
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,020
The manor is in chaos.

365
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,500
I treat you to a meal here.

366
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,210
We're flattered.

367
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,540
It's just a simple meal.

368
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,420
A squirrel mandarin fish.

369
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,090
Pork joint stewed with rock sugar.

370
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:41,820
Beef served with cilantro.

371
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,460
Steamed pork ribs.

372
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,220
Crispy chicken wings.

373
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,100
Braised pork tendons.

374
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,300
Stewed lamb chops.

375
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,050
Okay, wait a moment.

376
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,110
I'm really sorry.

377
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,300
Our cilantro is sold out today.

378
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,220
I've changed a plate of beef with celery for you.

379
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:03,900
It's okay.

380
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,750
Come on. Eat it while it's hot.

381
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,460
Please enjoy.

382
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,740
[Cailian Manor]

383
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,260
Granny Jiang, it's you.

384
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:56,970
Granny Jiang.

385
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,790
What are you doing here?

386
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,000
Drive out evil spirits.

387
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:02,870
Avoid ghosts.

388
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,260
There's a vengeful spirit here.

389
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,180
There's a vengeful spirit!

390
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,410
A vengeful spirit!

391
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,839
It's not far from the place where the bride drowned.

392
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,589
This is really scary.

393
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,099
Wait. Granny.

394
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,660
Do you remember

395
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:22,420
the situation when Six Fingers Monster

396
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,680
appeared in the manor for the first time?

397
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,300
Ten years ago,

398
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,700
he suddenly appeared under your window

399
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,500
like a ghost.

400
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:45,090
The servants of Cailian Manor were all replaced ten years ago.

401
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,260
What happened?

402
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,170
All servants had to be replaced.

403
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:07,760
It's so late.

404
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,820
He went to his room.

405
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,090
He must be hiding something from me.

406
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,920
You're busy?

407
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,380
I thought about it.

408
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,530
Although there are inner walls in Cailian Manor,

409
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,980
the pond in the manor is connected with the outer river,

410
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,720
Lion Spirit probably fell into the waterway in the river

411
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,260
to escape from being traced

412
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,150
and swam into the manor.

413
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,010
Fortunately, Madam Xu saved him.

414
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:41,950
Strangely,

415
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,180
he disappeared

416
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,810
three days later.

417
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,490
And no one in the manor saw him.

418
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,740
Maybe he went out along the waterway?

419
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,290
I don't think so.

420
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,060
A person has been missing for ten years without sake.

421
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,900
I have a bad feeling about this.

422
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,280
Shi Hun has a habit of keeping records

423
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,820
after dealing with bodies.

424
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,690
As long as we find his notebook,

425
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,820
we can also find the body of Shan Gudao.

426
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:05,890
Di,

427
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,670
if you want to get rid of the Asura Grass,

428
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,070
don't waste your energy.

429
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,360
Nothing can do that

430
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,980
except the Xijing Trick.

431
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,530
You just

432
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,980
help me find Shi Hun.

433
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:17,940
I'm not like you.

434
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,120
Even without the Xijing Trick,

435
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,460
I won't let myself

436
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,860
lose all internal power.

437
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,380
You don't need to provoke me.

438
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,620
I think I'm living well now.

439
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,540
You liked to be a hero,

440
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,590
but now you'd rather be a disabled person.

441
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,970
Haven't you said that before?

442
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,220
My biggest weakness

443
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,730
is to be fond of being a hero.

444
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,090
I've changed.

445
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,390
If it weren't for

446
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,060
Fang protecting you,

447
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,960
how could you have gotten away with all dangers?

448
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:48,900
But haven't I been living well

449
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,120
in the past ten years?

450
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,430
Speaking of Fang Duobing,

451
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,330
Di,

452
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,830
I want to give you some advise.

453
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,530
At least your identity is

454
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,220
my old friend for many years.

455
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,060
Can you just pretend a little

456
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,060
and stop making him suspect?

457
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,870
Are you afraid that he'll find out who you are?

458
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,930
You don't know how troublesome he is.

459
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,680
Afraid of trouble?

460
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,210
I'll kill him when I regain my power.

461
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:14,870
Di,

462
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,960
he is just an unimportant junior.

463
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,240
It's not that serious.

464
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,020
What are they talking about?

465
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,340
Why can't I hear anything clearly?

466
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:35,770
Who?

467
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,150
Guo Kun.

468
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,200
You know martial arts?

469
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,310
You can't run away.

470
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,600
You can't run away.

471
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,820
Where is he?

472
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,060
I'm tired.

473
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,390
Let him go first.

474
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,880
But I know who he is.

475
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,380
It's that mad Guo Kun.

476
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,760
Li Lianhua.

477
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,420
Why didn't you give me any response?

478
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,180
Have you already known it?

479
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,180
Mr. Fang,

480
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,220
Guo Kun is mad,

481
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,500
but can't you see that?

482
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,420
He walks very steadily.

483
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,020
It's like the long-lost Arhat Qian Kun Step.

484
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,500
As for Guo Qian,

485
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,180
when I asked him about Shi Hun,

486
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,760
he looked clearly flustered in his eyes.

487
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,740
He wants to use his internal force

488
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,190
to stop such breath,

489
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,840
but exposed his inner power.

490
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,700
He's a member of the Southwest Bagua Sect.

491
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,900
Can't you tell it?

492
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,280
Then why didn't you tell me?

493
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,220
We didn't expect you wouldn't be able to tell it.

494
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,020
I did.

495
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,270
I just didn't say it.

496
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,220
But you two

497
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,680
are not good at martial arts.

498
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,940
You're quite good at judging character.

499
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,970
We're not skilled in martial arts.

500
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,770
So we need to observe carefully.

501
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:20,330
Everyone in Cailian Manor is skilled.

502
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,690
They pretend not to know martial arts

503
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,210
and have nothing to do with Baichuan Academy.

504
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,570
I think they're just making excuses to stop our investigation.

505
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,030
In the middle of the night,

506
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,220
someone sneaked around my room with skeletons.

507
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,620
Cailian Manor really likes to play tricks.

508
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,630
Why did you

509
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,050
stayed together stealthily

510
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,510
In the middle of the night?

511
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:39,780
We...

512
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,070
It just occurred to us that

513
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:46,140
since it's said this wedding dress is the murderer,

514
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,570
we don't know

515
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,110
what this wedding dress looks like.

516
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,590
Right.

517
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,460
Guo Kun can't be found

518
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,300
in a while.

519
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:55,750
Let's go.

520
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,060
I'll show you myself.

521
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,500
[Cailian Manor]

522
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,360
[Mysterious Lotus Casebook]

523
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:21,750
Go away! Go away! Go away!

524
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,640
It's just a wedding dress.

525
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:45,220
But here a complicated eighth-way Pan Wen lock is used.

526
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,150
It's a pity that it can't defeat me.

527
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,520
The clothes and jewelry are so plain.

528
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,420
Shouldn't the bride

529
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,640
be gorgeously and colorfully dressed?

530
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,360
This is not a wedding dress.

531
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,820
This is a silver mountain.

532
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,560
No taboo, no taboo.

533
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,210
You look so ignorant.

534
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,500
This is called pomegranate dress.

535
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,030
The crown is made of silver.

536
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,860
Plus this dress,

537
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,440
I'm afraid they'll weigh dozens of kilograms.

538
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,200
So heavy.

539
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,010
They will tire the bride out.

540
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,850
Guo Huo told me before

541
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,740
that this dress

542
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,220
was left by his ancestors.

543
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,590
It's very precious.

544
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,550
However precious it is,

545
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,150
it carries several lives.

546
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,780
I don't think anyone else

547
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,440
will wear this wedding dress.

548
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,860
Especially the daughter of Weiyuan Escort Agency.

549
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,600
She comes from a wealthy family.

550
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,860
There's no reason for her to compromise.

551
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,950
So I think

552
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,180
the murderer is very strange.

553
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,250
Because every time he killed someone,

554
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:35,310
he especially targeted at women in this wedding dress.

555
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,450
So, Fei.

556
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,430
If... I said if.

557
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,180
If someone is the bait,

558
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,330
the murderer might appear.

559
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,010
Good idea.

560
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:49,780
Right?

561
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:50,620
Fei.

562
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,570
Not only have you grown up,

563
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,260
but also you've become more and more perceptive.

564
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:54,740
Okay.

565
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,120
Put it on.

566
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,840
I have nothing to do with the case.

567
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,300
Excuse me.

568
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,350
Fei.

569
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,510
Have you forgotten what you promised?

570
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:06,490
Fang Duobing.

571
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,880
Why don't you have a try?

572
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,990
I guess none of us

573
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,520
want to wear this pomegranate dress.

574
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,260
To be fair,

575
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,300
let's play rock-paper-scissors.

576
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,220
Admit defeat.

577
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,420
The clothes are too heavy.

578
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,270
Well.

579
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,740
Let me go to kill someone.

580
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,520
I'll go with you.

581
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,070
Stop laughing. What's so funny?

582
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,070
Let me take a look.

583
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:04,580
Why is there no mirror in this room?

584
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,350
This is the bride's wedding room.

585
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,370
Without a mirror,

586
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,160
how can the bride make up

587
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,780
and try on the wedding dress?

588
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:19,410
Did someone move away the mirror?

589
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,250
It's outside.

590
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,160
Is this a mirror stone?

591
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,220
Did the bride come here every time

592
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,680
to look into the mirror in the wedding dress?

593
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:50,970
Be careful.

594
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,800
It's okay.

595
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,870
I see.

596
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:05,870
You can't run away!

597
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,290
Go to hell!

598
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:45,010
Where are you going?
Don’t move.

599
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,510
You can't run away.

600
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,790
Your martial arts skills haven't improved these years.

601
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,520
You're quite good at swimming.

602
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,370
Stop talking to me.

603
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:00,820
Listen.

604
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,260
This outfit is too heavy,

605
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,450
especially in the water.

606
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,110
Ordinary people can't get up.

607
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,250
You can't even handle a lunatic.

608
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,360
Do you still care about the reputation of the Sigu Sect?

609
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,350
The Sigu Sect has long been disbanded.

610
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,940
Why should we care about its reputation?

611
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,470
Besides,

612
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,570
can reputation solve the case?

613
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:21,670
Clean the bruises on your neck yourself.

614
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:23,950
Thank you.

615
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,780
You can't run away.

616
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,350
You can’t run away.
Li Lianhua, are you okay?

617
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:28,850
I'm fine.

618
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,480
It's nothing.

619
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,340
What happened?

620
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,340
Uncle.
Brother.

621
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:35,740
You...

622
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,580
What's going on?

623
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,220
I should ask you that.

624
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:41,590
Why did Mr. Guo

625
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,410
carry skeletons and

626
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,940
act like a ghost near our room in the middle of the night?

627
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,140
He attacked us when we are not prepared.

628
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,600
Did you conspire

629
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,820
to harm us

630
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,400
and then cover up the truth

631
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,670
in Cai Lian Manor?

632
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:53,930
Mr. Fang.

633
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,160
Is there any misunderstanding?

634
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,610
My uncle does know a little martial arts,

635
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,130
but he won't harm anyone.

636
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,910
Our Cailian Manor also

637
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,620
won't intend to harm you.

638
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,200
Master Guo,

639
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,460
I heard the opposite room

640
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,820
is for the bride who's married far away.

641
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,250
Because it's a long journey,

642
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,120
the bride will live there in advance, right?

643
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,010
So what?

644
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,110
Our Zhao clan has always been like this.

645
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,190
Why is there no mirror in this room?

646
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:23,340
The geomantic master came to see it before.

647
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,680
He said the mirror is not suitable for this room.

648
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,280
There's a raised stone here.

649
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:31,260
There's a row of Shoushan Stones by the lake.

650
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:32,960
Could it also be

651
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,660
the cause of geomantic omen?

652
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,270
This is a downhill.

653
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,310
The fortune and good luck can flow away

654
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,330
alongside the downhill.

655
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:42,690
I use Shoushan Stones to block it

656
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:43,840
and change the pattern.

657
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,840
As for this stone,

658
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,060
it's more normal.

659
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,830
What are you trying to say?

660
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,990
I risked my life

661
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,070
to react the way three brides died.

662
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,550
You acted so well.

663
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,830
You talk too much.

664
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,810
Actually, I really don't understand

665
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,940
what's wrong with this wedding dress.

666
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,600
So,

667
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,310
I just tried it.

668
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,070
Because there is no mirror in the room,

669
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,330
I came here to look into the mirror stone.

670
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,680
I didn't expect Guo Kun to show up with skeletons.

671
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,470
This is downhill.

672
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:29,900
Li Lianhua's dress

673
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:30,900
is very heavy.

674
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,720
So when a person falls,

675
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,510
it'll be hard to get up

676
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,150
due to the weight on his body.

677
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,180
He will also roll down the slope

678
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,840
because the body is too heavy.

679
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,340
The dress is too narrow.

680
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,870
It's hard for people to get up quickly.

681
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,500
That's why

682
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,660
Li Lianhua rolled down all the way

683
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,260
and fell into the lotus pond.

684
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,590
No wonder the brides

685
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,750
have fractures and scars everywhere.

686
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,580
That is thanks to your Shoushan Stones.

687
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:56,330
Yes.

688
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:08,590
If you pass out and fall into the water,

689
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,680
you'll drown.

690
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:11,810
If you didn't pass out,

691
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,270
since the wedding dress is so heavy,

692
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:15,600
you also can't save yourself in the water.

693
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:17,450
Li,

694
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,070
you mean

695
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,770
the three brides who died in our manor

696
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,130
fell into the pond

697
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,150
and drowned

698
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,390
due to the pomegranate dress.

699
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:28,430
That's right.

700
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,850
But their bodies

701
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,250
were found there.

702
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,060
How did they die here?

703
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,040
The water in the Lotus Pond is not stagnant.

704
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:39,140
Because the water leads to the outside river,

705
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,220
there is a hidden stream.

706
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,080
So the bodies were pushed to the bridge by the water.

707
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:45,530
The blooming lotus

708
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,890
blocked the bodies.

709
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,120
Li Lianhua.

710
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,120
When you were looking for clues

711
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,390
near the bridge where the bodies were found,

712
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,990
you had known the water there

713
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,140
actually leads to the bride's room,

714
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,340
right?

715
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,480
That's why you said you wanted to see the wedding dress.

716
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,080
What else?

717
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,400
Even then,

718
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,170
when those brides

719
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,740
looked into the mirror stone,

720
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,920
why did they suddenly trip?

721
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,260
You should ask Guo Kun.

722
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,010
Didn't someone

723
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,170
fall down like this?

724
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,900
Uncle went mad and scared the brides.

725
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,560
That's why…

726
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:17,470
You can't run away.

727
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,150
You can't run away.

728
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,500
I see.

729
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,430
It's my junior brother.

730
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,380
Bastard.

731
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,220
To be honest,

732
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,110
my brother has been mad since he was young.

733
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,450
At the age of marriage,

734
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,780
he would rush towards the brides in a wedding dress.

735
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,030
So I had to find someone to keep an eye on him

736
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,430
to avoid scaring others.

737
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,110
But I never thought...

738
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,700
It's all my fault.

739
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,870
He killed three people in a row.

740
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,850
I'll kill him today!

741
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:47,870
Guards!

742
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:48,500
Wait.

743
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:49,650
Mr. Fang.

744
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:50,690
Master Guo.

745
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,660
Even if he started it,

746
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,430
we can't punish him without permission.

747
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:55,420
I will take the criminal

748
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,220
back to Baichuan Academy first.

749
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,980
I wonder

750
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,340
if the chaos just now

751
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,910
harmed the Lotus Tomb in the pond.

752
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:05,670
Take a look.

753
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,780
I still think something is wrong.

754
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,280
Every time the brides

755
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,909
looked into the mirror stone,

756
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:25,969
why did Guo Kun happen to go mad there?

757
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:27,830
And Master Guo

758
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,060
is so harsh on the servants.

759
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,330
How could he allow such a stone

760
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:33,860
to be unmoved for ten years?

761
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,330
Besides, that road just now

762
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,730
is a twin-star oriented.

763
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,520
There's no need for Shoushan stones to change the fate.

764
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,719
It doesn't match the geomantic theory.

765
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:43,060
Something is wrong.

766
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,650
There are too many coincidences.

767
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,739
Are you listening to me?

768
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,630
How is that possible, Mr. Fang?

769
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,380
I just

770
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,980
said my guess.

771
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,990
Guo Qian immediately believed Guo Kun did it.

772
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,600
There's something wrong.

773
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:03,150
Not to mention that after Madam Xu died,

774
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,470
where did Shi Hun go?

775
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,250
Wasn't it all for nothing?

776
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,010
You knew it very early?

777
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,820
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

778
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,750
I was thinking of

779
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,900
the Lotus Tomb that Guo Qian mentioned.

780
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,870
I think

781
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,670
it's a secret technique.

782
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:17,870
I heard a little about it.

783
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:18,900
Right?

784
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:22,550
I remember many years ago,

785
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,950
Jinyuan Alliance also learned

786
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,400
many strange secret techniques from the Blood Realm.

787
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:28,850
Yes.

788
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:31,970
You two are so knowledgeable.

789
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,410
Only I know nothing.

790
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:34,930
Mr. Fang,

791
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,260
today,

792
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,730
you are the most tired.

793
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,340
I'll make you a midnight snack tonight.

794
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,620
No need.

795
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,760
You want to run?

796
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:44,510
Come back.

797
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,050
What is it?

798
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,310
What is this?

799
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:53,290
I added chili in the lotus seed soup.

800
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:54,790
This is specially prepared for you.

801
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,500
Spicy wolfberry lotus seed soup.

802
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,860
The lotus seed in the pond is big and round.

803
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,510
It's a pity not to taste it.

804
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:01,570
Come on, try it.

805
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:03,490
Fei.

806
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,360
You did well tonight.

807
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,740
This soup is for you.

808
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,490
No need.

809
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,120
Save it for yourself.

810
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:23,810
Strange.

811
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:26,460
The lotus nut has a strange fragrance.

812
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:27,610
What did you add?

813
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,840
There is something wrong.

814
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,290
The lotus nut is red.

815
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,770
They do like these strange things.

816
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,310
Do they use this?

817
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:47,560
It depends.

818
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,630
What are you talking about?

819
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,430
Who are they?

820
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:50,880
Also,

821
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,520
where did you find this finger bone?

822
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,530
It is at the bottom of the lotus pond.

823
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,220
I touched it in the mud.

824
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,490
There are bodies in the lotus pond?

825
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:01,090
Yes.

826
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:02,910
There were many people just now.

827
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,240
We shouldn't alert them.

828
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,450
They have left now.

829
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,970
Let's go and have a look.

830
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,980
Guo Qian treasures the lotus pond.

831
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,780
Let's be careful.

832
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,780
Don't get caught.

833
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:26,460
Let's go.

834
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:37,930
This.

835
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:39,790
Go into the water.

836
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,330
You've always been weak.

837
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,390
You can't go down.

838
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:43,400
Fei.

839
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,940
Go down and have a look.

840
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,060
What?

841
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,810
You aren't even willing to help us with this?

842
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,610
Then you'd better not follow us.

843
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,100
I don't need you

844
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:54,240
to order me around.

845
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,920
What's the matter?

846
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,700
Can you keep your voice down?

847
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,000
Fang Duobing.

848
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,820
Fang Duobing.

849
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,480
Why did you provoke him?

850
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,800
After the case in Cailian Manor,

851
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,330
you'd better stay as far away from Fei

852
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:29,340
as possible.

853
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,470
What do you mean?

854
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,300
Do you think I bullied him?

855
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,870
I'm helping you.

856
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:36,900
I can't explain it clearly to you.

857
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,660
Lower your voice.

858
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:37,970
I...

859
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,470
What is this?

860
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,400
I'll remember it once.

861
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,530
Corpse Fragrance Flower Tomb.

862
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:15,170
Bodies at the bottom of the pond are all like this.

863
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:17,010
This is indeed the style of Shi Hun.

864
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:19,600
So this is the Lotus-cultivating Magic of Cailian Manor.

865
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,450
If such roots were planted by the pond,

866
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:22,320
they would have been discovered long ago.

867
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,650
The lotus was cultivated by human bodies.

868
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:25,930
You...

869
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,470
Many people know Corpse Fragrance Flower Tomb.

870
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,430
But only Shi Hun

871
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,010
knows how to do it.

872
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,100
It's impossible for him

873
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,980
to stay in Cailian Manor only for a while.

874
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:35,780
That's right.

875
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,090
Guo Qian is lying.

876
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,100
Jinyuan Alliance likes

877
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,250
these abnormal tricks.

878
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,250
It's not strange.

879
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,420
On the other hand

880
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,460
why do you know so much

881
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,860
about Jinyuan Alliance?

882
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,320
Here's the thing.

883
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,620
You'll naturally know it

884
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:54,480
after having been in the wide world for long, right?

885
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,140
Is that true?

886
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,690
Don't treat me like a fool, okay?

887
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,840
Shi Hun is just a small potato in Jinyuan Alliance.

888
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,640
He only has a little records in the file.

889
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,970
But you two know so much about Jinyuan Alliance.

890
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,700
Why are you looking for Shi Hun?

891
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:09,330
Fine.

892
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,420
Since you have discussed all the way

893
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,410
and have a tacit understanding,

894
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,860
but you're only not honest with me.

895
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,370
You can investigate this case yourselves.

896
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:16,120
I

897
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:16,920
quit.

898
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,060
I'm the detective.

899
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,280
Why did I end up

900
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,560
becoming an outsider?

901
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:35,690
Forget it.

902
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,040
I said I don't care.

903
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:41,930
That's not right.

904
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,540
Why does Fei know so much

905
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,690
about strange secret techniques and Jinyuan Alliance?

906
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,860
Won't Li Lianhua be in danger?

907
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:10,330
[This is Li Lianhua, the owner of Lotus Tower. Find out who he is.]

908
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:10,330
[This is Fei from South Sea Sect. Find out who he is.]

909
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:10,330
[Fang Quality]

910
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,700
Tianji Hall has been

911
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,380
in the wide world for so many years.

912
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,650
It's not difficult

913
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:20,040
to investigate their background.

914
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,880
You can hide your secrets if you want.

915
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:31,970
One day,

916
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,500
I'll let you ask me in person

917
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,300
to trust you again.
