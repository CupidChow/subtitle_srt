Ackling filial discard, alright...

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,320
Maybe there should be another carrot molt aside.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,220
If you care what happens...

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:21,720
You can use the purple, blue, and purple-like

5
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,920
Now I can change outfits to behind-the-scenes!

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,780
To that, game-based hacktLife starts now!

7

A chain ON growth and chance of a intonation of��!

I'm not afraid of the world

I'm not afraid of the world

My heart is that IRight

Duan Ye?

42
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,960
That girl from Sabin's and short hair,

43
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,960
let me know.

44
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,960
The rest of you,

45
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,960
let them disappear.

46
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,960
This is easy.

47
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,960
Brother Long!

48
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,960
Wait for me for three minutes!

《The Little Mermaid Pappa》

50
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,960
You've been hiding in the sea

51
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960
for a long time.

52
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
Who is this?

53
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,960
Do you know him?

54
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
Brother Duan.

55
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
Brother Duan?

56
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,960
Brother Duan is so cruel.

57
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,960
Didn't you

58
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,960
borrow money from the Linxiao Pavilion?

59
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,960
He wasn't like this before.

60
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
Duan Ye!

61
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,960
Put down the Liu's brother!

62
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,960
You want to revive Lingxiao Pavilion?

63
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,960
I suggest you

64
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
hand over the money

65
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,960
so that you can have a good life.

66
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,960
Put down the Liu's brother!

67
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,960
Liu's brother! Liu's brother!

68
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,960
You're a little kid!

69
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
You don't care about it!

70
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,960
You can't

71
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,960
see your brother's face again!

72
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,960
Lingxiao Pavilion is over.

73
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,960
Don't think about it anymore!

74
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Duan Ye!

75
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,960
You left Lingxiao Pavilion

76
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
on your own.

77
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,960
If you have to defeat him,

78
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,960
you can pass this round.

79
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
Then just come at me!

80
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,960
You're not good at life.

81
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,960
You're still alive!

82
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,960
It doesn't feel like

83
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
I can fight with my hands.

84
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,960
I can't hide and watch the changes.

85
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,960
Hey!

86
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,960
You're not going to leave me alone.

87
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,960
Do you want to escape?

88
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
What are you laughing at?

89
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,960
I'm telling you.

90
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,960
My bear cat

91
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,960
can't even blink.

92
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,960
I can't even control it.

93
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,960
Who are you scaring?

94
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,960
I know more about the bear cat than you do.

95
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,960
You're all busy.

96
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,960
I'm busy.

97
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,960
I'm 19.

98
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,960
I'm 19.

99
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,960
I'm 10.

100
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,960
As long as I can keep going,

101
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,960
I might as well go to the front.

102
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,960
If I can't win this round,

103
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,960
I'll never be able to defeat you.

104
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,960
I'm sorry, Lingxiao Pavilion.

105
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,960
I'll come to the door of the Dengji

106
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,960
to thank you.

107
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,960
Thank you.

108
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,960
You're dead.

109
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,960
Finally, I have a chance.

110
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,960
The door of the Dengji?

111
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,960
Why are you beating me?

112
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,960
You're not good at fighting.

113
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,960
I'm here to kill you.

114
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,960
You idiot.

115
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,960
The enemy is coming after you.

116
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,960
Why are you fighting?

117
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,960
Run away.

118
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,960
I'm a beast.

119
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,960
I found this in the first place.

120
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,960
I have it.

121
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,960
Hey, stop.

122
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,960
The beast.

123
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,960
Help.

124
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,960
Don't pull me.

125
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,960
Help.

126
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,960
I'm so stupid.

127
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
Help.

128
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,960
What should I do?

129
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,960
The Dengji?

130
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,960
I don't know the man behind the sky.

131
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,960
Let me take care of him.

132
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,960
Thank you, Xiao Nian.

133
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,960
I'm so stupid.

134
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,960
I know the man behind the sky.

135
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,960
I'm so stupid.

136
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,960
But it's our main stage.

137
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,960
Don't be bad, Xiao Nian.

138
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,960
What should I do?

139
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,960
Xiao Nian, pull him.

140
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
Something's wrong.

141
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,960
What's going on?

142
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,960
Run.

143
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,960
Thank you, Erliang.

144
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,960
What did you do to my giant?

145
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,960
Don't worry, guys.

146
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
I'm back.

147
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,960
You're here.

148
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,960
Great.

149
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,960
I can't even clean up this mess.

150
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,960
Hey, I'm back.

151
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,960
Where's the bracelet?

152
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,960
Liu Fengbao.

153
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,960
Liu Fengbao.

154
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,960
Liu Fengbao.

155
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,960
You're fine.

156
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,960
I'm so worried about you.

157
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,960
I've been keeping the bracelet with me.

158
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,960
Look, so many people are attacking me.

159
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,960
But even if I die,

160
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,960
I have to protect this bracelet.

161
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,960
Whoever wants to take your bracelet from me

162
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,960
has to go through my body.

163
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,960
Go through it.

164
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,960
What did you say?

165
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,960
The wind is too strong.

166
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,960
I can't hear you.

167
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,960
Give me the bracelet.

168
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,960
It's almost three minutes.

169
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,960
Okay, you're done.

170
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,960
Thank you.

171
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,960
Bai Mao, you can do it yourself.

172
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,960
Why are you leaving?

173
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,960
So many people are attacking me.

174
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,960
Can you see it?

175
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,960
You're so stupid.

176
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,960
You're here to help me.

177
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,960
You're so stupid.

178
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,960
Yu Shi, how are you?

179
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,960
Can you handle it?

180
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,960
You're so stupid.

181
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,960
After Liu Fengbao's guidance,

182
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,960
I can improve quickly.

183
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,960
I can't be too proud.

184
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,960
But...

185
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,960
He's too busy.

186
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,960
He doesn't want to use his skills.

187
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,960
I said he can't hear anything.

188
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,960
It's okay.

189
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
Give me the bracelet.

190
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,960
Don't worry.

191
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,960
I won't interfere with your strategy.

192
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,960
I just want you to help me.

193
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,960
Help Yu to make a picture.

194
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,960
Xiaoxiao.

195
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,960
Ready.

196
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,960
Liu Shi, you're finally here.

197
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,960
Liu Shi.

198
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,960
What's this?

199
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,960
This is the Great Peng's vision.

200
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
The Great Peng's vision.

201
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
Kun Hua is a bird.

202
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
Qi Ming is a Peng.

203
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,960
You think you can imitate the leader

204
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,960
and make a profit in Ling Xiaoge?

205
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,960
You're really a stubborn and cunning person.

206
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,960
I'll leave Ling Xiaoge

207
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,960
and make sure you know

208
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,960
who you are.

209
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,960
Just like you know the leader?

210
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,960
What did you say?

211
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,960
Cheng Xin.

212
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,960
Leave it to me.

213
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960
You go help Bai Mao.

214
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
Okay.

215
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,960
Si Bei, let's go.

216
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,960
How long are you going to hold?

217
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,960
Let go of me.

218
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,960
Let go of me.

219
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,960
Chengge.

220
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,960
Help me.

221
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,960
Si Bei, be careful.

222
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,960
You're doing well, kid.

223
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,960
You can actually find me.

224
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,960
You're a bit selfish.

225
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,960
Why don't you join us in the ghost investigation?

226
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
Chengge, you're finally here.

227
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,960
You're my only brother.

228
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,960
You can't do anything without me.

229
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,960
Look.

230
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,960
Isn't that the leader of the Wangu Sect?

231
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
Why is he on you?

232
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
You go get him.

233
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
Hurry up.

234
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,960
Cheng Xin and I are going to help.

235
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,960
That dragon is gone.

236
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,960
It's gone.

237
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,960
This guy is so fierce.

238
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,960
You take him out.

239
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,960
I'll use the long way.

240
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,960
Let's go.

241
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,960
Don't go any further.

242
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,960
Chengge, Chengge.

243
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,960
How do you say we're going to split this?

244
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
How can we take this?

245
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,960
Let's get rid of him first.

246
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,960
Si Bei.

247
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,960
Although it's true,

248
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,960
the attack didn't work at all.

249
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
What should we do?

250
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,960
It doesn't look like fire.

251
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,960
We've tried it with fire power.

252
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,960
We've tried it.

253
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,960
It's useless.

254
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,960
The spirit of the sect looks like a master.

255
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,960
The back of the skin is weak.

256
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,960
It's not moving at all.

257
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,960
Then try it with my Si Bei.

258
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
Come out.

259
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,960
Han Wei.

260
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,960
It's not good.

261
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,960
We did it.

262
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,960
It seems that it's not his weakness.

263
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,960
As long as we can take out this back skin

264
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,960
and break it,

265
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,960
we can hit it in its body.

266
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,960
You're going to defeat him with a blow.

267
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,960
Don't be so proud.

268
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,960
How can the spirit master be defeated so easily?

269
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,960
Don't forget

270
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,960
we have special skills.

271
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
It's gone.

272
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,960
Si Bei, attack.

273
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
Han Wei.

274
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,960
What's wrong?

275
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,960
They've got a good soul.

276
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,960
They can't move at all.

277
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,960
Damn it.

278
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,960
Han Wei, take back.

279
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,960
The connection between you and Ling Chong

280
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,960
has been cut off completely.

281
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,960
Even Zhao Hui can't do it.

282
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,960
The original fear that the master brought

283
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,960
to the world

284
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,960
and the spirit master couldn't do anything.

285
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,960
You'll die.

286
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,960
You'll die.

287
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,960
But it's not good for Ling Chong.

288
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,960
Who?

289
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,960
What's going on?

290
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,960
What's going on?

291
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,960
Isn't that a waste of energy?

292
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,960
He's not strong enough.

293
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,960
Who is this little girl?

294
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,960
Long Nitian.

295
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,960
How could Ling Chong be so strong?

296
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,960
Miling, you're awake.

297
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,960
It's still the King of the Emperor.

298
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,960
You're already in a serious state.

299
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,960
Chen Xu.

300
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,960
King of the Emperor, Ling Chong.

301
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,960
You're so good.

302
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,960
You're so good, Hu Yuan.

303
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,960
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

304
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,960
Is that your friend?

305
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,960
Of course.

306
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,960
It's you.

307
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,960
I didn't expect you to come help me.

308
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,960
You're so unbeatable.

309
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,960
You?

310
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
No.

311
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,960
I just passed by.

312
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,960
I saw something on the ground.

313
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,960
I picked it up.

314
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,960
It's a bracelet.

315
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,960
Young Master, I actually dropped it.

316
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,960
Don't trust him.

317
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,960
It's mine.

318
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,960
Really?

319
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,960
Is it that big, Brother Chen?

320
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,960
What are you doing?

321
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,960
Let go of my hand.

322
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,960
Jiang Bei Mo.

323
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,960
Jiang Bei Mo.

324
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,960
Wake up.

325
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
You have to admit that

326
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,960
I've met your Panda.

327
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,960
It's the most difficult to beat you.

328
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,960
But it seems

329
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,960
you can't hold on for long.

330
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,960
Just give it a try.

331
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,960
I'll let you go.

332
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,960
That's enough.

333
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,960
My Dazong is in chaos now.

334
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,960
He's at an endless battle.

335
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,960
He's not his opponent.

336
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,960
Jiang Bei Mo, stop.

337
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,960
You can't win

338
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,960
just by injury like this.

339
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,960
You...

340
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,920
However, we held a massive event for different reasons.

341
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,560
It's this kind of thing that I was practicing during school high school years.

342
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,680
But you managed to improve yourself so that I went on aças to progress,

343
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,480
picked mine up and improved my personality.

344
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,480
In order for holes,exp устройary standards must be made.

345
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,000
Rockets have always to be great.

346
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,960
If we can make the wall good,

347
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:44,960
I have never thought that I can be as good as everyone else.

348
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:50,960
I can only stop time and look at him.

349
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,960
Look at him.

350
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,960
Look at them.

351
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,960
No matter how strong you are,

352
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,960
no matter how many sects you defeat,

353
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,960
you will still be able to win.

354
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,960
I will always be your leader.

355
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,960
I will always be your leader.

356
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,960
I will always be your leader.

357
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,960
No matter how strong you are,

358
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,960
no matter how many sects you defeat,

359
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
no matter how much you win,

360
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,960
you will still be able to win.

361
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,960
Miss Yatong,

362
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,960
please come again.

363
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,960
I will pretend to be difficult

364
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,960
and answer them with great pleasure.

365
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,960
I really can't help you.

366
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,960
Then you must help me

367
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,960
to get more attention to kitchen.

368
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,960
Master!

369
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,960
Then I will be satisfied.

370
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,960
Are you really worthy of being a strong person?

371
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,960
Sect Leader.

372
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,960
I believe in you.

373
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,960
How is Sister Yue so big?

374
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,960
Congratulations on your wedding.

375
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,960
Sister Yue is so big.

376
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,960
Are you really a newbie?

377
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,960
Who is the leader?

378
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,960
Is he the leader of the sect?

379
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,960
You are called Jiao Bai Mu.

380
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,960
My leader.

381
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,960
I believe that everything we experienced together

382
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
is not meaningless.

383
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,960
Now, listen to me.

384
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,960
I will definitely be able to...

385
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,960
If you continue like this, I will be really angry.

386
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,960
You promised me that you would help me to get more attention.

387
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,960
This kind of secret is not able to help you.

388
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,960
I have already thought about the strategy.

389
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,960
Listen to me. You will definitely defeat him.

390
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,960
Why? You dare not fight?

391
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,960
Unfortunately, there is no chance for you to lose now.

392
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,960
Give it to me.

393
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,960
My eyes! What are you doing?

394
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,960
Damn it. I have never lost this strategy.

395
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,960
You did well, Leader.

396
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,960
Continue.

397
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,960
I will take him now.

398
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,960
What are you doing?

399
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,960
I will not let you continue.

400
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,960
You are not the leader.

401
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,960
You did it!

402
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,960
First, disturb his vision.

403
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,960
Then, exchange the two Bear Cat's accessories.

404
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,960
You really made him confused.

405
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,960
Jiao Bai Mu, take his hand ring.

406
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,960
After three minutes, he will be eliminated and then release him.

407
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,960
Jiao Bai Mu, what are you talking about?

408
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,960
We are the best sect.

409
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,960
Leader, Brother Liu, I won.

410
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,960
How are you guys?

411
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,960
I heard it.

412
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,960
It seems that only you are left.

413
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,960
Duan Yi.

414
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,960
I will take you to the temple.

415
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,960
I will take you to the temple.

416
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,960
I will take you to the temple.

417
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,960
I will take you to the temple.

418
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,960
I will take you to the temple.

419
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,960
I will take you to the temple.

420
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,960
I will take you to the temple.

421
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,960
I will take you to the temple.

422
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,960
I will take you to the temple.

423
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,960
I will take you to the temple.

424
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,960
I will take you to the temple.

425
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,960
I will take you to the temple.

426
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,960
I will take you to the temple.

427
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,960
I will take you to the temple.

428
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,960
I will take you to the temple.

429
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,960
I will take you to the temple.

430
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,960
I will take you to the temple.

431
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,960
I will take you to the temple.

432
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,960
I will take you to the Temple.

433
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,960
I will take you to the temple.

434
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,960
Luolala.

435
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,960
For sure we are in brideynours.
