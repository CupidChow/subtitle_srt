1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Momoda

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,260
Come here.

3
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,100
Get up.

4
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,780
Dad, up.

5
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,260
I will follow you two to the place where you live.

6
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,260
I will take a step forward to the present.

7
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,260
For the sake of you two, and all the family members,

8
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,260
I can be the one to learn.

9
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,260
The truth is not far away now.

10
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,260
As long as we win this battle,

11
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:22,260
Lin Xiao Ge will be able to make a living in the Jin Sect.

12
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,260
We will be able to investigate the whole.

13
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,260
The ancestors of the ancestors are here.

14
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,260
I will bless the descendants of the ancestors to be able to make a living in the Jin Sect.

15
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,260
We will win this battle.

16
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,260
They are coming out.

17
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,260
Ready!

18
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,260
I wish the Sect Leader of the Sects to be victorious in the Martial Arts.

19
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,260
Lin Xiao Ge will not be defeated in the battle.

20
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,260
I wish the Sect Leader of the Sects to be victorious in the Martial Arts.

21
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,260
Lin Xiao Ge will not be defeated in the battle.

22
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,260
Let's go.

23
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,260
Let's go.

24
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,260
Wow, you fly so high.

25
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,260
Good.

26
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,260
I will also start to fight with my full legs.

27
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,260
Look over there.

28
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,260
It's so amazing.

29
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,260
Let's wait and see.

30
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,260
Okay.

31
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,260
Master, slow down.

32
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,260
Senior, let's go to the spiritual master's place.

33
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,260
Master.

34
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,260
Put theiao on another side.

35
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,860
This way for thechsel.

36
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,860
Wow!

37
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,860
Wow! Lin Xiao Ge is here!

38
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,860
This is a good place to be.

39
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,860
This place is so quiet.

40
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,860
It's so quiet.

41
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,860
This place is so quiet.

42
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,860
This is a good place to be.

43
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,860
This is a good place to be.

44
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,860
Wow!

45
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,860
What kind of water bottle is this Lin Xiao Ge?

46
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,860
He even bought a water bottle.

47
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,860
Even Meng Jingran has to

48
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,860
win a fake challenge like this.

49
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,860
It's so ridiculous.

50
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,860
I don't think so.

51
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,860
What's your opinion on Mr. Bai?

52
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,860
Tell me.

53
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,860
Fan Lingxiao was born in a famous family.

54
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,860
But he was not born in a family.

55
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,860
He was only a person.

56
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,860
He was born and created by Lin Xiao Ge.

57
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,860
He has been from the world to the entertainment industry.

58
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,860
He is a very ancient person.

59
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,860
He has been a little bit like me.

60
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,860
He knows Lin Chong very well.

61
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,860
He knows very well.

62
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,860
But I think

63
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,860
this cup is very delicious.

64
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,860
Everyone.

65
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,860
You traitor!

66
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,860
Fan Zhangmen,

67
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,860
Heimi still likes you.

68
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,860
How about you take him back?

69
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,860
Who said that?

70
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,860
Come out.

71
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,860
Is it you?

72
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,860
What do you want to say?

73
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,860
Duan Ye.

74
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,860
Do you remember the appointment

75
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,860
with me just now?

76
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,860
Of course.

77
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,860
We became the best in the world together.

78
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,860
That's right.

79
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,860
All these years,

80
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,860
this sentence has always been on my mind.

81
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,860
At that time,

82
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,860
I was the only one who did the best in the world.

83
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,860
I gave up on my hard work.

84
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,860
Until you,

85
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,860
Gu Ling,

86
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,860
and everyone else,

87
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,860
came to me.

88
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,860
That's why I was able to turn this hat

89
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,860
into reality.

90
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,860
Now,

91
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,860
we stand here

92
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,860
and face this reality.

93
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,860
Let's go to the world

94
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,860
and see the world.

95
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,860
Everyone,

96
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,860
the sea is too big.

97
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,860
It really is.

98
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,860
I dare not look at the beauty of the world.

99
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,860
Get out.

100
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,860
It turns out that way.

101
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,860
Look at the huge god area.

102
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,860
It's the legendary

103
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,860
Yahu Bao Sa Lake.

104
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,860
You are indeed capable.

105
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,860
But in front of me,

106
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,860
you are almost dead.

107
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,860
A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a

108
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,860
I can't see t光的光

109
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,860
It's really gölly here.

110
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,860
Come here.

111
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,860
Hu.

112
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,420
The

113
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:32,380
Great

114
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,380
counter응

115
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,100
Look further

116
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,940
Also that he was six years old.

117
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,280
Is this okay?

118
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,760
Relax...

119
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,540
The way to an advanced situation has reached.

120
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,340
The boundary conditions are already completed.

121
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,300
I do not have the courage.

122
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,960
Also you come and challenge Bullet numero

123
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,360
It's possible toiki you.

124
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,880
This partie is to prepare for a ADC member.

125
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,580
Cheng-Cheng Hua!

126
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,780
Come.

127
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,480
Wake up!

128
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,720
A storm!

129
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,300
Zhengen isuclear!

130
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,000
So strong.

131
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,040
broken into pieces.

132
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,160
Feelings of the sacred geyser

133
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,480
break into an ugly grave.

134
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,200
the precious geyser

135
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,100
breaks to pieces.

136
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,800
Xu Noon.

137
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,940
Zhao GRUNover.

138
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,920
I am not in charge at all.

139
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,920
The End

140
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,920
The peach bag made by the mother is the best

141
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,920
Eat more if it's delicious

142
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,920
This is the secret of our family's growth

143
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
The peach bag made by the mother is the best

144
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,920
Xiao Nian, you are my first pet

145
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,920
Xiao Yan, the water is coming

146
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,920
Xiao Nian, you are here

147
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,920
Sect Leader, I know how big the ancestral sword sect is

148
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,920
But no matter what

149
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,920
I will keep walking with you

150
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,920
I am the spirit

151
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,920
I hope that in the future, we can rest together

152
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,920
We will be together

153
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,920
We will be together

154
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,920
Sect Leader, hurry up

155
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,920
The spirit of the Lingxiao Pavilion

156
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,920
We will be the best in the world

157
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,920
What is this?

158
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,920
It shouldn't be like this

159
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,920
Don't go

160
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,920
Don't go

161
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,920
Don't go

162
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,320
Keeping walking

163
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,840

00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,920
קcie Muchas

165
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,920
The monk he dich storied

166
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,920
The God Are told to kneel down

167
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,920
women

168
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,920
You'll have trouble

169
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,920
The dragon has been Diskussation

170
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,920
I have to tell you

171
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:46,920
When the time comes, he will definitely help you to avoid the disaster.

172
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,920
Where is this?

173
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,920
I'm not dead yet.

174
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,920
The clothes are not mine.

175
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,920
I'm not dead yet.

176
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,920
Guzhan, I'm not dead yet.

177
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,920
where is he?

178
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,920
Come out.

179
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,820
Who is this?

180
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,820
I...

181
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,820
How did I become like this?

182
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,820
There! I found him!

183
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,820
The one in the White House?

184
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,820
I'm a little man! I caught you!

185
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,820
What did I do?

186
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,820
Stay inside for me.

187
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,820
I've been dead for a year.

188
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,820
Ling Xiao Ge has worked hard to get into the sect.

189
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,820
He's gone.

190
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,820
He's been saved.

191
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,820
But he's been starting all over again.

192
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,820
He's not willing to do it.

193
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,820
Why did the universe become like that?

194
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,820
I was hit by someone's fist.

195
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,820
Who am I to the body?

196
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,820
But let's see what I can summon first.

197
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,820
What's all this?

198
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,820
You're my spiritual pet?

199
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,820
What do you know?

200
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,820
Don't...

201
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,820
I...

202
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,820
What's all this nonsense?

203
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,820
This is not bad.

204
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,820
I'll go back first.

205
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,820
It'll be troublesome to get into trouble if the guards bump into me.

206
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,820
I can't escape for a while.

207
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,820
I can only recognize them.

208
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,820
Yuan Feng, I'm busy.

209
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,820
My Miss is taking medicine.

210
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,820
You're so dirty.

211
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,820
There are three levels of human.

212
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,820
You're so far away.

213
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,820
You're still so far away.

214
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,820
Let's go.

215
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,820
I want to see you.

216
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,820
Well, what's the matter with Miss Bai?

217
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,820
She probably won't do anything.

218
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,820
Miss Shen.

219
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,820
Miss, I brought the food.

220
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,820
You can leave.

221
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,820
Yes, I'll leave.

222
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,820
Liu Feng, you're here.

223
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,820
Miss Bai, what can I do for you?

224
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,820
Do you know why I keep you here?

225
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,820
Miss, you're so generous.

226
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,820
You want to give me another chance to change my mind.

227
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,820
Liu Feng, you're so bold.

228
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,820
You dare to hit my idea.

229
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,820
If you didn't take medicine in my water,

230
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,820
you'd be in trouble if you were to do that.

231
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,820
You want to stop me?

232
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,820
Actually, it's all a misunderstanding.

233
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,820
I've never been so bold and bold

234
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,820
since I was born.

235
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,820
I killed you.

236
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,820
I hate you so much.

237
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,820
I want to make you a man of my life

238
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:18,820
and be a humble slave who can be my slave.

239
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,820
No, I can't.

240
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,820
I've been a good girl since I was a kid.

241
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,820
I don't know how to serve people.

242
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,820
I can cook and wash clothes and cook every day.

243
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,820
I don't have any color.

244
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,820
I can't do that.

245
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,820
Miss Bai, you should treat me to a high-ranking.

246
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,820
I'll take my leave.

247
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,820
When did I say that you can leave?

248
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,820
What?

249
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,820
What a talented man.

250
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,820
I can't just hang up so easily.

251
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,820
I'll take my leave.

252
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,820
Miss Bai, you're so stubborn.

253
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,820
I'm not.

254
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,820
I'm just a young girl.

255
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,820
I'm a young girl.

256
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,820
I'm a young girl.

257
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,820
I'm a young girl.

258
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,820
I'm a young girl.

259
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,820
I'm a young girl.

260
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,820
I'm a young girl.

261
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,820
Miss Bai, hurry up.

262
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,820
Go.

263
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,820
What?

264
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,820
So fast.

265
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,820
Hurry up.

266
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,820
Who's that?

267
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,820
Hurry up.

268
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,820
He can control two sides of the battle?

269
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,820
Damn it.

270
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,820
It's mine.

271
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,820
Okay.

272
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,820
Good.

273
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,820
Good.

274
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,820
Damn it.

275
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,820
Xiao Bai, you...

276
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,820
What?

277
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,820
Miss Bai, I'll have your signature.

278
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,320
Ok

279
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,320
Great

280
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:16,780
Turtle

281
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,320
Lady

282
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,560
Nevertheless, whatner then...

283
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,260
The until here, you sure don't know

284
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,260
Princess Pewdie advanced above another

285
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:25,900
сид once again

286
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,120
Haha

287
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,200
The little star

288
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,020
The little star

289
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,920
Us

290
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:34,480
is off

291
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:34,980
So the—

292
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:35,840
the city is off

293
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,340
The sky is shaking

294
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,200
The stance is rugged

295
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:37,700
The wind is deaf

296
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:39,540
Crouch with more appeal

297
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,180
Get ready

298
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,180
first

299
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,460
Guns

300
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,440
Ray

301
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,200
There may a

302
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,560
yes

303
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,960
Do I die again

304
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,180
I've never seen such a low profile move.

305
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,180
Today, I really opened...

306
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,180
It's you?

307
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,180
Your life is so hard.

308
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,180
Yes.

309
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,180
You actually took your pond carp as your pet?

310
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,180
You're such a coward.

311
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,180
You're such a stupid thing to do.

312
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,180
Although the pond carp used to be a great companion

313
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,180
for the war,

314
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,180
the peak of the peak of the peak

315
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,180
was still very high.

316
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,180
The peak of the peak was still very high.

317
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,180
But a year ago, the peak was still very high.

318
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,180
The pond carp, which was so small,

319
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,180
was not controlled.

320
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,180
He suddenly lost his master.

321
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,180
He was so mean to his master.

322
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,180
It's not like that.

323
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,180
It's just an accident.

324
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,180
You said it's not like that.

325
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,180
The Alliance has ordered to kill the pig.

326
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,180
Now the pond carp is dead.

327
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:02,180
This is my brother's hiding it here.

328
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,180
It might be the last one in the mainland.

329
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,180
Besides,

330
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,180
the pond carp's companion is only

331
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,180
the leader of Ling Xiao Pavilion.

332
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,180
It's just a useless useless bug

333
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,180
in other people's hands.

334
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,180
You're talking like that.

335
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,180
I'm not tired of seeing the coffin.

336
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,180
Go, Xiao Nian.

337
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,180
Go.

338
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,180
Go.

339
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,180
Go.

340
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,180
Go, go.

341
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,180
Awesome.

342
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,180
I'll leave first.

343
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,180
It's so disgusting.

344
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,180
Go.

345
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,180
Go.

346
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,180
Go.

347
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,180
I can't take it.

348
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,180
Please calm down, Miss.

349
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,180
Miss,

350
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,180
we split up and chased after the chicken.

351
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,180
We chased after the wet jade.

352
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,180
We still haven't found

353
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,180
the trace of Lord Liu Feng.

354
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,180
We can't take it.

355
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,180
We can't take it.

356
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,180
We can't take it.

357
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,180
We can't take it.

358
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,460
We just need to hold on.

359
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,680
It does look like

360
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,680
I take it, too.

361
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,380
We have toilarize the никогда machine.

362
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,180
I thought that

363
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,180
the memory of the fifth guest

364
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,180
was no longer humane.

365
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:45,680
At last,

366
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:51,500
when I was

367
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,180
angry with Lord Liu,

368
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,520
watching authorities

369
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,180
and dangling get destroyed,

370
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,180
Institutions of Xi's PosMOB,

371
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,180
doesn'tincolnäsu,

372
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,120
To this end,

373
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,940
will look

374
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,820
like a lion.

375
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,580
Those vampires

376
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,500
will have to come out

377
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,720
and eliminate Article Ten.

378
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:22,980
Yesterday,

379
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,180
I told you

380
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,860
this country

381
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,860
Ah!

382
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,860
What happened last night?

383
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,860
It really wasn't a dream.

384
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,260
That's what happened.

385
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,260
That thief was not only humiliating me,

386
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:51,860
but also making Xiao Bai swallow me.

387
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,860
Brother!

388
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,860
You want to avenge me?

389
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,860
Damn it!

390
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,860
I'm so angry!

391
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,860
It's not easy for me to take away the soul of Nian Yu.

392
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:07,860
Bastard!

393
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,860
Brother, listen to me!

394
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,860
Nian Yu is too powerful.

395
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,860
Why didn't you give it to me earlier?

396
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,860
Powerful?

397
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,860
Not that.

398
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,860
Nian Yu doesn't have any power.

399
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,860
The only thing that can be used to destroy the world

400
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:27,860
is that it can't do anything against the Sun.

401
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:31,860
You can just use the white snake to destroy the Sun.

402
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,860
I have the Sun?

403
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:37,860
Anyway, it's the kind of Nian Yu that has no power.

404
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,860
People say you're a useless beast.

405
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,860
You're a murderer. You dare to kill me?

406
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,860
You're not strong enough to raise a child.

407
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,860
And you have the power to control the world.

408
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,860
But there's only one exception.

409
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,860
Fan Ling Xiao.

410
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,860
You're so strong. I'm the one who's the most clear.

411
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,860
But he's dead.

412
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,860
No one knows his secret anymore.

413
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,860
Because I can't find your strongest secret.

414
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,860
That flower thief is just a thief.

415
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,860
He won't do anything.

416
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,860
Nian Yu, you must be very worried.

417
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,860
You must want to prove yourself.

418
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,860
Qing Shi, you failed.

419
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,860
This is what Qing Yu promised.

420
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,860
He will kill you.

421
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:23,860
Don't worry. I'll take care of him sooner or later.

422
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,860
Nian Yu, as long as you're there,

423
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:31,860
I can take back what I lost.

424
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,860
Let's go.

425
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,860
Come with me.

426
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,860
Let's wait for the wind.

427
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,860
The world is full of wonders.

428
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,860
The story of the Bilibili is about to start.

429
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,860
I'll return the heaven and earth.

430
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,860
Ask him about the wind and rain.

431
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:22,860
But the fancy clothes and good and bad are all in vain.

432
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,860
They're all in vain.

433
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:30,860
They say it's hard to chase after dreams.

434
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:35,860
Too many ups and downs.

435
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,860
But I'm a man of love.

436
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:43,860
I can't be a hero until I die.

437
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,860
I'm in a daze.

438
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,860
I'm a man of love.

439
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:55,860
The good and bad are all in vain.

440
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,860
Don't ask me.

441
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,860
You're a crazy man.

442
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,860
You're a man of love.

443
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,860
You're a man of love.

444
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,860
Don't ask me.

445
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:23,860
Ask the world who is the best.

446
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:27,860
I'll return the heaven and earth.

447
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:30,860
Ask him about the wind and rain.

448
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:36,860
But the fancy clothes and good and bad are all in vain.

449
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,860
They're all in vain.

450
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:44,860
They say it's hard to chase after dreams.

451
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:48,860
Too many ups and downs.

452
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,860
But I'm a man of love.

453
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:56,860
I can't be a hero until I die.

454
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,860
I'm in a daze.

455
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:01,860
I'm a man of love.

456
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:06,860
The good and bad are all in vain.

457
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,860
Don't ask me.

458
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,860
You're a man of love.

459
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:16,860
The good and bad are all in vain.

460
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,860
Don't ask me.

461
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,860
You're a man of love.

462
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,860
You're a man of love.

463
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:29,860
The good and bad are all in vain.

464
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,860
Don't ask me.

465
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,860
You're a crazy man.

466
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,860
You're a man of love.

467
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:42,860
You're a man of love.
