To

49
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,400
I'm very impatient.

50
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,440
To

51
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,620
I'm very impatient.

52
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,280
No need to be nervous.

53
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,120
No need to be nervous.

54
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,040
No need to be nervous.

55
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,040
You can think about it.

56
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,040
You and Ling Zhong's contract will kill me, right?

57
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,040
Damn it!

58
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,040
What's that?

59
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,040
I haven't seen you for a while, Su Mu Chuan.

60
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,040
Do you still remember me?

61
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,040
You two saved me.

62
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,560
Next, according to the plan, Gu Ling, you go save the other

63
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,040
Lin Chong who was locked up.

64
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,040
I'll go help Duochu.

65
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,040
After you're done, you come to support me.

66
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,040
You...

67
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,040
Why did you save me?

68
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,040
Bai Mao has a good strength.

69
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,040
He asked her to help us.

70
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,040
We'll split up the battle equipment.

71
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,040
You have good taste.

72
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,040
Then, let's start the action.

73
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,040
Go!

74
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,040
Duochu, someone is in jail.

75
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,040
Jail?

76
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,040
It's still a bit difficult.

77
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,040
Get out of here!

78
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,040
Cang Bao Ge?

79
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,040
Please have a look.

80
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,040
There are so many treasures.

81
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,040
Yi State's treasure?

82
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,040
High-end scroll?

83
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,040
It's a upgrade material?

84
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,040
Don't rush!

85
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,040
When Duochu is defeated, I'll upgrade it for you.

86
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,040
Don't be so troublesome.

87
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,040
Join us in the battle.

88
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,040
We can share these treasures.

89
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,040
Thank you for your kindness.

90
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,040
Unfortunately, I'm here to avenge Ling Xiao Ge.

91
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
Avenge?

92
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,040
The master of Ling Xiao Ge is killed by that ghost.

93
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,040
Who are you going to avenge?

94
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,040
Nonsense!

95
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,040
You're not going to avenge me?

96
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,040
Die!

97
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,040
What is this?

98
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,040
It's a trap!

99
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,040
You bastard!

100
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,040
Give me your treasure!

101
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,040
Take it!

102
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,040
Damn it!

103
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,040
What? Why didn't you chase me?

104
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,040
What?

105
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,040
Stop!

106
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,040
Don't!

107
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,040
I'll kill you!

108
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,040
My god!

109
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,040
What?

110
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,040
No!

111
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,040
I should be able to drag her down.

112
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,040
No!

113
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:56,040
I'll have to save the ghost and them in the future.

114
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,040
Let's go!

115
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,040
They're all saved?

116
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,040
Okay, we have to find them.

117
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,040
Where is it?

118
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,040
Junior Brother Liu!

119
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,040
Junior Brother Liu!

120
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,040
What's wrong? Are you okay?

121
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,040
I have no strength.

122
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,040
I need everyone to fight for some healing.

123
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,040
This is a trap.

124
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,040
Liu Yang!

125
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,040
Do you want me to be a fool?

126
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
Come on!

127
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,040
Su Mo Chuan!

128
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,040
You dare to fight with yourself?

129
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
You're kidding!

130
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Are you making friends with you?

131
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
Okay!

132
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,040
I'm not seeing you.

133
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,040
Yue Tou, use the light to get in.

134
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,040
Okay!

135
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,040
It's a light!

136
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,040
It's gone!

137
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,040
It's almost healed.

138
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,040
Thank you, Xiao Xiang.

139
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,040
I'll be right back.

140
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,040
Damn it!

141
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,040
I'm still in a hurry!

142
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,040
Si Bei, go!

143
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,040
It's now!

144
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,040
Xiao Xiang, Si Bei!

145
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,040
Xuan Feng!

146
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,040
Huo Luan!

147
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,040
Don't think too much.

148
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,040
Xuan Jing!

149
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,040
Let's fight them!

150
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,040
Everyone, Si Bei...

151
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,040
Take their sects down!

152
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,040
Gu Ling!

153
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,040
I admit that your battle was really amazing.

154
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,040
But I have to admit that my evolution is still a little bit more than that.

155
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,040
It's a pity that the world's first Ling Xiao Pavilion in the West...

156
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,040
will be here...

157
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,040
in the future.

158
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,040
No!

159
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,040
Kill them!

160
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,040
Kill them!

161
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,040
This is...

162
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,040
a fog!

163
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,040
A fog?

164
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,040
A fish?

165
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,040
There's always a fish in the world!

166
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,040
No!

167
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,040
Don't go too far.

168
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,040
Find a way to get there.

169
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,040
It's now!

170
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,040
Go!

171
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,040
Throw it away with the water cannon!

172
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,040
Go!

173
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,040
What is this?

174
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,040
Go!

175
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,040
This is...

176
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,040
deceptive!

177
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,040
There's noon light...

178
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,040
but the living cannot escape from his mind.

179
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,040
readily dried out materials.

180
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,040
Do not dare!

181
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,040
Send them into hell!

182
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,040
Valiant Ocean!

183
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,040
What?

184
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,040
Damn it!

185
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,040
I'll take it!

186
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,040
He's using his power.

187
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,040
I can't let him get inside!

188
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,040
No!

189
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,040
Demon... Demon...

190
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,040
It's the Demon's core!

191
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,040
The core hasn't been absorbed yet!

192
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,040
Get lost!

193
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,040
I must rush back!

194
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,040
Demon...

195
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,040
I'll win the last time!

196
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,040
Demon!

197
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,040
The core is broken.

198
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,040
Demon...

199
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,040
Demon...

200
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,040
I can't...

201
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,040
I can't...

202
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,040
I can't...

203
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,040
I can't leave...

204
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,040
I can't...

205
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,040
I can't...

206
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,040
I can't...

207
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,040
I can't...

208
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,040
Ling Xiao Ge!

209
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,040
Go to hell!

210
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,040
Demon...

211
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,040
Be careful!

212
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,040
It's you...

213
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,040
The demon that's on the town...

214
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,040
Well...

215
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,040
Thank you for saving me.

216
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,040
Why did he run away?

217
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,040
How did he run away?

218
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,040
Is this a revenge?

219
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,040
Oh, right!

220
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,040
I haven't got the material yet!

221
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,040
I almost forgot!

222
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,040
It seems that all the strategic items that I can take are here.

223
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,040
I've been trying my best this time.

224
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
I'll take the seven.

225
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,040
It's fair, right?

226
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,040
So, you're all...

227
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,040
Five!

228
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,040
What's going on?

229
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,040
I was thinking about what to do.

230
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,040
Oh, right!

231
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,040
I have to break it!

232
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,040
I have to take half of it!

233
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,040
What...

234
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040
What do I have to do?

235
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,040
You said you're sorry to us!

236
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,040
You have to give us all the treasure!

237
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,040
Really?

238
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,040
It seems...

239
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,040
It seems that...

240
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,040
It hurts!

241
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,040
I can't wash it off!

242
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,040
Forget it!

243
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,040
I'll go back to sleep after I finish my work.

244
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,040
Okay!

245
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,040
Everyone, choose your favorite spirit bed!

246
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,040
Okay!

247
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,040
Fireball?

248
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,040
That's not bad!

249
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,040
Come on!

250
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,040
Fireball!

251
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,040
Junior Liu! Junior Liu!

252
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,040
Junior Liu!

253
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,040
Junior Liu!

254
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,040
Junior Liu, you're awake!

255
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,040
Why are you suddenly fainted?

256
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,040
We took so much energy to get you back!

257
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,040
Now that you're awake, we can rest assured.

258
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,040
Let's go make some delicious food for you now.

259
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,040
Hurry up and get well soon!

260
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,040
We won't get lost!

261
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,040
God years later Bürista!

262
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,040
Now have a look around!

263
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,040
Someone looked around!

264
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,040
In any case, it's gone!

265
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:32,040
Oh, it seems like the space has been upgraded.

266
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:38,040
With the growth of this year, the ability to space has also become more and more powerful.

267
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,040
Time has gone by.

268
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:47,040
Before the final exam, the spirits can all be upgraded to the high-end of the Jiu-Ling Qi.

269
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,040
The spirits are not very likely to be the internal ghosts.

270
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,040
The internal ghosts have already left.

271
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,040
The owner has no money to pay for the door plate.

272
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,040
Before we know it, we still can't lose any money.

273
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,040
I'm wondering if the spirits have seen the young man.

274
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,040
It seems that they can't keep it.

275
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,040
We still have to take the initiative to test his reaction.

276
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,040
Sect Leader!

277
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,040
You're here?

278
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,040
The fight that just happened in the sect has been so fierce.

279
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,040
I'm really sorry.

280
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:36,040
But, I'm relieved to see you're fine.

281
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,040
Xiao Men, what's wrong?

282
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,040
I was just confessing to Sect Leader.

283
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,040
And he...

284
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:52,040
He said that after you joined the sect,

285
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,040
you will have hope, Ling Xiao.

286
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,040
No, no.

287
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,040
It's all thanks to everyone for working hard together.

288
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:09,040
Actually, I came here to explain to you about the year.

289
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,040
There are only these things about the year.

290
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:26,040
I didn't expect to see someone use the year.

291
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,040
It's so clear.

292
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,040
Sect Leader, what were you doing before?

293
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,040
Why did you join the sect?

294
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,040
Junior Brother Liu, don't talk about this.

295
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,040
I want to show you something.

296
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,040
Are you the one on this?

297
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,040
No way!

298
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,040
The family has sent me a notice!

299
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,040
Could it be that Junior Brother Liu is a talented person?

300
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,040
No, no, no.

301
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,040
Sect Leader, don't misunderstand.

302
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,040
This is so dirty.

303
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,040
Sect Leader, you have to believe me.

304
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,040
I believe you.

305
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:12,040
I've been watching your movements these days.

306
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,040
You're not a talented person.

307
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:21,040
But, you're familiar with me.

308
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,040
Your intentions, your actions,

309
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,040
and your words,

310
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:33,040
are like a sign of a war.

311
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,040
This is a sign of a war.

312
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,040
Please tell me,

313
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:44,040
are you his disciple, or his friend?

314
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:54,040
Or are you his disciple?

315
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,040
I love to sleep, I sleep with my body.

316
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,040
I love to sleep, I sleep with my body.

317
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:26,040
I sleep with my body.

318
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,040
I'm a teacher, please teach me.

319
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,040
I'm a teacher, please teach me.

320
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,040
I'm a teacher, please teach me.

321
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,040
I'm a teacher, please teach me.

322
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,040
I'm a teacher, please teach me.

323
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,040
I'm a teacher, please teach me.

324
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:17,040
I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm sure it's a little bit of a shame.

325
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:22,040
I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm sure it's a little bit of a shame.

326
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:27,040
I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm sure it's a little bit of a shame.

327
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:32,040
I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm sure it's a little bit of a shame.

328
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:37,040
I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm sure it's a little bit of a shame.
