00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Welcome!

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We can help you.

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We want to enter the city and rent a comfortable and affordable hotel.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No problem. Please wait outside.

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Hello.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Hello, boss. Please give Wei Zhi a speedy hotel. I want the fastest.

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm Lin Xiao Ge. I'll give you a contract.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No problem. I'll arrange it for you.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Please show me the secret music.

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Including the movements and the tongue.

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Little boy and papa, big Kun and waa.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Lin Xiao Ge, so big.

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What's your face? Is there a problem?

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
No, no. I'm searching.

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I can't let you set up the door.

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So embarrassing.

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Why don't you come again?

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Stop thinking.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I found you. It's Lin Xiao Ge.

68
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
No problem. Please give Wei Zhi a speedy hotel.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'll give you a secret music.

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Sir, your door is already famous.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'll show you.

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Get out of here.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'll show you.

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
In October, the challenge was successful.

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The level was high.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
In May, the leader died.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The level was low.

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
In August, the leader of the Pusha League,

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and the leader of all the leaders of Lin Xiao Ge,

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
was in the battle.

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
In February, the attack was successful.

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Lin Xiao Ge suffered a lot.

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He was killed by the leader.

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'll show you.

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What are you doing?

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Cooking.

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
No, you're cooking so well.

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You don't know what's going on with Lin Xiao Ge.

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm sorry. I don't know what's going on.

90
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I just think that there's an important guest today.

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Welcome.

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Anything I can help you?

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
My two leaders suffered a serious injury.

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I need to be in a hurry to treat them.

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And can you give them a handwritten letter?

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
No problem. Leave it to me.

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Excuse me, do you have a waterproof water pump?

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Wait a minute. I'll help you find it.

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
There's a thing. There's one left.

100
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That's great. The thing has been successful.

101
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Wait a minute. I want the last one.

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'll pay three times.

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
How is it, boss?

104
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Sorry. I've already been bought by this guest.

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That's right. You should always come first and wait.

106
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Boss, if you don't make money, you won't be a businesswoman.

107
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I need to get the thing that's handsome.

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Wait.

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Brother Liu.

110
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Brother Liu, eat slowly.

111
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I haven't eaten for days. Where are you laughing?

112
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I haven't eaten anywhere.

113
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm at home and I'm having a good time.

114
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Well...

115
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Brother Xue, I have a good time.

116
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Brother Liu, you don't seem to be in the right mood today.

117
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What do you mean?

118
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Why don't you drink today?

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Last night, I had a lot of drinks.

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I don't care. Let's have a drink today.

121
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
If you're afraid of me, you can take it from me.

122
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
How is it?

123
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Good.

124
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Today is the day when Ling Xiao Ge was born.

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm grateful for your support.

126
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Ling Xiao Ge, you're so beautiful.

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You're so beautiful.

128
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
No.

129
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Brother Liu is so beautiful.

130
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I didn't feel anything.

131
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I didn't expect that Liu Feng Mang's wine is so good.

132
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Brother Xue, I'm leaving.

133
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'll take this water pump.

134
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Take it away. Take it away.

135
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Don't be afraid.

136
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'll help you untie the rope.

137
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Don't be caught by those people anymore.

138
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Xiao Ni, although you've learned how to use the water pump,

139
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
this is just a start.

140
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Let's go meet our old friends now.

141
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Brother Xue!

142
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Man...Man-Gou!

143
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Someone's here!

144
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Who's here to kill Ling Xiao Ge?

145
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You're a useless sect.

146
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You're still standing here with such a good water pump.

147
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You're so useless.

148
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
If you don't want to die, you should hurry and leave.

149
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
This place is already a huge help for us.

150
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
A group of people who know nothing,

151
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
dare to kill me.

152
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You're so stupid.

153
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
He's a fast guy.

154
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Catch him.

155
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yes.

156
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Hello!

157
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What do you think of this area?

158
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Brother Xue!

159
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,720
Hmph, a bunch of rascals dare to attack my Ling Xiao Pavilion.

160
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,840
They are simply not self-explanatory.

161
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,680
I think you guys have some kind of misunderstanding about the power of the Shadow Cat.

162
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,760
Based on these little bugs you guys

163
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,760
are still hiding in Ling Xiao Pavilion's place.

164
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,320
This is old times.

165
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,320
Do you know Ling Xiao Pavilion is the world's first?

166
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,880
Why are you still standing here?

167
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,200
If you have any tricks, just come out!

168
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,200
Don't let me!

169
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Ah!

170
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Watch out!

171
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Run!

172
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Ah, Ling Xiao Pavilion, I'm back.

173
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I don't know what you guys are doing now.

174
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's only been a year. Why has it become like this?

175
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Where did the door go?

176
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The door is open. What's going on?

177
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Ah!

178
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Hei Ming! Hei Ming!

179
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Duan Shixia!

180
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Duan Shixia!

181
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Ah!

182
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Don't!

183
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Don't leave me!

184
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Ming!

185
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Don't leave!

186
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Don't leave!

187
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Ah!

188
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You guys are just a bunch of trash.

189
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Now, there's even no leader who can fight.

190
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I suggest you guys should leave.

191
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Otherwise...

192
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What is this?

193
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Where did you get that dog?

194
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
That's my word.

195
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Where did you guys come from?

196
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You dare to offend me, Ling Xiao Pavilion?

197
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You brat, mind your own business.

198
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Do you believe I'll let you go with me?

199
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Mind your own business?

200
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm the one who's in charge here.

201
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Xian Yichen, go!

202
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You guys are so bad!

203
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You're going to get a dog with me!

204
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Mo Ruoxi!

205
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What?

206
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Mo Ruoxi's trick is so bad!

207
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You're too weak.

208
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You're too weak.

209
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You're so bad!

210
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You're a bad dog. How could you beat me?

211
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
How could you?

212
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
These guys are too bad.

213
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You've been hit by the weakly dog.

214
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You haven't found it yet.

215
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You're not going to be punished.

216
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Don't be afraid, guys.

217
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Take out all the enemies.

218
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You're the only one left.

219
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Both of you, don't fight.

220
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Don't care about that dog.

221
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Attack Liu Chong Shi.

222
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You're too weak.

223
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You used the weakly dog to attack the normal person.

224
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
If you can't run away, you'll die.

225
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Brother, this is so funny.

226
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
This grass-dried pig must have let that kid run away.

227
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Where is he? Where did he go?

228
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Boss.

229
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Young man, come and take a rest.

230
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
But...

231
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I can't find so many high quality bugs.

232
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Didn't the Alliance send the order of the wild?

233
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
How could you do that?

234
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I... I want to report it.

235
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Okay.

236
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You've been swallowed.

237
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
No one knows.

238
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I let you go first.

239
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'll kill you if I don't kill you.

240
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You're so pretty.

241
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
That's right.

242
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Wait for us.

243
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You're so small.

244
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Young man.

245
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Young man.

246
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Thank you for your help.

247
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Ling Xiao Ge's head is so big.

248
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Thank you.

249
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I see you again.

250
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
That's great.

251
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Young... Young man.

252
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You... Who are you?

253
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You can't recognize me, right? I am...

254
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Wait.

255
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I can't say it now.

256
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Xuan Kun is a real man.

257
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Someone has touched my hand.

258
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Maybe he is the most familiar.

259
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Young man.

260
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'm Liu Feng Mang.

261
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I just think you're like a bird.

262
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm Gu Ling.

263
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Thank you for your help.

264
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Gu Ling, let's go and see what's going on.

265
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Young man, please wait.

266
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Everyone, this is the one who helped you.

267
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Don't be too polite.

268
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's my duty.

269
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Senior sister, go and see Brother Duan.

270
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Senior sister, go and see Brother Duan.

271
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Senior sister, how are you?

272
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
We finally caught it.

273
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
This shadow cat is a white-leafed gold-tailed cat.

274
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Congratulations, Sect Leader.

275
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
No.

276
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
He seems to like you very much.

277
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Then I'll give it to you.

278
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Really?

279
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You like him too, right?

280
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Then, take good care of him.

281
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Don't worry, Sect Leader.

282
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I will definitely train him

283
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
to be the best leader.

284
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm leaving.

285
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Go. Where are you going?

286
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm leaving, Ling Xiao Ke.

287
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
What did you say?

288
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Our Ling Chong is dead.

289
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Ling Xiao Ke is no longer there.

290
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's already gone.

291
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
This is Ling Xiao Ge.

292
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Why is there nothing?

293
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Are you alone?

294
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Yes, I'm the leader of Ling Xiao Ge.

295
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You're so young to be the leader.

296
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Can you do it?

297
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
There's no line at the door.

298
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You even said you want to be the best in the world.

299
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Really?

300
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Don't go.

301
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Ling Xiao Ge still has hope.

302
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I can help you.

303
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Re-do it.

304
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Who do you think you are?

305
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Ling Xiao Ge needs you to be a stranger.

306
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm telling you, Ling Xiao Ge is the best in the world.

307
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You're the only one who can do it.

308
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I'll take it seriously.

309
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'll build the best sect in the world.

310
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You're just like real.

311
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Don't disappoint me.

312
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Senior!

313
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Senior, you can't leave.

314
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
We still have to follow the order of the sect leader

315
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
to take over Ling Xiao Ge.

316
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
The sect leader is dead!

317
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Ling Xiao Ge is the one who brought it up.

318
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
In order to get him, we're nothing.

319
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Duan Yan, you're a bastard!

320
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I don't think you can say that.

321
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
We can still...

322
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Senior, you're the best!

323
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Ling Xiao Ge died a year ago!

324
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm sorry.

325
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I have to leave this place.

326
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Let's start over.

327
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Xiaowu, Li Cheng.

328
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Everyone, please stop Duan Yan.

329
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Sorry, Senior.

330
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Ling Xiao Ge is dead now.

331
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
He's already dead.

332
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Thank you for taking care of me.

333
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Take care, Senior.

334
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Don't leave! Ling Xiao Ge is still alive!

335
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Senior!

336
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Ling Xiao Ge is still alive.

337
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Take care.

338
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Ling Xiao Ge is still alive.

339
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Take care.

340
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Take care.

341
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Senior, you're the one who brought it up.

342
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I can definitely solve all the difficulties.

343
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Ling Xiao Ge is still alive.

344
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
So...

345
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
So...

346
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Don't leave.

347
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Don't leave!

348
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm sorry.

349
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm sorry.

350
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I'm sorry.

351
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I speak.

352
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Take care.

353
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
You've got to take me there.

354
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
attacking Ling Xiao Ge.

355
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
What the heck!

356
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,340
Cute

357
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,660
Like

358
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,480
TV
