1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,840
Then, there's our Lose Mor Avoidable

2
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,840
I will never kill myself

3
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,840
I will accept the price

4
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,840
I can't give up my life

5
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,840
I will go to the sea to meet the moon

6
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,840
I will return the favor to the king

7
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,840
I will give up my life

8
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,840
I will go to the sea to meet the moon

9
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,840
I will return the favor to the king

10
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,840
The King of the Sea

11
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,840
Gu Shimei

12
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,840
How are you?

13
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,840
Brother Duan

14
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,840
Why are you here?

15
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,840
You joined other sects

16
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,840
Who are you?

17
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,840
Get out of here

18
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,840
Don't hurt us

19
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,840
Unless you want to be a prey

20
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,840
Ling Xiao Ge is looking for you

21
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,840
Stop it

22
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,840
I'm talking to you

23
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,840
Let's not be in your eyes

24
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,840
Take it

25
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,840
Shui Heimi

26
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,840
Great

27
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,840
Heimi is alive

28
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,840
I thought I would never see you

29
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,840
Heimi

30
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,840
He is fighting

31
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,840
Let's fight

32
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,840
Great

33
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,840
Shui Heimi

34
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,840
Shui Heimi

35
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,840
I will kill you

36
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,840
I'm coming

37
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,840
Shui Heimi

38
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,840
Heimi

39
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,840
Heimi is not right

40
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,840
What happened to him?

41
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,840
As you see

42
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,840
He is alive

43
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,840
And stronger

44
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,840
Because

45
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,840
I joined a strong sect

46
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,840
They turned Heimi into this

47
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,840
Gu Ling

48
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,840
What's the point of you still supporting Ling Xiao Ge?

49
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,840
Come to our ghost sect

50
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,840
I will attract you

51
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,840
Believe me

52
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,840
This is the real strong sect

53
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,840
No, Brother Duan

54
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,840
You come back to Ling Xiao Ge

55
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,840
We will be back soon

56
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,840
I have the information

57
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,840
I will be back in Ling Xiao Ge

58
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,840
Ling Xiao Ge

59
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,840
I'm not lying to you

60
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,840
We have been in the ghost sect for a month

61
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,840
No, you see the box

62
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,840
Come back, Brother Duan

63
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,840
We can do it

64
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,840
You bitch

65
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,840
A shameless outsider

66
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,840
You are a useless spirit

67
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,840
And you are the heart of Guo Jia Jia's son

68
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,840
You want to re-establish Ling Xiao Ge

69
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,840
But if you can come back

70
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,840
Shut up

71
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,840
You don't know what you are talking about

72
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,840
You are so greedy

73
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,840
Brother Duan

74
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,840
Ling Xiao Ge really needs you

75
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,840
I'm no longer your senior

76
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,840
it can change your mind

77
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,840
last day

78
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,840
We basically fell in love

79
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,840
Forget my dance

80
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,840
I will not fall in love with him.

81
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,840
Brother Duan.

82
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,840
Brother Duan.

83
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,840
Brother Duan.

84
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,840
Brother Duan.

85
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,840
Brother Duan.

86
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,840
I found the fourth sister.

87
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,840
You are so good.

88
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,840
I have a question.

89
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,840
Why do you have a cat with a cat?

90
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,840
It's not good.

91
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,840
I will kill you if I am strong.

92
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,840
I will be killed by the cat.

93
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,840
I want to kill him.

94
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,840
Why did you go there?

95
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,840
But I don't think so.

96
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,840
I am too strong.

97
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,840
Everyone is avoiding me.

98
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,840
I will...

99
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,840
You are welcome.

100
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,840
I found this one first.

101
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,840
I have to take it.

102
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,840
Take it.

103
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,840
Or I will beat you.

104
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,840
Little boy.

105
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,840
Little boy, you are playing.

106
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,840
Who is this relative?

107
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,840
You are so rude.

108
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,840
I am the most powerful god of the world.

109
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,840
The master of the world.

110
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,840
The master of the world.

111
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,840
Why do you have such a long name?

112
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,840
How did you know?

113
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,840
You dare to kill me.

114
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,840
I am sorry, Lu Xiaomei.

115
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,840
I accidentally hit the handball.

116
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,840
Bastard.

117
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,840
You want to go?

118
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,840
Then do you want to summon the little white rabbit or the little cat?

119
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,840
You are forcing me to do it.

120
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,840
What?

121
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,840
What's going on?

122
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,840
Brother, look.

123
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,840
What is that?

124
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,840
That is...

125
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,840
I can't do it.

126
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,840
What?

127
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,840
You can't do it.

128
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,840
I will do it.

129
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,840
I can't do it.

130
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,840
How do you know?

131
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,840
I can't do it.

132
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,840
You can do it.

133
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,840
You can't do it.

134
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,840
Let me see.

135
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,840
What are you doing?

136
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,840
Is that a little cat?

137
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,840
Little cat.

138
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,840
What are you doing?

139
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,480
Little boy, is it Dragon Sky?

140
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,520
It's impossible.

141
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,520
They are not good at making fun of the name of the super god of the heaven.

142
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,040
Moreover, no matter how good the formation of a child is,

143
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,440
Ling Chu Chi can't even be a king.

144
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,640
It's still possible.

145
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:14,440
Oh, Master Bai said Ling Chu is born.

146
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,280
That's right, Lord Lv.

147
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,720
If Ling Chu Chi is enough for the next six years,

148
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,240
he can put Ling Chu Pei Tai directly into his Ling Chu Chi.

149
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,960
This way, he won't be limited by the capacity.

150
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,120
How could he be so good?

151
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,120
Why didn't my father give me one?

152
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,440
The heaven is rich and high.

153
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,520
What do you mean by that?

154
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,720
Ling Chu is very good at making fun of the name of the super god.

155
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,000
The birth of the king is a miracle.

156
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,480
What's strange is that his ability is still a bit weak.

157
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,480
I think this young man has some amazing skills.

158
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,560
You are...

159
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,000
You are...

160
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Ling Chu's half-life.

161
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,920
You know a lot.

162
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,920
Do you envy me?

163
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,280
Ling Chu's half-life?

164
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,600
He's dead.

165
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,960
Pei Tai is dead again.

166
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,960
He's dead.

167
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,960
He's dead again.

168
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,160
That's right.

169
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,160
I said I was not good at this.

170
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,160
You're wasting it.

171
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,160
You're wasting it.

172
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,160
You wasted so much time.

173
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,160
You're still not dead.

174
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,160
You're not good at this.

175
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,280
Father.

176
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,280
Father.

177
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,280
Father.

178
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,480
You dare not speak?

179
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,480
You are still very weak.

180
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,480
Ling Chu's half-life.

181
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,480
Why can't you remember?

182
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,480
You are too weak.

183
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,480
You...

184
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,480
You are too weak.

185
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You don't have any thoughts?

186
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Father, you can just keep it.

187
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Maybe Ling Chu's half-life is also a bit short.

188
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Ling Chu's development and growth are very close.

189
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
If Ling Chu is not good enough in the future,

190
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Ling Chu's strength will be limited.

191
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,960
I don't think I can marry a king of the world.

192
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,520
Where's that dragon?

193
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,520
It fell down.

194
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,520
I...

195
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,520
You fool! You're so much more than a tiger!

196
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,520
You're dead!

197
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,520
What?

198
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,520
You dare to blame me for my control?

199
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,520
You don't know that because you don't know how to train me.

200
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,520
That's why you're like this.

201
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,520
Dragon! You dare to save me?

202
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,520
What are you doing?

203
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,520
You two are fighting?

204
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,520
It seems that with his ability,

205
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,520
the king of the world is very powerful.

206
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,520
We have the victory.

207
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,520
Listen to my command.

208
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,520
Ready.

209
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,520
Right now!

210
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,520
Try my latest development.

211
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,520
One, two, three, go!

212
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,520
You're dead!

213
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,520
Dragon!

214
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,520
Damn it!

215
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,520
Dragon! You're not a tiger!

216
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,520
You again?

217
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,520
Nili, I have something to tell you.

218
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,520
Get out!

219
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,520
What's wrong?

220
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,520
Ling Chu is already so powerful.

221
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,520
Look at you, you're so shameless.

222
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,520
What about the special skill of the king of the world?

223
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,520
Haven't you seen it?

224
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,520
Open your eyes!

225
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,520
It's useless.

226
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,520
We'll win this time!

227
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,520
You two, hurry up and get to know me.

228
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,520
You think I'm boring?

229
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,520
Come again!

230
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,520
Come here!

231
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,520
You little bastard!

232
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,520
You're still fighting?

233
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,520
I think we're not that easy.

234
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,520
It's waste of time!

235
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,520
We're wasting time.

236
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,520
The skill of the king of the world is limited.

237
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,520
Nili, give me another ten points.

238
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,520
What?

239
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,520
Run, Xiao Fei!

240
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,520
I'll take it!

241
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,520
Easy to solve.

242
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,520
Xiao Fei!

243
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,520
Take it!

244
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,520
Stop!

245
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,520
What are you doing, boss?

246
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,520
It's annoying to be scolded by the dragon.

247
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,520
Dragon God's father?

248
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,520
If I don't scold you,

249
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,520
you'll be beaten to death.

250
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,520
What are you talking about?

251
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,520
I'm just scaring him.

252
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,520
It's very stupid.

253
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,520
Stupid?

254
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,520
Do you know how big your name is?

255
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,520
The whole team is afraid of you.

256
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,520
You're not afraid of me?

257
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,520
The whole team is afraid of us now.

258
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,520
You're so smart.

259
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,520
That guy is too mean!

260
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,520
He's almost my son!

261
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,520
You saw the strength gap.

262
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,520
I'll give you a life.

263
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,520
I'll give you a life.

264
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,520
I'll give you a life.

265
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,520
I won't give up even if I die.

266
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,520
I'll give you a life.

267
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,520
It's hard to do.

268
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,520
I told you not to kill him.

269
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,520
You're so greedy.

270
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,520
You can't hurt a bad guy.

271
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,520
Forget it.

272
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,520
Let's collect the score.

273
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,520
How much do you have now?

274
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,520
One point.

275
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,520
We're here.

276
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,520
You're so strong.

277
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,520
You're my son.

278
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,520
How did you do that?

279
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,520
Don't make me worry.

280
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,520
Who told you to be so greedy?

281
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,520
It's so hard.

282
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,520
I'll give you a life.

283
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,520
You were so close.

284
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,520
I was so lucky.

285
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,520
What's wrong with your ankle?

286
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,520
It's okay.

287
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,520
You're so good at training.

288
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,520
I won.

289
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,520
Long Ning Tian.

290
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,520
I'm Cheng Xi.

291
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,520
I'll defeat you.

292
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,520
Cheng Xi?

293
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,520
Yes.

294
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,520
I remember.

295
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,520
Who is Long Ning Tian?

296
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,520
I'm Long Ning Tian.

297
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,520
I'm Cheng Xi.

298
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,520
I'm Cheng Xi.

299
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,520
I'm Cheng Xi.

300
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,520
I'm Cheng Xi.

301
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,520
I'm Cheng Xi.

302
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,520
I'm Cheng Xi.

303
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,520
I'm Cheng Xi.

304
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,520
I'm Cheng Xi.

305
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,520
I'm Cheng Xi.

306
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,520
I'm Cheng Xi.

307
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,520
I'm Cheng Xi.

308
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,520
I'm Cheng Xi.

309
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,520
I'm Cheng Xi.

310
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,520
I'm along my friend.

311
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,520
I forgot to bring you a cup of tea.

312
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,520
I'm all envious.

313
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,520
My friend's turn to be like me!

314
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,520
I'm a strongÇinей prosthet.

315
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,520
Oh

316
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:20,520
Oh
