Good luck, everyone!

Okay, then, to the next level...

00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:37,560
I bought them and they are from Thanks a lot

39
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,520
Those clams are all depended on you

40
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,360
Mo!

41
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,960
Master Jiao Bai,

42
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,960
it seems that the place is almost closed.

43
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,360
How about we go to the west side?

44
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,640
The Pearl disappeared.

45
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,880
It seems that there are already people there.

46
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,720
Forget it. Let's draw...

47
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,600
Where are the people?

48
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,800
Jiao Bai Mo!

49
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,920
He's not listening.

50
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,800
Oh no.

51
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,320
There are actually three people.

52
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,560
I only have one person.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,280
I'm afraid I can't beat them.

54
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,000
He wants us to hand over the buns?

55
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,680
This...

56
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,840
Xiu Xiang!

57
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,800
What should we do?

58
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,240
It seems to be very powerful.

59
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,400
It's strange.

60
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,360
Why do they take the buns and don't need to return the score?

61
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,040
There's no way.

62
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,560
We can only use our B-shape.

63
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,480
Fly to the sky to control its cold!

64
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,960
Grow up to the forest of the whole continent.

65
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,080
And...

66
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,440
Grow up to the top of the mountain!

67
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,720
To prevent the world from being destroyed,

68
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,120
to protect the peace of the world,

69
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,200
I will defeat the enemy's powerful power.

What can we do?

75
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,240
I really have no idea.

76
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
Give me your bags.

77
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,240
I'll spare you.

78
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,240
I won't die.

79
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,240
Right.

80
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
You let me do anything.

81
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,240
I won't take the bags away.

82
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,240
Or...

83
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,240
Or...

84
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,240
Sister Ye will...

85
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,240
She will die.

of the new member group

90
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,240
that just joined the competition.

91
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,240
They said that to increase the brightness

92
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,240
is good for our future development.

93
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,240
They said that we have arranged everything.

94
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,240
We don't want to think about anything.

95
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,240
Just come to the competition.

96
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,240
I didn't expect that you would do it without a word.

97
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,240
Our neighbors are all here to sell the Meng.

98
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,240
They won't fight at all.

99
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,240
I can see that.

100
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,240
But...

101
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,240
Sister Ye was kidnapped by another person.

102
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,240
We are going to give her 5 bags.

103
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,240
If we can't do it,

104
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,240
I will kill Sister Ye

105
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,240
if I can't do it.

106
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,240
Where is the bad guy?

107
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,240
Tell me.

108
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,240
I'll help you to get rid of him.

109
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,240
Let him go.

110
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,240
He's back so soon.

111
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,240
Did you find the bad guy?

112
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,240
We only found three.

113
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,240
You want to fight with me?

114
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,240
Don't you want his life?

115
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,240
Don't touch it.

116
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,240
We found a way to avoid it.

117
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,240
Tell me.

118
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,240
You want to win the competition, right?

119
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,240
We have something to help you win.

120
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,240
Look.

121
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,240

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,240
You...

123
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,240
We made it.

124
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,240
Look at his neck.

125
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,240
He has a broken head on his neck.

126
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,240
You...

127
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,240
If you dare to listen to me again,

128
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,240
I will cut his neck off.

129
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,240

130
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,240

132
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,240
Stop.

134
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,240
Stop.

135

Since you're doing this,

136
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,240
make a choice.

137
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,240
Either you see him die here,

138
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
or you all get hit by a broken head

139
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,240
and become my tool.

140
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
After I finish the competition,

141
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,240
I will spare you.

142
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,240
Make a choice.

143
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,240
Sister Ye.

144
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,240
Help me.

145
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,240
Make a choice.

146
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,240
Make a choice.

147
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,240
Think about it.

148
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,240
Make a choice.

149
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,240
Or you all get hit by a broken head.

150
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,240
What?

151
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,240
Stand up.

152
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,240
Are you crazy?

153
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,240
What?

154
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,240
Who are you talking about?

155
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,240
You...

156
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,240
And the head.

157
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,240
Sister Ye.

158
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,240
It's okay.

159
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,240

160
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,240
Thank you so much.

162
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,240
Are you okay?

163
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,240
Go away.

164
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,240
Sister Ye.

165
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
Sister Ye.

166
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,240

I didn't know who I was before.

I didn't know who I was before.

00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,240
It's getting late. I should continue my exam.

175
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,240
Big Sister, can you tell me which door you are from?

176
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,240
I'm from Ling Xiao Pavilion. What's wrong?

177
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,240
These are the lives of the people who saved Big Sister.

178
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,240
We will leave the competition.

The exam and the competition have been going on for two hours.

184
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,240
The God of God will rank first and the score will be 42 points.

185
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,240
How is Ling Xiao Pavilion doing now?

186
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,240
Currently, it's 7th place. The score is 76 points.

187
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,240
7th place?

188
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,240
Isn't it good?

189
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,240
There's another situation.

190
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,240
We have investigated the place where the God of God is lost.

191
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,240
All the people are killed.

192
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,240
How come?

193
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,240
It seems that someone is using the rules to kill people.

194
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,240
Let's investigate it.

195
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,240
The total number of the bags is marked.

196
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,240
The second stage is starting.

197
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,240
Hey, I said

198
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,240
why are you following the door sign?

199
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,240
Why are you following me?

200
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,240
Who's following you?

201
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,240
I just...

202
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,240
I haven't seen Xiao Jue for a long time.

203
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,240
You're so affectionate.

204
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,240
Jiang Rour,

205
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,240
what do you think

206
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,240
I am?

207
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,240
You?

208
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,240
You are

209
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,240
a

210
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,240
good person.

211
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,240
No, no, no.

212
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,240
I mean,

213
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,240
I have a headache recently.

214
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,240
So I can't remember what happened in the past.

215
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,240
Headache?

216
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,240
Did you get the monster again?

217
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,240
What?

218
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,240
What monster?

219
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,240
What monster?

220
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,240
What monster?

221
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,240
Tell me.

222
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,240
What did you say?

223
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,240
Tell me what happened when I got sick.

224
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,240
Help!

225
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,240
It hurts!

226
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,240
It hurts.

227
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,240
I'm sorry.

228
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,240
Who did you do this to me?

229
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,240
What's wrong?

230
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,240
You're the same.

231
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,240
Be careful.

232
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,240
Yan Wei?

233
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,240
Damn it.

234
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,240
How did you know about him?

235
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,240
You didn't even listen to my attack order.

236
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,240
Why are you here?

237
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240
Do you know him?

238
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,240
Mu Chuan.

239
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,240
Do you have enemies?

240
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,240
Don't be nervous, boss.

241
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,240
You're friends.

242
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,240
You four are in the same group.

243
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,240
You're going to be very low-skilled.

244
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,240
I know that.

245
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,240
This is what you mean.

246
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,240
Don't ask.

247
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,240
Let's go.

248
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,240
I'll collect the bags.

249
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,240
Who wants to help you?

250
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,240
We're friends.

251
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,240
What's going on?

252
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,240
Someone's here.

253
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,240
This is a miracle.

254
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,240
Long Miao.

255
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,240
Who are you?

256
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,240
I'm Fen Duo.

257
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,240
I'm the god of the temple.

258
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,240
You're also a good man.

259
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,240
Xiao Men, don't fight.

260
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,240
Let me talk to him first.

261
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,240
Senior Nie, please be wise.

262
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,240
This is where we collect the points.

263
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,240
We can't transfer them.

264
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,240
There are no bags to collect.

265
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,240
So we don't need to use them.

266
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,240
I think we don't need to fight for nothing.

267
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,240
What do you think?

268
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,240
That's right.

269
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,240
That's great.

270
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,240
Senior Nie is wise.

271
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,240
So, goodbye.

272
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,240
See you.

273
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,240
Xiao Men, let's go.

274
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,240
Please pay attention to the students.

275
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,240
The second stage of the exam is open.

276
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,240
The rules are changed.

277
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,240
You get another student's reward.

278
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,240
You touch your own reward 30 seconds later.

279
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,240
You'll get all the points.

280
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,240
No.

281
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:59,240
Looks like we're strong enough to fight.

282
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
Retreat.

283
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,240
Xiao Jue, Xiao Teng.

284
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,240
Prepare to fight.

285
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,240
You're so weak.

286
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,240
Run, big brother.

287
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,240
Bai Mao, what are you doing?

288
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,240
We're fighting with that guy.

289
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,240
He's so strong.

290
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,240
Can't we fight with him?

291
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,240
How can I explain this to you?

292
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,240
Why did he run away?

293
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,240
Old lady, why are you a coward?

294
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,240
Come on, let's fight.

295
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,240
Let me see how strong you are.

296
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,240
Uncle, uncle.

297
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,240
My hand.

298
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,240
You can't even take out the spirit.

299
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,240
You're so weak.

300
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,240
Please.

301
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,240
We're not the spirit masters.

302
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,240
I'm telling the truth.

303
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,240
Actually, they're not the spirit masters.

304
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,240
No one can win.

305
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,240
I'll call the police.

306
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,240
I'll give you two more to find the door.

307
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,240
Don't show up.

308
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,240
Good.

309
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,240
You're hurting them.

310
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,240
I knew the rules would change.

311
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,240
I hope they can give up.

312
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,240
Or it'll be a disaster.

313
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,240
Why?

314
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,240
They're trying to kill each other.

315
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,240
Miss Bai seems to have some misunderstandings about the exam.

316
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,240
The purpose of the exam is to pick the strongest door.

317
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,240
Then you don't have to kill them.

318
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,240
The purpose of the rules is not to kill each other.

319
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,240
Miss Bai, you can take the purpose of the rules.

320
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,240
The spirit masters?

321
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,240
You too?

322
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,240
I can't even breathe.

323
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,240
We were sent here.

324
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,240
We can't do anything.

325
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,240
Sir, please spare us.

326
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,240
We've given you the handkerchief.

327
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,240
We have nothing to do with you.

328
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,240
In the second phase, it's obviously to encourage everyone to take the handkerchief.

329
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,240
But because of the knowledge of the book,

330
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,240
it's very difficult to take the handkerchief.

331
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,240
So the purpose of the rules is not to encourage everyone to take the chance.

332
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,240
It's to encourage the weak.

333
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,240
To encourage?

334
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,240
Now, the handkerchief has become a threat to all the sects.

335
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,240
Only the real one who has the determination will stay.

336
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,240
I think this is the real purpose of the alliance.

337
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,240
That's right.

338
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,240
Those who can't hold it are already in the back of the hall.

339
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,240
The seal of the hall is fully recognized.

340
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,240
The rest of the team has 15.

341
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,240
Another team is recognized.

342
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,240
Dan Mao, you're the only one left in the sect.

343
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,240
Don't you think about leaving?

344
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,240
Bullshit!

345
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,240
I'm going to take the handkerchief.

346
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,240
Look, I'll be there by the end.

347
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,240
You're right.

348
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,240
The useless is useless.

349
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:37,240
So the useless thing shouldn't be in this world.

350
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,240
Are you wearing the handkerchief?

351
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,240
Very good.

352
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,240
I remember you.

353
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,240
I'm going to take the handkerchief.

354
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,240
I'm going to take the handkerchief.

355
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
I'm going to take the handkerchief.

356
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,240
I'm going to take the handkerchief.

357
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,240
I'm going to take the handkerchief.

358
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,240
I'm going to take the handkerchief.

359
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,240
I'm going to take the handkerchief.

360
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,240
I'm going to take the handkerchief.

361
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,240
I'm going to take the handkerchief.

362
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,240
I'm going to take the handkerchief.

363
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,240
I'm going to take the handkerchief.

364
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,240
I'm going to take the handkerchief.

365
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,240
I'm going to take the handkerchief.

366
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,240
I'm going to take the handkerchief.

367
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,240
I'm going to take the handkerchief.

368
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,240
Come on.

369
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,240
ambience

370
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:54,240
Called

371
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:02,240
Besido

372
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,240
One, two, three, four!

373
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,240
Ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba!
