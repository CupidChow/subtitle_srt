1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm going to make a new one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm going to use the same thing as the other one.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm going to make a new one.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm going to make a new one.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm going to make a new one.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm going to make a new one.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm going to make a new one.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to make a new one.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm going to make a new one.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to make a new one.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm going to make a new one.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm going to make a new one.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm going to make a new one.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going to make a new one.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm going to make a new one.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm going to make a new one.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm going to make a new one.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm going to make a new one.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm going to make a new one.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm going to make a new one.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm going to make a new one.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm going to make a new one.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm going to make a new one.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm going to make a new one.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm going to make a new one.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Now, Ling Xiao Ge is going to the building.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Brother Duan Ye is a man of the sect.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
If he is the most powerful, he is the strongest.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's a pity that he is leaving now.

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Then the current candidate is also a useless man.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I just came. How can I be embarrassed?

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It must be the chief of the martial arts world.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
How can it be?

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Greetings, chief.

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You are so clever.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I thought you would call me chief Fan.

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Then I will take the chief first.

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Then what should we do next?

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Of course, we should catch the spirit.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Chief Fan?

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You should say it.

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Ling Xiao Ge was killed by the sect.

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Our spirit is all killed.

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Now, Xiao Xi, Yue Jie and I don't have any spirit.

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But the skill of the martial arts world is to capture the new spirit.

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's a test for the next one.

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But the sect's superior spirit, Qi Xi Di, has been defeated.

48
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's a good spirit that can't be captured by others.

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I know a place.

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I caught it first.

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I think your spirit is Qi Xi Di.

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's a good spirit.

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Mo Huo, follow me.

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
No one is following us?

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I don't think so.

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Brother, don't leave me.

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Come down.

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
This is what I said.

59
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's really Qi Xi Di.

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The leader of Qi Xi Di should be in this place.

61
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Leader? What is that?

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The level of the same cat and tiger is higher than the tiger.

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And the elephant is divided into four.

64
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
For example, these flower-shaped stones are the common form of the clan.

65
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It looks like the form of the right-winged seven-five-six-six.

66
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The school monkey is also the clan.

67
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The spirit of the clan is usually more gentle.

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The higher the level, the more careful it is.

69
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What level is that spirit?

70
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It looks so fierce.

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Three tailed foxes?

72
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The one with the spirit of the living spirit?

73
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
No. Why is there an animal-like spirit-like animal in this cave?

74
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Everyone, be careful. That spirit-like animal is the master.

75
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Get up!

76
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
How did you guys find this place?

77
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This place is a battle of the great man.

78
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Just go away if you have the strength.

79
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Otherwise, I won't be polite.

80
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You are not very confident.

81
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You are not very good at the level of the first level.

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Leave this kind of weakness to me.

83
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Which spirit-like beast is better?

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Xiao Man, is this really useful?

85
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Why don't we have any spirit-like beasts?

86
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Zhao Huan Huan can change colors.

87
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Just use this micro-shape to make the expression more attractive.

88
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I am not trying.

89
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's effective. Be careful.

90
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The spirit-like beast, let's go.

91
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Success!

92
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The eyes are sharp.

93
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What is that sound?

94
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
This micro-shape is the spirit-like beast.

95
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The spirit-like beast, go!

96
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Hurry, don't be caught by him.

97
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Is that the spirit-like beast?

98
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Be careful.

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
This is the spirit-like beast.

100
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It has its own special skill.

101
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's very simple.

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I said it. Who catches first is who.

103
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Don't come to me.

104
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Go!

105
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Go!

106
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Look! What's going on?

107
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
My color!

108
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What's going on?

109
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
No, this skill is not good at all.

110
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's you!

111
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
This skill is very strange. Everyone, hide!

112
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Be careful.

113
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
We are going to die. Protect yourself first.

114
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
My hand?

115
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
This is...

116
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Xiao Juan, hurry, take the poison.

117
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Use it on me. I am poisoned.

118
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
No!

119
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
No!

120
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Ye Wei!

121
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Ye Wei, stop!

122
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What's going on?

123
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The blood and the dragon are drawn.

124
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's been so long.

125
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It doesn't seem like a general.

126
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I see.

127
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Its skill is to absorb the color.

128
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And then use the color to create a fake.

129
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So it is.

130
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
This guy is fooling me.

131
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's you!

132
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
He is afraid that he will confuse us and confuse you.

133
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
He has this skill.

134
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But it's not a real injury.

135
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Except for the poison, it's only me who is in trouble.

136
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Ye Wei, stop!

137
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I will solve it with my long-term skill.

138
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Ye Wei!

139
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Let's work together.

140
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
After we catch it, how is the balance?

141
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Let's catch it first.

142
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Tai Di, that direction.

143
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yes, that's right.

144
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
We made it.

145
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Cheng Wan Yao!

146
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
What? This...

147
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
The dragon and the stone have changed colors.

148
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's the same again.

149
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Where did he go?

150
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Be careful.

151
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
He might have hidden the color.

152
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Ye Wei, the dragon has to be caught.

153
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
There!

154
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Ye Wei!

155
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
What is this?

156
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
He is...

157
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I will save you!

158
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
At this moment, a dog has entered the camp.

159
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
In this world, the dog is blind.

160
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
This is how the image of the dog is after the fake.

161
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
This smart little Tai Di

162
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
decides to use his own way to save his owner.

163
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
How did you see him?

164
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
We caught the leader!

165
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
These guys are so smart!

166
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Go after them!

167
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Goodbye, you guys!

168
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Thank you for your help!

169
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I will go to the trading group tomorrow.

170
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Let's go for a walk.

171
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Let's start the adventure.

172
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Su.

173
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,900
Three for everybody, four for Z dad

174
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:32,020
for

175
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:38,580
Office

176
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,580
You're quite good.

177
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,580
Do you want to teach me?

178
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,580
Cut the crap.

179
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,580
I've given up my Han Wei.

180
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,580
Take his Han Wei back.

181
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,580
Han Wei!

182
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,580
Han Wei, don't be afraid. I'll take you away now.

183
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,580
You let him run away?

184
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,580
Stop!

185
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,580
Let me see where he runs.

186
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,580
You Yang, what do you want?

187
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:21,580
It's obvious that you can't get back to Ling Chong.

188
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,580
You bastard!

189
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,580
Han Wei!

190
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,580
Come again!

191
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,580
You bastard!

192
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,580
What are you still doing without the value?

193
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,580
You're just a soldier.

194
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,580
You can still sell a good price.

195
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,580
Episode 1

196
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,580
This is...

197
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,580
It looks like...

198
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,580
Liu's brother.

199
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,580
It doesn't look like him.

200
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,580
Let's not talk about it.

201
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,580
Let's observe it.

202
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,580
Everyone, wait.

203
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,580
What are you doing?

204
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,580
Nothing.

205
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,580
Ling Xiao Ge, Mo Mo Da.

206
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,580
Please take out all our money.

207
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:10,580
Sorry, your account is not in the best shape.

208
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,580
Qian Chun is gone.

209
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,580
Who is it?

210
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,580
What a pity!

211
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,580
Who did it?

212
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,580
Oh, right.

213
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,580
I suddenly remembered that I have some savings.

214
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,580
So cute.

215
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,580
Xing Ge is so handsome.

216
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,580
But it's too expensive.

217
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,580
Boss, you can't sell a good price.

218
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,580
You can't be cheap.

219
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,580
You have the color here.

220
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,580
It looks fresh.

221
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,580
It's not expensive.

222
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:04,580
Sister, it's not a common thing to buy vegetables.

223
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,580
What's that?

224
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,580
Green pepper.

225
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,580
Sister, it's so delicious.

226
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:18,580
Sister, I look like a princess.

227
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,580
Okay, keep it for me.

228
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,580
Thank you, sister.

229
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,580
It's not over yet, right?

230
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,580
Here.

231
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,580
Sister Yue, we have a leader now.

232
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,580
Have you chosen?

233
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,580
Beauty.

234
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,580
The new leader of the house.

235
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,580
Come and have a look.

236
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,580
Isn't that the Xijiao Bear Cat we caught?

237
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,580
It's the strategy of the guard.

238
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,580
We caught this leader.

239
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,580
Give it back to us.

240
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,580
This master.

241
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,580
You are that Ling Xiao Ge, right?

242
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,580
Last time, we didn't destroy you all.

243
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:38,580
You didn't even close the door and make a fool of us.

244
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,580
Say it again.

245
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:46,580
Will you use the spirit bug to attack the alliance?

246
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,580
You want to be executed, right?

247
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,580
Boss Wei, look.

248
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,580
Your spirit bug ran away while you were attacking.

249
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,580
How could we move in this dead place?

250
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,580
Have a good cooperation.

251
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,580
Okay.

252
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:43,580
Xijiao Bear Cat, can you listen to my request?

253
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,580
I can't help you with the dirty business.

254
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,580
I have enough of my weakness.

255
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,580
I hope you can help me.

256
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,580
My spirit bug.

257
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,580
I can't help you.

258
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,580
He's got the spirit bug!

259
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,580
I'll put my hands here,

260
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,580
just like the one in the sky.

261
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,580
Keep your hands straight.

262
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,580
Don't let the air get in the way.

263
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,580
Next, let's see the moon.

264
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,580
What's wrong with him?

265
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,580
Why is he so good?

266
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,580
He's really good.

267
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,580
The moon is really good.

268
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,580
How could he even buy his own spirit bug?

269
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,580
Please give me your paper.

270
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,580
They seem to be telling us something.

271
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,580
It seems like their master was caught.

272
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,580
I want you to save him.

273
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,580
Are you going to save him?

274
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,580
Can we defeat Zizai now?

275
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,580
The Zizai Sect's branch is in the oil and oil meeting.

276
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,580
They came to us to find trouble.

277
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:41,580
They have the power to help the Zizai Sect.

278
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,580
If it's the sect leader,

279
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,580
they should be able to save him.

280
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,580
The power we have now...

281
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,580
It's good. Maybe they have the possibility to see through.

282
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,580
Let's go back to the sect.

283
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,580
What's this?

284
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,580
What does Junior Liu want to show us?

285
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,580
It's so mysterious.

286
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,580
Take a look. What is this?

287
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,580
It's the paper that Sect Leader didn't leave to us.

288
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,580
That's what you're talking about.

289
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,580
Look! There's a box!

290
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,580
There's another paper.

291
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,580
What is this?

292
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,580
Gu Ling, there are also friends from the sect.

293
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,580
Seeing this message...

294
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,580
means I've been in a bad mood.

295
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,580
I didn't expect that this way of meeting would connect with you.

296
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,580
I didn't care enough about you before.

297
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,580
I was able to give you the best.

298
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:52,580
Now, it must be very hard.

299
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,580
It's all my fault.

300
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,580
I'm really...

301
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,580
very sorry.

302
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,580
But no matter what,

303
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,580
please don't be angry.

304
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,580
We still have a chance.

305
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,580
We will definitely get what we lost.

306
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:20,580
I'm sure that Ling Xiao Ge will be the best sect in the world.

307
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,580
I've left you some things to remember.

308
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:27,580
I can let you guys speed up in a short period of time.

309
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,580
Open the box.

310
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,580
There's a detailed way that I wrote.

311
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,580
Be strong.

312
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,580
And then, fire will be on fire.

313
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,580
I'm sorry.

314
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,580
Please, everyone.

315
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,580
I will always be by your side.

316
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,580
I will witness your glory.

317
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,580
Popo Popo Popo

318
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,580
Popo Popo

319
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,580
Popo Popo Popo

320
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,580
Popo Popo Popo
