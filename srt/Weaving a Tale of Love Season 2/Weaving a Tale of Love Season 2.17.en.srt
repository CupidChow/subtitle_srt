<i>[Episode 17]</i>

3
00:01:36,852 --> 00:01:38,212
There is no need for you all to worry,

4
00:01:39,292 --> 00:01:42,572
As long as your statement doesn't significantly
contradict with Captain Zhang's,

5
00:01:43,212 --> 00:01:44,412
the charge of deception

6
00:01:45,332 --> 00:01:47,252
would naturally not fall upon you all,

7
00:01:48,092 --> 00:01:50,452
Your honor, please investigate further,

8
00:01:51,372 --> 00:01:54,132
I've heard Zhang Er talk about this,

9
00:01:54,132 --> 00:01:56,312
but I haven't seen it myself,

10
00:01:56,312 --> 00:02:00,412
so I don't know what is really happening,

11
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,192
I was confused just now

12
00:02:02,192 --> 00:02:03,512
and offended you,

13
00:02:03,512 --> 00:02:04,852
It's all my fault,

14
00:02:04,852 --> 00:02:08,532
- Please forgive me,
- Please forgive me,

15
00:02:08,532 --> 00:02:10,092
Please forgive me,

16
00:02:16,652 --> 00:02:17,972
Prefect Wang, please take a seat,

17
00:02:19,012 --> 00:02:20,732
Thanks, but there's no need,

18
00:02:21,412 --> 00:02:22,732
I still have official duties to attend to,

19
00:02:22,732 --> 00:02:24,612
so if you have no other matters,

20
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:26,532
I have to take my leave now,

21
00:02:26,532 --> 00:02:28,632
Why do you want to kill me?

22
00:02:28,632 --> 00:02:31,812
Madam, that's not a joke to be made casually,

23
00:02:31,812 --> 00:02:34,332
I have had no grievances with you,

24
00:02:34,332 --> 00:02:35,732
Why would I harm you, Madam?

25
00:02:35,732 --> 00:02:38,612
The incident with the coachman at the residence
was my oversight,

26
00:02:38,612 --> 00:02:41,432
but I wasn't aware of his actions,

27
00:02:41,432 --> 00:02:43,252
Then, was it related to Protector-General Qu

28
00:02:45,172 --> 00:02:46,892
or the Princess?

29
00:02:50,812 --> 00:02:52,132
Madam,

30
00:02:52,732 --> 00:02:53,852
what are you talking about?

31
00:02:53,852 --> 00:02:56,272
Why can't I understand?

32
00:02:56,272 --> 00:02:57,812
Are you genuinely not understanding

33
00:02:58,412 --> 00:02:59,732
or just pretending not to?

34
00:03:09,052 --> 00:03:10,112
Captain Zhang,

35
00:03:11,052 --> 00:03:12,412
what should we do now?

36
00:03:14,692 --> 00:03:16,752
It was all my fault,

37
00:03:16,752 --> 00:03:17,972
After several months,

38
00:03:17,972 --> 00:03:20,112
it's normal for
some people can't remember it clearly,

39
00:03:20,112 --> 00:03:22,012
but I never lied,

40
00:03:22,012 --> 00:03:24,372
Your words give us reassurance,

41
00:03:27,532 --> 00:03:28,576
Among all of you,

42
00:03:29,772 --> 00:03:31,252
has anyone seen the northern herdsmen?

43
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:34,692
We have never seen them,

44
00:03:35,572 --> 00:03:38,852
I encountered them on the road

45
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:41,492
and bought twenty calves before hurrying back,

46
00:03:41,492 --> 00:03:42,692
I didn't meet anyone else,

47
00:03:44,772 --> 00:03:47,132
Captain Zhang's words are quite interesting,

48
00:03:48,012 --> 00:03:51,252
Now, the northern rebels are causing chaos,

49
00:03:52,652 --> 00:03:55,292
If there are northern herders who have come
to graze on the outskirts of Xizhou,

50
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:56,892
it must have caused quite a commotion,

51
00:03:57,452 --> 00:03:59,972
Now, the village junior officer
is completely unaware of it,

52
00:04:00,652 --> 00:04:03,132
The northern herders must have come secretly,

53
00:04:04,092 --> 00:04:06,372
How many benefits
did you give to these northerners

54
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:08,202
so that he only found you

55
00:04:08,202 --> 00:04:10,332
and sold you just twenty calves?

56
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:12,232
This matter is too important,

57
00:04:12,232 --> 00:04:14,052
It also involves your titled official status,

58
00:04:14,052 --> 00:04:15,612
I dare not make decisions on my own,

59
00:04:17,332 --> 00:04:19,012
If you cannot explain clearly,

60
00:04:19,012 --> 00:04:22,332
then please go to the military barrack
and defend yourself,

61
00:04:23,492 --> 00:04:24,512
Please judge wisely,

62
00:04:24,512 --> 00:04:27,712
I have never done anything against the country,

63
00:04:27,712 --> 00:04:30,572
Captain Zhang would never collude
with the rebels in the north,

64
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:34,372
Now you all know that the military is currently

65
00:04:35,132 --> 00:04:38,172
conducting a stringent investigation on
those in contact with the rebels

66
00:04:39,052 --> 00:04:41,092
If you want to vouch for Captain Zhang,

67
00:04:41,892 --> 00:04:43,892
then please accompany Captain Zhang

68
00:04:43,892 --> 00:04:45,332
and defend yourselves in the military

69
00:04:56,252 --> 00:04:57,332
Madam,

70
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,172
you really got us,

71
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:02,812
Why would you make such a statement?

72
00:05:03,652 --> 00:05:05,932
I have always been open and honest,

73
00:05:08,332 --> 00:05:09,772
Now I finally understand

74
00:05:09,772 --> 00:05:12,612
why the Empress Wu regards you so highly,

75
00:05:13,372 --> 00:05:14,732
It seems like the Protector-General Qu

76
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:16,812
has not seldom checked our background,

77
00:05:17,332 --> 00:05:18,400
Alright then,

78
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:22,792
Then, let's just be frank with each other

79
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:26,012
to avoid causing misunderstandings
from everyone guessing,

80
00:05:27,372 --> 00:05:30,052
It's unfortunate that I am a nobody

81
00:05:30,052 --> 00:05:31,852
and don't hold much power or influence,

82
00:05:31,852 --> 00:05:34,652
There are many things I don't know
as I simply follow orders,

83
00:05:34,652 --> 00:05:38,532
Madam, if you want any information from me,

84
00:05:38,532 --> 00:05:40,212
then you've come to the wrong person,

85
00:05:42,332 --> 00:05:43,612
It seems that Prefect Wang

86
00:05:44,452 --> 00:05:45,852
is not willing to cooperate,

87
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,772
It's not like I'm not willing to cooperate,
I really don't know,

88
00:05:50,652 --> 00:05:51,932
I'll take my leave,

89
00:05:51,932 --> 00:05:54,572
Aren't you afraid that I will inform
Qu Chongyu about what I know?

90
00:06:01,212 --> 00:06:02,992
Your words and actions
are your own responsibility, Madam,

91
00:06:02,992 --> 00:06:05,772
Of course, I can't stop you,

92
00:06:05,772 --> 00:06:07,832
But let me tell you,
The Minister won't be easily fooled,

93
00:06:07,832 --> 00:06:10,092
It's not like he believes everything you say,

94
00:06:10,652 --> 00:06:12,052
I know that your Qu family is vulnerable

95
00:06:12,052 --> 00:06:13,892
because the Princess has something on you,

96
00:06:13,892 --> 00:06:15,372
And you don't want Qu Chongyu

97
00:06:15,372 --> 00:06:17,132
to find out about it,

98
00:06:26,372 --> 00:06:28,732
Madam, you must be joking,

99
00:06:30,692 --> 00:06:32,252
But we both know

100
00:06:32,252 --> 00:06:33,892
it's not a joke,

101
00:06:34,692 --> 00:06:36,312
Since Prefect Wang is unwilling to speak,

102
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,272
I have no choice but to ask Minister Qu

103
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,352
about what leverage

104
00:06:39,352 --> 00:06:41,212
the Princess holds over

105
00:06:41,212 --> 00:06:43,712
the Qu family in Chang'an,

106
00:06:43,712 --> 00:06:45,272
It must be something powerful

107
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:46,972
if it's making Protector-General Qu hide it
even from his own son

108
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:48,372
and work so hard for her,

109
00:06:48,372 --> 00:06:49,504
Excuse me,

110
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:57,852
What's wrong? Are you scared?

111
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:05,692
Senior Official Pei,

112
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,652
The Zhang family of Dunhuang is known for
being disciplined and loyal,

113
00:07:08,652 --> 00:07:11,572
Indeed, those calves are not
from the northern people,

114
00:07:11,572 --> 00:07:14,052
If I lie, may I be struck by lightning,

115
00:07:14,652 --> 00:07:15,808
Then, tell me

116
00:07:16,612 --> 00:07:18,532
where did those calves come from?

117
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:23,264
You're not saying, are you?

118
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:25,696
Never mind,

119
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:28,532
I already knew,

120
00:07:29,292 --> 00:07:31,532
These twenty calves are not a small number,

121
00:07:32,212 --> 00:07:33,772
It can't be gotten out of nowhere,

122
00:07:34,972 --> 00:07:36,012
In the past few months,

123
00:07:36,692 --> 00:07:39,532
the number of calves lost
in each village of Gaochang

124
00:07:40,132 --> 00:07:41,852
just happens to be twenty,

125
00:07:41,852 --> 00:07:45,612
If these calves were not bought
from the northern herders,

126
00:07:46,172 --> 00:07:47,892
then they must be stolen goods,

127
00:07:48,412 --> 00:07:50,432
No, absolutely not,

128
00:07:50,432 --> 00:07:51,732
It's no use denying it,

129
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:55,972
I've already caught the cattle thief,

130
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:58,712
The thief confessed,

131
00:07:58,712 --> 00:07:59,840
Guys,

132
00:08:00,972 --> 00:08:02,332
would you be interested

133
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:06,092
in seeing how this cattle thief and Mr, Zhang

134
00:08:06,092 --> 00:08:08,332
confront each other in court?

135
00:08:10,772 --> 00:08:11,840
Bring the criminal,

136
00:08:15,252 --> 00:08:16,412
The cattle thief is here,

137
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,792
The cattle thief will be confronted in court,

138
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:18,944
Cattle thief!

139
00:08:27,732 --> 00:08:29,972
How did he get injured like this?

140
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,332
Senior Official Pei,

141
00:08:33,132 --> 00:08:34,972
he knows some martial arts moves,

142
00:08:35,612 --> 00:08:37,372
Therefore, during the arrest process,

143
00:08:37,372 --> 00:08:38,792
we broke his right leg

144
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:40,612
and captured him,

145
00:08:50,944 --> 00:08:52,064
Prefect Wang,

146
00:08:52,612 --> 00:08:54,452
do you know what you are doing?

147
00:08:55,372 --> 00:08:57,052
If I were to die in Xizhou,

148
00:08:57,052 --> 00:08:59,692
aren't you afraid that the entire Qu family
would be buried with me?

149
00:09:01,212 --> 00:09:02,772
As for my relationship with the Empress,

150
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,132
it seems you have investigated thoroughly,

151
00:09:05,932 --> 00:09:08,012
Why did His Majesty send Shouyue to Xizhou?

152
00:09:08,772 --> 00:09:10,292
Presumably, you have also guessed it,

153
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,772
What exactly do you want?

154
00:09:17,772 --> 00:09:19,312
Please clarify,

155
00:09:19,312 --> 00:09:22,292
If Shouyue and I are killed in Xizhou,

156
00:09:23,052 --> 00:09:25,812
what do you think His Majesty would think?

157
00:09:26,412 --> 00:09:27,732
What would the Empress think?

158
00:09:28,572 --> 00:09:29,892
I might as well tell you,

159
00:09:30,532 --> 00:09:33,292
His Majesty has long suspected
that your Qu family harbors disloyalty,

160
00:09:33,972 --> 00:09:35,152
Me and Shouyue

161
00:09:35,152 --> 00:09:37,892
were explicitly ordered to investigate
the Qu family in Xizhou,

162
00:09:39,492 --> 00:09:41,372
The Princess wants to kill us,

163
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,372
It's simply a matter of
venting personal resentment,

164
00:09:43,372 --> 00:09:44,892
But if she knows that

165
00:09:45,492 --> 00:09:47,012
Shouyue falling from favor

166
00:09:47,012 --> 00:09:49,412
is just a play he put on with His Majesty,

167
00:09:50,052 --> 00:09:53,412
do you think she dares to kill us?

168
00:09:56,092 --> 00:09:58,372
It's well-known that Shouyue opposes

169
00:09:58,372 --> 00:10:00,012
Lady Wu becoming queen,

170
00:10:00,932 --> 00:10:03,732
but how do you know it's true?

171
00:10:04,252 --> 00:10:06,612
If he really opposes it,

172
00:10:06,612 --> 00:10:09,432
why would they donate the family fortune
to the government

173
00:10:09,432 --> 00:10:12,692
through Madam Yang?

174
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,132
Shouyue used to think
your family ruled Xizhou efficiently,

175
00:10:17,132 --> 00:10:18,472
and you have contributed to the country,

176
00:10:18,472 --> 00:10:21,812
You have been loyal
without any second thoughts,

177
00:10:21,812 --> 00:10:23,252
He has been hesitating

178
00:10:23,252 --> 00:10:25,052
whether to report truthfully or not

179
00:10:25,052 --> 00:10:26,912
in order to vindicate your Qu family,

180
00:10:26,912 --> 00:10:28,952
But I didn't expect your Qu family

181
00:10:28,952 --> 00:10:31,172
wants to work with the Princess

182
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,932
and put us in a dangerous spot,

183
00:10:33,652 --> 00:10:35,212
It's heartbreaking,

184
00:10:37,572 --> 00:10:39,972
Alright, since this is the case,

185
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,532
I might as well go out now,

186
00:10:42,132 --> 00:10:44,012
Everyone in Xizhou is outside the house,

187
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:46,492
I will inform them now that

188
00:10:46,492 --> 00:10:47,732
the Protector-General Qu

189
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:50,312
wants to kill the Chancellor and his wife,

190
00:10:50,312 --> 00:10:52,232
I must let the whole Xizhou know that

191
00:10:52,232 --> 00:10:54,852
the Qu family is an enemy of the Tang Dynasty

192
00:10:54,852 --> 00:10:56,252
and of His Majesty,

193
00:10:58,272 --> 00:10:59,332
Madam, it's a misunderstanding,

194
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,172
This is all a misunderstanding,

195
00:11:04,812 --> 00:11:05,952
Misunderstanding?

196
00:11:06,772 --> 00:11:08,012
It's really a misunderstanding,

197
00:11:08,532 --> 00:11:09,568
We…

198
00:11:10,092 --> 00:11:11,612
We are forced to do this,

199
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:13,772
Is that so?

200
00:11:13,772 --> 00:11:15,272
Then let's hear what you have to say,

201
00:11:15,272 --> 00:11:17,212
How exactly are you forced to do so?

202
00:11:23,852 --> 00:11:24,972
Where are you from?

203
00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:26,972
Are you going to confess your guilt now?

204
00:11:27,492 --> 00:11:28,772
I am from Xizhou,

205
00:11:29,372 --> 00:11:30,532
I confess my guilt,

206
00:11:32,972 --> 00:11:34,932
For The twenty calves that you have stolen,

207
00:11:35,972 --> 00:11:37,572
where are them now?

208
00:11:38,372 --> 00:11:39,372
It's all at his house,

209
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:42,572
Those twenty calves are all from me,

210
00:11:42,572 --> 00:11:44,192
H-H-He's lying,

211
00:11:44,192 --> 00:11:45,372
You're talking nonsense,

212
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,612
I don't even know you,

213
00:11:46,612 --> 00:11:47,892
And I have never taken your calves,

214
00:11:47,892 --> 00:11:49,212
Why are you making up stories?

215
00:11:50,612 --> 00:11:51,612
Princess

216
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:55,012
uses the lives of Minister's wife and children
as a pledge,

217
00:11:55,972 --> 00:11:58,452
forcing us to work for her

218
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:01,692
We really had no choice,

219
00:12:03,332 --> 00:12:05,572
Since it concerns
the wife and children of Minister Qu,

220
00:12:05,572 --> 00:12:07,332
why do you have to hide this from him?

221
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:10,852
You don't know his character,

222
00:12:10,852 --> 00:12:12,292
If he knew about this,

223
00:12:12,292 --> 00:12:15,212
he would definitely rush back to Chang'an
without regard for his own safety,

224
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:18,092
Protector-General is really scared that

225
00:12:18,092 --> 00:12:20,692
he would cause trouble
that would implicate the Qu family,

226
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:22,532
even to the whole Xizhou,

227
00:12:26,172 --> 00:12:27,652
Zhang Er,

228
00:12:27,652 --> 00:12:30,492
the calves were not bought from
the northern herders,

229
00:12:30,492 --> 00:12:31,812
and you ain't got a receipt to prove its legit,

230
00:12:32,732 --> 00:12:34,812
If the origin is unclear like this,
then it's stolen goods,

231
00:12:35,412 --> 00:12:37,192
Now we've got witnesses and evidence
stacked against you,

232
00:12:37,192 --> 00:12:39,052
and you're still denying it?

233
00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:41,092
If you don't clear this up today,

234
00:12:41,092 --> 00:12:42,752
do you really think
you can just waltz above the law?

235
00:12:42,752 --> 00:12:43,932
As if!

236
00:12:44,772 --> 00:12:47,412
No! No! No! I'll tell you the truth,

237
00:12:48,212 --> 00:12:49,376
Those calves

238
00:12:50,532 --> 00:12:51,892
aren't stolen goods,

239
00:12:51,892 --> 00:12:54,232
They actually belong to Qiao Liu,

240
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,652
I got greedy and wanted them all for myself,

241
00:12:57,252 --> 00:12:59,692
And that whole cattle thief story? Total lies!

242
00:13:03,852 --> 00:13:04,896
Zhang Er,

243
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:06,772
are you sure about this?

244
00:13:07,424 --> 00:13:08,480
No second thoughts?

245
00:13:09,052 --> 00:13:10,052
I've thought it through,

246
00:13:10,052 --> 00:13:12,592
I have not spoken a word of falsehood,

247
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,972
I am willing to return
all the calves to Qiao Liu,

248
00:13:14,972 --> 00:13:18,372
I'm just asking for a bit of trust here,
and for you to let me off just this once,

249
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,192
I hope you can see I'm telling the truth,

250
00:13:21,212 --> 00:13:23,492
Although we have made attempts on your lives,

251
00:13:24,292 --> 00:13:25,892
we have always held back a little,

252
00:13:25,892 --> 00:13:27,092
If it were not so,

253
00:13:27,092 --> 00:13:29,292
you surely would not have lived until today,

254
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:31,332
As for the matter regarding Minister Qu's
wife and children,

255
00:13:31,332 --> 00:13:32,532
there is no need to worry,

256
00:13:33,252 --> 00:13:35,752
I will write to the Empress,
laying it all out for her,

257
00:13:35,752 --> 00:13:37,372
asking for her help

258
00:13:37,372 --> 00:13:38,932
to get them out,

259
00:13:39,492 --> 00:13:41,152
It's not just for your family's sake,

260
00:13:41,152 --> 00:13:43,092
but it keeps us safe too,

261
00:13:44,092 --> 00:13:45,592
Do you really mean that?

262
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:46,592
Why?

263
00:13:47,212 --> 00:13:48,412
And if the Empress gives the order

264
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:49,732
to the Princess to release them,

265
00:13:49,732 --> 00:13:51,132
even the Princess has to listen, right?

266
00:13:52,452 --> 00:13:53,532
This is great,

267
00:13:54,492 --> 00:13:57,532
Let me thank you on behalf of the Minister,

268
00:13:57,532 --> 00:13:59,892
You don't have to thank me now,

269
00:13:59,892 --> 00:14:02,532
You can thank me later after it is done,

270
00:14:06,092 --> 00:14:08,332
Madam, I will leave now,

271
00:14:08,332 --> 00:14:10,812
I should tell this good news
to the Protector-General,

272
00:14:14,572 --> 00:14:16,532
Madam, I have another request,

273
00:14:16,532 --> 00:14:19,532
Please do not temporarily inform Minister
about the Chang'an matter,

274
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,332
Rest assured, I won't,

275
00:14:33,852 --> 00:14:34,944
Qiao Liu,

276
00:14:35,812 --> 00:14:38,452
how are we supposed to handle this situation?

277
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,872
I can't see him,

278
00:14:43,872 --> 00:14:45,012
Did you see him?

279
00:14:45,012 --> 00:14:46,304
No,

280
00:14:51,852 --> 00:14:53,092
This, this, this

281
00:14:54,452 --> 00:14:55,932
<i>[Zhang Yuanshan's nephew, Qiao Liu]</i>
It is really Qiao Liu, It is really Qiao Liu,

282
00:14:55,932 --> 00:14:57,572
Why is he here?

283
00:14:57,572 --> 00:14:58,592
Why is he here?

284
00:14:58,592 --> 00:14:59,812
Thank you, Senior Official Pei,

285
00:15:00,732 --> 00:15:02,012
I have to report my uncle

286
00:15:02,012 --> 00:15:03,352
because I had no choice,

287
00:15:03,352 --> 00:15:05,992
If he's willing to return my ten calves

288
00:15:05,992 --> 00:15:08,332
so I can cover the debts and medical costs,

289
00:15:09,452 --> 00:15:10,592
I'd like to ask Senior Official Pei

290
00:15:10,592 --> 00:15:12,332
not to go after my uncle for it,

291
00:15:15,552 --> 00:15:16,576
Zhang Er,

292
00:15:17,652 --> 00:15:19,772
considering that Qiao Liu has pleaded
on your behalf,

293
00:15:19,772 --> 00:15:21,332
I will not pursue the matter further,

294
00:15:22,012 --> 00:15:23,452
However, as for these twenty calves,

295
00:15:24,092 --> 00:15:25,572
you must return all of them to Qiao Liu,

296
00:15:27,332 --> 00:15:28,692
Furthermore,

297
00:15:28,692 --> 00:15:30,012
you are a titled official of the government,

298
00:15:30,852 --> 00:15:32,232
Doing such things

299
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:33,772
would dishearten the people,

300
00:15:34,532 --> 00:15:36,772
This year, Shangxian village's
water conservancy construction

301
00:15:36,772 --> 00:15:38,292
will be shouldered by you alone,

302
00:15:39,452 --> 00:15:42,452
In the future, you should benefit the community
and do more good deeds

303
00:15:43,212 --> 00:15:44,612
to make amends for today's mistakes,

304
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:48,972
Yes, Senior Official Pei,
Thanks for your forgiveness,

305
00:15:52,612 --> 00:15:53,632
As for a few of you,

306
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,652
who are unable to distinguish
between true and false,

307
00:15:58,132 --> 00:15:59,692
since you came to here today,

308
00:16:00,972 --> 00:16:02,412
then let's not make this trip in vain,

309
00:16:03,492 --> 00:16:04,512
After you guys go back,

310
00:16:04,512 --> 00:16:05,892
each person contributes six strings of money

311
00:16:06,612 --> 00:16:09,092
to pay for Qiao Liu's medical expenses
and the debts on his behalf,

312
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:11,092
Yes, sir,

313
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,092
As for the positions of the head of security
and the village junior officer,

314
00:16:15,132 --> 00:16:16,532
starting tomorrow,

315
00:16:16,532 --> 00:16:17,612
we're gonna pick some really competent people
for those roles,

316
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,292
Senior Official Pei solves cases
fair and square,

317
00:16:20,292 --> 00:16:21,932
We admire you profoundly,

318
00:16:22,532 --> 00:16:24,892
Yes, Yes, Yes,

319
00:16:24,892 --> 00:16:27,052
Yes, Yes, Yes,

320
00:16:37,376 --> 00:16:38,412
Yes, Yes,

321
00:16:38,412 --> 00:16:40,092
Yes, Yes,

322
00:16:41,932 --> 00:16:43,040
Today,

323
00:16:43,852 --> 00:16:45,132
the case of the disputed calves
has been solved,

324
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:47,332
The case of the stolen calves

325
00:16:47,932 --> 00:16:49,132
should also be put to an end,

326
00:16:50,132 --> 00:16:51,792
Now the crown prince has been established,

327
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:53,052
and the Emperor pardons the world,

328
00:16:54,212 --> 00:16:56,452
Originally,
it was a time for universal celebration,

329
00:16:58,012 --> 00:16:59,172
but I have found out that

330
00:17:00,212 --> 00:17:01,372
the thief

331
00:17:02,412 --> 00:17:03,452
is right in this yard,

332
00:17:03,452 --> 00:17:04,932
What? Right here?

333
00:17:04,932 --> 00:17:06,016
Who is it?

334
00:17:06,772 --> 00:17:08,012
Right, who is it actually?

335
00:17:11,812 --> 00:17:13,172
Who?

336
00:17:13,172 --> 00:17:14,272
The Emperor's grace is immense,

337
00:17:15,172 --> 00:17:17,692
I am willing to give this person
a chance to reform,

338
00:17:18,812 --> 00:17:20,292
I'm going to count to three,

339
00:17:21,012 --> 00:17:22,332
and if this person steps forward,

340
00:17:24,332 --> 00:17:25,692
this person will be forgiven

341
00:17:26,772 --> 00:17:28,132
and exempted from penal servitude,

342
00:17:34,612 --> 00:17:35,712
One,

343
00:17:45,492 --> 00:17:46,492
Two,

344
00:17:57,852 --> 00:17:58,892
It's him,

345
00:17:59,852 --> 00:18:00,896
Isn't that…

346
00:18:03,772 --> 00:18:05,452
Who is it? Who stole my calves?

347
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:06,464
It's Han Si,

348
00:18:07,012 --> 00:18:09,572
I am the one who stole the calves,

349
00:18:10,812 --> 00:18:13,212
Han Si, you madman,

350
00:18:13,852 --> 00:18:16,032
I wondered who had stolen my calves,

351
00:18:16,032 --> 00:18:18,492
It turns out it's this detestable wretch
bearing a grudge,

352
00:18:20,772 --> 00:18:24,172
Who are you? What is your name?
What crime have you committed?

353
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:26,932
Where are the stolen

354
00:18:28,132 --> 00:18:29,452
twenty calves now?

355
00:18:29,972 --> 00:18:31,232
I am Han Jingzhi,

356
00:18:31,232 --> 00:18:32,532
A veterinarian from Xizhou,

357
00:18:33,492 --> 00:18:34,812
In November last year,

358
00:18:35,492 --> 00:18:37,012
I stole twenty calves

359
00:18:37,812 --> 00:18:39,212
in various villages of Gaochang,

360
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,092
All are already dead,

361
00:18:42,092 --> 00:18:43,200
What?

362
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,512
Yes,

363
00:18:44,512 --> 00:18:45,760
That's right,

364
00:18:46,368 --> 00:18:47,424
Han Jingzhi,

365
00:18:48,012 --> 00:18:49,172
You, as a veterinarian,

366
00:18:49,812 --> 00:18:51,252
instead of helping others treat animals,

367
00:18:51,772 --> 00:18:53,012
yet steal other people's calves,

368
00:18:54,532 --> 00:18:55,812
That doesn't make any sense!

369
00:18:57,492 --> 00:18:58,656
Senior Official Pei,

370
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:02,812
even a vet's gotta make a living,

371
00:19:04,332 --> 00:19:05,472
When these folks needed me to
treat their animals,

372
00:19:05,472 --> 00:19:08,052
it was all urgent and desperate,

373
00:19:08,052 --> 00:19:09,452
I used the best medicine I could
when I treated their animals,

374
00:19:10,172 --> 00:19:12,092
But once their cows and horses got better,

375
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:14,912
they either complained I was too slow,

376
00:19:14,912 --> 00:19:17,072
or that it was just a coincidence,

377
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,612
They drag on without paying
my consultation fee,

378
00:19:18,612 --> 00:19:20,172
Some even don't pay for the medicines,

379
00:19:21,132 --> 00:19:22,372
These dozen or so households

380
00:19:22,932 --> 00:19:25,572
have owed me medical and prescription fees
for several years now,

381
00:19:25,572 --> 00:19:27,512
I truly cannot tolerate this anymore,

382
00:19:27,512 --> 00:19:28,872
You are slandering us,

383
00:19:28,872 --> 00:19:30,016
Senior Official Pei!

384
00:19:34,052 --> 00:19:35,252
Senior Official Pei! Senior Official Pei!

385
00:19:36,612 --> 00:19:38,092
I am willing to guarantee with my life that

386
00:19:38,732 --> 00:19:40,252
every word Han Si says is true,

387
00:19:40,252 --> 00:19:42,172
H-H-He would not lie,

388
00:19:45,292 --> 00:19:46,572
I can also testify,

389
00:19:48,492 --> 00:19:49,568
Han Jingzhi,

390
00:19:51,612 --> 00:19:52,792
For the matter of your cattle theft,

391
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,332
although there was a reason for the incident,

392
00:19:54,332 --> 00:19:55,772
and it coincides with the general amnesty,

393
00:19:56,732 --> 00:19:57,824
I can only agree to

394
00:19:58,652 --> 00:19:59,812
exempt you from punishment,

395
00:20:00,692 --> 00:20:02,532
But the price difference
between the calves and the medical fees

396
00:20:03,692 --> 00:20:06,452
need to be returned to these households,

397
00:20:06,452 --> 00:20:08,292
Senior Official Pei, Han Si…

398
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:09,408
Senior Official Pei,

399
00:20:09,952 --> 00:20:11,040
When I return home,

400
00:20:12,092 --> 00:20:14,452
I'll sell the ancestral house
to repay the money,

401
00:20:16,012 --> 00:20:17,216
That is too easy on him,

402
00:20:23,372 --> 00:20:24,480
Write down the ins and outs

403
00:20:25,332 --> 00:20:27,772
of this matter clearly,

404
00:20:31,412 --> 00:20:34,032
and make a list of the victims who lost their
calves due to the account reliance,

405
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,132
Copy one,

406
00:20:35,852 --> 00:20:37,172
Post it on the government's door,

407
00:20:37,812 --> 00:20:38,892
So everyone in Xizhou

408
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,092
will know,

409
00:20:41,092 --> 00:20:42,102
No! No!

410
00:20:42,102 --> 00:20:44,172
I don't want this money anymore,
I don't want this money anymore,

411
00:20:44,172 --> 00:20:46,652
Yes, Yes, Nice,

412
00:20:46,652 --> 00:20:47,972
Brilliant, Senior Official Pei,

413
00:20:47,972 --> 00:20:49,024
Senior Official Pei,

414
00:21:21,852 --> 00:21:23,612
Senior Official Pei, I'm really sorry,

415
00:21:24,172 --> 00:21:25,592
I originally planned to come alone,

416
00:21:25,592 --> 00:21:26,812
but they found out

417
00:21:26,812 --> 00:21:28,292
and insisted on coming with me,

418
00:21:30,412 --> 00:21:32,732
Thank you, Senior Official Pei,
for letting me keep my ancestral house,

419
00:21:33,652 --> 00:21:36,052
I don't know how to repay you,

420
00:21:38,652 --> 00:21:40,172
It's just a trifle, not worth mentioning,

421
00:21:41,532 --> 00:21:43,512
The gentry who owed you medical fees

422
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:45,592
would rather lose some money than
be publicly shamed,

423
00:21:45,592 --> 00:21:47,012
They would rather not be posted
on the notice board,

424
00:21:48,372 --> 00:21:49,412
They have pleaded a thousand times over,

425
00:21:50,052 --> 00:21:51,452
Only then did I reluctantly agree

426
00:21:51,452 --> 00:21:53,092
their unconditional demand
not to pursue the matter,

427
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:56,332
So, that's why the official notice
at the entrance was removed

428
00:22:00,532 --> 00:22:03,252
Han Si is my best friend,

429
00:22:04,732 --> 00:22:07,012
This time, Senior Official Pei not only
helped him but also saved him,

430
00:22:07,612 --> 00:22:08,768
Such high righteousness,

431
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,572
Please accept our bow,

432
00:22:17,092 --> 00:22:19,012
We came here not only to thank you
on behalf of Han Si,

433
00:22:20,652 --> 00:22:22,132
but also to apologize to you,

434
00:22:23,332 --> 00:22:24,448
To be honestly,

435
00:22:26,332 --> 00:22:28,652
the six of us were originally ordered here
to monitor you,

436
00:22:28,652 --> 00:22:29,972
I presume you could also see it,

437
00:22:30,652 --> 00:22:31,892
There have been many instances of disrespect
in the past,

438
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:33,612
I hope you could forgive us,

439
00:22:39,452 --> 00:22:41,772
We might come off as brutes,

440
00:22:41,772 --> 00:22:43,532
but we're not idiots,

441
00:22:44,052 --> 00:22:45,452
We know a good person when we see one,

442
00:22:45,452 --> 00:22:47,252
and we won't forget your kindness,

443
00:22:47,852 --> 00:22:49,252
I once owed Han Si a life,

444
00:22:49,252 --> 00:22:50,452
and I've had no way to repay it,

445
00:22:58,612 --> 00:22:59,652
We can't really put a price on this,

446
00:23:00,652 --> 00:23:01,728
but from today on,

447
00:23:02,252 --> 00:23:04,652
I'm putting my life at your service,

448
00:23:04,652 --> 00:23:06,692
I swear to God that

449
00:23:07,812 --> 00:23:08,972
from now on,

450
00:23:09,892 --> 00:23:11,652
if you say it's our time to go,
then we will be ready,

451
00:23:11,652 --> 00:23:13,512
And we'll only if you say so,

452
00:23:13,512 --> 00:23:15,452
If anybody breaks this promise,

453
00:23:15,452 --> 00:23:16,612
they deserve the worst,

454
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:26,092
Please get up quickly,

455
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,012
You all have to live well in the future,

456
00:23:30,612 --> 00:23:31,692
Do not do foolish things again,

457
00:23:32,372 --> 00:23:34,172
If anything happens because of foolish actions,

458
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:37,012
it would be a violation of your own oath,

459
00:23:37,696 --> 00:23:38,848
Senior Official Pei,

460
00:23:39,812 --> 00:23:41,352
I am ready to start my medical practice,

461
00:23:41,352 --> 00:23:42,672
For the money I owe to those people,

462
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:43,812
I will pay it back,

463
00:23:43,812 --> 00:23:45,120
You want to be a doctor?

464
00:23:46,932 --> 00:23:49,432
My family has been practicing medicine
for generations,

465
00:23:49,432 --> 00:23:51,632
But because my father passed away early,

466
00:23:51,632 --> 00:23:53,052
he left behind a heap of ancestral remedies,

467
00:23:53,052 --> 00:23:54,172
I had to figure it out by myself,

468
00:23:54,852 --> 00:23:55,912
Over the years,

469
00:23:55,912 --> 00:23:59,032
Though I make a living by treating animals,

470
00:23:59,032 --> 00:24:00,472
during this period,

471
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:03,492
I also treated hundreds of herders
who could not afford medical care,

472
00:24:04,452 --> 00:24:05,492
Recently,

473
00:24:05,492 --> 00:24:07,512
I revisited the ancestral remedies at home

474
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:08,932
and have gained substantial insight,

475
00:24:08,932 --> 00:24:11,212
I will not bring shame upon my ancestors,

476
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,240
Good luck,

477
00:24:14,852 --> 00:24:17,512
If you ever need me,

478
00:24:17,512 --> 00:24:18,652
please tell me,

479
00:24:19,452 --> 00:24:20,852
I would go through fire

480
00:24:21,612 --> 00:24:22,656
for you,

481
00:24:24,972 --> 00:24:25,972
Mr, Han, no need to stand on ceremony,

482
00:24:29,212 --> 00:24:31,252
Actually, there's one thing I don't understood,

483
00:24:31,892 --> 00:24:33,772
I don't know if you can tell me,

484
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,064
What is it?

485
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,532
Why did you steal those calves?

486
00:24:41,632 --> 00:24:42,812
To be honest with you,

487
00:24:43,452 --> 00:24:44,692
I steal them for

488
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:46,292
testing medicines,

489
00:24:46,932 --> 00:24:48,572
My family has passed down
some ancient remedies,

490
00:24:49,412 --> 00:24:51,692
But they really look strange,

491
00:24:51,692 --> 00:24:53,772
I dare not use them on humans,

492
00:24:56,572 --> 00:24:58,952
So I can only steal some calves and sheep,

493
00:24:58,952 --> 00:25:00,852
Test them on the animals,

494
00:25:00,852 --> 00:25:02,572
If it's okay,

495
00:25:02,572 --> 00:25:03,812
then they can be used on humans,

496
00:25:09,052 --> 00:25:10,412
Look,

497
00:25:10,412 --> 00:25:12,012
Did I drool?

498
00:25:13,092 --> 00:25:14,368
Hallucination!

499
00:25:18,092 --> 00:25:20,572
Then why specifically calves, not a lambs?

500
00:25:22,252 --> 00:25:23,264
Because

501
00:25:26,812 --> 00:25:28,064
beef is more delicious,

502
00:25:35,092 --> 00:25:36,292
You are so stupid,

503
00:25:37,132 --> 00:25:39,252
Kudi Liuli talked through her hat,

504
00:25:39,252 --> 00:25:41,932
You actually believed it,

505
00:25:49,772 --> 00:25:50,892
Do you know

506
00:25:50,892 --> 00:25:52,852
who is the Princess?

507
00:25:54,932 --> 00:25:57,532
If Pei Xingjian's demotion is a sham,

508
00:25:58,452 --> 00:26:00,232
would she be so brazen

509
00:26:00,232 --> 00:26:01,772
Send someone to kill him
across a thousand miles?

510
00:26:02,972 --> 00:26:04,032
And what else?

511
00:26:04,572 --> 00:26:05,972
Following His Majesty's secret decree?

512
00:26:05,972 --> 00:26:07,612
That's even more nonsensical,

513
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:11,172
The Tang army is about to campaign
in the north,

514
00:26:11,172 --> 00:26:15,172
Now is the time for our Qu family
to contribute,

515
00:26:16,212 --> 00:26:17,532
At this moment, mobilize the Qu family

516
00:26:18,172 --> 00:26:19,852
is like shooting ourselves in the foot,

517
00:26:22,212 --> 00:26:23,328
Furthermore,

518
00:26:24,092 --> 00:26:25,472
more than half of the Qu family members

519
00:26:25,472 --> 00:26:27,372
are held as hostages in Chang'an,

520
00:26:27,932 --> 00:26:30,972
The Princess has that hanging over us,

521
00:26:30,972 --> 00:26:32,972
How could the Emperor possibly

522
00:26:32,972 --> 00:26:34,312
suspect our Qu family?

523
00:26:34,312 --> 00:26:36,012
You are right,

524
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:37,492
I was momentarily confused

525
00:26:37,492 --> 00:26:39,212
and was deceived by Kudi Liuli,

526
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:41,032
Deceived?

527
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:42,292
You are just a fool,

528
00:26:42,292 --> 00:26:43,752
You are extremely stupid,

529
00:26:43,752 --> 00:26:45,852
Such a lie full of flaws,

530
00:26:45,852 --> 00:26:47,732
If you had a bit of a brain,

531
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:48,932
how could you be deceived?

532
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:55,812
I know my mistake, Please don't be angry,

533
00:26:55,812 --> 00:26:56,932
Don't touch me,

534
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,372
Now we know

535
00:27:17,372 --> 00:27:20,092
the thing Qu Zhizhan least wants us to know,

536
00:27:22,172 --> 00:27:24,272
Whether it's for Qu Chongyu or the Qu family,

537
00:27:24,272 --> 00:27:25,732
I'm afraid he can't keep us,

538
00:27:26,892 --> 00:27:29,132
Then we might as well talk to him openly,

539
00:27:29,652 --> 00:27:31,312
If we can convince him to believe

540
00:27:31,312 --> 00:27:33,612
we have a way to save Qu Chongyu's
wife and children,

541
00:27:33,612 --> 00:27:36,432
and requested His Majesty
to decree the return of that kid,

542
00:27:36,432 --> 00:27:38,692
What other reason does he have to
keep harming us?

543
00:27:41,772 --> 00:27:43,212
One who was demoted to Xizhou

544
00:27:43,732 --> 00:27:45,092
because he offended the Empress,

545
00:27:46,092 --> 00:27:48,012
requests His Majesty to restore that kid,

546
00:27:49,052 --> 00:27:51,212
If you were Qu Zhizhan, would you believe it?

547
00:27:53,252 --> 00:27:54,292
So in his view,

548
00:27:55,252 --> 00:27:56,292
only by killing us

549
00:27:57,212 --> 00:27:58,732
is the most reliable solution,

550
00:28:00,172 --> 00:28:01,172
So what should we do?

551
00:28:01,732 --> 00:28:03,052
We can't just sit around and wait for death,

552
00:28:03,852 --> 00:28:05,212
They won't take action immediately,

553
00:28:06,292 --> 00:28:07,372
I am the Chancellor of Xizhou,

554
00:28:08,252 --> 00:28:09,632
If there's no foolproof strategy,

555
00:28:09,632 --> 00:28:10,852
rashly killing us would

556
00:28:11,532 --> 00:28:13,532
surely lead to the Emperor
holding the Qu family accountable,

557
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,532
Qu Zhizhan is not impulsive enough

558
00:28:15,532 --> 00:28:17,292
to do such a foolish thing,

559
00:28:17,972 --> 00:28:19,632
But they will make a move sooner or later,

560
00:28:19,632 --> 00:28:21,552
If we can't come up with a countermeasure,

561
00:28:21,552 --> 00:28:23,852
we will still be at the mercy of others
by then,

562
00:28:23,852 --> 00:28:25,052
Of course,
we have to think of a countermeasure,

563
00:28:26,332 --> 00:28:27,732
But we must wait for them to act first,

564
00:28:28,932 --> 00:28:30,032
As soon as they make a move,

565
00:28:30,032 --> 00:28:31,092
there will be flaws,

566
00:28:31,852 --> 00:28:32,992
By then,

567
00:28:35,012 --> 00:28:36,252
we will have a solution,

568
00:28:42,212 --> 00:28:44,012
Now, the Pei Xingjian couple,

569
00:28:44,012 --> 00:28:46,652
know about the matter
of Chongyu's wife and children,

570
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:49,652
and they know we harbor malicious intentions

571
00:28:50,172 --> 00:28:51,292
to kill them,

572
00:28:52,652 --> 00:28:53,728
It seems that

573
00:28:55,212 --> 00:28:57,212
we have to take action,

574
00:28:58,212 --> 00:28:59,572
If we keep them,

575
00:29:01,452 --> 00:29:02,892
I'm afraid it will only make us anxious,

576
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,052
Can I

577
00:29:05,732 --> 00:29:07,572
make a remark?

578
00:29:08,452 --> 00:29:10,752
Those two have

579
00:29:10,752 --> 00:29:12,292
recently arrived here,

580
00:29:13,092 --> 00:29:15,212
If they died an untimely death at this time,

581
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:18,652
once the Emperor founds out that our Qu family…

582
00:29:20,652 --> 00:29:23,252
What's more important? Chongyu or this?

583
00:29:23,252 --> 00:29:24,732
- Chongyu is more important, Chongyu,
- Who is more important?

584
00:29:24,732 --> 00:29:26,212
Chongyu is more important,

585
00:29:26,212 --> 00:29:27,412
Chongyu is more important,

586
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,760
<i>[Chang'an]</i>

587
00:29:45,532 --> 00:29:47,132
Madam, take a look quickly,

588
00:29:47,132 --> 00:29:48,532
That lotus flower is really blooming brightly,

589
00:29:48,532 --> 00:29:49,612
Over there,

590
00:29:49,612 --> 00:29:51,892
This lotus flower is Madam's favorite,

591
00:29:51,892 --> 00:29:52,928
Slow down,

592
00:29:52,928 --> 00:29:55,072
Perhaps a distinguished guest is coming today,

593
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,732
They are all competitively
showing off their beauty,

594
00:29:57,692 --> 00:29:58,932
Madam, be careful,

595
00:29:59,872 --> 00:30:01,024
Come over,

596
00:30:03,132 --> 00:30:04,332
Look at this fish,

597
00:30:06,092 --> 00:30:07,892
- Look at that
- This is a gift from His Majesty,

598
00:30:07,892 --> 00:30:09,092
Is it beautiful, young master?

599
00:30:09,092 --> 00:30:11,732
The Princess is His Majesty's aunt,

600
00:30:11,732 --> 00:30:13,612
Of course, His Majesty is so nice to

601
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:14,852
Residence of the Hedong Duke,

602
00:30:15,652 --> 00:30:16,892
- Be careful, Madam,
- Young master,

603
00:30:18,212 --> 00:30:19,332
Young master,

604
00:30:19,332 --> 00:30:21,292
Grandma, you walk too slowly,

605
00:30:21,292 --> 00:30:22,932
I can run so fast,

606
00:30:22,932 --> 00:30:24,372
Young master, slow down,

607
00:30:24,372 --> 00:30:25,504
Slow down,

608
00:30:26,252 --> 00:30:27,772
This child, Song'er,

609
00:30:28,492 --> 00:30:31,412
the more I see him,
the more I can't help but love him,

610
00:30:32,412 --> 00:30:35,212
Song'er is naturally active and naughty,

611
00:30:35,212 --> 00:30:37,692
Only the Princess spoils him,

612
00:30:39,412 --> 00:30:41,012
The young master is lively and adorable,

613
00:30:41,012 --> 00:30:42,112
Smart and clever,

614
00:30:42,112 --> 00:30:44,012
Even if he is a little naughty,

615
00:30:44,012 --> 00:30:45,492
he is still very likable,

616
00:30:46,852 --> 00:30:48,652
You have been in Chang'an for so many years,

617
00:30:49,532 --> 00:30:51,492
and the young master is so beloved by Madam,

618
00:30:52,692 --> 00:30:53,772
If you ask me,

619
00:30:54,292 --> 00:30:56,232
why don't you move over here

620
00:30:56,232 --> 00:30:57,892
to save you the trouble of leaving?

621
00:30:57,892 --> 00:30:59,312
In just a few days

622
00:30:59,312 --> 00:31:00,692
Madam would urge me to go

623
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,292
to call you all back here again,

624
00:31:02,292 --> 00:31:03,552
How can we do this?

625
00:31:03,552 --> 00:31:05,132
we've only been here a few days

626
00:31:05,132 --> 00:31:07,112
and the Princess has already gone all out
for us,

627
00:31:07,112 --> 00:31:09,392
How could we have the nerve to
stay here any longer?

628
00:31:09,392 --> 00:31:10,432
Fuxian,

629
00:31:10,944 --> 00:31:13,052
if you're worried about others gossip,

630
00:31:13,052 --> 00:31:15,132
why not let me adopt you as a goddaughter?

631
00:31:15,652 --> 00:31:16,732
Then,

632
00:31:16,732 --> 00:31:17,852
You and your son

633
00:31:17,852 --> 00:31:20,692
can reside in my place with a clear conscience,

634
00:31:20,692 --> 00:31:21,972
How can I deserve that?

635
00:31:21,972 --> 00:31:23,332
You are unwilling,

636
00:31:24,332 --> 00:31:25,852
Being loved by the Princess

637
00:31:25,852 --> 00:31:27,252
Is my utmost luck,

638
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:28,892
How could there be any reason to not want it?

639
00:31:30,412 --> 00:31:32,052
Then, it's settled,

640
00:31:32,692 --> 00:31:35,972
To have such a clever and well-behaved grandson
like Song'er is really a blessing

641
00:31:36,932 --> 00:31:39,692
My heart is filled with joy,

642
00:31:42,932 --> 00:31:45,192
In a few days, it will be Madam's birthday,

643
00:31:45,192 --> 00:31:48,852
Why not combine the two events together?

644
00:31:48,852 --> 00:31:51,332
It would be a double celebration,

645
00:31:51,972 --> 00:31:53,332
This is a good idea,

646
00:31:54,292 --> 00:31:55,412
What do you think about this, Fuxian?

647
00:31:57,292 --> 00:32:00,252
I will follow the arrangements made
by the Princess,

648
00:32:09,732 --> 00:32:11,572
It is truly the work of a great master,

649
00:32:12,092 --> 00:32:14,092
This carving is just like a living thing,

650
00:32:16,092 --> 00:32:17,412
I really love this,

651
00:32:18,212 --> 00:32:19,452
As long as Lady Jing likes it,

652
00:32:20,812 --> 00:32:22,132
It's really beautiful,

653
00:32:22,132 --> 00:32:24,132
Liuli, when will you have some free time?

654
00:32:24,132 --> 00:32:25,672
Could you help to draw a few more pictures
for me?

655
00:32:25,672 --> 00:32:26,972
You can name the price,

656
00:32:26,972 --> 00:32:28,172
As long as you ask,

657
00:32:28,732 --> 00:32:29,812
I will definitely not bargain,

658
00:32:31,132 --> 00:32:33,172
Aren't you afraid I'll ask for the moon

659
00:32:33,172 --> 00:32:34,492
to swindle a hefty sum from you,

660
00:32:35,012 --> 00:32:36,172
I'm not afraid at all,

661
00:32:37,012 --> 00:32:39,592
That's true, You have a wealthy brother,

662
00:32:39,592 --> 00:32:41,952
He could buy this broken carving of mine
for a hundred gold,

663
00:32:41,952 --> 00:32:43,772
I suppose he wouldn't care about
this amount of money,

664
00:32:48,172 --> 00:32:49,492
Speaking of your brother,

665
00:32:49,492 --> 00:32:51,572
you have no idea how much he despises me now,

666
00:32:52,172 --> 00:32:54,332
It's almost
as if staying in the same room with me

667
00:32:54,332 --> 00:32:55,852
could sully his eyes

668
00:32:57,212 --> 00:32:58,312
Don't blame him for it,

669
00:32:58,312 --> 00:33:00,192
He looks at any woman in that way,

670
00:33:00,192 --> 00:33:01,692
Is that so?

671
00:33:01,692 --> 00:33:04,452
So he looks at your sister-in-law who remained
in Chang'an as a hostage in the same way?

672
00:33:05,092 --> 00:33:06,472
Of course, that's different,

673
00:33:06,472 --> 00:33:08,892
My brother is very good to my sister-in-law,

674
00:33:09,812 --> 00:33:12,932
Leaving a woman with kids in Chang'an
as hostages is what you call good?

675
00:33:12,932 --> 00:33:15,252
Isn't he afraid they'll be bullied in Chang'an?

676
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:17,452
Bullied?

677
00:33:18,172 --> 00:33:19,292
Who would dare?

678
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:23,452
They're like a sacred thing to him,

679
00:33:23,452 --> 00:33:25,652
Who would have the audacity to target them?

680
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,352
Not to mention anything else,

681
00:33:27,352 --> 00:33:28,852
if my sister-in-law and that kid

682
00:33:28,852 --> 00:33:31,352
get bullied in Chang'an,

683
00:33:31,352 --> 00:33:33,552
he would definitely return immediately

684
00:33:33,552 --> 00:33:34,732
to Chang'an,

685
00:33:36,252 --> 00:33:37,572
If that is a royal noble,

686
00:33:37,572 --> 00:33:39,392
who bullied by them in Chang'an,

687
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:42,212
I don't believe your brother would dare to
strike back in Chang'an,

688
00:33:43,292 --> 00:33:44,972
Not to mention a royal noble,

689
00:33:44,972 --> 00:33:46,144
even the…

690
00:33:49,532 --> 00:33:50,732
Let me just put it to you like this,

691
00:33:51,292 --> 00:33:54,572
My brother truly fears nothing,

692
00:33:54,572 --> 00:33:56,052
If he is pushed to the limits,

693
00:33:56,052 --> 00:33:57,692
he is capable of anything,

694
00:34:00,052 --> 00:34:01,532
Liuli,

695
00:34:01,532 --> 00:34:02,572
I advise you that

696
00:34:02,572 --> 00:34:04,732
it would be wise to provoke him less
in the future,

697
00:34:04,732 --> 00:34:06,572
He even dares to kill his way back to Chang'an,

698
00:34:06,572 --> 00:34:07,692
Who dares to mess with him?

699
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,432
A notice,

700
00:34:23,432 --> 00:34:25,092
There is a notice,

701
00:34:27,552 --> 00:34:28,612
What's going on?

702
00:34:29,292 --> 00:34:30,572
Cooperate with the tax collector,

703
00:34:30,572 --> 00:34:31,852
Pay off all arrears,

704
00:34:32,452 --> 00:34:33,572
Non-cooperators

705
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:34,792
will be punished by the law,

706
00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:35,932
Further consequences will be faced?

707
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:37,992
Pay all accumulated debt of previous years…

708
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,592
Are they trying to kill us?

709
00:34:39,592 --> 00:34:40,772
Indeed,

710
00:34:40,772 --> 00:34:42,312
If we have surplus grain and silk,

711
00:34:42,312 --> 00:34:44,252
we wouldn't have been in arrears
for so many years,

712
00:34:44,252 --> 00:34:45,332
Right,

713
00:34:45,332 --> 00:34:46,772
But I've heard that this Senior Official Pei

714
00:34:46,772 --> 00:34:48,852
solves cases fair and square
and has a good character,

715
00:34:49,772 --> 00:34:51,692
He should be understanding of our difficulties,

716
00:34:52,252 --> 00:34:53,812
He might even show mercy towards
our subordinates,

717
00:34:54,372 --> 00:34:55,892
Stop daydreaming,

718
00:34:55,892 --> 00:34:57,372
As an official from the government,

719
00:34:57,372 --> 00:34:59,572
how would they care about the lives of us?

720
00:34:59,572 --> 00:35:01,092
I can't afford it anyway,

721
00:35:03,892 --> 00:35:05,452
Master, do you know about this matter?

722
00:35:09,892 --> 00:35:11,412
Protector-General Qu is so detestable!

723
00:35:12,132 --> 00:35:13,652
He didn't even give a single notification

724
00:35:13,652 --> 00:35:14,912
and posted this

725
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:16,292
b y using your name,

726
00:35:20,052 --> 00:35:21,120
Father,

727
00:35:22,692 --> 00:35:23,712
Recently,

728
00:35:24,252 --> 00:35:25,452
inside the territory of Xizhou,

729
00:35:26,252 --> 00:35:28,372
rumors are rife
and the public resentment is boiling,

730
00:35:28,372 --> 00:35:30,092
Do you know about it?

731
00:35:31,652 --> 00:35:32,768
Is that so?

732
00:35:35,932 --> 00:35:37,732
What kind of rumors are those?

733
00:35:39,532 --> 00:35:42,292
Most of them concern taxation issues,

734
00:35:45,292 --> 00:35:48,892
Father, did you assign Pei Xingjian
to collect taxes?

735
00:35:48,892 --> 00:35:49,920
Why?

736
00:35:50,452 --> 00:35:52,212
He is the Chancellor of Xizhou,

737
00:35:52,972 --> 00:35:55,372
Isn't that what he should be doing?

738
00:35:55,372 --> 00:35:58,092
Pei Xingjian indeed has some methods,

739
00:35:58,692 --> 00:35:59,776
However,

740
00:36:00,812 --> 00:36:02,012
Xizhou's arrears in tax

741
00:36:02,012 --> 00:36:04,712
are not a plight that happened overnight,

742
00:36:04,712 --> 00:36:07,972
Tens of thousands of households haven't been
delinquent in rent for three to five years,

743
00:36:07,972 --> 00:36:10,892
If you force them to collect taxes now, then…

744
00:36:10,892 --> 00:36:13,772
If the situation now were not
so difficult to reverse,

745
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:15,572
do you think I would resort to
such an inferior strategy?

746
00:36:18,332 --> 00:36:19,772
We are both well aware

747
00:36:20,652 --> 00:36:22,972
that the army will surely arrive this autumn,

748
00:36:24,052 --> 00:36:25,692
What's left in the Xizhou warehouse?

749
00:36:26,252 --> 00:36:29,312
Where are we gonna dig up all the supplies
for the troops?

750
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,212
If I don't start pressing for taxes,

751
00:36:31,212 --> 00:36:32,612
by the time the army arrives,

752
00:36:33,252 --> 00:36:34,752
we won't be able to hand over
the military supplies,

753
00:36:34,752 --> 00:36:37,052
Who will bear this blame?

754
00:36:38,332 --> 00:36:39,872
Anyway, we're already at this point,

755
00:36:39,872 --> 00:36:43,172
Just let Pei Xingzhi handle

756
00:36:43,972 --> 00:36:45,572
things like offending the people of Xizhou,

757
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:49,512
You are right,

758
00:36:49,512 --> 00:36:51,152
I'm just worried,

759
00:36:51,152 --> 00:36:53,132
What if not only has he not gotten taxes,

760
00:36:53,132 --> 00:36:54,832
but he's caused a rebellion instead,

761
00:36:54,832 --> 00:36:57,452
If this causes major chaos in Xizhou,
we won't be able to cover the losses,

762
00:36:57,452 --> 00:36:59,692
That's also because the officials of
the government forced them,

763
00:36:59,692 --> 00:37:03,172
The people of Xizhou were driven into a corner
and had no choice but to revolt,

764
00:37:14,812 --> 00:37:15,904
Madam,

765
00:37:16,412 --> 00:37:18,812
Lady Liu, long time no see, Please have a seat,

766
00:37:23,772 --> 00:37:25,172
It's really been a long time,

767
00:37:26,132 --> 00:37:28,772
You seem to have lost a lot of weight,

768
00:37:29,732 --> 00:37:32,732
Shouyue once studied physiognomy
under Daoist master Li Chunfeng,

769
00:37:32,732 --> 00:37:34,312
I heard it from Shouyue that

770
00:37:34,312 --> 00:37:37,652
he has never seen your cousin,
so he can't judge his appearance,

771
00:37:38,212 --> 00:37:40,472
However, you should be blessed in the future,

772
00:37:40,472 --> 00:37:42,652
You need to relax
and take good care of yourself,

773
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:45,532
I appreciate your kind words,

774
00:37:46,212 --> 00:37:47,272
Madam, please be at ease,

775
00:37:47,272 --> 00:37:48,892
I have now come to understand,

776
00:37:49,452 --> 00:37:50,632
For me

777
00:37:50,632 --> 00:37:53,252
my cousin has merely gone to a farther place,

778
00:37:53,252 --> 00:37:55,612
If we're meant to cross paths again, we will,

779
00:37:57,052 --> 00:37:58,052
If not,

780
00:38:00,172 --> 00:38:01,492
here's always another shot in the next life,

781
00:38:03,172 --> 00:38:04,712
But I didn't come

782
00:38:04,712 --> 00:38:06,252
to chat about all that,

783
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,872
I've heard

784
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,492
the Protector-General has already
posted notices in 18 towns

785
00:38:09,492 --> 00:38:11,292
in the five counties of Xizhou,

786
00:38:11,892 --> 00:38:14,752
It's said that Senior Official Pei will
come forward to rectify taxation

787
00:38:14,752 --> 00:38:17,172
and reclaim the rent and taxes owed by Xizhou
over the years,

788
00:38:18,052 --> 00:38:19,252
Does he know

789
00:38:19,252 --> 00:38:21,612
what situation he will face?

790
00:38:22,532 --> 00:38:23,612
In recent days,

791
00:38:24,252 --> 00:38:26,812
Shouyue is searching for the whereabouts of
your cousin,

792
00:38:26,812 --> 00:38:28,472
He's been using the whole thing as an excuse

793
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,552
to scout out every little place in Xizhou,

794
00:38:30,552 --> 00:38:32,532
even going through everyone's
household registration and stuff,

795
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,352
He found that

796
00:38:34,352 --> 00:38:38,092
now, people here owe way more tax than before,

797
00:38:38,092 --> 00:38:39,692
and the rich and poor
both have debts piling up,

798
00:38:40,332 --> 00:38:42,532
If Shouyue tries to force them to pay up,

799
00:38:42,532 --> 00:38:43,892
he's gonna end up making everyone mad,

800
00:38:43,892 --> 00:38:45,172
and it'll just make life all the more
miserable for them,

801
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:48,072
But if he doesn't push for the tax,

802
00:38:48,072 --> 00:38:49,752
by the time the army rolls in this fall,

803
00:38:49,752 --> 00:38:52,232
Xizhou won't have the cash or the resources
to support them,

804
00:38:52,232 --> 00:38:55,772
As the Chancellor of Xizhou,
he would be in trouble,

805
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,891
<i>[Army Advisor Zhang Juyin]</i>

806
00:39:50,612 --> 00:39:51,680
Advisor Zhang,

807
00:39:52,652 --> 00:39:54,052
Xizhou is behind in tax,

808
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:56,852
It has come to this point,

809
00:39:58,372 --> 00:40:00,212
This is a long story,

810
00:40:00,212 --> 00:40:01,212
Senior Official Pei,

811
00:40:04,052 --> 00:40:05,572
the taxation of Xizhou

812
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:06,972
has begun to fall into arrears

813
00:40:06,972 --> 00:40:08,952
as early as in the Zhenguan era

814
00:40:08,952 --> 00:40:10,732
when Protector-General Guo
was ruling over Xizhou,

815
00:40:12,332 --> 00:40:13,812
At the beginning of the third year of Yonghui,

816
00:40:14,372 --> 00:40:16,452
By the time Protector-General Qu
was ordered to come Xizhou,

817
00:40:17,212 --> 00:40:19,612
the warehouse in Xizhou was already
out of food and money,

818
00:40:20,132 --> 00:40:23,372
For these three years, from Protector-General
to miscellaneous workers

819
00:40:23,932 --> 00:40:27,452
The expenditure of Protector-General
of Xizhou was reduced again and again,

820
00:40:27,452 --> 00:40:29,652
Only thus has
the current situation been maintained,

821
00:40:29,652 --> 00:40:30,892
However, this tax…

822
00:40:31,772 --> 00:40:33,412
has been carried over year after year,

823
00:40:34,892 --> 00:40:37,792
Hence the need for Senior Official Pei
to thoroughly rectify matters,

824
00:40:37,792 --> 00:40:39,052
According to you,

825
00:40:40,052 --> 00:40:41,372
how should one rectify it?

826
00:40:42,692 --> 00:40:43,744
Fu,

827
00:40:49,332 --> 00:40:50,492
this is a secret remedy from the palace,

828
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:52,012
It can render a person unconscious
for several days,

829
00:40:52,012 --> 00:40:53,492
Nobody can tell what it is,

830
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:55,492
I suppose Senior Official Pei
can make use of it,

831
00:40:57,252 --> 00:40:59,732
Let me thank you on behalf of Shouyue
for your kindness,

832
00:40:59,732 --> 00:41:01,992
The taxation in Xizhou is already a lost cause,

833
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:03,452
What can the Qu family do about it?

834
00:41:04,012 --> 00:41:05,992
As descendants of the Gaochang royal family,

835
00:41:05,992 --> 00:41:07,892
how dare they oppose the Equal-field system,

836
00:41:07,892 --> 00:41:09,812
not uttering a single word
against the tax levies?

837
00:41:11,772 --> 00:41:12,932
At this moment,

838
00:41:12,932 --> 00:41:14,452
Shouyue could certainly pretend to be ill,

839
00:41:14,452 --> 00:41:15,812
or even deliberately get injured

840
00:41:15,812 --> 00:41:17,232
to avoid this situation,

841
00:41:17,232 --> 00:41:18,252
but what about after?

842
00:41:18,772 --> 00:41:20,632
As long as he remains the Chancellor of Xizhou,

843
00:41:20,632 --> 00:41:22,932
sooner or later,
he will have to deal with this situation

844
00:41:29,012 --> 00:41:30,732
The people of Xizhou are tough and fearless,

845
00:41:30,732 --> 00:41:32,772
you can't scare them off easily
without laying down some serious rules,

846
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:36,932
Senior Official Pei should prioritize
the most indebted town

847
00:41:36,932 --> 00:41:38,412
and use tough means,

848
00:41:39,892 --> 00:41:41,912
just like Protector-General Qiao in the past,

849
00:41:41,912 --> 00:41:43,612
For the one who refuses to pay rent,

850
00:41:43,612 --> 00:41:45,592
double the amount
and take the property as collateral,

851
00:41:45,592 --> 00:41:46,932
Make an example out of one,

852
00:41:46,932 --> 00:41:48,412
making the unruly people feel scared,

853
00:41:49,052 --> 00:41:52,412
Only then can the trend of arrears be reversed,

854
00:41:54,212 --> 00:41:55,412
What you said

855
00:41:56,652 --> 00:41:57,812
seems to make some sense,

856
00:42:06,812 --> 00:42:07,840
Senior Official Pei,

857
00:42:08,372 --> 00:42:11,132
In extraordinary times,
extraordinary measures must be taken,

858
00:42:12,092 --> 00:42:14,652
If not, the lack of food will be apparent
once the great army arrives

859
00:42:14,652 --> 00:42:15,652
This is not child's play,

860
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:20,412
The Chancellor also holds the positions
of the leader and executive in Xizhou,

861
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:21,932
You will be condemned for a major crime,

862
00:42:27,744 --> 00:42:28,768
Okay,

863
00:42:29,652 --> 00:42:30,972
You are right,

864
00:42:31,732 --> 00:42:33,012
If that's the case,

865
00:42:33,012 --> 00:42:34,052
this important task

866
00:42:34,772 --> 00:42:35,968
is entrusted to you,

867
00:42:40,488 --> 00:42:45,044
<i>♫ I write my longing for you in Spring ♫</i>

00:45:14,068 --> 00:45:17,507
<i>♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫</i>

901
00:45:17,507 --> 00:45:20,468
<i>♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫</i>

902
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:24,291
<i>♫ Winter comes again, and flowers wither ♫</i>

903
00:45:24,291 --> 00:45:27,139
<i>♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫</i>

904
00:45:27,139 --> 00:45:30,516
<i>♫ I look outside, like the poems asking ♫</i>

905
00:45:30,516 --> 00:45:36,067
<i>♫ My love, have you
found someone good for you ♫</i>
