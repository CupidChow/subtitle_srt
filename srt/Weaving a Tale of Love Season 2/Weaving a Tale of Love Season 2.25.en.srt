3
00:01:36,499 --> 00:01:40,796
Although you did not be famous overnight
in the battle this time,

4
00:01:41,356 --> 00:01:44,796
you have already seen the gap
between you and others.

5
00:01:47,836 --> 00:01:51,596
A gentleman should constantly strike to become
strong just like the evolution of the universe

6
00:01:52,436 --> 00:01:55,996
and cultivate to become tolerant
just like the earth bears everything on it.

7
00:01:56,596 --> 00:01:58,596
I surely believe in Chongyu.

8
00:01:59,636 --> 00:02:04,476
He will definitely lead Xizhou
to its former glory in the future.

9
00:02:07,396 --> 00:02:11,236
Drink a few more glasses with me tonight.

10
00:02:12,396 --> 00:02:13,836
Drinking is harmful to your health.

11
00:02:14,556 --> 00:02:19,156
So what? Let's go.

12
00:02:19,156 --> 00:02:21,276
Father. Father.

13
00:02:22,636 --> 00:02:23,680
Let's go.

14
00:02:24,192 --> 00:02:25,236

15

16
00:02:26,636 --> 00:02:28,436
Please don't drag me.

17

Hurry up.

18
00:02:37,076 --> 00:02:39,336
Minister. Madam.

19
00:02:39,336 --> 00:02:42,136
Each family in the village
has sent their capable daughters.

20
00:02:42,136 --> 00:02:44,816
If Madam needs something, just tell them.

21
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:46,156
Thank you for your hard work,
Village Mayor Zhou.

22
00:02:46,156 --> 00:02:47,436
You are welcome.

23
00:02:49,996 --> 00:02:52,156
Village Mayor Zhou, please gather all men

24
00:02:52,156 --> 00:02:53,436
to village gate,

25
00:02:54,396 --> 00:02:55,488
Okay,

26
00:02:59,676 --> 00:03:02,876
Yunyi. Minniang.
Take out raw cotton cloth without seeds

27
00:03:02,876 --> 00:03:04,596
and the common cotton cloth made in workshops.

28
00:03:04,596 --> 00:03:05,956
Please pass them around.

29
00:03:05,956 --> 00:03:07,008
Okay.

30
00:03:11,636 --> 00:03:13,196
Look! Take a look quickly.

31
00:03:20,596 --> 00:03:22,376
Madam, what method did you use?

32
00:03:22,376 --> 00:03:25,096
How can this woven cotton cloth be so soft?

33
00:03:25,096 --> 00:03:27,756
How did this raw cotton cloth become so clean?

34
00:03:28,316 --> 00:03:29,756
There's nothing particular.

35
00:03:29,756 --> 00:03:31,556
The cotton cloth that you see

36
00:03:31,556 --> 00:03:33,916
is deseeded and softened by a weaving machine.

37
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,556
As long as this cotton is used,

38
00:03:35,556 --> 00:03:38,296
everyone can weave soft cotton cloth.

39
00:03:38,296 --> 00:03:40,476
Not to mention that it could replace silk
for paying weaving tax.

40
00:03:40,476 --> 00:03:42,076
If take it to the market,

41
00:03:42,076 --> 00:03:43,796
one piece could also be exchanged
for a string of coins.

42
00:03:44,596 --> 00:03:46,356
A string of coins? that's too much.

43
00:03:47,196 --> 00:03:49,036
Senior Official allow us to use cotton.

44
00:03:49,036 --> 00:03:51,756
Everyone knows that it can replace silk
for paying weaving tax.

45
00:03:52,276 --> 00:03:56,156
In Xizhou, everyone knows that cotton is easy
to grow but difficult to be woven.

46
00:03:56,156 --> 00:03:58,676
Just deseeding requires a lot of efforts.

47
00:03:59,276 --> 00:04:02,236
Therefore, it's not because the family
really can't afford cloth.

48
00:04:02,236 --> 00:04:05,456
Normal women would never try this.

49
00:04:05,456 --> 00:04:08,596
But now there's such clean,
soft, and pure cotton.

50
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:10,476
And it's possible to exchange it
for a string of money.

51
00:04:10,476 --> 00:04:12,156
It truly broadens our horizons.

52
00:04:13,356 --> 00:04:16,696
I wonder
if Madam could possibly show us the method.

53
00:04:16,696 --> 00:04:17,756
Then follow me.

54
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,436
Come on, let's go and have a look.

55
00:04:38,956 --> 00:04:40,836
Now I show it to everyone.

56
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:45,256
As long as you handle the method,
everyone can learn it.

57
00:04:45,256 --> 00:04:46,556
Please watch carefully.

58
00:05:13,676 --> 00:05:15,516
Snacks in the countryside are not elaborate.

59
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:17,236
Ladies, please have a little bit.

60
00:05:17,236 --> 00:05:19,216
Thanks for your hardworking.

61
00:05:19,216 --> 00:05:21,236
I will prepare some drinks and dishes outside.

62
00:05:21,236 --> 00:05:23,196
Madam, if you need anything, just tell me.

63
00:05:25,556 --> 00:05:27,516
The pastries here hardly tasty.

64
00:05:27,516 --> 00:05:29,556
Madam, please taste what Minniang has brought.

65
00:05:29,556 --> 00:05:30,876
Is it edible?

66
00:05:50,276 --> 00:05:52,076
Is everything fine
when you distribute errand boys?

67
00:05:52,676 --> 00:05:54,836
Madam's idea is excellent.

68
00:05:55,436 --> 00:05:57,096
If those women had not went there quickly

69
00:05:57,096 --> 00:06:00,036
and strongly praised the cotton
promoted by Madam,

70
00:06:00,036 --> 00:06:03,836
Today's distribution
would not be so successful.

71
00:06:04,436 --> 00:06:06,756
It is Minister that organized well
and did everything by himself.

72
00:06:06,756 --> 00:06:09,396
For promoting in every village and town,
Liuli dare not claim the credit.

73
00:06:14,596 --> 00:06:16,116
Minister has been working hard all day.

74
00:06:16,116 --> 00:06:18,436
Please sit down and have some tea and snacks.

75
00:06:18,436 --> 00:06:20,316
Yes, yes, sit down quickly.

76
00:06:21,356 --> 00:06:22,596
These are all brought by Minniang.

77
00:06:22,596 --> 00:06:24,356
They all are your taste.

78
00:06:25,316 --> 00:06:26,476
Excuse me for a moment.

79
00:06:26,476 --> 00:06:28,316
Go to see how the meal is going.

80
00:06:35,676 --> 00:06:36,836
I heard you coughing continuously.

81
00:06:36,836 --> 00:06:38,256
Your voice is a bit hoarse.

82
00:06:38,256 --> 00:06:39,676
I have added sanguisorba in it.

83
00:06:39,676 --> 00:06:41,796
It can moisturize lungs and relieve cough.
Have it please.

84
00:06:43,556 --> 00:06:45,896
Minister's meals are so exquisite.

85
00:06:45,896 --> 00:06:47,716
He wouldn't eat such crude things,

86
00:06:47,716 --> 00:06:49,556
not to mention such coarse tea sets.

87
00:06:49,556 --> 00:06:51,876
Let alone unknown sanguisorba.

88
00:06:52,396 --> 00:06:54,076
How could it be unknown?

89
00:06:54,076 --> 00:06:56,036
I just dug it up in the courtyard on my own.

90
00:07:00,276 --> 00:07:03,636
Minister trusts me. Sanguisorba is the best
for moisturizing lungs and relieving cough.

91
00:07:05,036 --> 00:07:08,116
Yunyi, stop.
There are many famous doctors around Minister.

92
00:07:08,116 --> 00:07:10,596
For a minor cough,
your folk remedies are not necessary.

93
00:07:11,516 --> 00:07:13,636
But by drinking one or two cups
of Sanguisorba water,

94
00:07:13,636 --> 00:07:14,876
he will get better.

95
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:16,276
Why do we make it so troublesome?

96
00:07:29,568 --> 00:07:31,636
Minister, you are smart.

97
00:07:31,636 --> 00:07:33,876
After drinking two more cups,
your cough will be cured tomorrow.

98
00:08:01,236 --> 00:08:04,316
Minister agreed to drink the Sanguisorba water
offered by Yunyi.

99
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:05,756
It surprises me.

100
00:08:06,476 --> 00:08:07,996
Based on my understanding of Minister,

101
00:08:07,996 --> 00:08:11,276
Minister wouldn't touch unknown things.

102
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,356
Perhaps it's a moment of tenderness.

103
00:08:19,316 --> 00:08:21,076
I have also been forced
to drift in foreign lands

104
00:08:21,676 --> 00:08:23,328

107
00:08:50,336 --> 00:08:52,076
They avoid us.

108
00:08:53,196 --> 00:08:54,316
How would I know that?

109
00:08:55,876 --> 00:08:58,416
I see Yunyi is very enthusiastic
towards Minister.

110
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,276
Does she love Minister?

111
00:09:02,236 --> 00:09:03,328
Yes.

How could it be possible?

113
00:09:06,476 --> 00:09:07,656
Why not?

114
00:09:07,656 --> 00:09:10,636
Minister is handsome
and cares about the people in Xizhou.

115

express your feelings so easily.

118
00:09:18,036 --> 00:09:20,876
Liking is simply liking. Why do I cover it up?

119
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:22,956
What? Do you like him as well?

120
00:09:28,356 --> 00:09:31,036
To tell the truth,
a few years ago, the elders in my family

121
00:09:31,036 --> 00:09:32,796
indeed intended to match me with Minister.

122
00:09:33,636 --> 00:09:37,556
Minister and I
can be considered as childhood sweethearts.

123
00:09:38,956 --> 00:09:40,236
It's a pity.

124
00:09:40,236 --> 00:09:41,836
It's a pity
that Minister doesn't like you, isn't it?

125

It's not just that Minister doesn't like me.

He doesn't like any girl in this world.

Even if Minister is excellent in all fields,

but he simply loves handsome youths.

129
00:10:01,036 --> 00:10:02,396
Is that really true?

130
00:10:02,396 --> 00:10:05,836
Of course.
Minister has already passed the age of thirty.

132

that he brings a message from Master.

He said that something happened
at the military camp.

00:12:42,716 --> 00:12:44,896
Why would the Tang army massacre the merchants
for no reason?

180
00:12:44,896 --> 00:12:46,316
Totally lie.

181
00:12:47,756 --> 00:12:48,796
Massacre the merchants?

182
00:12:52,316 --> 00:12:54,136
Although I am certainly not such kind person,

183
00:12:54,136 --> 00:12:55,516
what I said today is true.

184
00:12:55,516 --> 00:12:58,936
If I cheat, I will be killed by thunder.

185
00:12:58,936 --> 00:13:00,756
Don't you think
you will not be killed by thunder?

186
00:13:04,556 --> 00:13:06,976
Yunyi, go back to your own courtyard first.

187
00:13:06,976 --> 00:13:09,916
No, sister, he is truly not a good person.

188
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,876
Put the question
whether he is good or not aside.

189
00:13:11,876 --> 00:13:14,516
What he said today is likely to be true.

190
00:13:23,196 --> 00:13:24,256
Thank you, my lady.

191
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,556
I'm grateful to you
for believing in me, my lady.

192
00:13:28,396 --> 00:13:30,756
My lady, you must hurry to summon Minister,
otherwise it will be too late.

193
00:13:31,676 --> 00:13:34,296
General Su said
that massacring the merchants is being a theft.

194
00:13:34,296 --> 00:13:36,676
And I am unwilling to tarnish my reputation
by sharing their loot.

195
00:13:37,236 --> 00:13:39,956
They falsely accused me,
regarding me as the remnants of a city rebel.

196
00:13:40,676 --> 00:13:42,756
Senior Official Pei said
the court must be informed about this.

197
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:43,836
And the sooner, the better.

198
00:13:46,356 --> 00:13:47,876
I've already sent someone to summon Minister.

199
00:13:48,716 --> 00:13:50,476
Master Mi, please comes in.

200
00:14:04,236 --> 00:14:05,976
I was born to be a bad person.

201
00:14:05,976 --> 00:14:08,956
I entered the city with bad plans this time.

202
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,656
I intended to steal armor
and go to someone's home I know.

203
00:14:12,656 --> 00:14:13,676
To swindle some silver.

204
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,436
But who knew

205
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:44,956
that household with dozens of family members

206
00:14:45,756 --> 00:14:47,996
was only a teenage girl left,

207
00:14:48,716 --> 00:14:49,916
Trembling in a water jar.

208
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:54,836
Recognizing me at a glance,
she burst into tears while hugging my neck.

209
00:15:00,516 --> 00:15:02,916
I then hit two Tang soldiers
who came in after hearing noise.

210
00:15:04,316 --> 00:15:06,196
I sent her out of the city
and helped her onto a horse.

211
00:15:08,876 --> 00:15:10,276
It's all because of me
that I didn't consider things thoroughly.

212
00:15:10,956 --> 00:15:12,276
I brought trouble for General Su.

213
00:15:12,956 --> 00:15:16,396
On the third day,
General Su sent me out of the military camp.

214
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,156
I later heard that General Su refused to accept

215
00:15:20,876 --> 00:15:23,676
gold and silver treasures
scraped from Dadu City

216
00:15:24,476 --> 00:15:27,116
That Deputy Director Wang insisted

217
00:15:27,756 --> 00:15:29,356
I am a scout from Dadu City.

218
00:15:30,236 --> 00:15:32,916
He also said
that General Su has sheltered scouts

219
00:15:33,556 --> 00:15:35,676
so that he showed mercy towards city rebels.

220
00:15:37,076 --> 00:15:39,836
I barely managed to escape
to Senior Official Pei.

221
00:15:41,396 --> 00:15:44,316
Now that it has come to this, the only way is
that we report it to the court.

222
00:15:44,956 --> 00:15:46,236
Let His Majesty be informed of this matter.

223
00:15:46,996 --> 00:15:50,236
It would be best to have Minister Qu,
Protector-General Qu, submit a report.

224
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:52,992
If that doesn't work,

225
00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:56,196
you could ask Minister to secretly send someone
to take you to Chang'an.

226
00:15:56,196 --> 00:15:57,796
My lady will know

227
00:15:58,996 --> 00:16:00,876
how to make this matter be heard
by the Emperor.

228
00:16:07,076 --> 00:16:08,996
How is the situation
at the military warehouse now?

229
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:12,436
The military warehouse of the Chief Historian
has no grain left to send.

230
00:16:14,716 --> 00:16:16,356
Since half a month ago,

231
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,796
soldiers' food has already been halved.

232
00:16:20,236 --> 00:16:22,436
The feed for the horses
has been reduced even more.

233
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:25,096
The warhorses
barely have forage to fill their bellies.

234
00:16:25,096 --> 00:16:27,636
But the private horses used for transportation
by the foot soldiers

235
00:16:28,636 --> 00:16:30,516
are dying in large numbers from hunger.

236
00:16:31,556 --> 00:16:32,716
There is much complaining among the soldiers.

237
00:16:33,236 --> 00:16:35,356
Wang Wendu must have massacred the merchants
in the city.

238
00:16:35,876 --> 00:16:37,636
Aside from returning without nothing,

239
00:16:38,196 --> 00:16:41,436
he loots food, grass, cash and silk
to stabilize the military's morale.

240
00:16:58,756 --> 00:17:00,696
Master Mi, this is Physician Han.

241
00:17:00,696 --> 00:17:03,316
It's better to cure your wounds first
before reporting to Minister.

242
00:17:10,076 --> 00:17:11,104
Thank you, my lady.

243
00:17:12,076 --> 00:17:13,396
I am fine.

244
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,936
I just fell off from horse and broke my nose
in the middle of the night.

245
00:17:15,936 --> 00:17:17,236
Just lost a bit more blood.

246
00:17:20,596 --> 00:17:21,636
Indeed, I am fine.

247
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:27,596
I just haven't had rest for a few days,
and the bleeding wouldn't stop after the shock.

248
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:30,036
There are other injuries.

249
00:17:31,876 --> 00:17:35,316
Staying up like this for another two days
would only shorten my life by two years.

250
00:17:44,156 --> 00:17:45,316
Madam, please step aside for a moment.

251
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,876
I need to check his wounds.

252
00:17:49,476 --> 00:17:50,496
Thanks.

253
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,864
[Rising Sun and Forever Moon]

254
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,628
[Protector-General of Xizhou, Qu Zhizhan]

255
00:18:43,076 --> 00:18:45,556
My lady, why are you looking at this?

256
00:18:46,116 --> 00:18:47,796
Could there be some tricks?

257
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,236
Come help me take a look at this.

258
00:18:54,276 --> 00:18:56,596
This one and the other
that maid brought back from An Family

259
00:18:56,596 --> 00:18:59,036
are indeed a bit different.
It's newly issued this year.

260
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:01,876
This is a masterpiece
into which I've put a night's effort.

261
00:19:04,956 --> 00:19:07,436
It seems
Senior Official Pei must be in danger now.

262
00:19:07,436 --> 00:19:09,156
Advisor Su hated Senior Official Pei.

263
00:19:09,156 --> 00:19:10,916
Senior Official Pei
is bound to have a hard time in the military.

264
00:19:13,596 --> 00:19:15,036
With this fake clearance document,

265
00:19:15,036 --> 00:19:17,436
I can ask Gu to take the An family's servants.

266
00:19:18,236 --> 00:19:20,576
With the help of the An family's
financial power and horses along the way

267
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,596
they arrive at the military
under the pretext of delivering supplies.

268
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:27,396
To help for Senior Official Pei outside
to prevent persecution from Advisor Su.

269
00:19:31,356 --> 00:19:34,036
The young servant that the lady sent
to wait at the city gate has returned.

270
00:19:34,036 --> 00:19:35,676
He says the Minister has returned.

271
00:19:36,636 --> 00:19:39,596
However,
that child couldn't even get close to Minister.

272
00:19:40,156 --> 00:19:43,076
He said Minister was accompanied
by dozens of people in armor.

273
00:19:43,076 --> 00:19:44,356
They enter the city gate together.

274
00:19:44,956 --> 00:19:46,576
Those people all looked hostile.

275
00:19:46,576 --> 00:19:49,256
Our young servant approached them
but hadn't even spoken one word yet.

276
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:50,896
He was pushed aside.

277
00:19:50,896 --> 00:19:52,856
However, that child was quite clever.

278
00:19:52,856 --> 00:19:55,636
He noticed that an attendant of Minister
was lagging behind.

279
00:19:55,636 --> 00:19:57,936
So he went up and said a few words.

280
00:19:57,936 --> 00:20:02,116
The attendant replied
that he would report to Minister when free.

281
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,396
Dozens of people in armor.

282
00:20:05,396 --> 00:20:07,316
Do you find out who these people are?

283
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:11,276
They said that the leader
is the military advisor Su Nanjin.

284
00:20:17,436 --> 00:20:18,676
[Peace and Safe Spread Far]
Is what you said true?

285
00:20:19,556 --> 00:20:20,956
The army has already returned.

286
00:20:20,956 --> 00:20:24,956
T-That Senior Official Pei
was already detained by the army.

287
00:20:24,956 --> 00:20:27,236
How dare I speak nonsense
about this vital matter?

288
00:20:28,396 --> 00:20:30,556
If this Pei Xingjian is just ineffective
in dispatching military provisions,

289
00:20:30,556 --> 00:20:31,904
then let it be.

290
00:20:31,904 --> 00:20:35,076
He also sided with Su Dingfang in showing mercy
to the scouts from Dadu City.

291
00:20:35,076 --> 00:20:37,356
How could the Deputy Director Wang
tolerate him?

292
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:41,636
Logically speaking, Pei Xingjian
is an official of Xizhou after all.

293
00:20:42,196 --> 00:20:44,276
It should be Protector-General Qu
to decide his fate.

294
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,956
Deputy Director Wang
wants me to inform the Protector-General.

295
00:20:47,836 --> 00:20:50,916
In a few days,
Pei Xingjian will be escorted back to Xizhou.

296
00:20:52,396 --> 00:20:53,440
Dadu.

297
00:20:54,556 --> 00:20:57,156
Is Master Su referring to the Dadu City
on the west of Yingsuochuan Valley?

298
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:01,276
I believe
this city is quite affluent as far as I know.

299
00:21:01,996 --> 00:21:03,576
The lord of the city is a sly character.

300
00:21:03,576 --> 00:21:05,516
It seems to have the guts

301
00:21:06,076 --> 00:21:07,956
to place a spy in the Tang army.

302
00:21:08,756 --> 00:21:10,756
Is he totally unaware of the danger?

303
00:21:10,756 --> 00:21:11,756
Isn't that the truth?

304
00:21:13,996 --> 00:21:15,356
Deputy Director Wang originally wanted to

305
00:21:15,356 --> 00:21:17,376
let Su Dingfang have dignity.

306
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:18,996
But he took advantage
of his previous military exploits,

307
00:21:18,996 --> 00:21:20,716
unfairly protecting the spy from Dadu City.

308
00:21:21,316 --> 00:21:23,156
He even secretly let him out of camp.

309
00:21:23,836 --> 00:21:25,196
Now, this spy from Dadu city

310
00:21:25,196 --> 00:21:27,156
has reached Xizhou probably.

311
00:21:28,476 --> 00:21:30,716
Deputy Director Wang has asked me
to cooperate with Protector-General Qu

312
00:21:30,716 --> 00:21:32,196
to catch this spy from Dadu.

313
00:21:32,836 --> 00:21:35,436
What's your opinion, Protector-General Qu?

314
00:21:43,116 --> 00:21:47,556
Since Deputy Director Wang has ordered,
I must obey.

315
00:21:49,396 --> 00:21:51,956
I heard from Chongyu that soldiers and horses
who have joined the army

316
00:21:51,956 --> 00:21:54,076
have secured the city gate of Xizhou.

317
00:21:54,756 --> 00:21:56,556
I suspect that the spy cannot escape anymore.

318
00:21:57,156 --> 00:22:00,356
The Advisor has been through many hardships
along the way.

319
00:22:00,356 --> 00:22:04,156
Do you need to freshen up
and rest for a moment?

320
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,436

321
00:22:06,756 --> 00:22:09,436
The spy is likely hiding
in Pei Xingjian's house.

322
00:22:10,356 --> 00:22:14,216
We should capture him immediately
to avoid more complications.

323
00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:15,516
Master Su, don't worry.

324
00:22:16,356 --> 00:22:19,976
I will arrange people
to spot Pei Xingjian's house secretly.

325
00:22:19,976 --> 00:22:23,016
By the way, find out the situation there
these past few days.

I'll inform you immediately

If so, thanks for Chongyu.

328
00:22:39,796 --> 00:22:42,316
Chongyu, don't blame me.
I don't mean to concealed it from you.

329
00:22:43,356 --> 00:22:44,856
It's just
that I accept military orders this time.

330
00:22:44,856 --> 00:22:47,156
I can't reveal the news until we get to Xizhou.

331
00:22:47,876 --> 00:22:49,676
I wondered why Ziyu said so

332
00:22:49,676 --> 00:22:51,996
and asked me
who else is in the Pei Shouyue's family.

333
00:22:52,836 --> 00:22:55,196
You'd better pay more attention
to catching the spy.

[Qu's Mansion]
Thoroughly inspect the merchants heading east.

Do not let them exploit any loopholes.

escape from punishment.

00:23:49,436 --> 00:23:52,156
I must the matter of life and death to you.

349
00:23:53,276 --> 00:23:54,636
Please ask me as your will, Madam.

350
00:23:55,276 --> 00:23:58,356
I wonder
if Physician Han could make Mr. Mi's injuries

351
00:23:58,356 --> 00:24:00,716
appear more critical.

352
00:24:00,716 --> 00:24:03,356
It's best to look like
he is on the brink of death.

353
00:24:06,076 --> 00:24:07,996
Merchants in Dadu City have been murdered.

354
00:24:07,996 --> 00:24:10,456
Master Mi. was falsely accused
of being a spy in Dadu.

355
00:24:10,456 --> 00:24:12,116
I have already asked Ni to tell you.

356
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:16,816
If he is caught and sent to the army,
it's certain that he won't come back.

357
00:24:16,816 --> 00:24:18,836
Even Senior Official Pei will be accused.

358
00:24:19,436 --> 00:24:21,876
I have thought of a risky plan.

359
00:24:22,556 --> 00:24:25,476
The more miserable Mi Dalang's appearance,
the better.

360
00:24:26,956 --> 00:24:28,596
I am going to fake the wound right away.

361
00:24:28,596 --> 00:24:29,632
Thank you.

362
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:41,156
Madam, I have a more convenient drug.

363
00:24:42,996 --> 00:24:45,316
I wonder if Madam is willing to try it.

364
00:24:47,636 --> 00:24:49,716
Alright, you prepare first.

365
00:24:49,716 --> 00:24:51,356

366
00:25:02,396 --> 00:25:04,196

there must be something strange about this.

367
00:25:04,716 --> 00:25:06,976
Pei Xingjian and Su Dingfang are not someone
who does not know what matters.

368
00:25:06,976 --> 00:25:08,236
How could it happen without reason?

369
00:25:08,236 --> 00:25:09,836
To cover up for some sort of spy.

370
00:25:13,836 --> 00:25:14,912
Go on.

371
00:25:15,876 --> 00:25:19,036
Send someone to give a message
to Pei's mansion.

372
00:25:21,036 --> 00:25:24,316
Senior Official Pei and his wife
are our benefactors.

373
00:25:25,636 --> 00:25:27,516

Tell the kitchen to cut off all the meat
for my father next two days.

377

I already know why Madam has invited me here.

382
00:26:01,556 --> 00:26:03,696
I came just to inform Madam.

383
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:06,096
Mr. Su has already taken orders
from the Chief Administrator

384
00:26:06,096 --> 00:26:08,276
to investigate the Dadu spy in Xizhou.

385
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:10,616

I will lead people to patrol the whole city.

386
00:26:10,616 --> 00:26:12,396
Madam need to make some preparations please.

387
00:26:13,236 --> 00:26:14,696
I assume that Minister is not aware

388
00:26:14,696 --> 00:26:16,836
what on earth has happened inside Dadu City.

389
00:26:21,036 --> 00:26:22,436
What's the matter?

390
00:26:22,436 --> 00:26:24,596
Master Mi,
please come out to greet the Minister.

391
00:26:33,316 --> 00:26:34,400
Minister.

392
00:26:35,716 --> 00:26:36,800
Master Mi.

393
00:26:37,516 --> 00:26:41,756
Minister, the merchants inside Dadu City
have been slaughtered.

394
00:26:43,396 --> 00:26:44,836
What did you say?

395
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:48,576
General Su Dingfang refuses
to collude with Deputy Director Wang.

396
00:26:48,576 --> 00:26:49,836
Then Deputy Director Wang slandered him

397
00:26:49,836 --> 00:26:51,596
that he helped me who is a spy from Dadu.

398
00:26:52,996 --> 00:26:56,136
Minister, you know someone named.

399
00:26:56,136 --> 00:26:58,256
I was born and raised in the Xizhou.

400
00:26:58,256 --> 00:26:59,556
How dare I do that

401
00:26:59,556 --> 00:27:02,304
stupid spy of Dadu? Minister.

402
00:27:08,316 --> 00:27:09,376
Did you say

403
00:27:10,916 --> 00:27:13,036
the merchants in Dadu City

404
00:27:16,796 --> 00:27:18,076
were all slaughtered?

405
00:27:21,196 --> 00:27:24,676
Minister, as Senior Official said,
things have happened.

406
00:27:25,236 --> 00:27:27,976
Only you
can vindicate innocent people of Dadu City.

407
00:27:27,976 --> 00:27:30,296
Protector-General Qu please report it
to the imperial court.

408
00:27:30,296 --> 00:27:33,316
Inform His Majesty of this deep grievance
as soon as possible.

409
00:27:33,836 --> 00:27:36,956
Convict those executioners, Minister.

410
00:27:59,516 --> 00:28:01,276
My Qu family is located
in the remote southwest frontier.

411
00:28:02,796 --> 00:28:04,176
We lack influence and are weak in power.

412
00:28:04,176 --> 00:28:08,116
If we overtly confront General Su, I'm afraid…

413
00:28:17,276 --> 00:28:18,836
I do have a safe and reliable method.

414
00:28:21,316 --> 00:28:22,856
Minister, you must be aware as well.

415
00:28:22,856 --> 00:28:25,996
I received help from Madam Rongguo,
the Empress's mother.

416
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:28,196
Madam Rongguo
has been exceptionally kind to Liuli.

417
00:28:29,516 --> 00:28:33,136
I ask Minister to secretly send an officer
to deliver a message to Chang'an for me.

418
00:28:33,136 --> 00:28:36,396
Liuli guarantees
that no matter how this matter is resolved,

419
00:28:36,396 --> 00:28:38,276
it will not implicate the family of the Qu.

420
00:28:38,276 --> 00:28:40,436
Furthermore, it might even make it possible for

421
00:28:40,436 --> 00:28:43,236
the Empress to be aware of Minister's loyalty.

422
00:28:50,356 --> 00:28:53,516
As for loyalty or not,
there is no need to mention it now.

423
00:28:54,796 --> 00:28:57,596
I, on the other hand,
would like to see these utterly mad men.

424
00:28:59,156 --> 00:29:00,956
I wonder what kind of fate will they meet.

425
00:29:04,436 --> 00:29:07,036
Madam, if there is any letter
to be sent to Chang'an

426
00:29:07,556 --> 00:29:10,396
Chongyu is willing to do for you
with whole heart.

427
00:29:39,156 --> 00:29:40,192
Thank you very much, Minister.

428
00:29:40,876 --> 00:29:42,876
This is the Ruyi that the Empress awarded me

429
00:29:42,876 --> 00:29:44,556
and the letter I wrote to the Empress

430
00:29:45,276 --> 00:29:46,996

have arrived at the Duke's mansion,

431
00:29:46,996 --> 00:29:48,276
they Just give the word

432
00:29:48,276 --> 00:29:50,716
that 'The Kudi clan sent someone
to greet to Madam Rongguo'.

433
00:29:50,716 --> 00:29:52,076
Someone will probably report it.

434
00:29:53,076 --> 00:29:56,716
Does the lady trust me so much?

435
00:29:58,116 --> 00:30:01,316
Minister has pride,
and he would surely not feed the dragon.

436
00:30:01,316 --> 00:30:04,816
Furthermore, this matter will sooner or later
become known to the world

437
00:30:04,816 --> 00:30:07,396
There is no need for Minister stain his fame
by associating with the corrupt.

438
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:14,316
This letter will surely be delivered
by Chongyu.

439
00:30:15,156 --> 00:30:17,636
It's just that the city gates are now closed.

440
00:30:19,116 --> 00:30:22,116

441

you've been keeping me in such suspense.

I just went to the Pei Family,
but I didn't see the Dadu scout.

448

I only saw one man selling live stocks.

449
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:10,396
The merchant from Xizhou, Master Mi,
was beaten until he was almost breathless.

450
00:31:10,396 --> 00:31:11,896
But he was still there, shouting and yelling,

451
00:31:11,896 --> 00:31:14,236
that the merchants were all slaughtered.
Everyone is dead.

452
00:31:14,236 --> 00:31:16,836
The treasure has been stolen,
and now they want to kill him.

453
00:31:17,556 --> 00:31:19,456
Why didn't Chongyu bring him back?

454
00:31:19,456 --> 00:31:21,156

00:37:15,016 --> 00:37:16,356
But if the medicine is not used,

520
00:37:16,356 --> 00:37:18,956
he can't keep yelling like this for long.

521
00:37:21,516 --> 00:37:24,116
Have you come here
for any official matters today?

522
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:25,716
Madam.

523
00:37:25,716 --> 00:37:28,356
It was said that Master Mi forced good people
into bad one.

524
00:37:28,356 --> 00:37:31,436
They want to take him to reply, madam.

525
00:37:32,636 --> 00:37:35,636
You all have also seen Master Mi's situation.

526
00:37:36,196 --> 00:37:37,756
Does he seem to be able to respond?

527
00:37:39,676 --> 00:37:40,916
Move aside, move aside, move aside,

528
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,596
Advisor Su, how do you think what we should do?

529
00:37:53,076 --> 00:37:56,716
Madam Kudi, long time no see.

530
00:37:58,036 --> 00:37:59,104
Master Su.

531
00:38:01,756 --> 00:38:03,596
I suppose he must be Master Mi.

532
00:38:04,476 --> 00:38:08,196
You allow him to talk nonsense
and stir up people's hearts here?

533
00:38:10,196 --> 00:38:12,476
This man, Mi Dalang, has committed

534
00:38:12,476 --> 00:38:13,716
coercing the innocent into degrading acts
several times in Yizhou.

535
00:38:14,396 --> 00:38:16,116
I'll take him back for questioning.

536
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,676
Hope that you can do me a favor.

537
00:38:20,156 --> 00:38:21,344
Master Su.

538
00:38:21,344 --> 00:38:24,580
Look at him. Can he bear such turbulence?

539
00:38:25,316 --> 00:38:28,856
Could you please show mercy to him
and allow him to have a rest?

540
00:38:28,856 --> 00:38:30,936
Let's talk about it after he wakes up.

541
00:38:30,936 --> 00:38:32,716
It's also good to preserve his life.

542
00:38:34,356 --> 00:38:35,916
It's not that Su is unwilling.

543
00:38:36,636 --> 00:38:38,916
It's just
that official duties make it inconvenient.

544
00:38:40,196 --> 00:38:42,796
And I must advise madam
not to indulge in momentary compassion,

545
00:38:42,796 --> 00:38:43,996
thereby tolerating the demon.

546
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:46,876
I just fear it may affect
Senior Official Pei's good reputation

547
00:38:46,876 --> 00:38:48,316
as well.

548
00:38:50,636 --> 00:38:52,716
Since you come here on orders
to take someone away,

549
00:38:53,316 --> 00:38:54,436
I shouldn't stand in the way.

550
00:38:55,636 --> 00:38:58,716
May I trouble you to show us
the official document to everyone?

551
00:39:03,916 --> 00:39:06,596
I was in a rush
when I left the house, so I did not bring it.

552
00:39:07,476 --> 00:39:09,876
Who doesn't know
that Master Mi is a notoriously wicked person?

553
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,956
Could it be that you suspect
that I have wrongfully accused him?

554
00:39:12,956 --> 00:39:16,236
Not at all.it is not I that suspect you.

555
00:39:16,796 --> 00:39:19,796
Even if Mi has misconducted himself,
he has not yet been convicted.

556
00:39:19,796 --> 00:39:21,276
He is the people of Xizhou.

557
00:39:21,956 --> 00:39:25,236
Since you want to capture someone in Xizhou,
there must be some evidence.

558
00:39:25,876 --> 00:39:27,436
Although I am a woman,

559
00:39:27,436 --> 00:39:29,476
yet I cannot simply watch the people of Xizhou

560
00:39:29,476 --> 00:39:31,476
losing their lives
in such an unclear and unjust manner.

561
00:39:32,076 --> 00:39:34,076
Well, well. Nice speech.

562
00:39:34,076 --> 00:39:35,116
That's right indeed.

563
00:39:42,356 --> 00:39:45,396
Madam is determined
to obstruct my official duties.

564
00:39:45,396 --> 00:39:47,536
How dare I hinder your official business.

565
00:39:47,536 --> 00:39:50,036
Although it is official duty,
it has its own set of rules.

566
00:39:50,036 --> 00:39:51,596
Which state
would take people from another place

567
00:39:51,596 --> 00:39:53,356
without even a single official document?

568
00:39:53,956 --> 00:39:57,056
Does your honor think
that Xizhou is a county of Yizhou?

569
00:39:57,056 --> 00:40:00,196
As long as you want to take the initiative,
you can capture anyone you want.

570
00:40:00,196 --> 00:40:01,676
Can you capture whoever you want?

571
00:40:18,756 --> 00:40:20,716
This is the fish symbol of Chief Administrator.

572
00:40:21,516 --> 00:40:23,876
I wonder if this can be used as a credential?

573
00:40:29,028 --> 00:40:30,976
[Same as Commander]

574
00:40:34,396 --> 00:40:35,716
How much longer does the lady want to verify?

575
00:40:36,596 --> 00:40:38,396
Do you still suspect that Su is faking it?

576
00:40:40,556 --> 00:40:42,676
Of course, this symbol is genuine.

577
00:40:43,356 --> 00:40:46,396
So your father, Prefectural Governor Su,
has become the Chief Administrator.

578
00:40:46,396 --> 00:40:47,916
It deserves congratulation.

579
00:40:49,836 --> 00:40:51,576
Madam, what do you mean?

580
00:40:51,576 --> 00:40:53,956
Isn't Governor Su the Chief Administrator?

581
00:40:54,556 --> 00:40:56,956
Then why does this case of forcing good people
into servitude in Yizhou

582
00:40:56,956 --> 00:40:58,716
require the military command
of the Chief Administrator?

583
00:40:59,556 --> 00:41:00,608
Could it be that

584
00:41:00,608 --> 00:41:03,356
Mi forced someone
from the Chief Administrator's family

585
00:41:03,356 --> 00:41:04,636
to be scorned?

586
00:41:04,636 --> 00:41:06,236
Madam, please do not speak nonsense.

587
00:41:06,236 --> 00:41:08,296
How can you joke about Chief Administrator?

588
00:41:08,296 --> 00:41:11,556
Nonsense? Who just came in and spoke

589
00:41:11,556 --> 00:41:14,236
that Mi has committed a crime in Yizhou
and needs to be taken back for questioning?

590
00:41:14,236 --> 00:41:16,516
Who cannot produce the documents from Yizhou?

591
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:18,436
But brought out a military token instead?

592
00:41:18,436 --> 00:41:20,716
Claim to arrest a merchant
who forces the good into servitude.

593
00:41:21,316 --> 00:41:22,416
But I didn't know this.

594
00:41:22,416 --> 00:41:26,076
I didn't realize that Commander would care
for the people of Xizhou like that.

595
00:41:26,076 --> 00:41:27,596
Even the merchants in the state and county

596
00:41:27,596 --> 00:41:29,596
and forcing good men to demon
should be inquired into.

597
00:41:30,396 --> 00:41:31,916
I am not unaware of what Mister Mi did.

598
00:41:31,916 --> 00:41:34,720
What on earth has he done
to enrage the Chief Administrator?

599
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,796
So Master Su

600
00:41:35,796 --> 00:41:38,196
indifferently take him away
regardless of his life.

601
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:42,596
Or is it that so-called forcing a good man
is merely an excuse?

602
00:41:43,196 --> 00:41:46,756
Could it be that this Mi
hasn't truly succumbed to evil?

603
00:41:47,316 --> 00:41:49,956
But has witnessed something
he should not have seen?

604
00:41:49,956 --> 00:41:52,296
thus he must be silenced by death.

605
00:41:52,296 --> 00:41:55,516
Hold on, don't speak nonsense.

606
00:41:57,316 --> 00:42:00,436
Who said Chief Administrator
wants to arrest this person to kill him?

607
00:42:01,396 --> 00:42:04,376
So, it's not Chief Administrator
who wants to arrest people. It's okay.

608
00:42:04,376 --> 00:42:06,836
I have been hearing about murdering all day.

609
00:42:06,836 --> 00:42:08,436
And now you come here

610
00:42:08,436 --> 00:42:11,256
and can't even wait for a moment
to take him away.

611
00:42:11,256 --> 00:42:12,856
Therefore, I was a bit over-concerned.

612
00:42:12,856 --> 00:42:16,436
I am a woman, lacking insight,
I beg your pardon, Advisor.

613
00:42:18,276 --> 00:42:21,356
Since it's not Chief Administrator
wanting to arrest him, it makes it easier.

614
00:42:22,116 --> 00:42:24,396
Anyway, this Master Mi has been injured
so badly.

615
00:42:24,396 --> 00:42:25,656
He cannot go anywhere.

616
00:42:25,656 --> 00:42:27,536
Advisor, please wait a moment.

617
00:42:27,536 --> 00:42:31,056
When his injuries get better,
you bring an official document to take him.

618
00:42:31,056 --> 00:42:33,116
So as to prevent everyone from truly believing

619
00:42:33,116 --> 00:42:34,756
that someone was robbing for money and silk,

620
00:42:34,756 --> 00:42:37,556
slaughtering the merchants in the city,
committing murder to silence them
