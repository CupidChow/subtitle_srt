00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:35,955
[Episode 28]

3
00:01:43,444 --> 00:01:44,512
Yunyi.

4
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:47,884
Yunyi.

5
00:01:47,884 --> 00:01:49,804
Lady Zhang has come to visit our lady again.

6
00:01:49,804 --> 00:01:50,964
She's already at the front courtyard.

7
00:01:50,964 --> 00:01:53,524
Perhaps you should try to stop her.

8
00:01:53,524 --> 00:01:55,564
Don't let her disturb Lady's recuperation.

9
00:01:55,564 --> 00:01:57,684
Didn't she just visit yesterday?
Why has she come again?

10
00:01:59,644 --> 00:02:00,964
Sister Liu is not here today.

11
00:02:01,984 --> 00:02:03,040
I will send her away.

12
00:02:14,204 --> 00:02:15,504
Sister is still in a coma.

13
00:02:15,504 --> 00:02:17,044
Lady Zhang, please go back.

14
00:02:17,044 --> 00:02:18,884
You are the sister of Madam Kudi.

15
00:02:18,884 --> 00:02:20,644
But you are not alike Madam Kudi at all.

16
00:02:20,644 --> 00:02:22,244
I came to visit Madam Kudi with kind intents.

17
00:02:22,244 --> 00:02:25,164
This is how Madam taught you to treat guests?

18
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,764
I can't argue with you.

19
00:02:26,764 --> 00:02:28,604
Anyhow, my sister is sick and can't treat you.

20
00:02:28,604 --> 00:02:29,632
Please leave.

21
00:02:30,244 --> 00:02:32,684
I brought so many precious gifts
to visit Madam.

22
00:02:32,684 --> 00:02:34,224
Even if I can't meet Madam.

23
00:02:34,224 --> 00:02:36,004
I'm tired after such a long journey.

24
00:02:36,004 --> 00:02:38,324
Yunyi, at least let me and my servant
have a cup of tea.

25
00:02:43,552 --> 00:02:44,640
Come in.

26
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,168
[Pei's Mansion]

27
00:02:59,884 --> 00:03:00,964
You have drunk your tea.

28
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:02,644
Shouldn't you two leave now?

29
00:03:04,324 --> 00:03:06,484
I notice that Lady Yunyi has a personality.

30
00:03:06,484 --> 00:03:08,444
You really don't resemble Madam Kudi at all.

31
00:03:09,484 --> 00:03:10,704
As far as I know.

32
00:03:10,704 --> 00:03:13,264
Madam Kudi only has one younger sister.

33
00:03:13,264 --> 00:03:15,164
Who is married to the heir of the Hedong Duke.

34
00:03:15,164 --> 00:03:16,204
She died of illness.

35
00:03:16,844 --> 00:03:19,124
I wonder if Madam Yunyi
is Madam Kudi's paternal cousin.

36
00:03:19,124 --> 00:03:20,164
Or maternal cousin?

37
00:03:20,164 --> 00:03:21,484
Do you also have the surname Kudi?

38
00:03:23,684 --> 00:03:25,124
What does any of this to do with you?

39
00:03:25,684 --> 00:03:27,224
Sure, it is none of my business.

40
00:03:27,224 --> 00:03:29,164
It's just that, having known you for so long

41
00:03:29,164 --> 00:03:30,564
I am still unaware of your surname.

42
00:03:31,164 --> 00:03:32,824
I see that you have an open and honest heart.

43
00:03:32,824 --> 00:03:34,104
About your surname.

44
00:03:34,104 --> 00:03:35,364
You wouldn't hide it, will you?

45
00:03:36,844 --> 00:03:39,004
A good woman does not casually
change her name or surname.

46
00:03:39,004 --> 00:03:40,204
Ashina Yunyi.

47
00:03:42,924 --> 00:03:43,964
You are from north.

48
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,904
So what?

49
00:03:49,904 --> 00:03:51,604
Not all the people in the North are bad.

50
00:03:51,604 --> 00:03:53,844
My father and brother are devoted to the court.

51
00:03:53,844 --> 00:03:54,844
To Tang Dynasty.

52
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,524
Of course they are.

53
00:03:58,084 --> 00:04:00,164
Otherwise, Senior Official Pei and Madam Kudi

54
00:04:00,164 --> 00:04:02,724
would not let you hide your identity in Xizhou.

55
00:04:20,724 --> 00:04:21,792
Take a look.

56
00:04:21,792 --> 00:04:23,244
Take a look. Take a look.

57
00:04:23,244 --> 00:04:24,564
With great difficulty,

58
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,304
I wanted to take advantage of Kudi's illness

59
00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:27,684
to find Yunyi's faults.

60
00:04:28,244 --> 00:04:29,804
That Liu Ruyue is a shrewd one.

61
00:04:29,804 --> 00:04:30,984
She was flawless.

62
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:33,404
But Yunyi herself is a stupid one.

63
00:04:34,244 --> 00:04:36,304
My lady, knowing Yunyi's surname is Ashina.

64
00:04:36,304 --> 00:04:37,364
Are you that kind of happy?

65
00:04:38,284 --> 00:04:40,264
Now Tang Dynasty is at war with the North.

66
00:04:40,264 --> 00:04:41,484
Yunyi is a northerner.

67
00:04:41,484 --> 00:04:43,004
Hiding her identity in Xizhou.

68
00:04:43,004 --> 00:04:44,524
Naturally, it's quite inappropriate.

69
00:04:44,524 --> 00:04:46,464
To put it harshly, she could be a spy.

70
00:04:46,464 --> 00:04:47,604
Death would not be excessive.

71
00:04:49,844 --> 00:04:52,484
I always think the way
Minister treated Ashina Yunyi.

72
00:04:52,484 --> 00:04:54,084
It is always a bit different from other women.

73
00:04:54,804 --> 00:04:56,064
But the fact that she is from the North.

74
00:04:56,064 --> 00:04:57,364
Minister will never...

75
00:04:57,888 --> 00:04:58,944
My Lady.

76
00:04:58,944 --> 00:05:01,484
Shouldn't we tell this news to Minister now?

77
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,384
I think that

78
00:05:04,384 --> 00:05:05,884
this news should be brought to Senior Official.

79
00:05:05,884 --> 00:05:07,604
That will be more safe
to tell Protector-General.

80
00:05:14,804 --> 00:05:17,844
Did I just say something wrong?

81
00:05:18,604 --> 00:05:20,484
That look of satisfaction on her face...

82
00:05:22,604 --> 00:05:24,084
What mistake did I make?

83
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,808
Liuli.

84
00:05:48,832 --> 00:05:49,884
Liuli.

85
00:05:58,336 --> 00:05:59,424
Liuli.

86
00:06:13,444 --> 00:06:14,464
Thank goodness.

87
00:06:15,484 --> 00:06:16,524
Lady has awakened.

88
00:06:16,524 --> 00:06:17,804
Hurry to call Physician Han over.

89
00:06:39,724 --> 00:06:40,832
Sister, you are awake.

90
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:45,484
The Lady is already out of danger.

91
00:06:45,484 --> 00:06:47,124
She just needs to take medicine
for a few more days.

92
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,376
Thank you, Physician Han.

93
00:06:49,964 --> 00:06:51,684
You have prescribed the medicine,
so please get some rest.

94
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:53,244
I will call for you later.

95
00:06:54,324 --> 00:06:55,644
Tan, see Physician Han out.

96
00:07:01,804 --> 00:07:02,924
Ni.

97
00:07:02,924 --> 00:07:04,304
Go and inform An Family.

98
00:07:04,304 --> 00:07:05,312
Yes.

99
00:07:08,084 --> 00:07:09,324
Lady Yunyi.

100
00:07:09,324 --> 00:07:10,724
Please inform Minister.

101
00:07:10,724 --> 00:07:11,784
These past few days.

102
00:07:11,784 --> 00:07:13,524
He has been asking about Liuli's condition
every day.

103
00:07:14,204 --> 00:07:15,264
Tell him not to worry.

104
00:07:15,264 --> 00:07:16,384
Liuli is awake.

105
00:07:16,384 --> 00:07:17,408
Okay.

106
00:07:19,684 --> 00:07:21,804
Sister has finally woken up.

107
00:07:21,804 --> 00:07:24,004
I shouldn't trouble sister with my own matters

108
00:07:25,924 --> 00:07:27,044
I'll go send a message to Minister.

109
00:07:42,144 --> 00:07:43,200
Minniang.

110
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:45,684
So you were saying.

111
00:07:45,684 --> 00:07:47,364
In the house of Senior Official Pei,

112
00:07:47,364 --> 00:07:49,764
there was a female spy from the north.

113
00:07:49,764 --> 00:07:51,204
And this female spy

114
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,364
has been persistently entangling with Chongyu.

115
00:07:55,004 --> 00:07:56,284
Exactly.

116
00:07:56,284 --> 00:07:58,324
She goes by the name Ashina Yunyi.

117
00:07:58,324 --> 00:07:59,784
A northern aristocrat.

118
00:07:59,784 --> 00:08:02,764
She has been hiding her identity
in Senior Official's residence.

119
00:08:02,764 --> 00:08:04,784
And she was constantly pestering Minister.

120
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,484
Clearly, her intentions are insidious.

121
00:08:06,484 --> 00:08:08,724
Since she was hiding her identity.

122
00:08:11,084 --> 00:08:13,684
Yet you stay in home every day.

123
00:08:13,684 --> 00:08:15,684
How could you possibly know this?

124
00:08:16,884 --> 00:08:18,064
This matter

125
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:20,284
is related to Senior Official and his wife.

126
00:08:21,284 --> 00:08:22,804
You must not make something up.

127
00:08:24,084 --> 00:08:26,704
I have always been
a friend of Senior Official's wife.

128
00:08:26,704 --> 00:08:27,784
That woman.

129
00:08:27,784 --> 00:08:29,864
She stays around of the Madam.

130
00:08:29,864 --> 00:08:32,004
That's how I could know.

131
00:08:32,724 --> 00:08:33,804
I also know.

132
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:34,924
Being a woman.

133
00:08:34,924 --> 00:08:36,604
I Shouldn't have inquired about this matter.

134
00:08:37,244 --> 00:08:38,804
But it concerns the safety of Xizhou.

135
00:08:38,804 --> 00:08:40,604
And it also affects the reputation of Minister.

136
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,844
That's why I come to tell you.

137
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:48,244
Your intention to protect Minister.

138
00:08:48,244 --> 00:08:49,564
I appreciate it.

139
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:51,584
Rest assured.

140
00:08:52,364 --> 00:08:54,404
I will definitely
investigate this matter thoroughly.

141
00:09:04,164 --> 00:09:06,404
Protector-General,
this matter is of great importance.

142
00:09:07,164 --> 00:09:10,164
I think,
that woman should be arrested and interrogated.

143
00:09:10,164 --> 00:09:12,124
She lurks in Xizhou.

144
00:09:12,124 --> 00:09:13,404
What are her intentions?

145
00:09:14,924 --> 00:09:17,724
At the very least,
she should be driven out of Xizhou.

146
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:18,844
Just in case.

147
00:09:43,008 --> 00:09:44,128
Yunyi.

148
00:09:44,844 --> 00:09:46,324
You look very uneasy.

149
00:09:46,324 --> 00:09:48,244
Is there something wrong with Madam Kudi?

150
00:09:52,484 --> 00:09:54,044
Sister has already woken up.

151
00:09:54,044 --> 00:09:55,244
Physician Han says,

152
00:09:55,964 --> 00:09:57,364
she will be fine as long as she rests.

153
00:09:58,404 --> 00:09:59,524
Amitabha Buddha.

154
00:09:59,524 --> 00:10:00,924
Madam is with good fortune.

155
00:10:00,924 --> 00:10:02,044
It's great that she was fine.

156
00:10:03,884 --> 00:10:05,404
It's me who is not fine.

157
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,224
I don't dare to disturb Sister's recovery.

158
00:10:07,224 --> 00:10:09,204
That's why I came to seek advice
from Sister Liu.

159
00:10:10,524 --> 00:10:11,724
I slip it out of my mouth.

160
00:10:11,724 --> 00:10:13,404
Zhang Minniang now knows my identity.

161
00:10:14,204 --> 00:10:15,404
Presumably now.

162
00:10:15,404 --> 00:10:17,964
She could have already told it to Minister.

163
00:10:17,964 --> 00:10:19,404
Sister Liu, do you think

164
00:10:20,164 --> 00:10:21,564
Minister will believe me?

165
00:10:27,968 --> 00:10:29,024
Chongyu.

166
00:10:30,404 --> 00:10:32,984
I've heard that in Senior Official Pei's home

167
00:10:32,984 --> 00:10:36,524
lives a northern woman surnamed Ashina.

168
00:10:37,164 --> 00:10:38,208
Did you know?

169
00:10:38,976 --> 00:10:40,032
I knew.

170
00:10:40,564 --> 00:10:42,884
she is the daughter
of the northern Nishu Tribe's leader.

171
00:10:43,564 --> 00:10:44,764
When she arrived at Xizhou.

172
00:10:44,764 --> 00:10:45,924
I have already investigated her.

173
00:10:47,004 --> 00:10:49,744
She was placed in Pei Xingjian's home
by General Su Dingfang.

174
00:10:49,744 --> 00:10:51,124
I think,

175
00:10:51,124 --> 00:10:52,804
it must have been for strategic reasons.

176
00:10:54,804 --> 00:10:57,484
I know you always act prudently.

177
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:02,044
You surely wouldn't get too close
with a spy from the North.

178
00:11:02,844 --> 00:11:03,904
Northern spy.

179
00:11:05,644 --> 00:11:08,324
Lady Kudi treats Ashina Yunyi as her sister.

180
00:11:08,884 --> 00:11:10,584
If she really has ulterior motives,

181
00:11:10,584 --> 00:11:12,084
with the astuteness of Mr. Pei and his wife,

182
00:11:12,084 --> 00:11:13,324
how could they let her stay at their home?

183
00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:15,328
Also,

184
00:11:16,044 --> 00:11:18,964
where do the words come from
that I am too close to her?

185
00:11:24,124 --> 00:11:25,864
As your father, I naturally believe,

186
00:11:25,864 --> 00:11:28,964
you are not a person
who abandons the cause for women.

187
00:11:42,176 --> 00:11:43,264
Liuli.

188
00:11:44,084 --> 00:11:46,004
I'll go outside and freshen up.

189
00:12:05,924 --> 00:12:08,224
My Lady, you are finally awake.

190
00:12:08,224 --> 00:12:10,084
You were seriously ill this time.

191
00:12:10,884 --> 00:12:12,404
You really scared us.

192
00:12:12,404 --> 00:12:13,764
Your husband hasn't close his eyes

193
00:12:13,764 --> 00:12:15,024
for past two days.

194
00:12:15,024 --> 00:12:16,284
He wouldn't let the maidservants do

195
00:12:16,284 --> 00:12:18,004
anything.

196
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:20,044
He has been by your side day and night.

197
00:12:20,644 --> 00:12:23,004
Lady, if you don't get better.

198
00:12:23,564 --> 00:12:26,444
I'm afraid your husband will fall ill too.

199
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:29,920
Indeed.

200
00:12:30,464 --> 00:12:31,564
A few days ago...

201
00:12:32,124 --> 00:12:34,484
Your hands and feet are frightfully cold.

202
00:12:34,484 --> 00:12:36,284
He heard Physician Han said,

203
00:12:36,284 --> 00:12:38,724
that it will be better if you keep warm.

204
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:39,944
He didn't even think.

205
00:12:39,944 --> 00:12:41,404
He became your heating pad.

206
00:12:45,084 --> 00:12:47,444
That comforting warmth in dreams...

207
00:12:47,444 --> 00:12:48,884
It was him all along.

208
00:12:59,808 --> 00:13:00,896
Chongyu.

209
00:13:02,084 --> 00:13:03,324
I noticed just before

210
00:13:04,204 --> 00:13:06,984
your words to that lady

211
00:13:06,984 --> 00:13:08,644
There was much intent to protect.

212
00:13:12,884 --> 00:13:14,324
Could it be that my son

213
00:13:14,324 --> 00:13:15,724
has finally begun

214
00:13:16,364 --> 00:13:18,124
to grow tenderness to women?

215
00:13:24,644 --> 00:13:26,604
Father, what are you talking about?

216
00:13:28,164 --> 00:13:29,604
What I just said is all true.

217
00:13:30,604 --> 00:13:31,924
That Ashina Yunyi.

218
00:13:31,924 --> 00:13:33,724
Although she comes from a northern nobility.

219
00:13:34,244 --> 00:13:35,364
But she is merely a woman who has suffered

220
00:13:35,364 --> 00:13:37,164
the pains of a life
of displacement and distress.

221
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:39,404
With her kind of intellect

222
00:13:39,404 --> 00:13:40,884
to say she is a scout from the north?

223
00:13:41,684 --> 00:13:43,284
I would never believe it.

224
00:13:47,564 --> 00:13:49,844
When did you start to care
about the trifles of Xizhou?

225
00:13:52,604 --> 00:13:54,444
Because Minniang told me about it.

226
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,096
Otherwise...

227
00:13:56,804 --> 00:13:58,164
How would I know?

228
00:14:01,484 --> 00:14:04,124
Zhang Minniang's claw
has been reaching a bit too far.

229
00:14:04,768 --> 00:14:05,804
Now...

230
00:14:06,524 --> 00:14:07,764
Do you still believe,

231
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,084
that she is just one harmless and weak girl

232
00:14:10,084 --> 00:14:12,124
stays in the boudoir?

233
00:14:35,804 --> 00:14:38,364
The doctor has said, eat less sweet food.

234
00:14:41,804 --> 00:14:42,844
Got it, got it.

235
00:14:48,604 --> 00:14:50,284
Eating this thing is just

236
00:14:51,844 --> 00:14:53,404
The peeling is too troublesome.

237
00:14:59,284 --> 00:15:01,964
Now, I'm afraid it's not a matter
of whether Minister trusts you or not.

238
00:15:01,964 --> 00:15:03,604
Now the northern rebel army is

239
00:15:03,604 --> 00:15:05,484
waging war against Tang Dynasty.

240
00:15:06,044 --> 00:15:08,284
As the Minister
of Xizhou Protector-General's Mansion.

241
00:15:08,284 --> 00:15:09,924
I'm afraid he will prioritize the greater good.

242
00:15:10,724 --> 00:15:12,244
Then will he capture me?

243
00:15:12,884 --> 00:15:13,964
Or will he kill me?

244
00:15:14,604 --> 00:15:15,764
Yunyi, don't be afraid for now.

245
00:15:16,604 --> 00:15:19,484
We still need to discuss this matter
with Senior Official Pei.

246
00:15:22,604 --> 00:15:23,864
I, Ashina Yunyi,

247
00:15:23,864 --> 00:15:25,544
I won't change my name or my surname.

248
00:15:25,544 --> 00:15:27,284
I've never done any harm to Xizhou.

249
00:15:28,204 --> 00:15:30,044
My sister and her husband
have kindly taken me in.

250
00:15:31,044 --> 00:15:32,244
I can't get them involved.

251
00:15:35,564 --> 00:15:37,384
I will go to find Qu Chongyu and make it clear.

252
00:15:37,384 --> 00:15:39,924
If he doesn't care about right or wrong,
then I will accept my fate.

253
00:15:41,564 --> 00:15:43,264
Yunyi, wait a moment.

254
00:15:43,264 --> 00:15:45,204
Let's discuss it with Senior Official Pei.

255
00:15:46,324 --> 00:15:48,084
Why does this child take rumors so seriously?

256
00:15:48,084 --> 00:15:49,644
Fu, get the cloak, let's go chase her.

257
00:15:49,644 --> 00:15:50,688
Yes.

258
00:16:15,564 --> 00:16:16,644
Yunyi, this way.

259
00:16:26,644 --> 00:16:29,164
Minister, Yunyi says
she has an urgent matter to see you.

260
00:16:31,964 --> 00:16:33,744
Y-Yun, what does Lady Yunyi want to see me for?

261
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:35,324
Let's find a place with no one around to talk.

262
00:16:37,568 --> 00:16:38,624
Okay.

263
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:51,964
What are you looking for me for?

264
00:16:53,364 --> 00:16:55,004
You already know that I am from the north.

265
00:16:55,564 --> 00:16:56,608
Aren't you going to arrest me?

266
00:16:58,204 --> 00:16:59,444
I thought it was something else.

267
00:17:02,404 --> 00:17:04,324
Since the first day
you entered the Senior Official's Residence.

268
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:06,324
I knew who you were.

269
00:17:06,884 --> 00:17:07,924
If I wanted to arrest you.

270
00:17:09,164 --> 00:17:10,444
I wouldn't wait until now.

271
00:17:12,524 --> 00:17:13,604
Do you believe me?

272
00:17:13,604 --> 00:17:14,844
I'm not a spy from the north?

273
00:17:15,804 --> 00:17:17,924
With your intelligence and character,

274
00:17:19,604 --> 00:17:20,724
you can't be a spy.

275
00:17:28,644 --> 00:17:30,484
Are you calling me an idiot in this way?

276
00:17:31,296 --> 00:17:32,352
No, not at all.

277
00:17:33,124 --> 00:17:34,844
I truly think this is precious.

278
00:17:35,724 --> 00:17:36,800
Very good.

279
00:17:40,064 --> 00:17:41,152
Go ahead.

280
00:17:42,964 --> 00:17:44,364
Make yourself comfortable
in the Senior Official's Residence.

281
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,016
I promise you,

282
00:17:46,764 --> 00:17:48,044
so long you stay in Xizhou,

283
00:17:48,844 --> 00:17:51,804
I, Qu Chongyu, will ensure your safety.

284
00:18:48,524 --> 00:18:50,044
Will you truly protect me?

285
00:18:58,844 --> 00:19:00,324
Yes, of course I will.

286
00:19:05,804 --> 00:19:06,964
The weather is so cool.

287
00:19:08,924 --> 00:19:10,484
Why are you dressed so thinly?

288
00:19:36,604 --> 00:19:38,084
Come, get up first.

289
00:19:39,604 --> 00:19:40,736
Fine.

290
00:19:46,284 --> 00:19:47,964
I-I-I will walk you out.

291
00:19:55,004 --> 00:19:56,064
Wait for me.

292
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,880
[Qu's Residence]

293
00:20:17,472 --> 00:20:18,560
Minister.

294
00:20:23,044 --> 00:20:24,984
Sister Liu, why are you here?

295
00:20:24,984 --> 00:20:26,048
Yunyi.

296
00:20:26,804 --> 00:20:27,844
You didn't cause any trouble, did you?

297
00:20:29,044 --> 00:20:30,084
I'll tell you more when I get back.

298
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,124
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

299
00:20:34,124 --> 00:20:35,124
Sister woke up.

300
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:39,072
Let's go.

301
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,864
Come.

302
00:21:37,724 --> 00:21:38,816
Are you feeling better?

303
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,400
Does it taste bitter?

304
00:22:03,136 --> 00:22:04,224
Slow down.

305
00:22:15,795 --> 00:22:18,339
[Pei's Mansion]

306
00:22:25,484 --> 00:22:27,404
General Su Dingfang came to see you.

307
00:22:27,404 --> 00:22:29,764
The Lord is on his way here with General Su.

308
00:22:30,524 --> 00:22:31,884
I look so sickly.

309
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:33,084
Won't it frighten my foster father?

310
00:22:33,084 --> 00:22:35,244
How could it, my Lady?
You've been recuperating for a week or so.

311
00:22:35,244 --> 00:22:36,448
You look much better.

312
00:22:40,124 --> 00:22:41,804
My lady, your foster father has arrived.

313
00:22:44,164 --> 00:22:45,484
Liuli, you've made me worry.

314
00:22:50,564 --> 00:22:51,724
It's all my fault.

315
00:22:53,284 --> 00:22:55,764
If only I hadn't
kept Shouyue confined in this camp.

316
00:22:56,684 --> 00:22:58,164
I'm afraid any of this won't happen.

317
00:22:58,724 --> 00:22:59,824
It's my fault.

318
00:22:59,824 --> 00:23:01,144
I failed to take good care of myself.

319
00:23:01,144 --> 00:23:02,604
What does it have to do with you?

320
00:23:03,484 --> 00:23:04,924
I must learn in the future

321
00:23:04,924 --> 00:23:06,164
to take good care of my own body.

322
00:23:07,044 --> 00:23:08,044
Listen to the doctor's advices.

323
00:23:08,604 --> 00:23:10,444
Do not rush to get out of bed.

324
00:23:10,964 --> 00:23:12,032
Take medication on time.

325
00:23:13,564 --> 00:23:15,424
I won't stay for long.

326
00:23:15,424 --> 00:23:16,604
Rest well.

327
00:23:17,684 --> 00:23:18,844
Shouyue and I.

328
00:23:18,844 --> 00:23:20,364
We will have a walk in the backyard.

329
00:23:21,444 --> 00:23:23,804
Shouyue,
please take good care of my foster father.

330
00:23:24,724 --> 00:23:25,824
Take a good rest.

331
00:23:44,804 --> 00:23:45,824
Shouyue.

332
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:48,884
Tell me the truth.

333
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:52,804
Is there anything else
that you want to hide from me?

334
00:23:58,404 --> 00:23:59,924
I am the foster father of Liuli.

335
00:24:01,644 --> 00:24:04,844
Her foster mother
is worried about her these days.

336
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:08,604
You can't play any tricks on us here.

337
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:11,564
This illness of hers?

338
00:24:11,564 --> 00:24:12,964
Could it severely injure her vitality?

339
00:24:17,724 --> 00:24:18,884
It's not actually due to this disease.

340
00:24:20,604 --> 00:24:22,404
The doctor said her body is too weak.

341
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,832
In terms of offspring.

342
00:24:27,444 --> 00:24:28,444
It might be a bit difficult.

343
00:24:48,844 --> 00:24:50,804
It really is fate playing tricks on us.

344
00:24:53,444 --> 00:24:55,284
Although Liuli's character is fierce.

345
00:24:56,484 --> 00:24:58,084
But she also understands reason.

346
00:25:00,644 --> 00:25:02,084
Given your background.

347
00:25:02,724 --> 00:25:04,164
it's even more different from others.

348
00:25:05,244 --> 00:25:06,744
Therefore, there are certain things

349
00:25:06,744 --> 00:25:08,044
you must remember.

350
00:25:08,684 --> 00:25:10,364
Do not let her down at all costs.

351
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:15,136
Rest assured.

352
00:25:16,004 --> 00:25:17,484
I will never let her down.

353
00:25:24,244 --> 00:25:25,444
There are three kinds of unfilial behavior.

354
00:25:26,564 --> 00:25:27,564
Having no descendants is the greatest.

355
00:25:29,324 --> 00:25:31,124
You are unwilling
to take a concubine or maidservant.

356
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:33,564
This is not wrong.

357
00:25:33,564 --> 00:25:35,644
But this is one situation, that is another.

358
00:25:36,564 --> 00:25:38,924
Have an offspring is a very vita matter.

359
00:25:47,524 --> 00:25:48,604
The Pei family has many children.

360
00:25:49,764 --> 00:25:51,324
I'm destined to have no children,

361
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:53,524
then I will adopt one.

362
00:25:53,524 --> 00:25:54,604
How can there be no descendants then?

363
00:25:55,808 --> 00:25:56,832
I won't lie to you.

364
00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:58,912
A couple of days ago.

365
00:25:59,604 --> 00:26:01,364
I have thought about it thousands of times

366
00:26:02,444 --> 00:26:03,764
as long as Liuli is safe and sound,

367
00:26:04,924 --> 00:26:06,484
I will have no other desires in this life.

368
00:26:08,084 --> 00:26:09,624
With great difficulty, she finally recovered.

369
00:26:09,624 --> 00:26:10,964
I can only be grateful.

370
00:26:11,684 --> 00:26:12,924
How dare I expect too much?

371
00:26:24,192 --> 00:26:25,312
Fine.

372
00:26:26,764 --> 00:26:28,564
Since you have made up your mind.

373
00:26:30,244 --> 00:26:32,044
I will say no more.

374
00:26:32,604 --> 00:26:33,644
Take good care of Liuli.

375
00:26:34,604 --> 00:26:36,444
I will handle the affairs of the camp.

376
00:26:37,364 --> 00:26:38,404
You don't have to worry.

377
00:26:42,164 --> 00:26:43,324
Thank you for your kindness.

378
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:08,484
The lady has been ill these days.

379
00:27:08,484 --> 00:27:09,864
You visited many times.

380
00:27:09,864 --> 00:27:11,564
And you brought so many valuable gifts.

381
00:27:12,804 --> 00:27:15,004
I thank you on my lady's behalf.

382
00:27:15,804 --> 00:27:17,244
Shouyue, where is this coming from?

383
00:27:18,724 --> 00:27:20,604
I have inquired Physician Han.

384
00:27:20,604 --> 00:27:22,844
He said although she has recovered,

385
00:27:22,844 --> 00:27:24,324
but she can't be bothered.

386
00:27:24,324 --> 00:27:25,324
She also need more rest.

387
00:27:26,164 --> 00:27:27,324
In addition to these medicines.

388
00:27:27,324 --> 00:27:29,564
I also brought some trinkets I made myself.

389
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,044
To cheer up the Lady.

390
00:27:35,616 --> 00:27:36,672
You have been thoughtful.

391
00:27:38,884 --> 00:27:41,564
However, I have a favor to ask.

392
00:27:42,564 --> 00:27:43,616
What is it?

393
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,048
Firstly.

394
00:27:47,004 --> 00:27:48,004
The lady currently

395
00:27:48,672 --> 00:27:49,728
needs to rest and recuperate.

396
00:27:50,684 --> 00:27:51,704
If there are any lapses in manners,

397
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:52,884
I hope Minister will forgive me.

398
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:55,328
Secondly.

399
00:27:56,684 --> 00:27:59,404
There are some words I don't want her to hear.

400
00:28:07,764 --> 00:28:08,800
You can count on me.

401
00:28:10,848 --> 00:28:11,904
This time.

402
00:28:13,284 --> 00:28:14,604
I have failed in my trust.

403
00:28:15,284 --> 00:28:16,804
Even if the Lady didn't blame me.

404
00:28:16,804 --> 00:28:18,524
I am indeed a little uneasy.

405
00:28:19,284 --> 00:28:21,184
The officials and their families in Xizhou.

406
00:28:21,184 --> 00:28:23,964
I will also have my father's concubine
relay the message.

407
00:28:23,964 --> 00:28:25,684
Tell them not to meddle any more.

408
00:28:26,924 --> 00:28:28,000
Thank you for your understanding.

409
00:28:46,564 --> 00:28:48,404
Physician Han, thank you
for personally preparing the medicine.

410
00:28:48,404 --> 00:28:49,804
Actually,
about the matter of preparing the medicine.

411
00:28:49,804 --> 00:28:52,744
You could leave it to Ni
or other servants in the Pei's Mansion.

412
00:28:52,744 --> 00:28:54,044
No problem, it's my duty.

413
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:02,464
Then, I shall take my leave.

414
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,488
Hey.

415
00:29:14,244 --> 00:29:16,244
This is the medicine
that I specifically prepared for you.

416
00:29:16,924 --> 00:29:18,524
It's especially suited to your constitution.

417
00:29:19,564 --> 00:29:20,844
The temperature is just right now.

418
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:21,920
You should drink it quickly.

419
00:29:23,164 --> 00:29:24,604
I'm very fit and strong.

420
00:29:24,604 --> 00:29:25,604
Instead, it's you.

421
00:29:25,604 --> 00:29:27,784
Who is diagnosing and preparing medicine
for the Lady every day.

422
00:29:27,784 --> 00:29:29,224
You work very hard.

423
00:29:29,224 --> 00:29:30,724
Don't go out of your way
to prepare medicine for me anymore.

424
00:29:32,044 --> 00:29:33,844
Recently, the Lady fell ill,
you've been taking care of her all the time.

425
00:29:34,364 --> 00:29:36,128
You're very weak,
you must take care to recuperate.

426
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:39,084
I am a physican. You must listen to me.

427
00:29:43,924 --> 00:29:45,284
Alright, I'll listen to you.

428
00:29:59,124 --> 00:30:00,684
I just don't want you to overwork yourself.

429
00:30:01,568 --> 00:30:02,592
It's not hard.

430
00:30:03,924 --> 00:30:04,984
I would do anything for you.

431
00:30:04,984 --> 00:30:06,124
And I won't feel tired.

432
00:30:19,072 --> 00:30:20,160
Physician Han.

433
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,696
Senior Official.

434
00:30:22,204 --> 00:30:23,484
How is the lady's pulse today?

435
00:30:24,244 --> 00:30:26,164
The lady's pulse has improved.

436
00:30:26,164 --> 00:30:27,964
A new prescription has been given today.

437
00:30:27,964 --> 00:30:29,924
In the future, the focus will be
on replenishing energy and maintaining health.

438
00:30:30,688 --> 00:30:32,444
The weather is about to warm up soon.

439
00:30:32,444 --> 00:30:33,684
Regarding the Lady's condition,

440
00:30:33,684 --> 00:30:35,224
it should be no different from previous years.

441
00:30:35,224 --> 00:30:37,324
She just needs to take good care of herself.

442
00:30:38,284 --> 00:30:40,044
I will be relying on Physician Han's assistance
more in the future.

443
00:30:40,044 --> 00:30:41,120
You are too kind.

444
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,784
Senior Official, I shall go back to pharmacy
to write prescriptions.

445
00:30:43,784 --> 00:30:44,960
I will take my leave now.

446
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,016
Please do.

447
00:31:03,004 --> 00:31:04,032
Brother-in-law is here.

448
00:31:18,724 --> 00:31:21,244
What's the good news?
You seemed so happy just now.

449
00:31:21,244 --> 00:31:22,368
Take a guess.

450
00:31:24,964 --> 00:31:27,044
Is Physician Han said
you've made a great recovery?

451
00:31:27,044 --> 00:31:29,084
No need to take those bitter medicines anymore?

452
00:31:29,084 --> 00:31:30,564
What are you talking about?

453
00:31:30,564 --> 00:31:32,704
I only changed medicine.

454
00:31:32,704 --> 00:31:34,924
Don't know when I will stop taking them.

455
00:31:36,924 --> 00:31:38,004
When will you stop taking it,

456
00:31:38,844 --> 00:31:39,884
I will feed you till then.

457
00:31:42,804 --> 00:31:44,324
Don't you need to go to the camp?

458
00:31:44,324 --> 00:31:45,764
Yesterday, my foster father came.

459
00:31:45,764 --> 00:31:46,964
Did he say anything?

460
00:31:47,844 --> 00:31:49,604
If you're not well, I won't go anywhere.

461
00:31:50,764 --> 00:31:53,044
My mentor has spoken,
telling me not to worry about that place.

462
00:31:53,564 --> 00:31:54,656
First, I'll take good care of you.

463
00:31:58,528 --> 00:31:59,564
You haven't told me yet.

464
00:32:00,164 --> 00:32:01,244
What were you just laughing about?

465
00:32:02,324 --> 00:32:03,424
Take another guess.

466
00:32:08,164 --> 00:32:09,564
There are times when even you can't guess, huh?

467
00:32:11,524 --> 00:32:14,284
Ni wants to learn the art
of acupuncture from Physician Han.

468
00:32:14,844 --> 00:32:16,424
Physician Han has already agreed.

469
00:32:16,424 --> 00:32:19,284
Maybe there will be a great female doctor
in our home.

470
00:32:20,884 --> 00:32:22,644
Han Si actually agreed to teach?

471
00:32:24,244 --> 00:32:25,424
Why have I heard,

472
00:32:25,424 --> 00:32:26,644
this technique of acupuncture

473
00:32:27,204 --> 00:32:28,524
Is a closely guarded secret
of the medical family?

474
00:32:29,244 --> 00:32:31,404
Exactly. I was shocked too.

475
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,544
At first, Han Si was not agreeable.

476
00:32:34,544 --> 00:32:36,164
But upon my sister's urging.

477
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:38,304
Han Si immediately softened and agreed.

478
00:32:38,304 --> 00:32:40,004
You haven't seen Han Si's face.

479
00:32:40,004 --> 00:32:41,784
It's like a cooked shrimp.

480
00:32:41,784 --> 00:32:42,804
So, it seems that.

481
00:32:43,324 --> 00:32:44,924
In the future when we see Physician Han.

482
00:32:44,924 --> 00:32:46,324
We have to call him Brother-in-law.

483
00:32:48,364 --> 00:32:49,444
Speaking about this matter.

484
00:32:49,964 --> 00:32:51,724
I do want to ask you for something.

485
00:32:52,324 --> 00:32:54,444
What is it that you have to ask me for?

486
00:32:55,884 --> 00:32:57,864
Haven't you made Cheng a civilian.

487
00:32:57,864 --> 00:32:59,564
I want to take this opportunity

488
00:32:59,564 --> 00:33:01,904
to make Tan and Ni civilians.

489
00:33:01,904 --> 00:33:02,924
You must not refuse.

490
00:33:05,088 --> 00:33:06,124
As long as you are happy.

491
00:33:07,044 --> 00:33:09,164
It doesn't really matter, even if

492
00:33:09,164 --> 00:33:10,336
we set free all the servants in this household.

493
00:33:11,724 --> 00:33:12,804
It's just that there's no rush for this matter.

494
00:33:13,724 --> 00:33:15,424
Wait until we find suitable people
to serve you.

495
00:33:15,424 --> 00:33:17,024
Then set them free, is that alright?

496
00:33:17,024 --> 00:33:18,624
I have already asked them.

497
00:33:18,624 --> 00:33:20,284
They all want to stay.

498
00:33:20,284 --> 00:33:21,644
I have thought about it too.

499
00:33:21,644 --> 00:33:23,184
As long as they are willing to stay here,

500
00:33:23,184 --> 00:33:25,404
I will be paying them wages in the future.

501
00:33:25,404 --> 00:33:27,204
If they want to leave,

502
00:33:27,204 --> 00:33:29,084
we can always pick someone else.

503
00:33:29,084 --> 00:33:32,364
I never quite liked
having a crowd around me at all times.

504
00:33:34,284 --> 00:33:35,524
You can take charge of this matter.

505
00:33:36,684 --> 00:33:37,844
It's just that our house

506
00:33:37,844 --> 00:33:39,044
There are two few of people.

507
00:33:39,764 --> 00:33:41,544
In a few days, when I have time.

508
00:33:41,544 --> 00:33:42,844
I will pick a few more people.

509
00:33:42,844 --> 00:33:44,124
So you can save some trouble as well.

510
00:33:44,764 --> 00:33:46,424
There are just the two of us in this courtyard.

511
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:48,004
What do we need that many people for?

512
00:33:50,004 --> 00:33:53,244
Speaking of which, Ni did it for me.

513
00:33:53,244 --> 00:33:55,324
That's why she thought
of learning this acupuncture technique.

514
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,424
It's all my fault.

515
00:34:01,444 --> 00:34:03,824
That day, I tried to emulate
Physician Han's technique,

516
00:34:03,824 --> 00:34:05,044
and gave you a session of moxibustion.

517
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,784
But I was still somewhat unskilled,

518
00:34:07,784 --> 00:34:09,884
and left a few red marks on your back,

519
00:34:10,484 --> 00:34:12,924
as well as three blisters near your navel,

520
00:34:13,764 --> 00:34:15,124
which started to heal these couple days.

521
00:34:15,884 --> 00:34:17,144
Ni must be thinking

522
00:34:17,144 --> 00:34:18,804
that you will need long-term treatment.

523
00:34:18,804 --> 00:34:20,284
So the acupuncture technique is needed.

524
00:34:20,964 --> 00:34:22,604
That's why she wanted to learn.

525
00:34:26,124 --> 00:34:28,524
Actually, it doesn't hurt much.

526
00:34:29,324 --> 00:34:30,404
It's just, that day,

527
00:34:31,124 --> 00:34:32,324
it was hard on you.

528
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:34,784
Liuli.

529
00:34:35,644 --> 00:34:36,804
I don't mind Physician Han.

530
00:34:37,484 --> 00:34:38,560
It's just that...

531
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:42,240
Just what?

532
00:34:52,484 --> 00:34:55,084
Firstly, Physician Han
is stubborn and straightforward.

533
00:34:55,764 --> 00:34:58,004
Looking at him,
he became flustered before even starting.

534
00:34:58,604 --> 00:35:01,284
Therefore, it's better if I take action myself
for a more stable outcome.

535
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,096
Secondly.

536
00:35:04,804 --> 00:35:06,164
You are so shy usually.

537
00:35:06,924 --> 00:35:08,684
You don't let others help you
with dressing or bathing.

538
00:35:09,484 --> 00:35:11,204
And then, moxibustion is not
as simple as using needles.

539
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,824
I observe Physician Han's technique.

540
00:35:14,824 --> 00:35:15,964
It is not that complicated.

541
00:35:16,524 --> 00:35:17,924
I roughly recognize those acupuncture points.

542
00:35:18,644 --> 00:35:20,764
So, I gave it a try.

543
00:35:22,004 --> 00:35:24,244
Unexpectedly, I still failed.

544
00:35:29,084 --> 00:35:32,204
I originally thought he was unwilling
to let others did it.

545
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:36,964
It turns out he was considerate
of my embarrassment upon waking up.

546
00:35:38,528 --> 00:35:39,604
Now it's all right.

547
00:35:40,164 --> 00:35:41,864
Ni will learn acupuncture.

548
00:35:41,864 --> 00:35:43,204
- It will be good for the future
- No.

549
00:35:45,924 --> 00:35:47,084
Even if Ni has mastered it,

550
00:35:47,644 --> 00:35:48,844
she will leave sooner or later.

551
00:35:50,284 --> 00:35:52,524
I will pay a visit another day.

552
00:35:52,524 --> 00:35:55,084
I will learn acupuncture from Physician Han.

553
00:35:55,724 --> 00:35:57,604
You are so busy with official duties every day.

554
00:35:57,604 --> 00:35:58,724
Where would you find the time?

555
00:35:59,284 --> 00:36:00,344
In my opinion,

556
00:36:00,344 --> 00:36:01,440
Ni

557
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:24,000
[Three months later]

558
00:36:52,564 --> 00:36:54,524
I heard from Tan that you want to go out again.

559
00:36:57,684 --> 00:36:59,324
Be good and take care of yourself.

560
00:37:00,724 --> 00:37:01,964
Shall I read you a story? Would you like that?

561
00:37:15,764 --> 00:37:17,924
How come there is a clearance document
in this book?

562
00:37:21,044 --> 00:37:23,204
Take a look, when was this issued?

563
00:37:25,004 --> 00:37:26,364
It was issued some days ago.

564
00:37:29,084 --> 00:37:30,364
How did it get wrapped up inside the book?

565
00:37:33,204 --> 00:37:34,764
Could it be from Sister An?

566
00:37:36,404 --> 00:37:38,124
Clearance document is especially troublesome
to have a replacement.

567
00:37:38,124 --> 00:37:39,804
Better find someone
to send it back to her quickly.

568
00:37:40,484 --> 00:37:41,600
Take another look.

569
00:37:48,084 --> 00:37:49,244
This paper isn't right.

570
00:37:51,244 --> 00:37:52,444
Starting from last summer.

571
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:54,064
For the clearance documents of Xizhou,

572
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:55,284
they don't use yellow hemp paper.

573
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,856
This...

574
00:38:01,604 --> 00:38:03,924
Senior Official Pei sure has a discerning eye.

575
00:38:03,924 --> 00:38:06,084
This clearance document
was drawn by this young lady.

576
00:38:06,604 --> 00:38:07,744
Without this item.

577
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:09,444
How could sister possibly
go to the military barracks?

578
00:38:10,364 --> 00:38:12,284
It's only after finishing that I remembered

579
00:38:12,284 --> 00:38:14,804
the official document paper in Xizhou
has now been changed.

580
00:38:14,804 --> 00:38:16,104
I have to make a new one.

581
00:38:16,104 --> 00:38:19,324
This one was likely
slipped into this book casually.

582
00:38:22,084 --> 00:38:23,204
How did I not think of that?

583
00:38:26,524 --> 00:38:27,924
This was supposed to be safe.

584
00:38:27,924 --> 00:38:29,724
But you're quite bold, aren't you?

585
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,324
These official documents

586
00:38:31,324 --> 00:38:32,624
how could you do these?

587
00:38:32,624 --> 00:38:34,844
If outsiders get to know about this,
it'll be a disaster.

588
00:38:40,064 --> 00:38:41,084
Do not do it again.

589
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,144
This clearance document.

590
00:38:43,144 --> 00:38:44,484
From Xizhou to the military camp.

591
00:38:44,484 --> 00:38:45,604
You need to stamp a dozen seals.

592
00:38:46,604 --> 00:38:48,164
If it is detected at any place,

593
00:38:48,164 --> 00:38:50,084
it would be a major event
that would alarm the surroundings.

594
00:38:50,084 --> 00:38:52,284
By then, it would be impossible
for your sister to get away.

595
00:38:52,284 --> 00:38:53,644
And both of us will be in trouble.

596
00:38:54,484 --> 00:38:56,844
If even you can't tell, who else could?

597
00:38:58,684 --> 00:39:01,604
However, I saw that
when you passed through cities

598
00:39:01,604 --> 00:39:03,324
you just need to show a Zhuyu coin.

599
00:39:03,324 --> 00:39:04,448
What is that then?

600
00:39:05,324 --> 00:39:06,464
That's a token of passage.

601
00:39:07,204 --> 00:39:08,724
Officials rely on it

602
00:39:09,324 --> 00:39:10,584
and their appointment credentials

603
00:39:10,584 --> 00:39:12,724
to enter through city gates
and stay at post stations.

604
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,284
When the mounted messenger
is delivering military intelligence.

605
00:39:15,284 --> 00:39:17,284
It is also thanks to it that
they can exchange horses along the way.

606
00:39:18,244 --> 00:39:20,544
This clearance document is
too troublesome after all.

607
00:39:20,544 --> 00:39:22,284
You need the seal of approval.

608
00:39:22,284 --> 00:39:23,684
And you cannot use the post horses.

609
00:39:23,684 --> 00:39:25,004
When I have some time,

610
00:39:25,004 --> 00:39:26,644
It would be better if I made a token.

611
00:39:27,604 --> 00:39:28,644
You have already made a clearance document.

612
00:39:29,244 --> 00:39:30,244
And now you have to make a token of passage.

613
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:32,192
What else do you want to make?

614
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:36,404
Don't tell me, you're thinking of
making military tokens and official papers?

615
00:39:36,404 --> 00:39:37,484
To mobilize armies.

616
00:39:38,644 --> 00:39:40,344
Why would I mobilize armies?

617
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,924
Besides, once this token is used, it's used.

618
00:39:42,924 --> 00:39:44,124
No one will investigate.

619
00:39:44,124 --> 00:39:45,604
But after the military token is used.

620
00:39:45,604 --> 00:39:47,384
Someone will indeed check.

621
00:39:47,384 --> 00:39:48,764
If I make that object,

622
00:39:48,764 --> 00:39:49,964
that will be asking for trouble.

623
00:39:52,524 --> 00:39:53,764
Besides, I was just joking.

624
00:39:53,764 --> 00:39:55,024
You actually took it seriously?

625
00:39:55,024 --> 00:39:57,544
That Zhuyu is made of copper, not a document.

626
00:39:57,544 --> 00:39:59,764
No matter how capable I am,
how could I produce it?

627
00:40:01,284 --> 00:40:03,964
I'm afraid we have to find Qu Chongyu
for this matter.

628
00:40:03,964 --> 00:40:06,324
But I wonder if he is bold enough.

629
00:40:06,324 --> 00:40:07,804
If he is tight-lipped enough.

630
00:40:08,924 --> 00:40:10,484
I heard that he feels very guilty this time.

631
00:40:11,164 --> 00:40:13,604
Perhaps a way can be found to persuade him.

632
00:40:15,284 --> 00:40:16,324
It seems I was overthinking it.

633
00:40:17,284 --> 00:40:18,644
There are indeed some people in Xizhou.

634
00:40:18,644 --> 00:40:20,504
Those who seek your help and also owe you.

635
00:40:20,504 --> 00:40:22,104
But surely no one is like you.

636
00:40:22,104 --> 00:40:23,124
Unaware of the state laws.

637
00:40:23,124 --> 00:40:25,044
Willing to cause troubles by
helping you make the tokens of passage.

638
00:40:38,964 --> 00:40:40,764
Isn't this from

639
00:40:40,764 --> 00:40:43,324
the pacification ambassador appointed
by His Majesty recently, Ashina Buzhen?

640
00:40:43,324 --> 00:40:45,044
He gave this to you as a gift.

641
00:40:45,044 --> 00:40:46,244
You've been looking at it for a while.

642
00:40:46,244 --> 00:40:47,964
Is there something inappropriate?

643
00:40:47,964 --> 00:40:49,204
Nothing inappropriate.

644
00:40:50,844 --> 00:40:52,924
Junmeng, you take this wine
to Senior Official Pei.

645
00:40:53,444 --> 00:40:54,524
He is a man who knows wine.

646
00:40:55,204 --> 00:40:56,764
He should be able
to taste the quality of the wine.

647
00:40:57,964 --> 00:40:59,040
Send to...

648
00:40:59,564 --> 00:41:00,644
Senior Official Pei?

649
00:41:01,564 --> 00:41:03,364
Both you and I have been far away
from our hometowns.

650
00:41:03,884 --> 00:41:05,124
We've lived under others' roofs.

651
00:41:05,124 --> 00:41:07,744
We should understand the pain of homesickness.

652
00:41:07,744 --> 00:41:08,768
I think,

653
00:41:09,404 --> 00:41:11,284
this wine should help him
with his homesickness.

654
00:41:12,128 --> 00:41:13,152
I understand.

655
00:41:13,844 --> 00:41:16,044
You plan to use the wine from Yunyi's hometown

656
00:41:16,044 --> 00:41:17,784
to ease Senior Official Pei's
homesickness, right?

657
00:41:17,784 --> 00:41:19,864
Don't you have something better to do?

658
00:41:19,864 --> 00:41:21,004
Go to supervise the work.

659
00:41:21,568 --> 00:41:22,604
Also

660
00:41:22,604 --> 00:41:25,024
It seems that you became very happy
after Lady Jing left.

661
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,404
Nonsense, I'm worried,
I'm in a state of lovesickness

662
00:41:36,896 --> 00:41:41,284
[Pei's Mansion]

663
00:41:41,284 --> 00:41:42,464
Be careful, my Lady.

664
00:41:44,224 --> 00:41:45,264
My Lady.

665
00:41:45,264 --> 00:41:48,324
We come to visit Madam Kudi every now and then.

666
00:41:48,324 --> 00:41:49,984
But they do not appreciate it.

667
00:41:49,984 --> 00:41:52,524
Always making an excuse of her illness
and refuses to meet.

668
00:41:53,204 --> 00:41:55,524
Why does my Lady still insist on coming?

669
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,696
You do not understand.

670
00:41:58,324 --> 00:42:00,484
Senior Official Pei has won the hearts
of the people in Xizhou.

671
00:42:01,164 --> 00:42:02,884
His mentor is General Su Dingfang.

672
00:42:02,884 --> 00:42:05,204
Now, he has been appointed by His Majesty
as the Chief Administrator of Yili route.

673
00:42:05,844 --> 00:42:07,004
Now, Xizhou

674
00:42:07,004 --> 00:42:08,604
is now under their rules.

675
00:42:09,484 --> 00:42:11,084
I often visit Madam Kudi.

676
00:42:11,084 --> 00:42:12,124
That is a show of knowing the situation.

677
00:42:12,644 --> 00:42:15,304
Whether she meets me or not, it doesn't matter.

678
00:42:15,304 --> 00:42:17,664
Anyway,
I've made sure to show enough concern for her.

679
00:42:17,664 --> 00:42:19,084
My lady is wise.

680
00:42:25,244 --> 00:42:26,564
Greetings, Lady Zhang.

681
00:42:26,564 --> 00:42:28,204
I see Prefect Wang
has also come to Senior Official's Residence.

682
00:42:28,204 --> 00:42:29,304
What a coincidence.

683
00:42:29,304 --> 00:42:31,564
I wonder if Minister has any orders.

684
00:42:31,564 --> 00:42:34,364
The Minister sent me to deliver wine
to Senior Official.

685
00:42:34,364 --> 00:42:37,204
Look at the exquisitely carved flowers
on this wine flask.

686
00:42:37,204 --> 00:42:39,724
This should be a wine utensil
of the nobility in the north.

687
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:42,444
Could this wine be from the north?

688
00:42:45,811 --> 00:42:50,367
♫ I write my longing for you in Spring ♫

689
00:42:52,447 --> 00:42:56,895

♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫

721
00:45:19,391 --> 00:45:22,830
♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫

722
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:25,791
♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫

723
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:29,614
♫ Winter comes again, and flowers wither ♫

724
00:45:29,614 --> 00:45:32,462
♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫

725
00:45:32,462 --> 00:45:35,839
♫ I look outside, like the poems asking ♫

726
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:41,390
♫ My love, have you
found someone good for you ♫
