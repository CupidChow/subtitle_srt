<i>[Episode 14]</i>

3
00:01:36,695 --> 00:01:39,095
Each scripture must have over 3000 characters,

4
00:01:39,095 --> 00:01:40,995
It will take a month's time to transcribe,

5
00:01:40,995 --> 00:01:43,015
At least twenty people are needed for the job,

6
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:52,775
Please take your time as you go,

7
00:01:52,775 --> 00:01:53,995
What do I have to hide from you?

8
00:01:53,995 --> 00:01:56,295
Then why don't you tell me when you have ideas?

9
00:01:57,215 --> 00:01:58,255
You'll know when the time comes,

10
00:01:59,135 --> 00:02:00,635
Mr, Pei and Lady Kudi,

11
00:02:00,635 --> 00:02:02,495
you two have time
to come to the market again today, huh?

12
00:02:06,815 --> 00:02:10,535
Shouyue, I just need to ask the shopkeeper
about something, Wait for me,

13
00:02:10,535 --> 00:02:13,495
Everything has been prepared for you,
Please, this way,

14
00:02:13,495 --> 00:02:16,115
Do you have any fabric printing boards
in the shop today, shopkeeper?

15
00:02:16,115 --> 00:02:18,555
Yes, yes, right this way,

16
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,735
- I'll take you to have a look
- Alright

17
00:02:19,735 --> 00:02:21,815
<i>[Gaochang City]</i>

18
00:02:21,815 --> 00:02:23,295
Sanniang,

19
00:02:23,295 --> 00:02:25,135
The Protector-General's Mansion has decided
to cut expenditures,

20
00:02:25,135 --> 00:02:27,615
and it has been decided to stop
using Yizhou's yellow hemp paper,

21
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:29,255
Instead, local coarse hemp paper will be used,

22
00:02:30,255 --> 00:02:31,335
We can no longer buy

23
00:02:31,895 --> 00:02:33,895
these carts of goods of yours,

24
00:02:34,615 --> 00:02:35,655
We are truly sorry,

25
00:02:37,215 --> 00:02:40,075
Although this was conceived by the Chancellor,
I am still to blame,

26
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:41,655
I forgot about this cart of goods,

27
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,895
You should still discuss it
with the Chancellor,

28
00:02:44,495 --> 00:02:46,115
If a remedy can be found,

29
00:02:46,115 --> 00:02:47,935
I will surely do my utmost,

30
00:02:48,495 --> 00:02:50,048
The Chancellor is here,

31
00:02:52,575 --> 00:02:54,295
Minister, sister,

32
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:04,855
Sister,
why didn't you tell me about this before?

33
00:03:09,735 --> 00:03:10,935
Let it be,

34
00:03:10,935 --> 00:03:13,675
Let's put these hemp papers
first in the government office,

35
00:03:13,675 --> 00:03:16,335
I'll talk to my father about it

36
00:03:16,335 --> 00:03:18,335
and consult with those colleagues,

37
00:03:18,335 --> 00:03:20,575
I will definitely find a proper solution,

38
00:03:22,055 --> 00:03:24,935
But if it really can't be solved,

39
00:03:28,455 --> 00:03:31,615
I will ask my father to take back the order,

40
00:03:32,575 --> 00:03:34,295
Thank you for your consideration, Minister,

41
00:03:34,295 --> 00:03:36,735
But if the orders change right away,

42
00:03:37,255 --> 00:03:40,155
I'm afraid it'll affect the reputation
of the Protector-General and Minister,

43
00:03:40,155 --> 00:03:42,455
I don't want to neglect public affairs
for personal reasons either,

44
00:03:43,415 --> 00:03:46,775
Let's move all these papers into my yard,

45
00:03:47,775 --> 00:03:51,415
I'll definitely take responsibility for this
because it arises from me, Sister,

46
00:03:51,935 --> 00:03:53,455
Don't worry, Sister,

47
00:03:53,975 --> 00:03:56,695
No need to worry,
These stacks of paper don't worth much,

48
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:57,935
I will handle it myself,

49
00:03:58,935 --> 00:04:02,015
May I ask why you're making it so hard
on yourself?

50
00:04:02,735 --> 00:04:04,975
All the paper must be worth 200,000 coins
at least,

51
00:04:05,895 --> 00:04:08,175
Shouyue, it may cost you years' salary
to keep your promise,

52
00:04:09,295 --> 00:04:11,895
We're colleagues after all,

53
00:04:12,495 --> 00:04:15,095
What's wrong with giving up some face
at this point?

54
00:04:15,615 --> 00:04:16,975
Thank you for your kindness, Minister,

55
00:04:26,895 --> 00:04:29,495
We will take our leave first,

56
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:35,035
Cao, tell them to take all these papers
to the Pei Mansion,

57
00:04:35,035 --> 00:04:37,055
Alright, Sanniang,

58
00:04:37,055 --> 00:04:39,095
You guys, Move all these things
to the Pei Mansion,

59
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:49,015
<i>He actually has quite a bit of backbone
at this crucial moment,</i>

60
00:04:53,695 --> 00:04:56,015
Come on, slow down,

61
00:04:56,015 --> 00:04:57,344
Let go,

62
00:05:00,455 --> 00:05:01,920
Good,

63
00:05:04,255 --> 00:05:06,175
Sister, rest assured,

64
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:09,455
The usage paper has already been decided
by Liuli and I,

65
00:05:10,215 --> 00:05:13,635
It's just not ready for others to know
until it's finished,

66
00:05:13,635 --> 00:05:15,755
However, it made you worried all the way,

67
00:05:15,755 --> 00:05:16,975
It's all my fault,

68
00:05:17,855 --> 00:05:19,552
Just as expected,

69
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,584
Please follow me,

70
00:05:41,895 --> 00:05:43,895
Liuli, look who's here,

71
00:05:45,015 --> 00:05:46,215
Sister, you've had a hard journey,

72
00:05:46,975 --> 00:05:48,775
This time, it has finally been a success,

73
00:05:48,775 --> 00:05:51,775
The engraved boards will be complete
in a few days,

74
00:05:58,855 --> 00:06:01,215
This piece I'm working on will be finished
the day after tomorrow at the latest,

75
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,975
This piece I'm working on will be finished
by tomorrow,

76
00:06:03,935 --> 00:06:05,135
Indeed, it was successful,

77
00:06:05,135 --> 00:06:06,815
This time it was done better than the last,

78
00:06:11,095 --> 00:06:12,335
How was this written?

79
00:06:12,895 --> 00:06:14,535
How can it be written
so neatly and beautifully?

80
00:06:18,855 --> 00:06:20,055
It was written by it,

81
00:06:22,655 --> 00:06:24,735
The words, of course, were written by Shouyue,

82
00:06:24,735 --> 00:06:26,935
He first writes words on special thin paper
where grid lines are marked on

83
00:06:26,935 --> 00:06:28,775
from the fabric printing store,

84
00:06:28,775 --> 00:06:30,895
Next, he pastes the paper on wooden boards,

85
00:06:30,895 --> 00:06:34,215
The carver then carves the lines following
the word outlines visible through the paper,

86
00:06:34,815 --> 00:06:38,055
The engraver gradually removes the part of
the wood board outside the carved lines,

87
00:06:38,055 --> 00:06:40,135
This is how an engraved board
for printing is made,

88
00:06:46,415 --> 00:06:49,255
How did you come up with this?

89
00:06:49,975 --> 00:06:51,375
Of course, I didn't think of this myself,

90
00:06:52,015 --> 00:06:53,015
It's all Liuli's idea,

91
00:06:54,655 --> 00:06:56,975
That day,
Liuli and I came out of the paper shop…

92
00:07:10,415 --> 00:07:11,655
Shouyue, look at this,

93
00:07:18,495 --> 00:07:20,735
What is the mystery in this engraved board?

94
00:07:21,615 --> 00:07:23,795
Forgive my stupidity, I really can't see it,

95
00:07:23,795 --> 00:07:24,855
You're messing with me,

96
00:07:27,175 --> 00:07:30,955
I was thinking, since this engraved board
can have intricate patterns,

97
00:07:30,955 --> 00:07:32,895
it must be able to carve characters as well,

98
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:37,235
If this method is feasible works,

99
00:07:37,235 --> 00:07:39,815
we also don't need to rush to sell it
elsewhere,

100
00:07:39,815 --> 00:07:41,315
Why not print Buddhist scriptures directly?

101
00:07:41,315 --> 00:07:43,495
The Buddhist scriptures can be sold
all year round and everywhere,

102
00:07:44,095 --> 00:07:46,415
Of course, it's not cost-effective
if you only made one or two copies,

103
00:07:46,935 --> 00:07:49,895
However,
if you print hundreds or thousands of copies…

104
00:07:49,895 --> 00:07:51,375
My dear Liuli,

105
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,135
You are indeed the most intelligent woman
in the world,

106
00:07:58,495 --> 00:08:00,575
I, Pei Xingjian, am fortunate
to marry such a virtuous wife,

107
00:08:00,575 --> 00:08:02,208
My lady,

108
00:08:08,015 --> 00:08:09,295
Anyway, I have my uncle to thank to

109
00:08:09,295 --> 00:08:12,215
for opening the fabric printing store
in Xizhou,

110
00:08:12,215 --> 00:08:13,695
Therefore, it occurred to me that

111
00:08:13,695 --> 00:08:17,115
Since the wood used for fabric printing
can be carved into such complex patterns,

112
00:08:17,115 --> 00:08:19,175
it probably can also be used
for engraving words,

113
00:08:19,175 --> 00:08:22,255
Surprisingly, after a few attempts,
it actually worked,

114
00:08:23,055 --> 00:08:26,135
Now, all four engravers
from the fabric printing store are here,

115
00:08:26,135 --> 00:08:28,495
The shopkeeper even helped me find
seven or eight more craftsmen

116
00:08:28,495 --> 00:08:31,635
who used to carve furniture and pottery,

117
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:33,455
Otherwise, how could it be so fast,

118
00:08:35,135 --> 00:08:36,135
In that case,

119
00:08:36,655 --> 00:08:38,295
I will find a few more reliable people
to come over,

120
00:08:38,855 --> 00:08:41,215
Since the first engraved board
has been made today,

121
00:08:41,815 --> 00:08:43,295
we can then proceed
with printing the scriptures,

122
00:08:44,695 --> 00:08:46,495
we'll start by printing 2,600 copies,

123
00:08:47,495 --> 00:08:49,035
Leave the selling part to me,

124
00:08:49,035 --> 00:08:52,375
After the Buddhist scriptures are sold,
we'll split the profit in half,

125
00:08:52,895 --> 00:08:55,595
No need for that, it isn't worth much anyway,

126
00:08:55,595 --> 00:08:58,415
Moreover, we can't compete with the people
for profit by doing this,

127
00:08:58,415 --> 00:08:59,855
Jiulang, you are mistaken,

128
00:09:00,575 --> 00:09:02,715
In business, fairness is all that matters,

129
00:09:02,715 --> 00:09:05,335
I just found us some helpers and storefronts,

130
00:09:06,135 --> 00:09:08,275
This Buddhist scripture was copied by you,
Jiulang,

131
00:09:08,275 --> 00:09:10,095
The idea of engraved boards came from Liuli,

132
00:09:10,095 --> 00:09:11,775
How can I take advantage of the two of you?

133
00:09:11,775 --> 00:09:13,655
But all the paper was provided by you, sister,

134
00:09:13,655 --> 00:09:15,855
and you're to sell all the Buddhist scriptures,

135
00:09:16,415 --> 00:09:19,735
Are you being so modest
because of status's Shouyue?

136
00:09:20,255 --> 00:09:22,135
How about this? Once they're sold out,

137
00:09:22,135 --> 00:09:23,455
you just give us a thirty percent share
of the profit,

138
00:09:24,015 --> 00:09:25,315
If you're not even willing to do this,

139
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,415
then I will have no choice
but to ask the uncles in the clan to do this,

140
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:30,175
Well, all right then,

141
00:09:30,175 --> 00:09:32,495
Then Liuli and Jiulang will take one-third
of the profit,

142
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:35,055
I'll keep your kindness

143
00:09:35,055 --> 00:09:36,095
in my heart,

144
00:09:37,655 --> 00:09:39,655
There's one more thing I'd like to ask you,
sister,

145
00:09:39,655 --> 00:09:40,655
What's the matter?

146
00:09:40,655 --> 00:09:42,075
If you want to print this Buddhist scriptures,

147
00:09:42,075 --> 00:09:44,595
I'm afraid this yard is still too small,

148
00:09:44,595 --> 00:09:47,295
It would be better
to switch to a more spacious place,

149
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,975
Furthermore,
this whole engraving boards to print scriptures

150
00:09:49,975 --> 00:09:51,455
is all your idea, sister,

151
00:09:51,455 --> 00:09:53,775
From now on,
Shouyue and I will no longer be involved,

152
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,195
Why is that?

153
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,975
I don't want the responsibility of course,

154
00:10:03,415 --> 00:10:05,615
Sister,
please take a look at the scripture first,

155
00:10:06,455 --> 00:10:08,295
Liuli and I will be back in a moment,

156
00:10:17,615 --> 00:10:18,875
What are you doing?

157
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,615
I haven't made everything clear with her,

158
00:10:20,615 --> 00:10:21,855
It won't be too late to talk about it
in a while,

159
00:10:43,735 --> 00:10:44,736
Please sit down quickly,

160
00:10:51,615 --> 00:10:53,755
Oh, I forgot to tell her,

161
00:10:53,755 --> 00:10:55,275
I've been testing ink these days,

162
00:10:55,275 --> 00:10:57,175
I found that pine soot ink
is the most convenient to use,

163
00:10:57,175 --> 00:10:58,935
Other inks won't give the same results,

164
00:11:01,815 --> 00:11:03,495
It's not too late to go after you clean it up,

165
00:11:04,215 --> 00:11:05,815
Now that our sister has arrived,

166
00:11:05,815 --> 00:11:07,215
You've already done everything you can,

167
00:11:08,175 --> 00:11:09,215
You need to have a good rest,

168
00:11:09,855 --> 00:11:12,815
Look, you've got dark circles under your eyes,

169
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,015
Who knew it would be so troublesome,

170
00:11:17,175 --> 00:11:21,895
Liuli, do we really have to
share the profits with our sister?

171
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,595
Of course, we should collect,

172
00:11:23,595 --> 00:11:25,215
Otherwise,
even if you you're at peace with yourself,

173
00:11:25,215 --> 00:11:27,015
how could she be at peace with herself?

174
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,495
Since you like it, then go ahead and do it,

175
00:11:33,415 --> 00:11:35,215
Just like you've just reminded her,

176
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:37,935
it's best to kept things from the outsiders

177
00:11:37,935 --> 00:11:38,935
from knowing this is your idea,

178
00:11:39,935 --> 00:11:41,895
If you ever find any problems,
make sure to tell me,

179
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,295
Furthermore, don't tire yourself out too much,

180
00:11:45,895 --> 00:11:48,595
Once you work, you forget everything else,
and nobody can stop you,

181
00:11:48,595 --> 00:11:50,135
You must not be like that in the future,

182
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,455
Can you promise me?

183
00:11:52,455 --> 00:11:54,144
Okay,

184
00:11:54,775 --> 00:11:55,935
Since you have promised me,

185
00:11:56,655 --> 00:11:58,055
if you forget about it,

186
00:11:58,055 --> 00:11:59,455
then I'll have to punish you,

187
00:11:59,455 --> 00:12:00,835
How will you punish me?

188
00:12:00,835 --> 00:12:02,455
Rather than letting my wife tire herself,

189
00:12:03,135 --> 00:12:05,695
it's better
to let the husband do the hard work instead,

190
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,055
I won't babble with you anymore,

191
00:12:11,055 --> 00:12:12,215
I'm going to see our sister,

192
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:14,895
Good, I'll go with you,

193
00:12:18,015 --> 00:12:19,495
- Isn't there?
- Nope,

194
00:12:19,495 --> 00:12:20,615
How is it gone?

195
00:12:22,495 --> 00:12:23,815
Where did it go?

196
00:12:23,815 --> 00:12:25,135
This also isn't here,

197
00:12:25,975 --> 00:12:27,575
- Here?
- No,

198
00:12:30,112 --> 00:12:31,295
What are you looking for?

199
00:12:31,295 --> 00:12:34,335
There's nothing there, take a look,

200
00:12:34,335 --> 00:12:36,815
Ni, Xiaotan, what happened?

201
00:12:36,815 --> 00:12:40,295
I just placed a stack of freshly printed

202
00:12:40,295 --> 00:12:41,415
Buddhist scriptures right here,

203
00:12:41,415 --> 00:12:43,135
but I can't find them as soon as I turn around,

204
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:46,415
Yes, I saw her put things here as well,

205
00:12:46,415 --> 00:12:47,815
How did they disappear?

206
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:50,935
Did someone take them by mistake?

207
00:12:51,775 --> 00:12:53,715
No way, I asked everyone and no one took them,

208
00:12:53,715 --> 00:12:55,415
We have been searching here
for quite some time now,

209
00:12:55,415 --> 00:12:56,935
This is really strange,

210
00:12:57,535 --> 00:12:59,435
We are all here,

211
00:12:59,435 --> 00:13:01,655
No outsider has come in or out just now,

212
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:04,495
Could it be…
Did the pile of Buddhist scriptures

213
00:13:04,495 --> 00:13:05,955
run away itself?

214
00:13:05,955 --> 00:13:07,735
Shouyue,

215
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:10,655
My surname is Bai,
and I'm the third child in my family,

216
00:13:10,655 --> 00:13:12,235
I have no other skills,

217
00:13:12,235 --> 00:13:13,755
but a fearless fighter,

218
00:13:13,755 --> 00:13:15,535
I will await the Chancellor's orders
from now on,

219
00:13:16,775 --> 00:13:17,975
Have you thought of something?

220
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:21,495
About us printing of the Buddhist scriptures,

221
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,255
I'm afraid Qu Chongyu will find out very soon,

222
00:13:24,775 --> 00:13:29,095
Are you saying the crazy peacock sent someone
to steal the Buddhist scriptures?

223
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,095
That shouldn't be the case,

224
00:13:31,095 --> 00:13:32,895
I was just unloading goods at the doorstep,

225
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,455
I didn't see anyone coming in or out,

226
00:13:35,575 --> 00:13:37,655
This person has superb lightness skills
and exceptional agility,

227
00:13:38,255 --> 00:13:40,615
Avoiding your notice is not difficult at all,

228
00:13:41,615 --> 00:13:43,535
But it's not illegal for us
to print the Buddhist scriptures,

229
00:13:43,535 --> 00:13:45,375
what does it matter even if he finds out?

230
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,455
There's nothing wrong with him
knowing that we print Buddhist scriptures,

231
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,935
but I'm afraid
that the secret of Liuli might be revealed,

232
00:13:55,232 --> 00:13:56,768
It's all my oversight,

233
00:14:05,495 --> 00:14:06,515
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes

234
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:07,775
What's the matter? Why are you in such a hurry?

235
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,215
Take a look at what Bai San just delivered,

236
00:14:14,295 --> 00:14:15,455
What's wrong?

237
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:16,928
Look carefully,

238
00:14:19,975 --> 00:14:21,184
The characters are well written,

239
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,256
The paper is also very good,

240
00:14:28,655 --> 00:14:29,875
Yizhou hemp paper,

241
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:30,895
Yizhou hemp paper,

242
00:14:31,575 --> 00:14:34,615
The An family is using the Yizhou hemp paper
for the Buddhist scriptures,

243
00:14:35,455 --> 00:14:37,255
No wonder when I was testing Sanniang,

244
00:14:37,255 --> 00:14:38,615
she said there's no need to trouble me,

245
00:14:38,615 --> 00:14:41,175
So, she has known a way to handle these papers
all along,

246
00:14:41,935 --> 00:14:43,055
That's not right,

247
00:14:43,055 --> 00:14:44,895
If she wants to transcribe
so many Buddhist scriptures,

248
00:14:44,895 --> 00:14:46,215
that will require many workers,

249
00:14:46,215 --> 00:14:49,355
Being new to Xizhou, where can she find
so many people to help her transcribe?

250
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:50,375
And these characters,

251
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,295
You can tell they're written by an expert
by looking,

252
00:14:53,295 --> 00:14:54,935
Perhaps neither you nor I could write them,

253
00:14:56,775 --> 00:14:58,255
I may not even be able to write it,

254
00:14:59,495 --> 00:15:00,775
They're not by written,

255
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:01,975
You're joking with me,

256
00:15:01,975 --> 00:15:03,495
Not by written?

257
00:15:03,495 --> 00:15:05,035
Or do they just come out of the air?

258
00:15:05,035 --> 00:15:07,015
Printed,

259
00:15:07,015 --> 00:15:07,575
Give me your hand,

260
00:15:09,455 --> 00:15:13,855
Just like this, printed one by one,

261
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:17,335
Print,

262
00:15:17,335 --> 00:15:18,435
That's not right either,

263
00:15:18,435 --> 00:15:21,415
Printing so many of them
must be quite time-consuming,

264
00:15:21,415 --> 00:15:23,712
And where would you find so many gems?

265
00:15:23,712 --> 00:15:25,553
It's not gemstone, It's wood,

266
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:29,055
If one were to make thousands of copies
with wood at one time,

267
00:15:29,055 --> 00:15:31,155
not only would it save time
compared to handwriting,

268
00:15:31,155 --> 00:15:32,655
but it could also be reused,

269
00:15:32,655 --> 00:15:34,775
It's a great method with myriad of benefits,

270
00:15:38,455 --> 00:15:40,695
It seems that I really underestimated
Pei Xingjian,

271
00:15:40,695 --> 00:15:43,415
However, it was that Kudi Liuli
who thought of this idea,

272
00:15:45,735 --> 00:15:48,975
Are you worried that Qu Chongyu'll find out
it was my idea for the engraved boards?

273
00:15:50,495 --> 00:15:53,775
I'm afraid in the next couple of days,
he'll find reasons to test you

274
00:15:54,615 --> 00:15:55,975
If I don't let you take the lead,

275
00:15:55,975 --> 00:15:58,375
that would clearly show
I fear that he might harm you,

276
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,975
But if I do let you take the lead,

277
00:16:00,735 --> 00:16:02,055
I truly cannot be at ease,

278
00:16:03,015 --> 00:16:04,455
Could he possibly murder me to silence me,

279
00:16:05,015 --> 00:16:06,695
or stop at nothing to harm me?

280
00:16:07,775 --> 00:16:10,495
For now, it is not necessary to kill you
to silence you,

281
00:16:11,135 --> 00:16:13,315
He will probe the truth and falsehood
in your words,

282
00:16:13,315 --> 00:16:14,535
seeking to understand your details and motives,

283
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:17,855
This is better than murder,

284
00:16:17,855 --> 00:16:20,115
But if he really understands Liuli's motives,

285
00:16:20,115 --> 00:16:22,155
will he consider her as a threat

286
00:16:22,155 --> 00:16:23,175
and actually do something to harm her?

287
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:31,255
In that case, please bring Sanniang over,

288
00:16:33,135 --> 00:16:34,855
Okay, I'm going right away,

289
00:16:40,455 --> 00:16:42,875
If that's the case, you can rest assured,

290
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,415
I have my ways
to keep him from probing further,

291
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,815
Liuli, you must not be overconfident,

292
00:16:48,815 --> 00:16:51,055
Qu Chongyu's intelligence is not inferior
to mine,

293
00:16:51,055 --> 00:16:52,575
And this time he has come prepared,

294
00:16:53,255 --> 00:16:54,375
I'm worried he might be harmful to you,

295
00:16:54,975 --> 00:16:56,835
Just set your heart at ease,

296
00:16:56,835 --> 00:16:59,735
I've got quite a few insights
on dealing with that crazy peacock,

297
00:17:02,495 --> 00:17:04,615
Alright, your wife is so smart,

298
00:17:04,615 --> 00:17:06,015
What else do you have to worry about?

299
00:17:14,975 --> 00:17:17,815
Sister, if Qu Chongyu comes to ask you
about the Buddhist scriptures,

300
00:17:17,815 --> 00:17:19,104
please answer him this way,

301
00:17:48,255 --> 00:17:49,295
<i>It's in his hand as expected,</i>

302
00:17:51,895 --> 00:17:55,215
I got some routine matters to taken care of,
Sorry for keeping Master An waiting,

303
00:17:56,455 --> 00:17:58,415
Minister Qu,

304
00:17:58,415 --> 00:18:00,655
Do you recognize this?

305
00:18:01,215 --> 00:18:03,355
This's the newly made Buddha scripture
by my An family,

306
00:18:03,355 --> 00:18:04,935
Of course I recognize it,

307
00:18:04,935 --> 00:18:06,335
You're indeed a straightforward person,

308
00:18:07,015 --> 00:18:10,095
Can anything here in Xizhou
ever be concealed from Minister Qu?

309
00:18:10,655 --> 00:18:13,775
Besides, the production of the scriptures
in my establishment is all aboveboard,

310
00:18:13,775 --> 00:18:15,015
So why the need to avoid others?

311
00:18:16,575 --> 00:18:17,655
Then come in and speak,

312
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,915
I'm quite fond of this Buddhist scripture,

313
00:18:27,915 --> 00:18:30,095
I just don't know the method of production,

314
00:18:30,615 --> 00:18:32,935
And I don't know how it was made so neatly,

315
00:18:34,175 --> 00:18:35,695
The matter is quite simple really,

316
00:18:35,695 --> 00:18:37,895
You just need to engrave the characters
out of the wood board,

317
00:18:37,895 --> 00:18:39,295
Then apply ink and press it onto the paper,

318
00:18:40,335 --> 00:18:41,695
I've thought of this too,

319
00:18:42,495 --> 00:18:45,575
It's just that I've tried using a wood board
these past two days,

320
00:18:45,575 --> 00:18:47,175
However, I can never find the knack,

321
00:18:47,775 --> 00:18:49,995
How do you carve the characters
in reverse on the wood board?

322
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:53,215
And what kind of wood board
can withstand the engraving and ink erosion?

323
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:54,975
Can you please tell me?

324
00:18:56,975 --> 00:18:58,400
Well…

325
00:19:00,895 --> 00:19:01,975
You can surely rest assured,

326
00:19:02,615 --> 00:19:05,095
I'm just curious,

327
00:19:08,735 --> 00:19:11,575
Thus, if you confess honestly,

328
00:19:12,135 --> 00:19:13,695
how about I reward you with a hundred gold?

329
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,024
A hundred gold?

330
00:19:21,775 --> 00:19:23,175
You don't need to worry,

331
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,415
Even if I know the method of production,

332
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:28,875
I will absolutely not involve myself
in the business of the Buddhist scripture,

333
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,255
With this said,
you can always rest assured, right?

334
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,355
Since the Minister has put it out this way,
there's not much more to say,

335
00:19:34,355 --> 00:19:37,175
If I were to decline further,
it would indeed be quite ungracious,

336
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:42,915
But the inventor of this engraved board
printing technique is actually my sister,

337
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,415
As for how it's made, I truly have no idea,

338
00:19:47,175 --> 00:19:48,615
Very well then, In that case,

339
00:19:48,615 --> 00:19:52,215
please trouble Master An to go back
and discuss thoroughly with Lady Kudi,

340
00:19:52,935 --> 00:19:54,175
I shall await the good news,

341
00:20:12,055 --> 00:20:15,904
<i>Respect and Honor One's Origin</i>

342
00:20:20,975 --> 00:20:22,304
Say yes to him,

343
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:25,015
The technique of engraved board
is truly a shortcut to profit,

344
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,655
Is one hundred gold too little?

345
00:20:26,655 --> 00:20:28,855
Actually,
the key to this matter is not complicated

346
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:31,355
It's just that they didn't think of
using fabric printing skills,

347
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,615
The wooden board we use

348
00:20:32,615 --> 00:20:34,775
was pear wood which first soaked
for several months

349
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,515
at the fabric printing store
before dried thoroughly,

350
00:20:36,515 --> 00:20:38,695
It's much more resilient than ordinary wood,

351
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:41,395
When carving characters,
there would be no cracks or breaks on it,

352
00:20:41,395 --> 00:20:44,655
The stencil characters are also written
on the special thin paper used at the store,

353
00:20:44,655 --> 00:20:45,815
This way, the reverse side can also

354
00:20:45,815 --> 00:20:47,875
clearly show the handwriting,

355
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,295
These tow thoughts might not
immediately occur to others,

356
00:20:50,295 --> 00:20:51,975
However, that doesn't mean no one would never
be able to figure it out in their lifetime,

357
00:20:52,615 --> 00:20:55,095
There are many skilled artisans
at the crazy peacock's place,

358
00:20:55,095 --> 00:20:57,015
Sooner or later, they will figure these out,

359
00:20:57,015 --> 00:20:59,295
By then, I'm afraid even a hundred gold pieces
would not be obtainable

360
00:20:59,935 --> 00:21:01,255
It's just that by doing so,

361
00:21:01,255 --> 00:21:03,955
Qu Chongyu will definitely ask you
to go to his workshop,

362
00:21:03,955 --> 00:21:05,715
Aren't we falling into his trap?

363
00:21:05,715 --> 00:21:07,235
Sister, there is no need to worry,

364
00:21:07,235 --> 00:21:09,735
Even if he doesn't ask, I will go by myself,

365
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:10,895
Why is that?

366
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,455
If we don't let him understand clearly,

367
00:21:12,455 --> 00:21:14,255
how can we make him let down his guard?

368
00:21:17,055 --> 00:21:18,895
Then I will go speak with Qu Chongyu,

369
00:21:32,655 --> 00:21:33,895
My lady, watch your step,

370
00:21:40,135 --> 00:21:41,600
Please, this way, My lady

371
00:21:50,695 --> 00:21:52,255
Sorry for the bother, My lady,

372
00:21:52,255 --> 00:21:53,935
No need for formalities, Minister,

373
00:21:53,935 --> 00:21:55,915
Since I have received
your hundred pieces of gold,

374
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:59,455
even if it's troublesome,
I have no choice but to take this journey

375
00:21:59,455 --> 00:22:01,495
in order to clear your doubts,

376
00:22:01,495 --> 00:22:04,635
I greatly admire your boundless ideas, my lady,

377
00:22:04,635 --> 00:22:06,755
It's just that some details
are still not fully comprehended,

378
00:22:06,755 --> 00:22:08,335
Hope you wouldn't hesitate to enlighten me,

379
00:22:08,335 --> 00:22:09,835
You're being too polite,

380
00:22:09,835 --> 00:22:11,195
Minister's inquiries are meticulous,

381
00:22:11,195 --> 00:22:13,055
I don't quite understand the questions either,

382
00:22:13,055 --> 00:22:14,215
Thank you for your efforts, Lady Kuli,

383
00:22:14,215 --> 00:22:15,815
No worries,

384
00:22:15,815 --> 00:22:17,955
I took your money for it,

385
00:22:17,955 --> 00:22:20,055
After all, they are so generous,

386
00:22:21,135 --> 00:22:23,915
You said these wood pieces
need to be soaked for several months,

387
00:22:23,915 --> 00:22:25,895
They can only be used
after being thoroughly dried,

388
00:22:25,895 --> 00:22:28,455
Just now, Master An brought over a piece,
and the wood is really good,

389
00:22:28,455 --> 00:22:30,095
But I wonder why?

390
00:22:30,935 --> 00:22:33,975
As for why, how could I know?

391
00:22:34,935 --> 00:22:36,655
My lady, are you trying to fob us off?

392
00:22:37,935 --> 00:22:39,755
What does this mean, Prefect Wang?

393
00:22:39,755 --> 00:22:41,055
According to Master An,

394
00:22:41,055 --> 00:22:44,055
the engraved board printing technique
was Lady Kudi's idea,

395
00:22:44,055 --> 00:22:47,255
Well, if that's the case,
how could you not know the production process?

396
00:22:47,255 --> 00:22:49,855
Could it be that someone else
came up with this idea?

397
00:23:01,335 --> 00:23:03,855
Are you saying that I pretend to understand
when I don't

398
00:23:04,495 --> 00:23:06,215
to swindle your money, Prefect Wang?

399
00:23:06,215 --> 00:23:07,295
I misspoke,

400
00:23:07,295 --> 00:23:10,395
I although even though
Lady Kudi came from commoner background,

401
00:23:10,395 --> 00:23:12,215
but you're respected as kin to an official,

402
00:23:12,215 --> 00:23:15,275
you wouldn't resort to such despicable means,

403
00:23:15,275 --> 00:23:17,655
Prefect Wang, you seem to have been sleeping
too well recently,

404
00:23:18,295 --> 00:23:20,335
That's why you're spouting nonsense here,

405
00:23:21,295 --> 00:23:23,535
I really don't know

406
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:24,855
the reason
why these soaked wooden boards are better,

407
00:23:25,535 --> 00:23:28,175
I only know about all the carving boards
in the fabric printing store

408
00:23:28,735 --> 00:23:31,735
need to be treated in this way
before they can be used,

409
00:23:32,255 --> 00:23:34,455
Otherwise, it is easy to burr during carving,

410
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,915
This is something that everyone would know
in the fabric printing store,

411
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,335
As for the truth in it, who will care?

412
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:43,775
Fabric printing store?

413
00:23:43,775 --> 00:23:44,935
Of course, fabric printing store,

414
00:23:45,615 --> 00:23:46,695
Minister, you didn't know

415
00:23:46,695 --> 00:23:49,335
that I once worked as a painter
in a fabric printing store,

416
00:23:49,335 --> 00:23:51,235
I'm familiar with craving boards
and dying cloth,

417
00:23:51,235 --> 00:23:53,595
I thought
since the wood engraved board could dye cloth,

418
00:23:53,595 --> 00:23:54,895
there's a great chance that
they could be used for printing books,

419
00:23:55,535 --> 00:23:58,055
Unexpectedly,
it turned out to be the case when tested,

420
00:23:58,775 --> 00:24:01,875
The wood used for engraved boards this time
was indeed from the fabric printing store,

421
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,575
If it hadn't been for the Minister,

422
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:06,135
I wouldn't have known
that other kinds of wood would not suffice,

423
00:24:07,495 --> 00:24:10,035
I didn't expect you to be this generous,

424
00:24:10,035 --> 00:24:12,895
You're willing to spend a great sum of money
just to ask about such a trivial matter,

425
00:24:29,015 --> 00:24:30,955
Given that, it really is quite a coincidence,

426
00:24:30,955 --> 00:24:32,335
Isn't it just coincidental?

427
00:24:33,215 --> 00:24:35,135
I wonder
if Prefect Wang is satisfied with my answer,

428
00:24:35,135 --> 00:24:36,215
I am enlightened,

429
00:24:36,215 --> 00:24:37,815
This money was offered voluntarily by you,

430
00:24:37,815 --> 00:24:39,895
It's not like I'm trying to swindle you,
just so you know,

431
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,335
My questions were answered,
and I suppose it's not a loss after all,

432
00:24:41,335 --> 00:24:43,455
Even if you feel at a loss,
I'm not going to return the money,

433
00:24:43,455 --> 00:24:46,015
Certainly not!
It's worth every penny to see your true nature,

434
00:24:46,015 --> 00:24:47,415
The money was well spent,

435
00:24:47,415 --> 00:24:49,655
Are you sarcastically implying
my ignorance and superficiality?

436
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,575
How could I dare,
My lady, your ideas are incredibly imaginative,

437
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:52,895
We could only admire
and cannot hope to compare,

438
00:24:52,895 --> 00:24:53,935
Good to know,

439
00:24:53,935 --> 00:24:55,795
If there's anything else to ask,
please go ahead,

440
00:24:55,795 --> 00:24:58,935
The smell here is truly unpleasant,
and it's also very noisy,

441
00:24:58,935 --> 00:25:01,435
If one stays too long,
I fear it would be suffocating,

442
00:25:01,435 --> 00:25:03,435
Lady Liuli usually just gives advice,

443
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:04,935
She doesn't want to see these people
do the heavy work,

444
00:25:05,455 --> 00:25:07,135
Why don't we call two craftsmen over

445
00:25:07,135 --> 00:25:08,735
and demonstrate directly
to the Minister how to do it?

446
00:25:08,735 --> 00:25:10,695
Great, Please go ahead and I won't see you out
as I still have things to do,

447
00:25:10,695 --> 00:25:12,535
It seems as if I liked to stay here, Let's go,

448
00:25:21,935 --> 00:25:23,835
- Despicable,
- Despicable,

449
00:25:23,835 --> 00:25:24,995
No worries, no worries,

450
00:25:24,995 --> 00:25:26,975
- Shrew,
- Shrew,

451
00:25:39,255 --> 00:25:40,535
Don't get so angry that it affects your health,

452
00:25:41,495 --> 00:25:43,035
You see, I originally thought this woman

453
00:25:43,035 --> 00:25:45,295
must be exceptionally smart
to come up with this idea,

454
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:47,055
Who would have thought she's just a painter
at a fabric printing store?

455
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:51,615
But it's good, after this,
we won't have to see her anymore,

456
00:26:03,323 --> 00:26:09,504
<i>[Protector-General's Mansion]</i>

457
00:26:10,415 --> 00:26:11,855
That medicine didn't have any effect at all,
did it?

458
00:26:11,855 --> 00:26:13,536
I told you, didn't I?

459
00:26:25,495 --> 00:26:29,855
Bai San,
it's better for you to be careful these days,

460
00:26:32,575 --> 00:26:36,015
Do not cause a bloody disaster
because of your speedy legs,

461
00:26:38,455 --> 00:26:40,015
Chancellor, you're making fun of me,

462
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,815
I have been working on these legs
for over twenty years,

463
00:26:42,815 --> 00:26:44,975
They've never failed me,

464
00:26:45,575 --> 00:26:47,215
Senior Official,

465
00:26:47,215 --> 00:26:49,435
you may not know,

466
00:26:49,435 --> 00:26:51,475
Speaking of Sanlang's speed,

467
00:26:51,475 --> 00:26:53,335
Let alone our office,

468
00:26:53,335 --> 00:26:55,795
he's a prominent figure

469
00:26:55,795 --> 00:26:58,375
in the entire Xizhou,

470
00:27:04,295 --> 00:27:05,335
I indeed didn't misjudge,

471
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:09,455
You'll certainly face a bloody disaster
within three days,

472
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:13,255
If you don't believe it,

473
00:27:13,255 --> 00:27:15,095
why not have a bet between the two of us?

474
00:27:19,215 --> 00:27:20,855
How will we bet?

475
00:27:20,855 --> 00:27:22,095
If my words don't come true,

476
00:27:23,415 --> 00:27:24,495
as long as I'm on duty,

477
00:27:24,495 --> 00:27:27,055
you can receive assistant's allowance

478
00:27:27,055 --> 00:27:28,635
and do whatever you wish,

479
00:27:28,635 --> 00:27:29,975
I will definitely not interfere,

480
00:27:31,015 --> 00:27:32,495
If what I said comes true,

481
00:27:33,135 --> 00:27:34,875
then you must explain clearly

482
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:37,055
how this bloody disaster come about,

483
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:40,235
So that I could avoid suspicion
from others later on,

484
00:27:40,235 --> 00:27:41,575
in case someone accuse me
of foul play behind the scenes,

485
00:27:44,695 --> 00:27:45,935
Agreed,

486
00:27:45,935 --> 00:27:47,535
Then let those present bear witness,

487
00:27:48,135 --> 00:27:50,775
If I truly encounter a bloody disaster
in these few days,

488
00:27:51,775 --> 00:27:54,975
whether or not it is a setup by someone,

489
00:27:54,975 --> 00:28:00,135
I am all ears and obedient
to Senior Official Pei's orders,

490
00:28:01,135 --> 00:28:02,624
Good,

491
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:18,235
Sanlang, you'd better be careful today,

492
00:28:18,235 --> 00:28:19,535
Although I don't believe

493
00:28:19,535 --> 00:28:21,275
there are any divine calculation techniques
in this world,

494
00:28:21,275 --> 00:28:23,335
however, since
Senior Official Pei dares to be so certain,

495
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:25,075
I believe he must be somewhat confident,

496
00:28:25,075 --> 00:28:26,895
It's not all groundless speculation,

497
00:28:26,895 --> 00:28:29,015
Alarming talk is not worth worrying about,

498
00:28:29,015 --> 00:28:30,675
I'll go and return shortly,

499
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:33,135
Keep watch here,

500
00:28:46,615 --> 00:28:48,015
Sanlang, be careful,

501
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:58,415
S-Sanlang, what happened?

502
00:28:58,415 --> 00:28:59,455
Why are you so loud?

503
00:28:59,455 --> 00:29:01,735
It's too shady, They're all oil barrels,

504
00:29:02,495 --> 00:29:04,175
Sanlang, Sanlang,

505
00:29:05,655 --> 00:29:07,015
You think a little oil can trap me?

506
00:29:11,095 --> 00:29:13,215
What happened to Sanlang?

507
00:29:14,535 --> 00:29:21,015
Sanlang, Sanlang,

508
00:29:23,415 --> 00:29:27,295
Which bold thief dares to break into
Pei Mansion at night?

509
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,815
People, come and surround this thief for me,

510
00:29:37,535 --> 00:29:38,976
Beat him up for me,

511
00:29:46,495 --> 00:29:49,455
What happened to Sanlang?

512
00:29:50,335 --> 00:29:51,616
Sanlang!

513
00:29:53,175 --> 00:29:54,415
Stop him, don't let him escape!

514
00:29:55,495 --> 00:29:56,735
Bold thief, where do you think you're going?

515
00:30:00,335 --> 00:30:01,408
San…Sanlang,

516
00:30:11,335 --> 00:30:12,448
Sanlang!

517
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:19,855
Open the door, save me,

518
00:30:22,575 --> 00:30:23,615
Hansi!

519
00:30:25,495 --> 00:30:27,008
Hansi!

520
00:30:29,775 --> 00:30:31,136
Hansi!

521
00:30:35,175 --> 00:30:37,415
Sanlang is injured, Hansi, hurry and save him,

522
00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:41,856
He's still alive,

523
00:30:44,495 --> 00:30:47,455
He's a human being,
Come see me again next time a cow gets hurt

524
00:31:13,055 --> 00:31:14,575
Is it really so magical?

525
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:16,695
It came true so quickly,

526
00:31:17,215 --> 00:31:19,655
Sanlang, how did you get injured like this?

527
00:31:21,815 --> 00:31:24,735
I fell over at night,
and there's nothing to ask about,

528
00:31:25,535 --> 00:31:27,375
Is there really a divine calculation technique
in this world?

529
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:31,136
Yes, there is,

530
00:31:31,136 --> 00:31:32,775
Yes,

531
00:31:36,215 --> 00:31:37,555
This is too frightening,

532
00:31:37,555 --> 00:31:40,615
Bai San, we have an agreement in advance,

533
00:31:41,335 --> 00:31:42,415
You need to explain to everyone,

534
00:31:42,935 --> 00:31:44,215
Where did you go last night?

535
00:31:44,215 --> 00:31:45,795
Why are you hurt?

536
00:31:45,795 --> 00:31:47,255
There's nothing good to say,

537
00:31:48,175 --> 00:31:49,415
I'm so injured,

538
00:31:50,215 --> 00:31:52,975
It's my own fault, and I can't blame others,

539
00:31:54,135 --> 00:31:55,335
Everyone, listen to me well,

540
00:31:55,935 --> 00:31:58,535
Senior Official Pei won this gamble,

541
00:31:59,495 --> 00:32:00,895
I, Bai San, am willing to admit defeat,

542
00:32:01,975 --> 00:32:06,415
From now on,
I'll only take Senior Official Pei's orders,

543
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:14,175
Bai San, I don't think it's convenient for you
to carry out your duties these days,

544
00:32:14,815 --> 00:32:15,855
You should go home and rest well,

545
00:32:18,695 --> 00:32:19,815
Slow down, slow down, slow down,

546
00:32:20,655 --> 00:32:21,655
How did you get hurt?

547
00:32:25,615 --> 00:32:28,095
What kind of person do you think of me?

548
00:32:28,695 --> 00:32:31,255
Is it possible to unsay what has been said?

549
00:32:33,335 --> 00:32:35,815
With a minor injury like this?

550
00:32:36,575 --> 00:32:39,255
Even if my head falls off,
I have to finish my duties first,

551
00:32:39,255 --> 00:32:40,415
Then I'll go home and drop dead,

552
00:32:41,695 --> 00:32:42,895
That's not right,

553
00:32:43,775 --> 00:32:46,415
The bet was just a joke I made up with you,

554
00:32:47,055 --> 00:32:48,495
I was just kindly reminding you,

555
00:32:48,495 --> 00:32:49,975
Only got there
because one thing led to another,

556
00:32:50,495 --> 00:32:51,735
Why do you have to take it so seriously?

557
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:55,875
You have to accept losing a bet
and repay your debts,

558
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:58,415
I may be a lout,
but I will never be a scoundrel,

559
00:32:59,055 --> 00:33:00,192
All good,

560
00:33:02,215 --> 00:33:04,255
Since you say you'll obey me,

561
00:33:05,215 --> 00:33:08,055
then I now order you to go home and rest well,

562
00:33:08,735 --> 00:33:10,176
Are you listening or not?

563
00:33:15,655 --> 00:33:16,960
Gently,

564
00:33:23,975 --> 00:33:27,335
I'm afraid he won't be able to get out of bed
for a couple of months with his fall

565
00:33:31,215 --> 00:33:33,935
This Bai San really has no brains,

566
00:33:35,535 --> 00:33:37,575
I've warned him time and again to be careful,

567
00:33:40,735 --> 00:33:41,975
Alright, you may go now,

568
00:33:43,495 --> 00:33:44,864
Yes,

569
00:35:09,615 --> 00:35:12,615
By the way, you haven't been to
the Great Buddha Temple in the north, right?

570
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:14,675
No, I haven't been there,

571
00:35:14,675 --> 00:35:16,775
But lately, I've often heard people mention it,

572
00:35:18,335 --> 00:35:19,655
Then you must go and see it,

573
00:35:21,015 --> 00:35:24,095
The Great Buddha Temple
is the most magnificent temple in Xizhou,

574
00:35:24,735 --> 00:35:27,215
Even compared to the Daci'en Temple
in Chang'an,

575
00:35:27,215 --> 00:35:28,375
it'll certainly not inferior,

576
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:31,635
If we were to discuss it in terms of murals,

577
00:35:31,635 --> 00:35:33,615
it would be even more outstanding,

578
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:37,495
<i>The entire Xizhou is not as big as a district
in Chang'an,</i>

579
00:35:38,055 --> 00:35:40,935
<i>Could there be a temple
that can compare to the Daci'en Temple?</i>

580
00:35:42,535 --> 00:35:43,935
Better than Daci'en Temple?

581
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:46,975
Seeing is believing,

582
00:35:46,975 --> 00:35:49,975
I will take you to see it tomorrow, how's that?

583
00:35:49,975 --> 00:35:52,075
Great, I've wanted to go for a long time,

584
00:35:52,075 --> 00:35:53,095
No manners,

585
00:35:54,575 --> 00:35:56,235
There's not much rules in my place,

586
00:35:56,235 --> 00:35:58,095
This girl is lively and cute,

587
00:35:58,095 --> 00:35:59,615
She indeed suits my taste very much,

588
00:36:00,215 --> 00:36:01,655
Thank you very much, Lady Qu,

589
00:36:01,655 --> 00:36:04,855
If you like her that much,
then how about I give her to you, Lady Jing?

590
00:36:05,575 --> 00:36:06,855
Is this true?

591
00:36:06,855 --> 00:36:09,495
I will send someone
to bring her contract to you tomorrow,

592
00:36:10,215 --> 00:36:11,255
My lady,

593
00:36:11,255 --> 00:36:14,575
If Lady Kuli is willing to part with her,
then I can't refuse,

594
00:36:16,135 --> 00:36:17,675
No no no,

595
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,035
My lady, please,

596
00:36:20,035 --> 00:36:22,055
Please don't give me away,

597
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:24,055
I can't leave you, my lady,

598
00:36:25,255 --> 00:36:27,975
My lady, I was wrong!

599
00:36:29,615 --> 00:36:31,040
Alright, alright,

600
00:36:34,895 --> 00:36:38,355
My lady, you are messing with me again!

601
00:36:38,355 --> 00:36:39,615
I will not concede!

602
00:36:40,335 --> 00:36:42,395
I am growing even fonder of this girl,

603
00:36:42,395 --> 00:36:44,015
Send someone to reward her,

604
00:36:49,535 --> 00:36:51,775
Since it's a gift from Lady Qu, just accept it,

605
00:36:53,655 --> 00:36:54,675
Thank you, my lady,

606
00:36:54,675 --> 00:36:56,295
I'm not the one you should be thanking,

607
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,495
Thank you very much, Lady Qu,

608
00:36:58,495 --> 00:37:00,064
No need, no need,

609
00:37:00,655 --> 00:37:02,695
Then let's go tomorrow,

610
00:37:02,695 --> 00:37:04,095
Obedience is the best respect,

611
00:37:06,328 --> 00:37:09,543
<i>[Judged by Actions, Known for Benevolence]</i>

612
00:37:29,895 --> 00:37:34,695
Why has Senior Official Pei been
so busy lately?

613
00:37:34,695 --> 00:37:37,335
He searched through all the registries
in Xizhou,

614
00:37:37,335 --> 00:37:39,695
and he left the city every few days,

615
00:37:40,575 --> 00:37:44,135
Is it merely to help Lady Liu find her cousin?

616
00:37:46,735 --> 00:37:47,975
I'm softhearted,

617
00:37:47,975 --> 00:37:50,155
I Can't stand to see lovers separated
by distance,

618
00:37:50,155 --> 00:37:53,495
Now Xizhou is well governed
by the Protector-General,

619
00:37:53,495 --> 00:37:55,255
As the Chancellor, I have nothing to do
in my leisure time,

620
00:37:55,895 --> 00:37:57,855
If I can help Lady Liu find her cousin,

621
00:37:58,415 --> 00:37:59,695
it would also be considered a good deed,

622
00:38:02,495 --> 00:38:03,775
Makes sense, makes sense,

623
00:38:09,415 --> 00:38:10,855
I made a mistake, I made a mistake,

624
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:12,355
Regret one step,

625
00:38:12,355 --> 00:38:13,696
Master,

626
00:38:14,975 --> 00:38:17,535
Master, Prefect Wang, Lady Liu is here,

627
00:38:17,535 --> 00:38:18,615
She wants to ask about her cousin,

628
00:38:22,975 --> 00:38:25,855
Look how anxious Lady Liu is,

629
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:27,455
She comes to ask me every day,

630
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:29,495
There's nothing can be done,

631
00:38:29,495 --> 00:38:32,355
I must ask Prefect Wang to bring the record
of registration of the garrison

632
00:38:32,355 --> 00:38:33,495
for me to take a look,

633
00:38:35,655 --> 00:38:36,815
For sure,

634
00:38:37,975 --> 00:38:40,635
Since you have a visitor, then let's stop here,

635
00:38:40,635 --> 00:38:41,895
I'll take my leave,

636
00:38:45,095 --> 00:38:46,400
I'll take my leave,

637
00:38:52,535 --> 00:38:54,016
Prefect Wang,

638
00:38:55,175 --> 00:38:57,495
Lady Liu, Senior Official Pei
is waiting for you,

639
00:38:57,495 --> 00:38:58,848
Thank you for your troubles,

640
00:39:16,135 --> 00:39:17,555
Ask the groom, Ren, to come see me,

641
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:18,752
Yes,

642
00:39:29,255 --> 00:39:30,655
My lady, my lady,

643
00:39:31,615 --> 00:39:34,035
Why do you taken the trouble
to bring me soup by yourself?

644
00:39:34,035 --> 00:39:35,055
Come, come here and have a seat,

645
00:39:35,055 --> 00:39:36,895
Don't tire yourself out,

646
00:39:40,135 --> 00:39:42,795
This is the soup that my lady made for me
by herself,

647
00:39:42,795 --> 00:39:44,955
I can tell it's extraordinary at first glance,

648
00:39:44,955 --> 00:39:46,095
Let me have a taste,

649
00:39:49,695 --> 00:39:51,095
Delicious,

650
00:39:51,095 --> 00:39:53,775
It's indeed more delicious
than the soup those people sent,

651
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:56,704
Tasty,

652
00:39:58,175 --> 00:39:59,648
Delicious,

653
00:40:01,175 --> 00:40:02,592
Yummy,

654
00:40:06,615 --> 00:40:08,255
My lady, today…

655
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,015
My lady looks so beautiful today,

656
00:40:15,415 --> 00:40:17,215
Am I not beautiful on regular days?

657
00:40:17,935 --> 00:40:19,755
Of course you do,

658
00:40:19,755 --> 00:40:24,215
You're looking absolutely stunning today!

659
00:40:25,615 --> 00:40:27,255
Liuli did my makeup,

660
00:40:32,775 --> 00:40:34,615
Good, good, So beautiful,

661
00:40:35,655 --> 00:40:41,015
My lady, it seems you've grown quite close
to Kudi Liuli lately,

662
00:40:41,015 --> 00:40:42,495
I enjoy her company,

663
00:40:43,015 --> 00:40:45,775
As long as you like it, that's good,

664
00:40:47,455 --> 00:40:52,975
It's just extremely inappropriate

665
00:40:54,335 --> 00:40:55,695
if you get very close to Lady Kudi,

666
00:40:57,575 --> 00:41:01,055
Pei Xingjian has made too many enemies,
and he might bring trouble to Kudi--

667
00:41:01,055 --> 00:41:03,215
Stop messing with that bowl
and stand up for me!

668
00:41:07,055 --> 00:41:08,475
If you guys are going after Pei Xingjian,

669
00:41:08,475 --> 00:41:10,135
it's not my business,
nor do I want to intervene,

670
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:11,855
But if you're thinking of targeting Liuli,

671
00:41:11,855 --> 00:41:12,895
don't blame me for not agreeing,

672
00:41:13,855 --> 00:41:15,855
My lady, you've misunderstood,

673
00:41:15,855 --> 00:41:18,175
She's a vulnerable woman
with no strength to fight back,

674
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:19,555
How could she possibly be in your way?

675
00:41:19,555 --> 00:41:21,495
Of course, that's not a hindrance to me,

676
00:41:21,495 --> 00:41:23,375
This…this is all the Protector-General's idea,

677
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:25,235
Then you go back
and tell the Protector-General,

678
00:41:25,235 --> 00:41:27,475
If anything bad happens to Liuli,

679
00:41:27,475 --> 00:41:29,455
I would make sure
his Protector-General's mansion has no peace,

680
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,975
You! Get out of here tonight!

681
00:41:42,815 --> 00:41:44,096
Close the door!

682
00:41:55,015 --> 00:41:57,155
My lady, it's unfair,

683
00:41:57,155 --> 00:41:58,335
It really has nothing to do with me,

684
00:41:58,335 --> 00:42:00,315
It's all from the Protector-General,

685
00:42:00,315 --> 00:42:02,272
Get out!

686
00:42:22,255 --> 00:42:23,855
We will go there by Lady Qu's carriage,

687
00:42:23,855 --> 00:42:25,135
You don't need to follow,

688
00:42:25,135 --> 00:42:26,624
Yes,

689
00:42:41,655 --> 00:42:44,215
I didn't expect
that Lady Jing was actually a devout believer,

690
00:42:45,575 --> 00:42:47,055
Liuli, stop making fun of me,

691
00:42:47,055 --> 00:42:49,935
I worship Buddha more for personal matters
than for the sake of devotion,

692
00:42:50,455 --> 00:42:52,335
Perhaps the Buddha has seen through this
as well,

693
00:42:52,335 --> 00:42:55,095
That's why, despite many years of praying,
my wishes have never been fulfilled,

695
00:43:00,915 --> 00:43:04,915
<i>♫ I write my longing for you in Spring ♫</i>

696
00:43:05,943 --> 00:43:10,547
<i>♫ The red plum is in full bloom like you ♫</i>

697
00:43:11,767 --> 00:43:15,091
<i>♫ By the pond, next to the willow trees ♫</i>

698
00:43:15,091 --> 00:43:18,739
<i>♫ I write a poem
to tell our story from the past ♫</i>

699
00:43:18,739 --> 00:43:23,699
<i>♫ The years pass by like a bird♫</i>

700
00:43:25,431 --> 00:43:30,195
<i>♫ The destiny always comes with regrets ♫</i>

701
00:43:32,055 --> 00:43:36,915
<i>♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫</i>

702
00:43:38,455 --> 00:43:41,363
<i>♫ Outside the pavilion, by the bridge ♫</i>

703
00:43:41,363 --> 00:43:44,883
<i>♫ Under the moonlight,
we parted at the doorstep ♫</i>

704
00:43:44,883 --> 00:43:51,187
<i>♫ I've endured hardship
to tell our lingering story ♫</i>

705
00:43:51,187 --> 00:43:54,675
<i>♫ Remembrance of past things ♫</i>

706
00:43:54,675 --> 00:43:57,747
<i>♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫</i>

707
00:43:57,747 --> 00:44:01,267
<i>♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫</i>

708
00:44:01,267 --> 00:44:04,787
<i>♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫</i>

709
00:44:04,787 --> 00:44:07,635
<i>♫ A snowy day, someone sings a sad song ♫</i>

710
00:44:07,635 --> 00:44:10,707
<i>♫ Against the window,
I had a drink for pleasure ♫</i>

711
00:44:10,707 --> 00:44:14,323
<i>♫ The moon still hangs in the sky,
but I'm no longer in the mood ♫</i>

712
00:44:14,323 --> 00:44:19,187
<i>♫ It's quite and cold outside,
but I grab my pen again ♫</i>

713
00:44:32,535 --> 00:44:37,811
<i>♫ The destiny always comes with regrets ♫</i>

714
00:44:39,095 --> 00:44:45,203
<i>♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫</i>

715
00:44:45,203 --> 00:44:48,403
<i>♫ Outside the pavilion, by the bridge ♫</i>

716
00:44:48,403 --> 00:44:51,699
<i>♫ Under the moonlight,
we parted at the doorstep ♫</i>

717
00:44:51,699 --> 00:44:58,195
<i>♫ I've endured hardship
to tell our lingering story ♫</i>

718
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:01,587
<i>♫ Remembrance of past things ♫</i>

719
00:45:01,587 --> 00:45:04,883

720

721
00:45:08,307 --> 00:45:11,539
<i>♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫</i>

722
00:45:11,539 --> 00:45:14,771
<i>♫ Winter comes again, and flowers wither ♫</i>

723
00:45:14,771 --> 00:45:18,131
<i>♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫</i>

724
00:45:18,131 --> 00:45:21,363
<i>♫ I look outside, like the poems asking ♫</i>

725
00:45:21,363 --> 00:45:26,355
<i>♫ My love, have you
found someone good for you ♫</i>

726
00:45:26,355 --> 00:45:29,907
<i>♫ Remembrance of past things ♫</i>

727
00:45:29,907 --> 00:45:33,171
<i>♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫</i>

728
00:45:33,171 --> 00:45:36,179
<i>♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫</i>

729
00:45:36,179 --> 00:45:39,571
<i>♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫</i>

730
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:42,963
<i>♫ Winter comes again, and flowers wither ♫</i>

731
00:45:42,963 --> 00:45:45,811
<i>♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫</i>

732
00:45:45,811 --> 00:45:49,555

733
00:45:49,555 --> 00:45:54,739
<i>♫ My love, have you
found someone good for you ♫</i>
