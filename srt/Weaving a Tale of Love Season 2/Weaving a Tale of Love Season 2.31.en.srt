[Episode 31]

3
00:01:51,802 --> 00:01:55,842
General, there are only
thousands of Qiuci rebels.

4
00:01:56,362 --> 00:01:59,082
We can wipe them out alone.

5
00:02:00,082 --> 00:02:03,442
We don't need the Army of the Great Tang
to handle so few enemies.

6
00:02:04,242 --> 00:02:05,642
The local troops can handle it.

7
00:02:06,762 --> 00:02:08,082
You may leave.

8
00:02:08,082 --> 00:02:09,242
Yes, Sir.

9
00:02:12,162 --> 00:02:13,242
Advisor Mei, please stay.

10
00:02:14,762 --> 00:02:15,808
Yes, Sir.

11
00:02:19,322 --> 00:02:20,416
Advisor Mei.

12
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,802
What do you think?

13
00:02:27,082 --> 00:02:30,282
Commander, this is a great opportunity.

14
00:02:32,122 --> 00:02:35,202
We can wipe out our disgrace this time.

15
00:02:36,242 --> 00:02:37,362
I'm listening.

16
00:02:37,362 --> 00:02:38,902
The Qu family and Pei Xingjian

17
00:02:38,902 --> 00:02:40,722
were behind what happened in Dadu City.

18
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:43,282
If we mobilize the troops,

19
00:02:43,282 --> 00:02:45,522
we can ask them to expropriate
200,000 dan of grains.

20
00:02:46,282 --> 00:02:48,722
People would resent them if they made it.

21
00:02:48,722 --> 00:02:52,682
Or we could punish them if they fail the task.

22
00:02:55,482 --> 00:02:59,322
Advisor Mei,
go back and write a letter about this.

23
00:03:00,122 --> 00:03:01,216
Yes, Sir.

24
00:03:08,162 --> 00:03:10,842
I'm sending Ziyu to supervise
the expropriation in Xizhou.

25
00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:13,762
No matter what happens,

26
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:18,402
Pei Xingjian will be held accountable.

27
00:04:02,082 --> 00:04:04,402
My lady has been painting you

28
00:04:05,282 --> 00:04:08,448
for less than an hour every day,
lasting two weeks.

29
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:09,482
Most of the time,

30
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:12,002
you stood there posing, holding the pipa.

31
00:04:13,602 --> 00:04:17,442
But Miss Zhang has to
sit there for hours every day,

32
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:19,162
playing the zither.

33
00:04:19,962 --> 00:04:21,642
I almost feel sorry for her.

34
00:04:35,882 --> 00:04:38,362
Sister, the chancellor wants to see you.

35
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:51,002
Miss Zhang, stay put. Otherwise,

36
00:04:51,002 --> 00:04:53,082
my sister's effort will be in vain.

37
00:04:57,682 --> 00:04:59,162
Naught you.

38
00:04:59,162 --> 00:05:01,082
I'm just teaching Zhang Minniang a lesson

39
00:05:01,082 --> 00:05:02,842
for trying to steal someone's husband.

40
00:05:13,962 --> 00:05:15,008
Come here.

41
00:05:19,682 --> 00:05:21,682
How long do you need to

42
00:05:21,682 --> 00:05:22,962
work on that painting?

43
00:05:23,682 --> 00:05:24,802
It will be done today.

44
00:05:25,682 --> 00:05:28,096
I don't think she's ever going to come

45
00:05:28,096 --> 00:05:30,176
even if I invite her over again.

46
00:05:31,842 --> 00:05:34,562
A letter came to Xizhou some days ago,

47
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:37,442
asking Commander Su Haizheng

48
00:05:38,282 --> 00:05:40,602
to take Ashina Mishe and Ashina Buzhen

49
00:05:40,602 --> 00:05:42,882
to take down the Qiuci rebels.

50
00:05:44,202 --> 00:05:46,560
Another war? What should we do?

51
00:05:48,242 --> 00:05:50,082
Commander Su is truly dedicated.

52
00:05:50,842 --> 00:05:53,842
Today, he sent the order
for someone from Tingzhou to supervise

53
00:05:55,042 --> 00:05:57,162
the weapon manufacture, and for Governor Qu

54
00:05:57,762 --> 00:05:59,642
to take charge of the provision.

55
00:06:00,642 --> 00:06:04,362
And we have to expropriate
200,000 dan of grains.

56
00:06:11,282 --> 00:06:13,002
If I'm not mistaken,

57
00:06:14,002 --> 00:06:18,202
we have about
120,000 dan of provisions in stock.

58
00:06:19,442 --> 00:06:21,582
General Su Dingfang
pacified the Western Regions

59
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:23,862
and wiped out 100,000 troops of Ashina Helu.

60
00:06:23,862 --> 00:06:25,362
They consumed less than

61
00:06:25,362 --> 00:06:27,262
100,000 dan of provision in a year.

62
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,362
There are only 3000 Qiuci rebels

63
00:06:29,362 --> 00:06:32,322
who took over two cities this time.

64
00:06:33,082 --> 00:06:35,502
And Su Haizheng
is asking for 200,000 dan of provisions,

65
00:06:35,502 --> 00:06:37,682
10,000 winter coats, and 20,000 rolls of cloth.

66
00:06:38,362 --> 00:06:39,962
He's asking for a lot.

67
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:42,602
Tell me.

68
00:06:43,602 --> 00:06:47,802
What does Su Haizheng want?

69
00:06:48,322 --> 00:06:50,442
First, he is a greedy man.

70
00:06:50,442 --> 00:06:52,122
He's asking for more

71
00:06:52,122 --> 00:06:54,722
in the name of the army for personal gains.

72
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:09,856
Secondly?

73
00:07:10,402 --> 00:07:11,522
Secondly,

74
00:07:11,522 --> 00:07:14,922
he's coming after you
and the Qu family for revenge.

75
00:07:16,482 --> 00:07:17,722
You're truly wise.

76
00:07:18,562 --> 00:07:21,642
Su Haizhen and his son blamed their demotion

77
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:22,722
on us.

78
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:24,922
And you caught them

79
00:07:24,922 --> 00:07:26,842
slaughtering people for looting.

80
00:07:26,842 --> 00:07:29,282
Of course, they'd seek revenge.

81
00:07:31,602 --> 00:07:32,608
Don't worry.

82
00:07:33,362 --> 00:07:37,042
Although they're asking for
a huge amount of provisions,

83
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:41,882
thankfully, we have
120,000 dan of grains in stock.

84
00:07:42,842 --> 00:07:44,962
Also, I managed to get another

85
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,162
50,000 dan of grains.

86
00:07:49,242 --> 00:07:52,442
Still, we need another 30,000 dan.

87
00:07:54,962 --> 00:07:56,602
That's not little.

88
00:07:57,762 --> 00:08:01,842
But with the reputation of the Qu family,

89
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:03,584
we can manage it.

90
00:08:04,202 --> 00:08:08,002
[For the benefit of the people]
It's good that you're not praying for luck.

91

92

00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:20,962
they're targeting Pei Shouyue and his wife.

95
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:27,362
His Majesty demoted them so swiftly back then.

96
00:08:27,922 --> 00:08:32,002
It's easy for them to realize that

97
00:08:32,802 --> 00:08:34,282
Pei Shouyue

98
00:08:34,802 --> 00:08:38,282
has filed a complaint against them first.

99

Our friendship with Pei Shouyue

101
00:08:57,402 --> 00:09:02,362
can stand any inspection,
but we still have to be careful.

102

I bet they have some grains in stock.

106

Rest assured. I'll work on it tomorrow.

107
00:09:36,202 --> 00:09:40,842
Although we can manage the expropriation,

108
00:09:42,162 --> 00:09:47,122
[Skillful and Experienced]
pay attention to the troop mobilization.

109
00:09:49,002 --> 00:09:54,882
According to the military order,
we get to keep only 1000 local troops or so

110
00:09:54,882 --> 00:09:57,722
throughout the dozen cities in Xizhou.

111
00:09:59,282 --> 00:10:05,602
So we must keep all the elites.

112
00:10:06,362 --> 00:10:11,904
Our servants and subordinates

113
00:10:14,762 --> 00:10:16,362
should also stay alert.

The news came out yesterday,

121

and the market price of rice rose by 20% today.

122
00:10:57,562 --> 00:11:00,062
We don't have much in stock.

123
00:11:00,062 --> 00:11:02,762
I wonder what price you're offering...

00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:06,522
Naturally, I'm willing to pay
according to the market price today.

00:14:36,482 --> 00:14:39,522
we had to befriend
some major families in Xizhou.

182
00:14:41,322 --> 00:14:42,882
Good idea.

183
00:14:44,682 --> 00:14:47,342
Tell them to make sure that

184
00:14:47,342 --> 00:14:50,962
all the major families
sever their ties with the Qu family.

185
00:14:50,962 --> 00:14:53,762
Things will be easier like that.

186
00:14:54,442 --> 00:14:55,520
Yes, Sir.

187
00:15:00,196 --> 00:15:04,928
[Qu's Mansion]

188
00:15:11,442 --> 00:15:12,762
Father, the guests are here.

189
00:15:16,722 --> 00:15:18,082
I pay my respect, Governor.

190
00:15:18,082 --> 00:15:19,242
I pay my respect.

191
00:15:19,242 --> 00:15:21,282
Nice to meet you, Mr. Su.

192
00:15:21,282 --> 00:15:22,482
This is Advisor Lu.

193
00:15:24,202 --> 00:15:25,362
Take a seat.

194
00:15:32,602 --> 00:15:35,842
How's it going with the provision gathering?

195
00:15:38,082 --> 00:15:42,562
This is the expropriation notice
we're going to send out.

196
00:15:43,562 --> 00:15:45,442
Please take a look, Mr. Su.

197
00:15:53,842 --> 00:15:56,162
You and your son truly care for the people.

198
00:15:56,962 --> 00:15:59,102
But according to the numbers here,

199
00:15:59,102 --> 00:16:02,962
we're still 80,000 dan of grains
and 20,000 rolls of cloth short.

200
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:07,682
I wonder how you're going to fill in the gap.

201
00:16:08,322 --> 00:16:09,682
Here's the thing, Mr. Su.

202
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,202
The weather was awful this autumn.

203
00:16:14,082 --> 00:16:15,282
Senior Official Pei managed

204
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:19,962
to get 50,000 dan of grains
just in case there's a drought next year.

205
00:16:20,762 --> 00:16:24,762
But unfortunately, we need to
expropriate grains and we're still

206
00:16:24,762 --> 00:16:26,282
30,000 dan short.

207
00:16:26,962 --> 00:16:29,602
We have a balance from the business tax.

208
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,902
Apart from 20,000 rolls of cloth,

209
00:16:31,902 --> 00:16:34,082
my father would dig into his pocket

210
00:16:34,922 --> 00:16:38,482
and buy 30,000 dan of grains
from the major families

211
00:16:39,002 --> 00:16:40,802
to fill in the gap.

212
00:16:45,442 --> 00:16:48,882
Xizhou has proved to be a wealthy place.

213
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,202
I wouldn't call it "wealthy".

214
00:16:55,202 --> 00:16:57,602
Since you have a plan for the expropriation,

215
00:16:58,482 --> 00:17:00,082
I'll leave you to it.

216
00:17:38,882 --> 00:17:41,362
Pei Xingjian is quite active.

217
00:17:42,322 --> 00:17:44,442
Is he a fortune-teller or something?

218
00:17:45,282 --> 00:17:47,462
Advisor Lu just told me that

219
00:17:47,462 --> 00:17:51,722
we shouldn't worry
because they may not get it their way.

220
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:56,362
Do you have a plan?

221
00:17:58,082 --> 00:18:02,262
I have a disciple who's from the sub-branch
of the Zhang family from Dunhuang.

222
00:18:02,262 --> 00:18:04,862
He's a county magistrate in Gaochang.

223
00:18:04,862 --> 00:18:06,842
He will visit me tomorrow morning.

224
00:18:07,402 --> 00:18:09,882
Please join us for a talk.

225
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:17,582
Why should I meet

226
00:18:17,582 --> 00:18:19,362
a nobody?

227
00:18:22,722 --> 00:18:24,102
I've heard that

228
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:27,562
Governor Qu has been
leading a secluded life this year.

229
00:18:28,282 --> 00:18:29,442
He has aged

230
00:18:29,962 --> 00:18:32,122
and his health condition is deteriorating.

231
00:18:32,122 --> 00:18:35,602
These noble families rely on the Qu family.

232
00:18:36,602 --> 00:18:39,642
If anything happens to Governor Qu,

233
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:43,842
who will the imperial court make
the next Governor?

234
00:18:44,682 --> 00:18:48,482
It should be Qu Chongyu or Pei Xingjian.

235
00:18:49,402 --> 00:18:53,802
Exactly, but Pei Xingjian has been avoiding

236
00:18:53,802 --> 00:18:55,202
these noble families.

237
00:18:56,162 --> 00:18:59,022
Qu Chongyu is arrogant and mean.

238
00:18:59,022 --> 00:19:01,082
He's never close to them, either.

239
00:19:02,282 --> 00:19:05,302
The noble families in Xizhou
are looking for a new backbone.

240
00:19:05,302 --> 00:19:07,762
They dare not offend you.

241
00:19:09,322 --> 00:19:12,642
What should I do tomorrow? Please enlighten me.

242
00:19:13,882 --> 00:19:15,042
I'm flattered.

243
00:19:20,442 --> 00:19:23,462
All you have to do is tell them that

244
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:24,882
you're here at Xizhou

245
00:19:24,882 --> 00:19:27,082
not only to share the burden of the governor

246
00:19:27,602 --> 00:19:30,022
but also to prevent anyone
from giving them a hard time

247
00:19:30,022 --> 00:19:32,202
in the name of expropriation

248
00:19:33,082 --> 00:19:36,402
because the noble families
are the backbone of the Western Regions

249
00:19:37,282 --> 00:19:40,802
and the foundation of the Great Tang.

250
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:54,948
[Tea]

251
00:19:59,682 --> 00:20:00,682
Advisor, please wait.

252
00:20:01,402 --> 00:20:04,442
Please tell Mr. Su to wait for a second.

253
00:20:22,162 --> 00:20:24,282
Why is Zhang Huaiji sneaking around?

254
00:20:25,282 --> 00:20:28,882
Mr. Su? Is he referring to Su Nanjin?

255
00:20:58,308 --> 00:21:01,408
[Protector-General's Mansion]

256
00:21:13,242 --> 00:21:16,282
I'm holding a birthday feast
for my mother tomorrow.

257
00:21:19,682 --> 00:21:21,562
Would you join us, Minister?

258
00:21:22,402 --> 00:21:25,362
I should attend my auntie's birthday feast.

259
00:21:25,362 --> 00:21:29,122
But I'm overwhelmed with work.

260
00:21:29,882 --> 00:21:32,282
Please ask her for forgiveness.

261
00:21:33,402 --> 00:21:34,496
Don't worry about it.

262
00:21:36,002 --> 00:21:37,120
I decided...

263
00:21:39,602 --> 00:21:43,242
I decided this in a rush.
It's not really her birthday.

264
00:21:43,242 --> 00:21:44,442
She's just ill.

265
00:21:44,442 --> 00:21:47,002
A fortune-teller suggested
we ward off the misfortune

266
00:21:47,002 --> 00:21:48,482
with a grand gathering.

267
00:21:49,162 --> 00:21:51,842
You're in charge of the expropriation.

268
00:21:52,482 --> 00:21:54,602
I'm sure my mother would understand.

269
00:21:56,562 --> 00:21:57,632
Thank you.

270
00:22:06,048 --> 00:22:07,122
Go away.

271
00:22:07,122 --> 00:22:08,256
Sorry.

272
00:22:08,256 --> 00:22:09,632
Go away.

273
00:22:18,802 --> 00:22:20,962
That Mr. Su kept staring
at the Governor's Mansion.

274
00:22:24,882 --> 00:22:25,952
Thank you.

275
00:22:37,802 --> 00:22:38,848
Anything else?

276
00:22:43,402 --> 00:22:44,802
We need a lot of grains.

277
00:22:44,802 --> 00:22:47,302
The major families don't mind offering some.

278
00:22:47,302 --> 00:22:49,922
But Xizhou has seen harvest for years.

279
00:22:49,922 --> 00:22:53,122
I'm sure each family
can offer two or three dan of grains.

280
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:55,122
Isn't it a safer plan?

281
00:22:55,802 --> 00:22:56,864
You know

282
00:22:58,482 --> 00:22:59,722
that we have to hand in

283
00:23:01,242 --> 00:23:04,242
all the stocks for years and what we purchased

284
00:23:04,242 --> 00:23:05,442
in the past few months.

285
00:23:06,322 --> 00:23:08,522
If the people don't have any grains at home,

286
00:23:09,242 --> 00:23:12,402
what should they do
if there's a natural disaster

287
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:15,602
or if we apply taxes next year?

288
00:23:18,122 --> 00:23:19,882
But those major families

289
00:23:19,882 --> 00:23:22,802
keep the rice to make rice wine.

290
00:23:23,522 --> 00:23:25,642
You can purchase their rice at a high price.

291
00:23:25,642 --> 00:23:27,882
And they're willing to sell to you.

292
00:23:31,962 --> 00:23:36,442
What? Are you really waiting
to profit from the people

293
00:23:37,202 --> 00:23:38,802
when there's a disaster?

294
00:23:41,682 --> 00:23:45,312
You're truly considerate. I'm just asking.

295
00:23:49,882 --> 00:23:53,122
I heard that Senior Official Pei is home.

296
00:23:53,122 --> 00:23:54,302
I'm going to visit him.

297
00:23:54,302 --> 00:23:56,642
I know he may not be available for the feast.

298
00:23:56,642 --> 00:23:57,882
But I should invite him.

299
00:23:59,042 --> 00:24:02,802
I need to talk to him, too. Let's go together.

302
00:24:17,536 --> 00:24:18,624
I'll wait.

303
00:24:20,962 --> 00:24:23,862
We'll leave you to talk.

304
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:26,242
We'll report to you later.

305
00:24:26,762 --> 00:24:27,776
Just a minute.

306
00:24:31,282 --> 00:24:35,402

and come to my mother's birthday feast?

310
00:24:40,642 --> 00:24:42,882
Advisor, look at me.

311
00:24:43,602 --> 00:24:44,962
I'm swamped with work.

312
00:24:45,762 --> 00:24:47,042
How about this?

313
00:24:47,042 --> 00:24:49,922
I will visit her another day.
Will that be alright?

314
00:24:50,482 --> 00:24:53,522
Forgive me. I dare not hold you back.

315
00:24:53,522 --> 00:24:55,442
Please don't mind me.

316
00:24:57,842 --> 00:25:00,802
Please come to the feast if you're free.

317
00:25:02,282 --> 00:25:04,042
Congratulations. Of course.

318
00:25:04,042 --> 00:25:05,922
Thank you. Please join us.

319
00:25:06,442 --> 00:25:08,222
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

Chancellor, Mr. Su is here.

321
00:25:11,162 --> 00:25:12,192
Bring him in.

Shouyue, it's been so long.
You look great as always.

323
00:25:18,242 --> 00:25:21,402
Ziyu, it's been so long. I've missed you.

324
00:25:22,442 --> 00:25:24,522
I pay my respect, Senior Official Pei.

325
00:25:27,922 --> 00:25:30,362
Chongyu, I knew you'd be here.

326
00:25:31,482 --> 00:25:33,202
I'm here for work just like you.

327
00:25:43,882 --> 00:25:45,242
Please do us the honor

328
00:25:45,242 --> 00:25:48,362
and attend my mother's
birthday feast tomorrow if possible.

329
00:25:54,122 --> 00:25:55,842
Thank you for inviting us.

330
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,002
Farewell.

331
00:26:04,722 --> 00:26:06,362
Senior Official Pei, you're so dedicated.

332
00:26:07,602 --> 00:26:10,082
I bet you're doing well with the expropriation.

333
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,242
I just gathered

334
00:26:12,242 --> 00:26:14,442
some stocked grains from nearby towns.

335
00:26:15,162 --> 00:26:17,682
You two have traveled a lot and done so much.

336
00:26:17,682 --> 00:26:20,242
I'm no match for you.

337
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,122
We have gathered some provisions.

338
00:26:23,842 --> 00:26:25,442
But the commander left us

339
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,242
only the local troops for city defense.

340
00:26:28,802 --> 00:26:29,962
How are you going to

341
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,762
find someone to transfer the provisions?

342
00:26:34,522 --> 00:26:36,562
I bet you have a plan in mind.

343
00:26:37,402 --> 00:26:39,802
Your words reassure us.

344
00:26:42,002 --> 00:26:45,382
The commander
has a plan for the provision transfer.

345
00:26:45,382 --> 00:26:48,722
We'll need your help.

346
00:26:53,562 --> 00:26:57,202
Chongyu, I bet you have things to talk about.

347
00:26:57,202 --> 00:26:58,682
I'll leave you to it.

348
00:27:27,282 --> 00:27:29,722
What is Su Nanjin up to?

349
00:27:32,082 --> 00:27:35,822
Why? Is there something weird
about the invitation?

350
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:37,682
It didn't seem weird at first.

351
00:27:38,562 --> 00:27:42,282
But it's getting interesting
if you look closely.

352
00:27:45,722 --> 00:27:48,602
Advisor Zhang said that
he decided to hold this feast

353
00:27:49,282 --> 00:27:51,522
at the last minute to ward off misfortune.

354
00:27:52,202 --> 00:27:54,762
The handwriting does look careless.

355
00:27:54,762 --> 00:27:56,562
But I guess it's normal.

356
00:27:57,122 --> 00:27:58,362
The handwriting is normal.

357
00:27:59,442 --> 00:28:02,322
But he came to
hand out invitations and bumped into

358
00:28:03,122 --> 00:28:04,682
Su Nanjin and the advisor

359
00:28:05,242 --> 00:28:08,362
who seemed to be his acquaintance.
Does it look normal?

360
00:28:10,242 --> 00:28:12,002
He invited them casually.

361
00:28:12,002 --> 00:28:14,482
And they said they'd visit tomorrow.

362
00:28:15,002 --> 00:28:16,082
Is that also normal?

363
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:21,042
I just want to know
if someone from the Zhang family

364
00:28:21,602 --> 00:28:23,562
has visited them today.

365
00:28:29,642 --> 00:28:33,602
Right now, Su Ziyu is the son of the commander.

366
00:28:34,322 --> 00:28:36,962
Understandably, the major families
want to make connections.

367
00:28:37,602 --> 00:28:40,442
But I don't think they dare

368
00:28:40,442 --> 00:28:42,162
to betray us.

369
00:28:42,922 --> 00:28:46,560
Master.

370
00:28:47,482 --> 00:28:48,576
Minister.

371
00:28:51,962 --> 00:28:55,082
What's wrong? We don't have to
hide anything from the minister.

372
00:28:56,522 --> 00:28:58,922
Master, Madam sent you a message.

373
00:28:58,922 --> 00:29:01,882
Advisor Zhang Huaiji met Mr. Su and his advisor

374
00:29:01,882 --> 00:29:04,482
before he entered the Minister's mansion.

375
00:29:05,642 --> 00:29:07,982
They sat at the tea house opposite

376
00:29:07,982 --> 00:29:09,082
of the Governor's mansion

377
00:29:09,962 --> 00:29:12,922
and followed Zhang Huaiji
into the Governor's mansion

378
00:29:12,922 --> 00:29:14,242
right afterward.

379
00:29:14,922 --> 00:29:18,562
Madam suspects that
they're up to something. Please be careful.

380
00:29:21,682 --> 00:29:22,720
That's it.

381
00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:26,202
Su Nanjin knows that we won't attend the feast

382
00:29:26,802 --> 00:29:27,840
and is using this

383
00:29:28,682 --> 00:29:31,042
to approach the major families.

384
00:29:31,042 --> 00:29:32,842
I'm afraid you'll see

385
00:29:33,442 --> 00:29:36,282
some trouble regarding the grains.

386
00:29:37,882 --> 00:29:39,602
I want to post a notice tomorrow.

387
00:29:40,682 --> 00:29:45,122
I'm planning to quadruple
the rice wine tax from October.

388
00:29:47,282 --> 00:29:48,682
That's what I was thinking.

389
00:29:49,282 --> 00:29:51,242
I'd post it after you buy grains.

390
00:29:51,842 --> 00:29:52,922
I guess that's it.

391
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:57,162
I'll draft the notice and post it tomorrow.

392

[Zhang Mansion]

394
00:30:37,762 --> 00:30:38,816
Greetings, brother.

395
00:30:41,402 --> 00:30:42,762
Have you been informed?

396
00:30:44,162 --> 00:30:48,042
It's my honor to play the zither
for our distinguished guests.

397
00:30:48,882 --> 00:30:50,162
It's not like that.

398
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:53,002
You're only playing

399
00:30:53,002 --> 00:30:54,762
for the uncles and aunties on a whim.

400
00:30:54,762 --> 00:30:57,682
You have no idea
about any distinguished guests.

401
00:30:59,122 --> 00:31:00,122
Understood.

402
00:31:00,122 --> 00:31:02,582
Good. Let me go wait.

403
00:31:02,582 --> 00:31:04,482
I'll leave you to talk.

404
00:31:06,084 --> 00:31:10,084
[An arduous task]

405
00:31:11,162 --> 00:31:12,256
Come here.

406
00:31:15,242 --> 00:31:17,642
I've heard of what has happened.

407
00:31:19,202 --> 00:31:20,842
Mr. Su is coming for a reason.

408
00:31:21,522 --> 00:31:25,102
Does he want to join hands with us

409
00:31:25,102 --> 00:31:27,222
against Qu Chongyu and Senior Official Pei?

410
00:31:27,222 --> 00:31:28,442
Don't talk nonsense.

411
00:31:31,562 --> 00:31:33,082
Watch your mouth.

412
00:31:33,082 --> 00:31:35,282
I'm sorry, brother. I was inconsiderate.

413
00:31:38,242 --> 00:31:39,922
That's right, you were.

414
00:31:40,642 --> 00:31:41,962
Against Qu Chongyu?

415
00:31:42,522 --> 00:31:44,642
Don't you know our tie with the Qu family?

416
00:31:45,242 --> 00:31:47,362
Remember. Your auntie is from the Qu family.

417
00:31:48,602 --> 00:31:50,362
But Chongyu is too willful.

418
00:31:51,002 --> 00:31:53,522
He didn't let us get a share of the workshop

419
00:31:53,522 --> 00:31:54,682
back then.

420
00:31:55,282 --> 00:31:58,042
And he's been giving us a hard time along with

421
00:31:58,042 --> 00:31:59,122
Chancellor Pei.

422
00:31:59,882 --> 00:32:01,882
We just want him to realize

423
00:32:01,882 --> 00:32:05,742
that he can't count on
the common people or the businessmen.

424
00:32:05,742 --> 00:32:09,082
Xizhou counts on people like us.

425
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:14,562
Meanwhile, Mr. Su is a distinguished man
with a strong character.

426
00:32:14,562 --> 00:32:15,982
He may be a military man,

427
00:32:15,982 --> 00:32:18,402
but he sees things more clearly than Chongyu.

428
00:32:19,042 --> 00:32:21,762
He came to the feast to enjoy our company.

429
00:32:22,722 --> 00:32:25,382
He's holding grudges
against Senior Official Pei.

430
00:32:25,382 --> 00:32:28,682
Chongyu knows it and keeps
hanging out with Senior Official Pei.

431
00:32:29,362 --> 00:32:31,402
Then he is to blame if he's in trouble.

432
00:32:33,082 --> 00:32:34,112
I see.

433
00:32:35,362 --> 00:32:38,462
Just play the zither today
and don't mind anything else.

434
00:32:38,462 --> 00:32:40,042
I'll do the rest for you.

435
00:32:41,802 --> 00:32:43,762
Mr. Su is as well-respected

436
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:45,422
as Qu Chongyu.

437
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:46,762
He's also quite handsome.

438
00:32:47,562 --> 00:32:48,762
He deserves your music.

439
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:50,880
Thank you, brother.

440
00:32:52,042 --> 00:32:54,442
I was ignorant and arrogant.

441
00:32:54,442 --> 00:32:56,322
Thank you for taking care of me.

442
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,402
I will do as you say from now on.

443
00:33:08,042 --> 00:33:10,582
It's a serious matter. We'll talk about it.

444
00:33:10,582 --> 00:33:11,982
Rest assured, brother.

445
00:33:11,982 --> 00:33:13,682
I always keep my promise.

446
00:33:14,282 --> 00:33:17,202
I know I should see the big picture here.

447
00:33:18,762 --> 00:33:21,202
I will behave and play the zither.

about that Mr. Su?

461

No need, it doesn't matter.

462

What matters is...

00:34:57,442 --> 00:34:58,464
Na.

00:35:00,882 --> 00:35:05,082

465

That's right.

466

What a wonderful melody.

467

Advisor, could you please tell that musician
to play another song?

468
00:35:24,362 --> 00:35:27,202
I've been tired
of the pipa songs in the Western Regions.

I've been away from Chang'an for years.

478
00:35:54,002 --> 00:35:57,122
That song made me nostalgic.

My mother has aged and my wife is ill.

Mr. Su asked for permission to marry you.

He has a wife in Chang'an,

who's been ill.

511
00:39:30,082 --> 00:39:31,722
He has only a daughter.

He's always wanted to marry someone here.

513
00:39:34,802 --> 00:39:36,822
But they have no noble families in Yizhou.

514
00:39:36,822 --> 00:39:38,362
That's why he never did.

515
00:39:39,402 --> 00:39:42,662
Today, he asked to make you his second wife.

516
00:39:42,662 --> 00:39:43,776
Second wife?

00:39:45,162 --> 00:39:47,482
Brother, does he really have the right

518
00:39:47,482 --> 00:39:49,042
to decide it on his own?

519
00:39:50,442 --> 00:39:52,962
Don't worry. I've asked him.

520

Commander Su

00:39:55,202 --> 00:39:58,602
has been urging Mr. Su to look for a noble lady

to have more descendants.

523
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:04,002
Before they came to Xizhou,
the commander told Mr. Su

524
00:40:04,522 --> 00:40:07,402
to make it formal if he met a nice girl.

525
00:40:07,922 --> 00:40:10,822
The commander can't come here
due to the pending war.

526

But Mr. Su has Advisor Wang with him,

who's an old friend of the commander.

528
00:40:15,682 --> 00:40:17,882

What's wrong? Aren't you happy?

531
00:40:37,962 --> 00:40:40,882
Mr. Su said "Second wife". I believe him.

532
00:40:40,882 --> 00:40:44,502
You're not the original wife,
but you will be included in their family tree.

533

Besides, he's sincere.

I dare not be greedy.

00:40:56,362 --> 00:40:59,362
Why did Mr. Su come here?

537
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:02,802
How did the commander plan everything

538
00:41:02,802 --> 00:41:04,482
before they came here?

539
00:41:06,802 --> 00:41:09,642
Is he here for the provisions or a new wife?

00:41:17,962 --> 00:41:22,602
But it's serious. We have to make plans.

542
00:41:25,922 --> 00:41:29,322
Speaking of which,
we must hand in the grains tomorrow.

543
00:41:30,042 --> 00:41:33,502
All the noble families are watching us.

544
00:41:33,502 --> 00:41:35,162
Brother, have you thought about it?

545
00:41:35,162 --> 00:41:37,082
If we agree to the proposal,

546
00:41:37,682 --> 00:41:40,442
what should we do tomorrow?

547
00:41:50,602 --> 00:41:51,616
Father.

548
00:41:53,122 --> 00:41:55,642
Father, why did you call me back in a rush?

549
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:03,202
[Father of Wang Junmeng]

550
00:42:03,202 --> 00:42:05,600
What do we do about the grains tomorrow?

551
00:42:06,372 --> 00:42:08,452
All the noble families have agreed

552
00:42:09,122 --> 00:42:12,722
to hand in no more than
500 dan of grains tomorrow.

553
00:42:13,562 --> 00:42:15,162
Are they crazy?

554
00:42:15,162 --> 00:42:17,682
Don't they know Chongyu?

555
00:42:17,682 --> 00:42:20,002
How do they have the nerve to challenge him?

556
00:42:20,602 --> 00:42:23,602
They used to look up to Governor Qu.

557
00:42:24,362 --> 00:42:26,682
Of course, Chongyu could manage them.

558
00:42:26,682 --> 00:42:30,422
But now, he's offended the commander.

559
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:33,022
No one knows if he's going to be fine.

560
00:42:33,022 --> 00:42:35,662
You think he's still in charge of Xizhou?

561
00:42:35,662 --> 00:42:37,362
Father, are you saying that

562
00:42:38,242 --> 00:42:39,360
the noble families

563
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,962
are joining hands against the Qu family?

564
00:42:45,282 --> 00:42:46,368
That's right.

566
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:56,736
♫ I write my longing for you in Spring ♫

567
00:42:57,764 --> 00:43:02,368
♫ The red plum is in full bloom like you ♫

568
00:43:03,588 --> 00:43:06,912
♫ By the pond, next to the willow trees ♫

569
00:43:06,912 --> 00:43:10,560
♫ I write a poem
to tell our story from the past ♫

570
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:15,520
♫ The years pass by like a bird♫

571
00:43:17,252 --> 00:43:22,016
♫ The destiny always comes with regrets ♫

572
00:43:23,876 --> 00:43:28,736
♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫

573
00:43:30,276 --> 00:43:33,184
♫ Outside the pavilion, by the bridge ♫

574
00:43:33,184 --> 00:43:36,704
♫ Under the moonlight,
we parted at the doorstep ♫

575
00:43:36,704 --> 00:43:43,008
♫ I've endured hardship
to tell our lingering story ♫

576
00:43:43,008 --> 00:43:46,496
♫ Remembrance of past things ♫

577
00:43:46,496 --> 00:43:49,568
♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫

578
00:43:49,568 --> 00:43:53,088
♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫

579
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:56,608
♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫

580
00:43:56,608 --> 00:43:59,456
♫ A snowy day, someone sings a sad song ♫

581
00:43:59,456 --> 00:44:02,528
♫ Against the window,
I had a drink for pleasure ♫

582
00:44:02,528 --> 00:44:06,144
♫ The moon still hangs in the sky,
but I'm no longer in the mood ♫

583
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:11,008
♫ It's quite and cold outside,
but I grab my pen again ♫

584
00:44:24,356 --> 00:44:29,632
♫ The destiny always comes with regrets ♫

585
00:44:30,916 --> 00:44:37,024
♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫

586
00:44:37,024 --> 00:44:40,224
♫ Outside the pavilion, by the bridge ♫

587
00:44:40,224 --> 00:44:43,520
♫ Under the moonlight,
we parted at the doorstep ♫

♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫

595
00:45:09,952 --> 00:45:13,184
♫ I look outside, like the poems asking ♫

596
00:45:13,184 --> 00:45:18,176
♫ My love, have you
found someone good for you ♫

597
