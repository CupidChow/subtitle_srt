Cui,

4
00:01:38,912 --> 00:01:39,936
Madam,

5
00:01:40,611 --> 00:01:43,811
For some reason,
I always feel something is not right,

6
00:01:45,051 --> 00:01:47,351
Qu Zhizhan has never reported to me,

7
00:01:47,351 --> 00:01:48,931
It really defies common sense,

8
00:01:50,091 --> 00:01:51,411
Prepare more people,

9
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:54,691
In a few days, they may be of great use,

10
00:01:55,851 --> 00:01:57,291
Yes, Madam,

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,304
<i>Grandpa,</i>

13
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:51,251
<i>No need to wait,
He has already returned to Xizhou,</i>

14
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:55,616
<i>That is tough for you,</i>

15
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:00,091
<i>Our family owes you,</i>

16
00:04:02,011 --> 00:04:03,731
<i>Grandpa, please don't say that,</i>

17
00:04:05,451 --> 00:04:07,771
<i>Chongyu and I grew up together,</i>

18
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,811
<i>His ambitions lie in Xizhou,</i>

19
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,091
<i>Since his opportunity has finally come,</i>

20
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:18,051
<i>he won't let himself be encumbered
by romantic entanglements,</i>

21
00:04:18,651 --> 00:04:19,680
<i>Over these years,</i>

22
00:04:20,691 --> 00:04:22,571
<i>you've sacrificed too much for our family</i>

23
00:04:23,451 --> 00:04:25,091

24
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:27,091
<i>But rest assured,</i>

25
00:04:27,811 --> 00:04:29,131
<i>I can assure you</i>

26
00:04:30,656 --> 00:04:31,691
<i>that your child</i>

27
00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:34,691
<i>will inherit everything from our family</i>

28
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,811
<i>and become the head of our family</i>

29
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:38,331
<i>and the master of Xizhou,</i>

30

<i>Sooner or later,</i>

31
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:54,931
<i>I will pass this family seal to him personally,</i>

32
00:05:16,011 --> 00:05:17,051
<i>Look at this child,</i>

33
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:18,091
<i>Over these past few months,</i>

00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:20,931
<i>the Princess seems
to have shown me great favor,</i>

35
00:05:21,651 --> 00:05:23,291
<i>but, in reality, it's been a smokescreen,</i>

36
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:28,211
<i>The Princess is using me and Song'er</i>

37
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:30,331
<i>to let Chongyu and others bow in obedience,</i>

38
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,971
<i>For the safety of Song'er,</i>

39
00:05:32,971 --> 00:05:34,891
<i>I could only recognize her as my foster mother,</i>

40
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:38,051
<i>The Princess is ruthless,</i>

41
00:05:38,731 --> 00:05:40,311
<i>If Song'er and I are even a bit careless,</i>

42
00:05:40,311 --> 00:05:41,731
<i>we will definitely fall into her vicious trap,</i>

43
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:46,011
<i>Grandpa sent me the real family seal,</i>

44
00:05:47,451 --> 00:05:49,131

<i>[Songzhu Pavilion]</i>

46
00:06:21,611 --> 00:06:22,624
Ms, Murong,

47
00:06:23,211 --> 00:06:24,288
Who are you?

48
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:26,016
Kudi Liuli,

49
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:28,611
It's you, Aren't you…?

50
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:31,051
I acted a play to meet you,

51
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:32,971
To meet me?

52
00:06:33,731 --> 00:06:35,851
Do you know you've been used by the Princess?

53
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:44,291
I know something more or less

54
00:06:44,851 --> 00:06:46,411
about the things between you,

55
00:06:47,131 --> 00:06:48,591
But sorry, I can't provide assistance,

56
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:49,731
Please wait,

57
00:06:51,971 --> 00:06:53,491
The Qu family were just glorified surrenderers,

58
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,931
We have no power in Chang'an
and are bullied by others,

59
00:06:58,531 --> 00:07:00,291
If not for the protection of the Princess,

60
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,336
I fear that

61
00:07:03,011 --> 00:07:04,451
we wouldn't even be able to have a full meal,

62
00:07:05,411 --> 00:07:06,931
The Princess is not a kind person,

63
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,451
Do not be deceived by her,

64
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:12,051
I know what kind of person she is

65
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:13,771
very well,

66
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:16,931
The things she did to Pei Shouyue

67
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:19,451
are not secrets anymore,

68
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:22,051
But what can be done after we know that?

69
00:07:23,731 --> 00:07:24,971
We have little influence,

70
00:07:26,171 --> 00:07:27,331
We really can't do much,

71
00:07:29,411 --> 00:07:30,731
I don't need you to do anything,

72
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:34,011
I just hope you don't side with the Princess,

73
00:07:37,411 --> 00:07:39,851
I'm sorry, I have no other choices,

74
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,091
I know what you want me to do for you,

75
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:48,411
but I can tell you honestly

76
00:07:50,051 --> 00:07:51,891
I dare not, nor can I,

77
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,371
It should be clear to you

78
00:07:55,531 --> 00:07:58,331
the Empress can give you
what the Princess gives you

79
00:07:58,971 --> 00:08:01,691
and what she can't,

80
00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:04,811
Are you saying…?

81
00:08:04,811 --> 00:08:05,856
If not,

82
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:08,491
how could Protector-General Qu
agree to let me return

83
00:08:08,491 --> 00:08:11,571
and hand over the family seal to you?

84
00:08:19,011 --> 00:08:20,091
What do you want me to do?

85
00:09:07,651 --> 00:09:09,891
What a pleasant surprise,

86
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:12,711
I was just wondering

87
00:09:12,711 --> 00:09:15,091
why my right eyelid kept twitching yesterday,

88
00:09:15,771 --> 00:09:18,251
Turns out something good was happening,

89
00:09:26,411 --> 00:09:28,011
Greetings, Princess,

90
00:09:29,811 --> 00:09:31,211
Greetings, Princess,

91
00:09:31,211 --> 00:09:32,291
Liuli,

92
00:09:33,051 --> 00:09:36,531
you have repeatedly defied me

93
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:40,811
and now you're even going to sabotage my plan,

94
00:09:42,651 --> 00:09:44,771
Fuxian, don't be afraid,

95
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,336
Come,

96
00:09:46,851 --> 00:09:48,491
You did a great job,

97
00:09:48,491 --> 00:09:50,011
I believe now

98
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:52,011
you are loyal,

99
00:09:53,411 --> 00:09:55,091
I am not, I didn't, I…

100
00:09:55,091 --> 00:09:57,251
Easy, I believe you,

101
00:09:59,811 --> 00:10:01,091
Unappreciative,

102
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,696
Lady Liuli,

103
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:07,711
don't be a stranger,

104
00:10:07,711 --> 00:10:09,011
Why didn't you tell us

105
00:10:09,531 --> 00:10:11,171
you were back?

106
00:10:12,051 --> 00:10:14,291
Do you have a bad memory, Cui?

107
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:16,671
You forgot that so quickly,

108
00:10:16,671 --> 00:10:19,091
I offended the Princess not long ago

109
00:10:19,611 --> 00:10:21,011
and in her presence,

110
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:23,971
donated Shouyue's inherited property
to the court,

111
00:10:24,704 --> 00:10:25,728
I guess

112
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:28,291
she hates the sight of me the most,

113
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,491
right?

114
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:34,211
You really have an annoying talent,

115
00:10:35,411 --> 00:10:37,851
Are you sure I won't kill you?

116
00:10:38,811 --> 00:10:39,891
Absolutely not,

117
00:10:41,011 --> 00:10:43,311
If it hadn't been for you pushing me
to the edge,

118
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:45,691
I wouldn't have taken risks
to return to Chang'an,

119
00:10:47,891 --> 00:10:49,431
This place is desolate

120
00:10:49,431 --> 00:10:50,811
with few people,

121
00:10:51,331 --> 00:10:54,131
If I kill you now, who will know?

122
00:11:05,691 --> 00:11:06,971
If I don't return tonight,

123
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:11,251
my foster parents will go to your residence
to ask for me,

124
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,731
You are supposed to be in Xizhou now,

125
00:11:14,251 --> 00:11:16,091
You were assassinated and are now dying,

126
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:19,811
It's expected even if you die,

127
00:11:20,411 --> 00:11:21,440
Furthermore,

128
00:11:22,011 --> 00:11:24,491
you were hurt by a rioter from Xizhou,

129
00:11:25,011 --> 00:11:26,571
What does it have to do with me?

130
00:11:27,731 --> 00:11:28,768
Take her down,

131
00:11:38,691 --> 00:11:39,712
Don't move!

132
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:09,811
I wonder

133
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,491
if your lady has safely arrived at Chang'an

134
00:12:14,971 --> 00:12:16,571
and met my family,

135
00:12:17,691 --> 00:12:19,011
No need to worry too much,

136
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:22,291
I believe Liuli proposed going back
to save them herself

137
00:12:22,811 --> 00:12:24,091
with great confidence,

138
00:12:24,672 --> 00:12:25,696
Otherwise,

139
00:12:26,331 --> 00:12:28,011
I would not allow her to undertake the risk,

140
00:12:39,811 --> 00:12:40,832
Fuxian,

141
00:12:41,371 --> 00:12:42,371
what are you doing?

142
00:12:43,011 --> 00:12:44,851
Princess, I earnestly request you

143
00:12:45,691 --> 00:12:47,051
to let go of Kudi Liuli,

144
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:49,951
You're threatening me?

145
00:12:49,951 --> 00:12:51,271
If I die,

146
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,471
the Qu family
certainly won't let this go easily,

147
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:55,311
If Chongyu gets out of control,

148
00:12:55,311 --> 00:12:56,851
you are aware of the consequences,

149
00:13:00,331 --> 00:13:01,408
Ms, Murong,

150
00:13:03,691 --> 00:13:06,451
Fuxian, I advise you to stay calm,

151
00:13:07,131 --> 00:13:09,251
Even if you don't care for yourself,

152
00:13:09,251 --> 00:13:12,051
consider Song'er,

153
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:15,171
Song'er,

154
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,651
Song'er is young now,

155
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,051
If he loses her mother,

156
00:13:23,611 --> 00:13:25,531
he will be very sad,

157
00:13:29,251 --> 00:13:30,511
Or…

158
00:13:30,511 --> 00:13:33,491
do you even not care about Song'er?

159
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,360
Ms, Murong,

160
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:45,451
I appreciate your kindness,

161
00:13:50,432 --> 00:13:51,520
I'm sorry,

162
00:13:52,512 --> 00:13:53,651
I'm sorry,

163
00:13:54,371 --> 00:13:57,891
Let's who can come to save you now,

164
00:13:59,211 --> 00:14:00,811
Do you think

165
00:14:00,811 --> 00:14:02,331
I came back empty-handed?

166
00:14:20,931 --> 00:14:22,691
Protector-General Qu
entrusted these two letters

167
00:14:23,211 --> 00:14:25,651
to me before I set off,

168
00:14:25,651 --> 00:14:28,971
I wonder if you recognize them,

169
00:14:29,531 --> 00:14:30,971
Qu Zhizhan,

170
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,891
If by sunset today,

171
00:14:34,891 --> 00:14:36,331
I haven't returned home,

172
00:14:37,331 --> 00:14:39,371
my foster father
will enter the palace overnight

173
00:14:39,371 --> 00:14:41,731
and deliver these two letters to His Majesty,

174
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:44,611
If His Majesty reads these two letters,

175
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:48,131
what will happen to all of you?

176
00:15:07,891 --> 00:15:09,011
Liuli,

177
00:15:09,011 --> 00:15:11,131
I know you hold resentment,

178
00:15:11,131 --> 00:15:14,291
but no matter what, we are family,

179
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:17,051
Moreover,

180
00:15:17,051 --> 00:15:18,611
the Princess raised Shouyue,

181
00:15:18,611 --> 00:15:22,011
You won't go so far as to do such a thing,
will you?

182
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:24,931
The ones really going too far aren't us, right?

183
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:26,651
Well…

184
00:15:26,651 --> 00:15:29,971
You want to intimidate me
with just the envelopes?

185
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:33,051
If you don't believe,
you can have a wager with me,

186
00:15:33,771 --> 00:15:37,171
But I fear
that you can't bear the consequences,

187
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:39,584
Madam,

188
00:15:40,371 --> 00:15:41,440
Madam,

189
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:43,531
You can leave,

190
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:45,971
but she must stay,

191
00:15:48,131 --> 00:15:50,251
I hit it off with Ms, Murong at first sight

192
00:15:50,251 --> 00:15:52,411
and I'm looking forward to
chatting with her tonight,

193
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:55,771
I hope that you can extend your mercy,

194
00:15:56,411 --> 00:15:58,891
Qu Zhizhan is a cunning fox,

195
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,771
He never trusts anyone,

196
00:16:01,331 --> 00:16:03,331
Today, only you came alone,

197
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:06,491
Pei Shouyue did not come with you,

198
00:16:07,411 --> 00:16:09,531
He must have been taken as a hostage,

199
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:13,251
If you can fulfill your promise,
then that's settled,

200
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:15,931
If anything happens to her and their child,

201
00:16:16,531 --> 00:16:18,451
I guess

202
00:16:18,451 --> 00:16:20,411
Pei Shouyue will be beheaded,

203
00:16:23,131 --> 00:16:25,211
If you don't want her and their child to die,

204
00:16:25,731 --> 00:16:29,371
bring those two letters to my mansion
to see me tomorrow,

205
00:16:52,851 --> 00:16:55,091
If your lady cannot return victorious,

206
00:16:56,091 --> 00:16:57,771
my grandfather
will surely take action against you,

207
00:17:01,531 --> 00:17:03,031
Her trip to Chang'an

208
00:17:03,031 --> 00:17:04,211
is seemingly safe,

209
00:17:04,771 --> 00:17:05,792
but in reality,

210
00:17:06,531 --> 00:17:07,571
it's perilous,

211
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:09,991
That's completely clear

212
00:17:09,991 --> 00:17:11,811
in your mind,

213
00:17:12,691 --> 00:17:13,851
But even so,

214
00:17:14,651 --> 00:17:16,531
you still allowed her to go there alone,

215
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:18,464
I'll remember

216
00:17:20,032 --> 00:17:21,091
this favor,

217
00:17:21,691 --> 00:17:22,720
You're too serious,

218
00:17:24,051 --> 00:17:25,171
We proposed the condition

219
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:27,411
that we'd rescue your wife and children,

220
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,971
Of course we should take the risk,

221
00:17:32,211 --> 00:17:33,771
But your words just now

222
00:17:34,451 --> 00:17:36,771
greatly pleased me,

223
00:17:38,131 --> 00:17:39,251
It means

224
00:17:39,251 --> 00:17:41,971
our efforts were not without return,

225
00:17:46,272 --> 00:17:47,296
Shouyue,

226
00:17:49,331 --> 00:17:50,336
I wonder

227
00:17:51,411 --> 00:17:53,411
if I have a chance now

228
00:17:55,611 --> 00:17:56,811
to become your friend,

229
00:17:57,771 --> 00:17:59,611
I never thought of being your enemy,

230
00:18:01,184 --> 00:18:02,208
Not in the past,

231
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:03,840
Nor do I now,

232
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:05,411
Let alone in the future,

233
00:18:21,211 --> 00:18:23,611
Qu Zhizhan, that old scoundrel,

234
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,811
How dare he betray me?

235
00:18:27,211 --> 00:18:28,291
Madam, calm your anger,

236
00:18:28,851 --> 00:18:31,451
Qu Zhizhan's dishonest act is truly despicable,

237
00:18:31,971 --> 00:18:33,011
But our priority

238
00:18:33,691 --> 00:18:35,071
is to grab those two letters

239
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:37,251
from Liuli,

240
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:39,811
I'm afraid it won't be that easy,

241
00:18:40,608 --> 00:18:41,632
How so?

242
00:18:42,171 --> 00:18:43,491
Would she really disregard

243
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:47,691
the safety of Qu Chongyu's wife and child?

244
00:18:47,691 --> 00:18:51,031
Today, we have only temporarily subdued her,

245
00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:53,811
Kudi Liuli is not a fool,

246
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:58,091
Once she goes back and thinks it over calmly,

247
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:03,051
she'll realize
I won't truly harm Fuxian and her son,

248
00:19:03,571 --> 00:19:04,611
Why?

249
00:19:09,051 --> 00:19:10,131
I don't understand,

250
00:19:11,051 --> 00:19:12,731
The great army is about to set out,

251
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,331
In the battle with the northern forces,

252
00:19:16,331 --> 00:19:17,931
the loyalty of the Qu family

253
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,491
is the key to victory,

254
00:19:21,011 --> 00:19:23,171
If at this moment, they rebel,

255
00:19:23,891 --> 00:19:25,891
the whole country will blame me,

256
00:19:28,651 --> 00:19:31,451
Could it be that you anticipated all this?

257
00:19:33,011 --> 00:19:34,371
No,

258
00:19:35,371 --> 00:19:36,791
You said

259
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,251
if Murong Yi saw the family seal,

260
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:39,851
she'd go meet you, I believed it,

261
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:42,731
But how did you make sure

262
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:45,371
the Princess would secretly follow?

263
00:19:46,571 --> 00:19:48,651
Earlier, I used the name
of the merchants from Xizhou

264
00:19:48,651 --> 00:19:50,471
to spread the news that I'd been assassinated,

265
00:19:50,471 --> 00:19:51,891
That was a preparation for today,

266
00:19:52,731 --> 00:19:55,891
How are these two matters related?

267
00:19:56,691 --> 00:19:59,331
After receiving news of the assassination,

268
00:19:59,891 --> 00:20:02,911
the Princess should be thrilled
and be celebrating it,

269
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:06,011
Why would she suspect
you'd secretly return to Chang'an?

270
00:20:06,611 --> 00:20:08,851
Because she didn't receive a letter
from Qu Zhizhan,

271
00:20:09,691 --> 00:20:13,051
The Princess had received false news
of my death many times,

272
00:20:13,051 --> 00:20:14,451
which had long made her skeptical,

273
00:20:15,211 --> 00:20:17,551
This time, the news seemed true,

274
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:19,451
but she would not believe it rashly,

275
00:20:20,171 --> 00:20:22,251
What made her more suspicious was

276
00:20:22,251 --> 00:20:25,731
that the rumors had already spread throughout,

277
00:20:25,731 --> 00:20:29,331
yet there was no letter
of good tidings from Qu Zhizhan,

278
00:20:29,891 --> 00:20:31,631
She was filled with doubts,

279
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:34,651
so she'd have someone keep a close watch
on Qu Chongyu's wife and child,

280
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:37,091
What should we do then?

281
00:20:37,691 --> 00:20:38,720
Can we really do nothing

282
00:20:39,331 --> 00:20:41,491
about Kudi Liuli?

283
00:20:47,691 --> 00:20:48,891
If the letters

284
00:20:49,971 --> 00:20:51,811
in her hands are real…

285
00:20:59,251 --> 00:21:00,411
Didn't you say

286
00:21:00,411 --> 00:21:03,091
the letter the Princess wrote to Qu Zhizhan

287
00:21:03,091 --> 00:21:04,651
was burned a long time ago?

288
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:08,371
What are you going
to exchange for them tomorrow?

289
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,571
Or do you have other strategies?

290
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,371
This is…?

291
00:21:24,971 --> 00:21:25,984
That's not right,

292
00:21:26,891 --> 00:21:28,691
If she really has those two letters,

293
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:33,211
why does she have to go through
the trouble of persuading Fuxian?

294
00:21:34,011 --> 00:21:36,371
She could just take the letters directly to Wu,

295
00:21:36,371 --> 00:21:37,771
That would be a direct victory,

296
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:40,051
leaving me no chance to turn things around,

297
00:21:41,651 --> 00:21:42,720
You're right,

298
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:46,611
That roundabout action

299
00:21:46,611 --> 00:21:48,171
goes against common sense,

300
00:21:52,131 --> 00:21:53,152
Could it be

301
00:21:53,971 --> 00:21:55,851
that they were just empty envelopes

302
00:21:56,571 --> 00:21:58,091
and she fooled us?

303
00:21:59,211 --> 00:22:02,211
Have people escort Fuxian and her son
out of the mansion now,

304
00:22:03,371 --> 00:22:06,571
Hide them in a secluded place,

305
00:22:06,571 --> 00:22:08,211
You mean…?

306
00:22:08,211 --> 00:22:09,280
Stall,

307
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:14,051
Until the Qus lose their patience

308
00:22:14,771 --> 00:22:16,651
and have Pei Xingjian killed,

309
00:22:17,331 --> 00:22:18,451
By then,

310
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:22,811
Liuli won't have been a threat anymore
even if she's alive,

311
00:22:23,971 --> 00:22:26,411
Madam, you are wise,
and I will take care of it right away,

312
00:22:27,491 --> 00:22:28,608
Remember

313
00:22:31,131 --> 00:22:33,371
not to let anyone find them,

314
00:22:35,171 --> 00:22:36,291
Yes, Madam,

315
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:10,811
Greetings, Princess,

316
00:23:17,411 --> 00:23:19,571
Did you bring the thing I needed?

317
00:23:22,931 --> 00:23:25,171
That depends on your sincerity,

318
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:26,336
How audacious!

319
00:23:28,531 --> 00:23:29,991
I just want to save them,

320
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,751
I have no hostile intentions against you,

321
00:23:31,751 --> 00:23:34,291
I hope that you can extend your mercy

322
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:35,531
and let go of the innocent people,

323
00:23:36,771 --> 00:23:39,551
Fuxian and her son are my esteemed guests,

324
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:40,691
They come and go freely,

325
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,931
I've restricted their freedom,

326
00:23:43,931 --> 00:23:47,211
Last night, they left my residence,

327
00:23:47,211 --> 00:23:48,811
As for where they've gone,

328
00:23:49,491 --> 00:23:52,611
as an elder, it's not my place to ask,

329
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:01,311
They must have gone to a place
where we absolutely can't find them,

330
00:24:01,311 --> 00:24:02,331
Kudi Liuli,

331
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:03,424
No matter,

332
00:24:04,451 --> 00:24:06,411
Foreigners are all rude,

333
00:24:07,411 --> 00:24:10,411
How could I stoop to her level?

334
00:24:11,411 --> 00:24:13,291
Thank you for your understanding,

335
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:15,371
I will take my leave,

336
00:24:17,051 --> 00:24:18,051
Stop there,

337
00:24:20,131 --> 00:24:21,971
Leave the letters behind before you go,

338
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,251
Since they are no longer at your residence,

339
00:24:27,131 --> 00:24:30,011
there's no need for me
to deal with you anymore,

340
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:32,371
This is the Residence of the Hedong Duke,

341
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:34,251
It's not a place

342
00:24:34,251 --> 00:24:35,851
where you can just come and go as you please,

343
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,696
Guards!

344
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:55,931
I am the wife of Pei Xingjian,
the Senior Official of Xizhou,

345
00:24:55,931 --> 00:24:57,531
the lady of the Pei family of Zhongjuan

346
00:24:57,531 --> 00:24:59,451
and the foster daughter of General Su Dingfang,

347
00:24:59,451 --> 00:25:00,891
Are you aware of the consequences

348
00:25:00,891 --> 00:25:02,031
of detaining me without cause?

349
00:25:02,031 --> 00:25:04,591
Seated here is the Princess,

350
00:25:04,591 --> 00:25:06,771
the aunt of His Majesty,

351
00:25:07,411 --> 00:25:10,191
In the eyes of the law,
the royal family and the commoners are equal,

352
00:25:10,191 --> 00:25:12,251
As a royal,

353
00:25:12,251 --> 00:25:14,171
you should set a good example for the people,

354
00:25:14,171 --> 00:25:16,131
How can you break the law?

355
00:25:16,651 --> 00:25:18,311
The Pei family's rules are strict,

356
00:25:18,311 --> 00:25:19,971
The Princess is just disciplining

357
00:25:19,971 --> 00:25:21,991
her junior disobedient to the rules,

358
00:25:21,991 --> 00:25:23,851
Why should she fear the criticism of others?

359
00:25:23,851 --> 00:25:25,951
What did I do wrong exactly?

360
00:25:25,951 --> 00:25:28,151
And which household rule did I violate,

361
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:31,491
which made you send people
all the way out there to hunt me down?

362
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,611
Stop slandering the Princess,

363
00:25:37,451 --> 00:25:38,811
The letter in my hand

364
00:25:40,011 --> 00:25:41,051
is the evidence,

365
00:25:43,891 --> 00:25:45,131
What are you waiting for?

366
00:25:45,131 --> 00:25:46,811
Go snatch the letter!

367
00:25:47,731 --> 00:25:48,731
Who dares?

368
00:25:56,571 --> 00:25:58,731
Princess, the attendant Wang
from the palace has arrived,

369
00:25:58,731 --> 00:26:00,331
saying His Majesty
has learned about Lady Kudi's return

370
00:26:00,331 --> 00:26:01,691
and summoned her to the palace,

371
00:26:02,331 --> 00:26:03,392
What?

372
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,091
The attendant said

373
00:26:05,091 --> 00:26:07,891
His Majesty just learned
that Lady Kudi was visiting you,

374
00:26:07,891 --> 00:26:10,451
Lady Kudi must go and meet His Majesty

375
00:26:10,451 --> 00:26:11,616
right now,

376
00:26:25,091 --> 00:26:26,611
All of you, leave,

377
00:26:26,611 --> 00:26:27,851
Yes,

378
00:26:32,731 --> 00:26:36,571
Madam, if this matter is known to His Majesty…

379
00:26:42,891 --> 00:26:44,451
You decided to hide them

380
00:26:45,171 --> 00:26:47,971
because you were suspicious

381
00:26:47,971 --> 00:26:50,731
that I was merely deceiving you
with an empty envelope,

382
00:26:51,891 --> 00:26:54,691
If you truly believe
that there is no letter inside this envelope,

383
00:26:54,691 --> 00:26:56,051
then what is there to fear?

384
00:27:10,051 --> 00:27:12,651
Even if you do have the letters,

385
00:27:13,211 --> 00:27:15,831
you are here all alone,

386
00:27:15,831 --> 00:27:19,331
We can snatch the letters and destroy them,
Then what could you possibly do about it?

387
00:27:21,251 --> 00:27:22,611
Would I be so foolish

388
00:27:22,611 --> 00:27:24,811
to carry both letters on myself?

389
00:27:38,211 --> 00:27:39,451
The letter is right here,

390
00:27:40,051 --> 00:27:41,211
It's entirely up to you

391
00:27:41,211 --> 00:27:43,211
to decide,

392
00:28:01,251 --> 00:28:03,331
<i>Didn't Protector-General Qu say
that they were all burned?</i>

393
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:04,731
<i>This envelope is genuine,</i>

394
00:28:05,611 --> 00:28:06,891
<i>but the letter was forged by me</i>

395
00:28:07,571 --> 00:28:10,171
<i>based on Protector-General Qu's oral account,</i>

396
00:28:11,491 --> 00:28:13,811
<i>It's hard to spot it as fake
unless you look closely,</i>

397
00:28:15,251 --> 00:28:18,071
<i>After all, I have lived in the Residence
of the Hedong Duke for over a decade,</i>

398
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:21,411
<i>What is so difficult about imitating
the handwriting of the Princess?</i>

399
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:24,571
<i>With it,</i>

400
00:28:24,571 --> 00:28:27,131
<i>do I still need to be afraid
that the Princess will not submit?</i>

401
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,531
What exactly do you want?

402
00:28:35,771 --> 00:28:37,411
Release the wife and child of Qu Chongyu,

403
00:28:37,411 --> 00:28:38,531
Make a written promise

404
00:28:38,531 --> 00:28:40,051
that you won't harm me and Shouyue again,

405
00:28:41,851 --> 00:28:43,971
Don't push your luck,

406
00:28:43,971 --> 00:28:45,024
Okay,

407
00:28:45,931 --> 00:28:47,531
Then let's await His Majesty's judgment,

408
00:28:55,731 --> 00:28:57,771
Madam, shall we…

409
00:28:58,931 --> 00:29:00,771
shall we just follow what she said?

410
00:29:03,072 --> 00:29:04,131
Madam, please be calm,

411
00:29:04,651 --> 00:29:06,711
This matter concerns our lives,

412
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:08,991
If the letter in her hands is really true,

413
00:29:08,991 --> 00:29:11,571
we won't afford to lose,

414
00:29:15,091 --> 00:29:18,131
The attendant Wang is already sick of waiting,

415
00:29:33,451 --> 00:29:34,771
As you wish,

416
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:38,211
But I want to see another letter,

417
00:29:38,971 --> 00:29:40,271
Another letter

418
00:29:40,271 --> 00:29:41,771
is in the hands of my foster father,

419
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,031
As long as I leave here safely,

420
00:29:46,031 --> 00:29:48,171
my foster father will offer it willingly,

421
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,331
Prepare the brush and ink,

422
00:29:57,344 --> 00:29:58,432
Yes,

423
00:30:16,811 --> 00:30:18,131
Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr, Wang,

424
00:30:24,451 --> 00:30:25,891
<i>General Su,</i>

425
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:27,971
<i>why did you invite me</i>

426
00:30:27,971 --> 00:30:29,971
<i>to your residence this late at night?</i>

427
00:30:53,371 --> 00:30:54,931
<i>Mr, Wang,</i>

428
00:31:08,731 --> 00:31:11,211
Both His Majesty
and Empress Wu miss you very much,

429
00:31:11,211 --> 00:31:12,551
Since you're back,

430
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:14,171
why don't you go to the palace to see them?

431
00:31:15,491 --> 00:31:17,091
I miss them very much as well,

432
00:31:17,731 --> 00:31:18,971
After this matter is over,

433
00:31:18,971 --> 00:31:20,771
I'll go to see them immediately,

434
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,696
Shouyue,

435
00:31:41,811 --> 00:31:43,091
here's to you,

436
00:31:44,651 --> 00:31:46,131
Ever since you took office,

437
00:31:47,331 --> 00:31:48,491
we've been giving you

438
00:31:49,011 --> 00:31:50,051
a hard time,

439
00:31:50,571 --> 00:31:52,411
and we nearly harmed you and your wife,

440
00:31:54,171 --> 00:31:55,411
But you had no complaints,

441
00:31:56,611 --> 00:31:57,771
You place the greater good

442
00:31:58,571 --> 00:31:59,691
and the people as the foremost,

443
00:32:00,811 --> 00:32:02,131
You're a good official,

444
00:32:03,731 --> 00:32:06,331
I want to toast you
on behalf of the people of Xizhou,

445
00:32:14,211 --> 00:32:15,211
You're flattering me,

446
00:32:15,891 --> 00:32:19,211
If all other officials were like you,

447
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:23,251
why worry about the stability

448
00:32:24,491 --> 00:32:25,691
and the peace of the country?

449
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:29,131
I don't mind telling you,

450
00:32:30,656 --> 00:32:31,744
A few years ago,

451
00:32:33,091 --> 00:32:34,651
I lived a wasted life,

452
00:32:36,131 --> 00:32:37,251
My teacher couldn't stand to see that,

453
00:32:38,011 --> 00:32:39,411
He brought me to a battlefield,

454
00:32:40,171 --> 00:32:41,344
That was a terrible loss

455
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:43,411
that year,

456
00:32:45,371 --> 00:32:47,131
When I was there,
time had already changed things,

457
00:32:48,571 --> 00:32:49,651
But the wilderness

458
00:32:51,691 --> 00:32:52,891
was strewn with bones,

459
00:32:54,571 --> 00:32:55,691
It was not yet night,

460
00:32:55,691 --> 00:32:57,091
but it was an overwhelming murderous aura,

461
00:32:57,811 --> 00:32:59,291
My teacher tossed me a few bags of wine,

462
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:02,171
He told me
I could either die drunk on the battlefield

463
00:33:03,011 --> 00:33:04,611
to be the dead's new company

464
00:33:05,331 --> 00:33:06,491
or cast away the wine bag

465
00:33:08,171 --> 00:33:09,651
to live a brand new life,

466
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:12,651
I have heard a bit
about your grudge against the Princess,

467
00:33:14,491 --> 00:33:16,491
That was when the Princess

468
00:33:17,331 --> 00:33:18,571
murdered your family

469
00:33:19,411 --> 00:33:20,611
and destroyed your future

470
00:33:22,531 --> 00:33:24,411
to snatch your family's wealth, right?

471
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,408
On that night,

472
00:33:31,251 --> 00:33:33,451
I gazed at the bones for a long time, thinking,

473
00:33:35,691 --> 00:33:37,171
"If I remain inebriated from now on
and never wake up,

474
00:33:38,611 --> 00:33:39,851
it probably won't take long

475
00:33:41,011 --> 00:33:42,491
for me to turn into bones,

476
00:33:43,968 --> 00:33:45,011
having no consciousness

477
00:33:45,611 --> 00:33:46,611
or feelings,

478
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:48,451
It seems pretty good,"

479
00:33:49,411 --> 00:33:51,051
But after I had a few drinks,

480
00:33:52,411 --> 00:33:53,611
I found it not good,

481
00:33:55,811 --> 00:33:57,211
If one's consciousness's gone when one dies,

482
00:33:58,211 --> 00:33:59,891
do I live a lifetime

483
00:34:01,251 --> 00:34:03,451
just to become a pile of bones

484
00:34:05,651 --> 00:34:08,611
and make my loved ones grieve and foes rejoice?

485
00:34:14,251 --> 00:34:15,931
But if one still has a mind after they die,

486
00:34:16,611 --> 00:34:18,971
how then should I face
the family in the netherworld?

487
00:34:20,891 --> 00:34:22,211
So, I abandoned my wine bag

488
00:34:23,371 --> 00:34:24,811
and slept in the wilderness,

489
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:27,571
When I woke up,

490
00:34:29,331 --> 00:34:30,336
the sun was rising in the east,

491
00:34:31,531 --> 00:34:33,291
Everything seemed entirely new,

492
00:34:38,051 --> 00:34:39,331
Thus, in the world,

493
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:41,291
there was one less drunkard

494
00:34:42,531 --> 00:34:43,611
and one more power-chaser,

495
00:34:46,091 --> 00:34:47,451
If you keep being so self-deprecating,

496
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:51,171
then everyone else is a mere parasite,

497
00:34:52,051 --> 00:34:53,051
How difficult it is

498
00:34:55,331 --> 00:34:57,051
not to become a parasite

499
00:34:58,051 --> 00:34:59,211
or a power-chaser,

500
00:35:03,531 --> 00:35:04,576
Minister Qu,

501
00:35:06,531 --> 00:35:07,851
with your actions in Xizhou,

502
00:35:09,611 --> 00:35:11,131
you can't be regarded as a parasite,

503
00:35:12,971 --> 00:35:14,291
And I barely managed

504
00:35:15,691 --> 00:35:17,211
not to be considered
a power-chaser not long ago,

505
00:35:21,651 --> 00:35:23,811
Your spirit

506
00:35:25,011 --> 00:35:26,091
is admirable,

507
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:43,051
This sword

508
00:35:43,571 --> 00:35:45,651
once brought me a formidable

509
00:35:46,731 --> 00:35:48,431
and respectable enemy,

510
00:35:48,431 --> 00:35:49,451
but I think

511
00:35:50,851 --> 00:35:53,491
it will bring me a reliable friend

512
00:35:54,891 --> 00:35:56,971
I can entrust my life to in the future,

513
00:36:01,931 --> 00:36:02,976
Before,

514
00:36:03,531 --> 00:36:06,011
you used this sword to defeat me,

515
00:36:06,011 --> 00:36:09,131
I have always wanted to find an opportunity
to return it to you,

516
00:36:09,691 --> 00:36:13,691
I believe now
this can be returned to its original owner,

517
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,936
May I give

518
00:36:29,571 --> 00:36:31,491
this sword to my buddy?

519
00:36:33,211 --> 00:36:34,811
As a token to testify our friendship,

520
00:36:36,131 --> 00:36:37,491
A symbol of our unending commitment,

521
00:37:06,411 --> 00:37:09,651
Mother, was that Empress Wu we just saw?

522
00:37:10,651 --> 00:37:14,171
Empress Wu allowed me
to return home to see my grandpa and my father,

523
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:17,611
Why aren't you allowed to go back together?

524
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:23,631
Because after you go to Xizhou
to have fun for a while,

525
00:37:23,631 --> 00:37:24,971
you will come back, won't you?

526
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:28,991
I'll stay in the capital to watch the house

527
00:37:28,991 --> 00:37:30,971
and wait for your return, okay?

528
00:37:30,971 --> 00:37:32,451
Okay,

529
00:37:32,451 --> 00:37:34,011
I'm heading back to Xizhou,

530
00:37:34,011 --> 00:37:36,131
I'm about to see my grandpa and father!

531
00:37:48,731 --> 00:37:49,792
Giddyap!

532
00:38:06,331 --> 00:38:07,771
This letter is fake?

533
00:38:08,731 --> 00:38:10,451
Even if it mimics so well,

534
00:38:11,571 --> 00:38:14,771
can't I even recognize my own writing?

535
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:18,131
Well done, Pei Xingjian,

536
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:20,971
Kudi Liuli,

537
00:38:21,731 --> 00:38:23,771
Two fake letters

538
00:38:25,411 --> 00:38:28,011
for my real promise,

539
00:38:31,131 --> 00:38:32,411
Madam,

540
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:33,440
Go away!

541
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:41,312
From now on,

542
00:38:44,771 --> 00:38:47,651
all my family

543
00:38:50,051 --> 00:38:53,931
have to bow down to Pei Xingjian,

544
00:38:56,411 --> 00:38:57,451
It's on me,

545
00:38:59,331 --> 00:39:00,591
It's on me,

546
00:39:00,591 --> 00:39:02,691
It's all my fault,

547
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,291
Princess,

548
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:07,531
- Madam!
- Princess!

549
00:39:07,531 --> 00:39:09,471
- Madam!
- Princess!

550
00:39:09,471 --> 00:39:11,771
Go get an imperial physician!

551
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:15,291
Madam, wake up,

552
00:39:16,131 --> 00:39:18,611
Someone!

553
00:39:18,611 --> 00:39:21,571
Madam, you must be okay,

554
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:24,771
Madam, if something happens to you,
what will I do?

555
00:39:30,897 --> 00:39:34,944
<i>[Pei Mansion]</i>

556
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:48,651
You've been staying at home
for more than a month,

557
00:39:50,091 --> 00:39:51,851
As a talented man and with your character,

558
00:39:51,851 --> 00:39:53,691
don't you find it boring?

559
00:39:54,971 --> 00:39:56,811
If everything goes well,

560
00:39:57,691 --> 00:39:59,571
Liuli must be on the way back now,

561
00:40:00,251 --> 00:40:03,171
All I need to do is to wait patiently,

562
00:40:04,651 --> 00:40:05,696
Waiting,

563
00:40:07,211 --> 00:40:08,211
Oh, right,

564
00:40:08,851 --> 00:40:11,091
How is the case
about the Great Buddha Temple going?

565
00:40:11,891 --> 00:40:14,051
That is a big case in Xizhou,

566
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:17,811
Tomorrow, I will hold court to try the case,

567
00:40:18,531 --> 00:40:20,331
The monks of the Great Buddha Temple

568
00:40:20,331 --> 00:40:21,691
are accused of defrauding other people,

569
00:40:21,691 --> 00:40:24,011
The Great Buddha Temple has a unique status
in Xizhou,

570
00:40:25,011 --> 00:40:26,691
That case is somewhat bizarre,

571
00:40:27,211 --> 00:40:28,451
If you need me,

572
00:40:28,451 --> 00:40:29,651
I will help with all my strength,

573
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,584
Okay,

574
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,825
<i>[Yong'an Bridge, Tranquil and Fulfilling Life]</i>

575
00:40:55,367 --> 00:40:57,383
<i>[Jiang Dalang, Mrs, Kong]</i>

576
00:41:05,211 --> 00:41:06,491
The plaintiff, Jiang Dalang,

577
00:41:06,491 --> 00:41:08,531
you are suing the monk Yizhao
from the Great Buddha Temple,

578
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:10,411
What exactly is the reason?

579
00:41:16,851 --> 00:41:17,931
Chancellor,

580
00:41:18,611 --> 00:41:20,051
I have been fatherless since I was young,

581
00:41:20,571 --> 00:41:22,171
It's just my mother and me in our family,

582
00:41:23,171 --> 00:41:24,811
I contracted this strange illness
a few years ago,

583
00:41:25,891 --> 00:41:26,891
For my sake,

584
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,891
my mother went to the Great Buddha Temple
every few days

585
00:41:29,891 --> 00:41:31,371
and prayed devoutly,

586
00:41:32,211 --> 00:41:33,651
She often didn't come home

587
00:41:33,651 --> 00:41:35,131
until she bumped her forehead
and others persuaded her,

588
00:41:35,691 --> 00:41:36,971
But one day,

589
00:41:38,771 --> 00:41:41,331
he, Yizhao, a monk

590
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,251
from the temple

591
00:41:44,011 --> 00:41:45,211
came to our door,

592
00:41:54,931 --> 00:41:55,968
<i>Monk,</i>

593
00:41:56,491 --> 00:41:58,531
<i>I wonder what brings you here,</i>

594
00:41:59,251 --> 00:42:01,411
<i>May I ask
if there are any sick people in your family?</i>

595
00:42:03,131 --> 00:42:05,971
<i>Yes, my son has caught a strange disease,</i>

596
00:42:05,971 --> 00:42:07,371
<i>Amitabha,</i>

597
00:42:08,411 --> 00:42:10,291
<i>Last night, Buddha appeared in my dream,</i>

598
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:12,471
<i>He directed me to come here</i>

599
00:42:12,471 --> 00:42:14,411
<i>to tell you the root cause
of your son's illness,</i>

600
00:42:15,651 --> 00:42:16,768
<i>Really?</i>

601
00:42:17,491 --> 00:42:19,451
<i>Amitabha,</i>

602
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:21,371
<i>Please come on in,</i>

603
00:42:33,131 --> 00:42:35,191
<i>Merciful monk, please save my son,</i>

604
00:42:35,191 --> 00:42:36,531
<i>I have no idea</i>

605
00:42:36,531 --> 00:42:38,811
<i>why my son is afflicted with
such a strange disease despite his young age,</i>

606
00:42:39,651 --> 00:42:40,811
<i>Amitabha,</i>

607
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:44,231
<i>The root cause of his disease</i>

608
00:42:44,231 --> 00:42:47,131
<i>is nothing but you,</i>

609
00:42:51,508 --> 00:42:56,064
<i>♫ I write my longing for you in Spring ♫</i>

610
00:42:58,144 --> 00:43:02,592
<i>♫ The red plum is in full bloom like you ♫</i>

611
00:43:04,096 --> 00:43:06,912
<i>♫ By the pond, next to the willow trees ♫</i>

612
00:43:07,488 --> 00:43:10,592
<i>♫ I write a poem
to tell our story from the past ♫</i>

613
00:43:11,104 --> 00:43:15,840
<i>♫ The years pass by like a bird♫</i>

614

615

623

<i>♫ A snowy day, someone sings a sad song ♫</i>

624
00:43:59,904 --> 00:44:03,168
<i>♫ Against the window,
I had a drink for pleasure ♫</i>

625
00:44:03,168 --> 00:44:06,528
<i>♫ The moon still hangs in the sky,
but I'm no longer in the mood ♫</i>

626
