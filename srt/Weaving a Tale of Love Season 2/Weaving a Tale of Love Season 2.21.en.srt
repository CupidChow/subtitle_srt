<i>[Episode 21]</i>

3
00:01:42,996 --> 00:01:45,056
Merciful monk, please save my child,

4
00:01:45,056 --> 00:01:46,396
I don't know why my son

5
00:01:46,396 --> 00:01:48,676
is so young
yet afflicted with such a strange illness,

6
00:01:49,516 --> 00:01:50,676
Amitabha,

7
00:01:51,716 --> 00:01:54,096
The root cause of your son's illness
lies not elsewhere

8
00:01:54,096 --> 00:01:56,996
but within you, lady donor,

9
00:01:58,756 --> 00:01:59,956
The root cause if from you?

10
00:02:02,396 --> 00:02:04,276
The Buddha appeared in my dream last night,

11
00:02:04,836 --> 00:02:07,416
He mentioned that you worship the Buddha
with utter devotion,

12
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:08,896
and you're extremely devout,

13
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:10,356
Your heart is worthy of compassion

14
00:02:11,516 --> 00:02:12,544
However,

15
00:02:14,356 --> 00:02:16,556
you don't realize
that everything has causes and effects,

16
00:02:16,556 --> 00:02:18,336
The reason that your son is plagued
by a mysterious illness

17
00:02:18,336 --> 00:02:21,956
is because you committed a heinous sin
by not saving someone in need at young age,

18
00:02:23,196 --> 00:02:25,336
In truth, your son is suffering on your behalf,

19
00:02:25,336 --> 00:02:26,656
Merciful Buddha

20
00:02:26,656 --> 00:02:28,976
can't bear to see the young man die early,

21
00:02:28,976 --> 00:02:31,356
So, I was sent to enlighten you,

22
00:02:31,956 --> 00:02:32,960
Lady donor,

23
00:02:33,716 --> 00:02:35,076
have you ever encountered a child
drowning near the river

24
00:02:35,076 --> 00:02:38,436
a decade ago?

25
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:43,436
Did you do nothing but letting him die?

26
00:02:44,516 --> 00:02:45,556
How would you know, high monk?

27
00:02:46,516 --> 00:02:47,616
Mother,

28
00:02:50,116 --> 00:02:52,796
Back in the day,
by the time I got to the riverside,

29
00:02:53,396 --> 00:02:55,276
the child was already motionless in the water,

30
00:02:55,796 --> 00:02:57,636
Moreover, I can't swim,

31
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,996
and I was pregnant,

32
00:03:04,036 --> 00:03:06,356
Since you're here, there must be a solution,

33
00:03:06,876 --> 00:03:08,536
I beg for your compassion, high monk,

34
00:03:08,536 --> 00:03:11,396
Save my son, save my son,

35
00:03:14,636 --> 00:03:15,796
Given the circumstances,

36
00:03:16,876 --> 00:03:18,996
lady donor, please come
to the Great Buddha Temple

37
00:03:18,996 --> 00:03:20,676
early tomorrow morning,

38
00:03:31,636 --> 00:03:32,956
You see things clearly,

39
00:03:32,956 --> 00:03:35,656
I don't recognize the mother and son at all,

40
00:03:35,656 --> 00:03:37,356
I've never left the Great Buddha Temple
without permission,

41
00:03:37,356 --> 00:03:39,256
I've never even been to Jiang Dalang's house,

42
00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:40,516
If you don't believe me, Senior Official,

43
00:03:40,516 --> 00:03:41,956
all the brothers in the temple,

44
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:43,316
Including Master Juexuan,

45
00:03:43,316 --> 00:03:44,876
can testify for me,

46
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:47,236
No, no,

47
00:03:47,236 --> 00:03:48,676
Yizhao,

48
00:03:48,676 --> 00:03:51,636
Today, the mother and son from Kong's family
are accusing you and the Great Buddha Temple,

49
00:03:51,636 --> 00:03:54,176
If I were to let the monks from the Temple
testify for you,

50
00:03:54,176 --> 00:03:55,516
that would be against legal principles,

51
00:03:56,396 --> 00:03:57,476
You should remain calm for now

52
00:03:58,116 --> 00:03:59,356
and let me finish listening to them,

53
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,036
Then, I will judge things on my own,

54
00:04:05,116 --> 00:04:07,276
You two don't need to hesitate,
Just speak the truth,

55
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:10,516
About that incident over twenty years ago,

56
00:04:11,316 --> 00:04:13,756
I had never mentioned it to another person,

57
00:04:14,436 --> 00:04:15,836
I repented sincerely a few times

58
00:04:15,836 --> 00:04:17,716
only in front of the bronze Buddha,

59
00:04:18,596 --> 00:04:21,456
So, the other day, when Yizhao brought it up,

60
00:04:21,456 --> 00:04:23,356
I believed about seventy to eighty percent,

61
00:04:24,036 --> 00:04:27,196
The next day,
I arrived at the Great Buddha Temple early,

62
00:04:28,076 --> 00:04:29,676
as instructed by Yizhao,

63
00:04:30,196 --> 00:04:33,236
I rushed to offer incense
after the early lessons in the temple,

64
00:04:33,236 --> 00:04:36,476
He said that there were no others
in the Buddha temple at that time,

65
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:39,436
only then
could the Buddha focus on listening to me,

66
00:04:42,396 --> 00:04:43,596
All of them are merciful,

67
00:04:44,356 --> 00:04:45,596
I, a faithful woman, Ms, Kong,

68
00:04:46,156 --> 00:04:48,156
sincerely ask for Buddha's merciful guidance,

69
00:04:49,116 --> 00:04:51,676
Did the child who drowned by the river
that year

70
00:04:52,236 --> 00:04:54,036
die because of me?

71
00:04:54,036 --> 00:04:56,356
My son, Jiang Dalang,
is suffering from a strange illness,

72
00:04:57,316 --> 00:04:59,076
Did he suffer me?

73
00:05:00,276 --> 00:05:01,316
I beg you, Buddha,

74
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,316
please be merciful and show us the way,

75
00:05:25,056 --> 00:05:26,116
My lady,

76
00:05:26,116 --> 00:05:27,200
My lady,

77
00:05:28,156 --> 00:05:29,736
My lady,

78
00:05:29,736 --> 00:05:32,336
The bronze Buddha…
the bronze Buddha has shed tears,

79
00:05:32,336 --> 00:05:33,836
Buddha's manifestation!

80
00:05:35,196 --> 00:05:36,436
Blessings from the Buddha!

81
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,516
Blessings from the Buddha!

82
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:39,776
Blessings from the Buddha!

83
00:05:40,396 --> 00:05:42,236
Amitabha,

84
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,264
Continuing on,

85
00:05:48,996 --> 00:05:50,016
Later on,

86
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,956
the woman was sent home
by a kind-hearted person,

87
00:05:53,556 --> 00:05:54,676
After waking up,

88
00:05:54,676 --> 00:05:56,956
I believed whatever Yizhao had said
without any doubt,

89
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,816
The next day,

90
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:00,956
Yizhao visited again

91
00:06:00,956 --> 00:06:02,876
asking me to give him some money,

92
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:06,236
He said it was for conducting rites
for the deceased child,

93
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,316
My sins only be absolved

94
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,396
by doing so,

95
00:06:12,116 --> 00:06:14,316
Only then can my son stay alive,

96
00:06:20,596 --> 00:06:21,836
Since then,

97
00:06:22,476 --> 00:06:25,156
Yizhao came to ask for money
under various reasons,

98
00:06:25,836 --> 00:06:27,316
Gradually,

99
00:06:27,316 --> 00:06:29,996
my family can't even afford
my medical expenses,

100
00:06:31,036 --> 00:06:33,716
Yizhao found Physician Han
with the most affordable consultation fee,

101
00:06:34,316 --> 00:06:35,356
However, who would have thought

102
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,956
that my condition improved

103
00:06:38,876 --> 00:06:40,316
after taking several doses
of Physician Han's medicine,

104
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,208
My mother

105
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:45,596
became even more convinced of Yizhao's words,

106
00:06:46,516 --> 00:06:47,596
until the day

107
00:06:48,996 --> 00:06:50,276
I discovered

108
00:06:51,236 --> 00:06:53,676
an unexpected scandal,

109
00:06:55,116 --> 00:06:56,516
Dalang, has your condition improved a bit?

110
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:57,516
I'm much better now,

111
00:06:57,516 --> 00:06:59,676
That's good,
Dalang is recovering quite quickly,

112
00:07:00,316 --> 00:07:01,344
Yes,

113
00:08:00,236 --> 00:08:01,312
Nonsense!

114
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,596
I've been in the Great Buddha Temple
since childhood

115
00:08:06,276 --> 00:08:08,276
and blessed by the Buddha and Master Juexuan,

116
00:08:09,076 --> 00:08:11,196
I diligently cultivate
to purify the six senses,

117
00:08:11,196 --> 00:08:13,776
How could I commit such a disgraceful act
against the precepts?

118
00:08:13,776 --> 00:08:16,436
How can you slander Buddhism and me like this?

119
00:08:16,436 --> 00:08:18,996
Are you not afraid
of falling into the Avici Hell?

120
00:08:18,996 --> 00:08:21,016
I saw it very clearly,

121
00:08:21,016 --> 00:08:23,456
The gold ornament you gave to the Widow Li

122
00:08:23,456 --> 00:08:25,396
was my mother's,

123
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:28,276
She gave it to you for good deeds,

124
00:08:29,556 --> 00:08:30,556
Thinking about it now,

125
00:08:31,596 --> 00:08:33,836
Physician Han's excellent medical skills

126
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,716
is the reason why my illness has improved,

127
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:38,696
It had nothing to do

128
00:08:38,696 --> 00:08:40,096
with the Bronze Buddha

129
00:08:40,096 --> 00:08:42,396
and the Great Buddha Temple,

130
00:08:46,048 --> 00:08:47,072
In that case,

131
00:08:47,676 --> 00:08:50,196
Send the Widow Li to the hall,

132
00:09:19,616 --> 00:09:20,640
Ms, Li,

133
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:25,316
Jiang Dalang filed a lawsuit
citing the monk have a private affair with you,

134
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:28,316
The monk also deceives his possession
and gives to you as a gift, Is it true?

135
00:09:29,396 --> 00:09:31,816
I've lived alone for three years
and strictly followed the way of a widow,

136
00:09:31,816 --> 00:09:33,196
I dare not have personal affairs with others,

137
00:09:33,196 --> 00:09:36,116
let alone with the high monk
of the Great Buddha Temple,

138
00:09:36,116 --> 00:09:38,676
Please, Senior Official, make a clear judgment
and exonerate the innocence of me,

139
00:09:39,876 --> 00:09:41,456
I've seen it with my own eyes,

140
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,396
I saw you embracing and being intimate
with Yizhao,

141
00:09:43,396 --> 00:09:44,716
How can it be false?

142
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:47,956
As a monk,
I have no grudge nor dealings with you,

143
00:09:47,956 --> 00:09:49,556
Why do you fabricate things out of nothing

144
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:51,016
and tarnish the clean reputation of Buddhism?

145
00:09:51,016 --> 00:09:52,756
Aren't you really afraid of retribution?

146
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,216
Good question,

147
00:10:01,996 --> 00:10:05,196
This happens to be what I want to know
the most,

148
00:10:05,756 --> 00:10:06,996
Yizhao,

149
00:10:06,996 --> 00:10:09,716
You just said
you have never left the Great Buddha Temple

150
00:10:10,396 --> 00:10:11,936
and have never been to Jiang Dalang's house,

151
00:10:12,448 --> 00:10:13,536
Is it so?

152
00:10:13,536 --> 00:10:14,592
Exactly,

153
00:10:15,436 --> 00:10:17,896
I recite scriptures and studies the Dharma
in the temple every day,

154
00:10:17,896 --> 00:10:19,316
I've Never taken half a step away,

155
00:10:21,248 --> 00:10:22,276
Everyone,

156
00:10:22,276 --> 00:10:24,676
You all are the neighbors of Jiang Dalang
and Ms, Kong,

157
00:10:25,396 --> 00:10:28,716
Have you ever seen this monk named Yizhao?

158
00:10:32,224 --> 00:10:33,396
Replying to you, Senior Official,

159
00:10:33,396 --> 00:10:35,476
When I was treating at Jiang Dalang's house

160
00:10:36,476 --> 00:10:37,516
I've seen this monk,

161
00:10:38,236 --> 00:10:39,556
And I 've even seen it with my own eyes

162
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:43,104
that Ms, Kong gave him money
for him to do good deeds on her behalf,

163
00:10:47,136 --> 00:10:48,192
Hansi,

164
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:50,236
You said you were treating Jiang Dalang's
for his illness,

165
00:10:51,116 --> 00:10:52,756
What disease does Jiang Dalang have?

166
00:10:52,756 --> 00:10:53,796
Can you explain it clearly?

167
00:10:54,396 --> 00:10:56,436
Jiang Dalang has a disease called goiter,

168
00:10:57,076 --> 00:10:58,716
Actually, it's not a complicated disease,

169
00:10:59,316 --> 00:11:01,956
However, this strange disease is not common,

170
00:11:01,956 --> 00:11:03,156
It's commonly known as the big neck disease,

171
00:11:05,556 --> 00:11:06,616
Is this disease curable?

172
00:11:06,616 --> 00:11:08,196
This disease can be cured,

173
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,256
From the current witness

174
00:11:11,256 --> 00:11:12,796
and the evidence,

175
00:11:12,796 --> 00:11:14,996
Jiang Dalang and Ms, Kong didn't lie,

176
00:11:15,516 --> 00:11:17,796
All neighbors and Physician Han can testify,

177
00:11:18,516 --> 00:11:20,796
It's clear that there indeed was a monk

178
00:11:21,716 --> 00:11:24,316
who deceived Ms, Kong for money
under the pretext of healing,

179
00:11:25,596 --> 00:11:27,996
And this monk was identified

180
00:11:29,236 --> 00:11:30,272
to be Yizhao,

181
00:11:37,312 --> 00:11:38,336
How come?

182
00:11:39,264 --> 00:11:40,320
You want to change your statement?

183
00:11:41,196 --> 00:11:42,208
Reporting back to the Senior Official,

184
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:44,796
although I've never left
the Great Buddha Temple,

185
00:11:45,476 --> 00:11:46,696
but I can't guarantee

186
00:11:46,696 --> 00:11:48,356
that Jiang Dalang's neighbors and locals

187
00:11:48,356 --> 00:11:49,956
had never seen my face,

188
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,864
What do you mean by this?

189
00:11:53,476 --> 00:11:54,496
To be honest,

190
00:11:55,008 --> 00:11:57,716
I have a twin brother named Menger,

191
00:11:58,396 --> 00:12:00,396
We united by coincidence not long ago,

192
00:12:01,276 --> 00:12:04,396
Master Juexuan granted him to stay temporarily
at the Great Buddha Temple to reunite with me,

193
00:12:05,196 --> 00:12:07,556
Menger looks almost exactly like me,

194
00:12:08,156 --> 00:12:10,036
Although I've never left
the Great Buddha Temple,

195
00:12:10,876 --> 00:12:11,956
I can't guarantee

196
00:12:12,596 --> 00:12:13,916
that Menger has never left,

197
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,248
According to your saying,

198
00:12:18,116 --> 00:12:20,396
the one who went out to swindle
was your twin brother,

199
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:22,208
not you,

200
00:12:27,616 --> 00:12:28,704
Reporting to the Senior Official,

201
00:12:29,796 --> 00:12:31,556
If I can find Menger,

202
00:12:31,556 --> 00:12:33,476
can my innocence be proven then?

203
00:12:34,036 --> 00:12:35,104
Of course it can,

204
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:36,956
As long as you bring Menger out,

205
00:12:37,836 --> 00:12:39,916
the truth of the case will come to light,

206
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,596
I have a deep brotherhood with Menger,

207
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:44,076
If you could let me go first,

208
00:12:44,076 --> 00:12:45,276
he'll definitely come to see me,

209
00:12:46,196 --> 00:12:47,296
When he shows up,

210
00:12:47,296 --> 00:12:49,916
I'll then persuaded him to come to the office
to explain the situation,

211
00:12:50,656 --> 00:12:51,680
Good,

212
00:12:52,476 --> 00:12:53,876
If that's the case,

213
00:12:53,876 --> 00:12:55,236
then I will make an exception just this once

214
00:12:55,956 --> 00:12:57,236
and let you return to the Great Buddha Temple,

215
00:12:59,516 --> 00:13:00,716
Amitabha,

216
00:13:01,996 --> 00:13:03,072
Thank you, Senior Official,

217
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,328
Bai San,

218
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,596
Yes,

219
00:13:08,596 --> 00:13:11,156
Bring extra people to guard at the foot
of the Great Buddha Temple Mountain,

220
00:13:12,036 --> 00:13:14,716
All those entering and exiting the gate
must be thoroughly checked

221
00:13:15,516 --> 00:13:17,356
to prevent the suspect Menger from escaping,

222
00:13:20,436 --> 00:13:21,516
Yes,

223
00:13:21,516 --> 00:13:22,528
Withdraw from the hall,

224
00:13:24,896 --> 00:13:26,400
<i>[Lead a Tranquil and Fulfilling Life]</i>◊

225
00:13:34,316 --> 00:13:36,036
Yizhao has returned to the Temple
for more than two days,

226
00:13:36,676 --> 00:13:38,036
Menger has completely disappeared,

227
00:13:38,716 --> 00:13:41,316
In theory, Menger is the one
who deceived others for money and love,

228
00:13:41,316 --> 00:13:43,036
Now, Menger is gone,

229
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:44,576
Exactly,

230
00:13:45,756 --> 00:13:46,816
According to Bai San's report,

231
00:13:47,796 --> 00:13:48,796
the monks in the temple

232
00:13:48,796 --> 00:13:50,236
haven't seen him for two days,

233
00:13:51,036 --> 00:13:54,196
So, it was Menger who disguised as Yizhao

234
00:13:54,196 --> 00:13:56,996
and fled after the incident,

235
00:14:01,876 --> 00:14:03,336
Menger has disappeared,

236
00:14:03,336 --> 00:14:06,996
You seem not at all worried about
the stagnation of the case review,

237
00:14:07,636 --> 00:14:09,396
Do you already have a well-thought-out plan?

238
00:14:11,008 --> 00:14:12,116
Long before you came,

239
00:14:13,036 --> 00:14:15,116
I had already sent Xiaoliu and Sanshou

240
00:14:15,116 --> 00:14:17,036
to secretly investigate the monks
at the Great Buddha Temple,

241
00:14:17,996 --> 00:14:19,196
I already knew at that time

242
00:14:19,196 --> 00:14:21,076
that Yizhao had a twin brother,

243
00:14:21,836 --> 00:14:23,676
It's just that after searching
inside and out of the Great Buddha Temple,

244
00:14:24,996 --> 00:14:26,356
the trace of Menger was not found at all,

245
00:14:27,356 --> 00:14:29,956
So when you were judging the case today,

246
00:14:29,956 --> 00:14:33,756
you pretended that you just found out
that Yi Zhao has a twin brother,

247
00:14:34,796 --> 00:14:37,996
Letting Yizhao look for Menger
was also deliberate

248
00:14:37,996 --> 00:14:40,196
because you know he can't find Menger,

249
00:14:41,076 --> 00:14:43,236
So, from the beginning, you suspected

250
00:14:43,236 --> 00:14:45,596
that Yizhao was impersonated by Menger,

251
00:14:46,156 --> 00:14:47,396
Since I dared to let him go,

252
00:14:48,876 --> 00:14:49,996
I was prepared early on,

253
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,716
Senior Official, Menger died,

254
00:15:09,472 --> 00:15:10,496
Menger,

255
00:15:12,716 --> 00:15:13,792
Menger,

256
00:15:15,836 --> 00:15:16,916
Menger,

257
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,456
The body was found at the bottom of a cliff
by devotees visiting the mountain,

258
00:15:19,456 --> 00:15:21,356
Once discovered,
it was retrieved by Xiaoliu and his team,

259
00:15:24,196 --> 00:15:25,556
Amitabha,

260
00:15:26,476 --> 00:15:28,796
I heard that someone had fallen off a cliff,

261
00:15:28,796 --> 00:15:30,436
I had a premonition of misfortune Immediately,

262
00:15:31,076 --> 00:15:33,756
I didn't expect it was really Menger

263
00:15:34,836 --> 00:15:37,116
Now that Menger is dead,

264
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:39,016
but he has shown himself,

265
00:15:39,016 --> 00:15:40,396
Yizhao's charges

266
00:15:40,996 --> 00:15:42,316
can also be cleared, right?

267
00:15:48,288 --> 00:15:49,408
Master,

268
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,136
please look carefully,

269
00:15:51,996 --> 00:15:54,276
Is the deceased really Menger?

270
00:15:55,356 --> 00:15:56,676
Senior Official, are you saying that

271
00:15:57,436 --> 00:15:59,536
it was Menger who killed Yizhao,

272
00:15:59,536 --> 00:16:03,756
and then appeared before everyone
under the guise of Yizhao

273
00:16:03,756 --> 00:16:05,916
to absolve himself of the crime this way?

274
00:16:07,156 --> 00:16:08,236
I'm wronged,

275
00:16:09,116 --> 00:16:10,476
I'm wronged,

276
00:16:11,396 --> 00:16:12,996
Menger came to see me last night,

277
00:16:12,996 --> 00:16:15,316
He said that he'd been hiding in the cave
behind the Great Buddha Temple

278
00:16:15,316 --> 00:16:16,776
since the incident occurred,

279
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:19,596
He planned to evade the limelight
and then flee to a distant place,

280
00:16:20,356 --> 00:16:22,796
I persuaded him with reason
and moved him with emotion,

281
00:16:22,796 --> 00:16:24,756
I was pleading with him to surrender
to the government,

282
00:16:25,996 --> 00:16:27,136
Menger begged me

283
00:16:27,136 --> 00:16:28,716
and ask me to give him a few more hours
to think,

284
00:16:29,276 --> 00:16:30,796
He would wait until dawn to make a decision,

285
00:16:31,636 --> 00:16:33,296
I relented for a moment,

286
00:16:33,296 --> 00:16:35,076
hoping he could surrender to the government,

287
00:16:35,076 --> 00:16:36,276
so I agreed,

288
00:16:37,636 --> 00:16:38,636
Unexpectedly…

289
00:16:39,676 --> 00:16:43,436
Unexpectedly, he was so distraught
that he committed suicide due to guilt,

290
00:16:44,076 --> 00:16:45,996
Amitabha,

291
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,276
Monastics do not tell lies,

292
00:16:50,784 --> 00:16:51,956
In my opinion,

293
00:16:52,716 --> 00:16:55,596
everything Yizhao says is the truth,

294
00:16:57,836 --> 00:16:58,876
This case is full of doubts,

295
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:02,156
I definitely can't judge the case
solely based on Yizhao's words,

296
00:17:04,716 --> 00:17:06,516
Jiang Dalang

297
00:17:07,316 --> 00:17:10,356
once accused Yizhao and the Widow Li
of having an illicit relationship,

298
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,320
It appeared

299
00:17:12,996 --> 00:17:14,236
this body should be Menger's,

300
00:17:14,796 --> 00:17:17,396
I will question Ms, Li again tomorrow,

301
00:17:18,396 --> 00:17:20,216
If Ms, Lee really has an affair with Menger,

302
00:17:20,216 --> 00:17:21,476
then she would

303
00:17:22,112 --> 00:17:23,168
definitely know

304
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:24,956
whose body

305
00:17:27,156 --> 00:17:28,160
this belongs to,

306
00:17:32,876 --> 00:17:36,636
Take Yizhao into custody for now,

307
00:17:55,356 --> 00:17:58,556
Speak now! Where did this jewelry come from?

308
00:18:00,036 --> 00:18:01,716
I was bewitched

309
00:18:01,716 --> 00:18:02,784
and believed

310
00:18:03,996 --> 00:18:05,616
the sweet words from Yizhao,

311
00:18:05,616 --> 00:18:06,816
I lost myself to him,

312
00:18:06,816 --> 00:18:08,196
However, I didn't know

313
00:18:08,196 --> 00:18:10,676
the jewelry he gave me was stolen property,

314
00:18:10,676 --> 00:18:11,876
I knew my mistake,

315
00:18:11,876 --> 00:18:13,356
and I'm willing to return these jewels,

316
00:18:18,196 --> 00:18:19,416
I want to give you a chance

317
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,956
considering that you are pregnant,

318
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,276
If you're still stubborn,

319
00:18:23,796 --> 00:18:25,196
then don't blame us for being ruthless,

320
00:18:28,156 --> 00:18:29,216
Speak up quickly!

321
00:18:30,756 --> 00:18:32,916
Whose child is it in the end,
Yizhao's or Menger's?

322
00:18:34,316 --> 00:18:35,356
I'm wronged,

323
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:36,916
Minister, you know I'm telling the truth,

324
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:39,756
I'm not pregnant,

325
00:18:41,024 --> 00:18:42,112
Not pregnant,

326
00:18:43,876 --> 00:18:45,396
Then you are lying,

327
00:18:47,328 --> 00:18:48,416
Reporting back to the Minister,

328
00:18:48,956 --> 00:18:49,976
When Ms, Li walked past me

329
00:18:49,976 --> 00:18:51,356
in the hall in other day,

330
00:18:52,396 --> 00:18:53,456
I noticed

331
00:18:53,456 --> 00:18:54,916
she's pregnant,

332
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,276
I've been practicing medicine for many years,

333
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,116
Apart from her physique and breath,

334
00:18:59,116 --> 00:19:01,516
Mrs, Li also experienced mild morning sickness
that day,

335
00:19:02,756 --> 00:19:04,156
Therefore, I dare to confirm

336
00:19:06,116 --> 00:19:07,356
that she's pregnant,

337
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,436
And it has been more than three months
at least,

338
00:19:17,996 --> 00:19:19,036
If you're not pregnant,

339
00:19:19,756 --> 00:19:22,396
do you dare let me take your pulse for you?

340
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:39,876
I'm sorry I know my mistake now,

341
00:19:40,676 --> 00:19:42,856
I'm indeed pregnant

342
00:19:42,856 --> 00:19:44,236
as the doctor said,

343
00:19:45,236 --> 00:19:46,756
I ask for your mercy, Minister,

344
00:19:46,756 --> 00:19:48,076
So, that child

345
00:19:48,996 --> 00:19:50,176
is Menger's?

346
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:53,920
Yes,

347
00:19:56,516 --> 00:19:58,476
You're also a person with a hard fate to pity,

348
00:19:59,436 --> 00:20:00,956
I want to show you the right direction,

349
00:20:01,516 --> 00:20:02,876
and I wonder if you are willing to take it,

350
00:20:03,476 --> 00:20:05,316
I am, I am,

351
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,116
Go to the government office
to identify the body,

352
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,356
Tell us if the deceased is Menger or Yizhao,

353
00:20:10,912 --> 00:20:11,936
In this way,

354
00:20:12,476 --> 00:20:14,036
I will no longer pursue your crimes,

355
00:20:14,556 --> 00:20:17,216
I will also give you some money
and a new identity

356
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,236
so you can then start over in another place,

357
00:20:20,236 --> 00:20:21,312
Is it okay?

358
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:22,916
Thank you, Minister,

359
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:23,916
Thank you, Minister,

360
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,236
I'm willing to identify the body,

361
00:20:32,896 --> 00:20:33,920
Send someone to

362
00:20:35,236 --> 00:20:38,236
bring in the thief who pretends to be Yizhao,

363
00:20:38,756 --> 00:20:40,356
Let me go, Let me go,

364
00:20:42,272 --> 00:20:43,296
Let me go,

365
00:20:46,396 --> 00:20:47,676
Menger,

366
00:20:47,676 --> 00:20:48,916
You have such a cold heart,

367
00:20:49,436 --> 00:20:51,356
You even had the heart
to kill your own brother,

368
00:20:55,596 --> 00:20:56,608
Menger,

369
00:20:57,396 --> 00:20:58,876
How did you kill Yizhao?

370
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:00,756
Aren't you going to confess?

371
00:21:01,436 --> 00:21:02,476
I, the little monk, am wronged,

372
00:21:02,476 --> 00:21:04,116
I don't know why this lady donor

373
00:21:04,116 --> 00:21:05,816
would mistake me for Menger,

374
00:21:05,816 --> 00:21:07,676
But I really am Yizhao,

375
00:21:08,516 --> 00:21:10,696
Menger has a birthmark on his left leg,

376
00:21:10,696 --> 00:21:12,776
But when I came to identify the body
last night,

377
00:21:12,776 --> 00:21:14,676
I noticed this body did not have
that birthmark,

378
00:21:15,276 --> 00:21:17,136
He is either Menger or Yizhao,

379
00:21:17,136 --> 00:21:18,756
Just inspect his left leg,

380
00:21:18,756 --> 00:21:19,956
and the truth will become clear,

381
00:21:21,408 --> 00:21:22,432
Bai San,

382
00:21:23,876 --> 00:21:24,876
pull up his pants,

383
00:21:28,636 --> 00:21:30,596
Let go of me! I am Yizhao!

384
00:21:32,556 --> 00:21:33,676
Let me go!

385
00:21:46,676 --> 00:21:48,116
Senior Official, there is indeed a birthmark,

386
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,144
Menger,

387
00:21:50,796 --> 00:21:51,956
what else do you have to say?

388
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,156
I didn't kill anyone,

389
00:21:59,956 --> 00:22:01,796
I did defraud Ms, Kong for their money,

390
00:22:02,476 --> 00:22:03,936
but I didn't kill my elder brother,

391
00:22:03,936 --> 00:22:05,516
Yizhao's death has nothing to do with me,

392
00:22:06,476 --> 00:22:07,716
My crime doesn't warrant death,

393
00:22:07,716 --> 00:22:08,996
Please investigate thoroughly, Senior Official,

394
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:10,576
Please investigate thoroughly, Senior Official,

395
00:22:10,576 --> 00:22:12,116
The evidence is as solid as a mountain,

396
00:22:12,116 --> 00:22:13,276
yet you're still making excuses,

397
00:22:14,836 --> 00:22:16,416
Every word I said was true,

398
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:17,756
Hope you will see clearly, Senior Official,

399
00:22:19,116 --> 00:22:20,156
Under the cover of night,

400
00:22:20,156 --> 00:22:21,376
Yizhao, unnoticed by anyone,

401
00:22:21,376 --> 00:22:22,476
secretly came to the mountain cave
where I was hiding,

402
00:22:22,476 --> 00:22:24,956
looking for me,

403
00:22:25,476 --> 00:22:28,036
However,
the night was dark, and the cliff was steep,

404
00:22:28,036 --> 00:22:30,756
he accidentally fell off the cliff and died,

405
00:22:35,552 --> 00:22:36,556
Meng Er,

406
00:22:37,436 --> 00:22:39,956
you're still lying incessantly even now,

407
00:22:39,956 --> 00:22:41,396
and you refuse to repent,

408
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:43,232
After Jiang Dalang

409
00:22:43,876 --> 00:22:45,296
and Ms, Kong's report,

410
00:22:45,296 --> 00:22:46,876
I immediately sent people
to search the mountains,

411
00:22:47,996 --> 00:22:49,396
If you're hiding in the mountains,

412
00:22:49,396 --> 00:22:50,516
how could I not find you?

413
00:22:53,396 --> 00:22:54,636
If I wasn't mistaken,

414
00:22:55,436 --> 00:22:56,596
you harbored the intent to kill

415
00:22:57,476 --> 00:23:00,236
to facilitate your affair with widow Li
as early as three months ago,

416
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,036
Yizhao then died by your hand,

417
00:23:02,636 --> 00:23:03,996
Yizhao died last night,

418
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:05,716
He died last night,

419
00:23:05,716 --> 00:23:07,076
If we follow your deduction, Senior Official,

420
00:23:07,076 --> 00:23:08,816
and assume he died three months ago,

421
00:23:08,816 --> 00:23:10,296
given the extremely hot weather condition,

422
00:23:10,296 --> 00:23:12,336
an autopsy will reveal the truth

423
00:23:12,336 --> 00:23:13,356
whether the body has been exposed for two days
or for many days,

424
00:23:13,356 --> 00:23:14,432
You can tell with an autopsy,

425
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:17,632
Coroner,

426
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,876
in your opinion, how long has Yizhao been dead?

427
00:23:24,576 --> 00:23:25,600
Reply to the Senior Official,

428
00:23:26,516 --> 00:23:27,996
based on the decomposition level of the body,

429
00:23:28,876 --> 00:23:30,836
he doesn't seem to have been dead
for three months,

430
00:23:32,476 --> 00:23:34,276
The weather these days is hot,

431
00:23:35,076 --> 00:23:37,516
and the body was found in the rural areas,

432
00:23:38,396 --> 00:23:39,836
If Yizhao has been dead for many days,

433
00:23:40,476 --> 00:23:42,296
his body cannot be this intact

434
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:44,636
under this sweltering weather,

435
00:23:45,756 --> 00:23:47,236
Right, right,

436
00:23:48,156 --> 00:23:49,556
Yizhao died the night before,

437
00:23:49,556 --> 00:23:51,636
He died accidentally by falling,

438
00:23:51,636 --> 00:23:53,236
No one else knows about the truth

439
00:23:53,236 --> 00:23:55,396
besides me and the bronze Buddha,

440
00:24:26,276 --> 00:24:27,916
This case indeed has many doubtful points,

441
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,160
For example,

442
00:24:32,876 --> 00:24:34,156
when exactly did the death occur?

443
00:24:35,716 --> 00:24:36,916
If it's as Menger described

444
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:38,316
and Yizhao died the night before,

445
00:24:38,316 --> 00:24:40,996
then there were only Yizhao and Menger
at the crime thing,

446
00:24:41,836 --> 00:24:43,756
So was it an accidental fall

447
00:24:43,756 --> 00:24:45,056
or was it a premeditated murder?

448
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,916
No one can provide any concrete evidence

449
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:48,556
and only Menger is left
to make evasive excuses,

450
00:24:51,036 --> 00:24:52,076
But if Yizhao

451
00:24:52,076 --> 00:24:53,156
indeed died three months ago

452
00:24:53,156 --> 00:24:54,236
as I've speculated,

453
00:24:56,076 --> 00:24:57,996
then the charge of murder against Menger

454
00:24:58,796 --> 00:24:59,840
could be confirmed,

455
00:25:04,676 --> 00:25:06,836
Things are rather intriguing
from what you said,

456
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:12,696
In that case, I will visit
the Great Buddha Temple tonight,

457
00:25:12,696 --> 00:25:14,716
Can we find any new clues?

458
00:25:16,512 --> 00:25:17,536
Thanks for your hard work, Minister,

459
00:25:18,036 --> 00:25:19,116
No need for formalities,

460
00:25:24,384 --> 00:25:31,264
<i>[The Great Hall]</i>

461
00:25:44,636 --> 00:25:46,516
Master, Minister,

462
00:25:48,156 --> 00:25:50,736
Did the bronze Buddha shed tears today?

463
00:25:50,736 --> 00:25:51,776
It has not,

464
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,556
Since I assigned people to guard here,

465
00:25:55,556 --> 00:25:59,236
the bronze Buddha has not again
shown the miracle of shedding tears,

466
00:26:36,836 --> 00:26:37,836
This is what the craftsmen left

467
00:26:38,436 --> 00:26:40,116
when the bronze Buddha was cast,

468
00:26:40,916 --> 00:26:42,016
In fact, the bronze Buddha statue

469
00:26:42,636 --> 00:26:43,956
is not cast in solid metal,

470
00:26:44,516 --> 00:26:45,516
Here is a secret door

471
00:26:46,116 --> 00:26:47,916
for the craftsmen to enter and exit,

472
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:49,636
How many people know about this secret door?

473
00:26:50,756 --> 00:26:53,096
The devotees worship the Buddha with piety,

474
00:26:53,096 --> 00:26:55,756
and they would not notice it,

475
00:26:56,876 --> 00:26:59,836
The monks take turns to clean on regular days

476
00:26:59,836 --> 00:27:02,236
and all of them are aware of it

477
00:27:02,236 --> 00:27:04,396
This is no longer a secret,

478
00:27:04,396 --> 00:27:06,396
Menger has stayed in the Great Buddha Temple
for a long time,

479
00:27:07,596 --> 00:27:08,676
and he should also know,

480
00:27:24,956 --> 00:27:26,048
Minister,

481
00:27:29,836 --> 00:27:30,976
Minister,

482
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:33,456
Have you discovered anything?

483
00:27:33,456 --> 00:27:34,456
Master,

484
00:27:34,456 --> 00:27:36,876
will Chongyu be able to stay
at the Temple tonight?

485
00:27:37,876 --> 00:27:39,436
I will arrange someone

486
00:27:39,956 --> 00:27:42,236
to clean up a top-tier zen room for you
right away,

487
00:27:42,848 --> 00:27:43,872
No need,

488
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,036
I'll Just stay in the room
previously used by Menger,

489
00:27:46,756 --> 00:27:47,776
Okay,

490
00:27:48,356 --> 00:27:49,536
as you wish, Minister,

491
00:27:50,756 --> 00:27:52,436
The Minister has already gone to investigate
in the Great Buddha Temple,

492
00:27:52,436 --> 00:27:54,316
That Bronze Buddha is not solidly cast,

493
00:27:54,316 --> 00:27:56,576
There is a hidden door behind the Buddha
that allows one person to enter and exit,

494
00:27:56,576 --> 00:27:58,396
No abnormalities were found
behind the hidden door,

495
00:27:58,996 --> 00:28:00,906
The Minister said
this case is of great importance,

496
00:28:00,906 --> 00:28:03,596
It's always good to keep each other informed
about details, no matter how small it seems,

497
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:07,016
The Minister will stay at the Temple
for the next few days,

498
00:28:07,016 --> 00:28:08,636
If there're any new discoveries
from your side, Senior Official,

499
00:28:08,636 --> 00:28:09,836
I will immediately relay the information,

500
00:28:11,072 --> 00:28:12,096
Understood,

501
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:14,304
I will take my leave now,

502
00:28:34,876 --> 00:28:36,636
Minister, please have your vegetarian meal,

503
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:56,996
Even though this zen room doesn't look fancy,

504
00:28:58,516 --> 00:29:00,756
it is cooler and more comfortable

505
00:29:00,756 --> 00:29:02,116
than my workshop's sleeping quarters,

506
00:29:02,836 --> 00:29:04,316
You are unaware, Minister,

507
00:29:04,316 --> 00:29:05,676
The Great Buddha Temple's ice cellar

508
00:29:05,676 --> 00:29:06,956
is right under this zen room,

509
00:29:07,636 --> 00:29:08,976
So, this room

510
00:29:08,976 --> 00:29:11,236
Is the coolest one in the Great Buddha Temple,

511
00:29:11,236 --> 00:29:13,396
Yizhao is the one
who takes care of the ice cellar,

512
00:29:15,556 --> 00:29:17,516
There's an ice cellar under this room?

513
00:29:18,196 --> 00:29:19,996
That's right, And the entrance is right there,

514
00:29:33,676 --> 00:29:36,296
The moisture on this baffle is seeping up
from the ice cellar,

515
00:29:36,296 --> 00:29:38,116
No matter how many times it's wiped,
it remains the same,

516
00:29:39,116 --> 00:29:41,156
It's not because we've been lazy
and haven't cleaned properly,

517
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:43,016
The Master had specifically instructed us

518
00:29:43,016 --> 00:29:44,716
that Minister Qu is an honored guest
of our temple,

519
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:45,796
We must serve you all,

520
00:29:45,796 --> 00:29:47,156
Sorry for the trouble, young master,

521
00:29:47,156 --> 00:29:49,156
I'm feeling a bit tired and would like to rest,

522
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:52,196
Then I shall not disturb you any longer,

523
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:53,876
Rest early for the night, Minister,

524
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,196
Tan!

525
00:30:58,996 --> 00:31:00,276
Master, what is it?

526
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:01,356
Go grab a bronze pot quickly,

527
00:31:02,116 --> 00:31:04,476
Fill the bronze pot
with the coolest well water,

528
00:31:04,476 --> 00:31:06,080
Make sure not to spill water
outside of the bronze pot,

529
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,196
Yes,

530
00:31:07,196 --> 00:31:08,320
Hurry up,

531
00:31:24,796 --> 00:31:25,956
Master,

532
00:31:25,956 --> 00:31:28,156
you have been looking at this bronze pot
for quite a while,

533
00:31:28,756 --> 00:31:29,756
What's so special

534
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:32,196
about this bronze pot?

535
00:31:32,796 --> 00:31:33,824
If this bronze pot is like this,

536
00:31:34,956 --> 00:31:36,556
then the Bronze Buddha is the same,

537
00:31:37,236 --> 00:31:39,036
What is the link
between the Bronze Buddha and the bronze pot?

538
00:31:39,556 --> 00:31:40,936
That bronze Buddha is not solid,

539
00:31:40,936 --> 00:31:41,996
and there is a secret chamber inside,

540
00:31:42,996 --> 00:31:45,316
If you were to put ice inside the Buddha statue

541
00:31:45,316 --> 00:31:46,576
during hot weather,

542
00:31:46,576 --> 00:31:47,716
the surface of the Bronze Buddha

543
00:31:47,716 --> 00:31:49,036
will appear drops of water,

544
00:31:50,636 --> 00:31:52,576
The Great Buddha Temple

545
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,516
is one of the few places with an ice cellar
in Xizhou,

546
00:31:55,636 --> 00:31:58,736
Very few people can afford to use ice
in Xizhou,

547
00:31:58,736 --> 00:32:00,736
Ice is very rare,

548
00:32:00,736 --> 00:32:02,516
so no one would think of it,

549
00:32:18,556 --> 00:32:20,956
Master, Minister Qu has arrived
and said it's urgent,

550
00:32:22,676 --> 00:32:23,916
Minister, you came in such a hurry,

551
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:25,696
Is there any significant discovery?

552
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:27,156
I do have some progress indeed,

553
00:32:28,276 --> 00:32:29,676
I'm listening,

554
00:32:29,676 --> 00:32:32,656
I found some good stuff in Menger's room,

555
00:32:32,656 --> 00:32:36,156
The entrance to the Great Buddha Temple's
ice cellar is right beneath his room,

556
00:32:36,156 --> 00:32:37,956
If according to what you said,

557
00:32:38,476 --> 00:32:40,636
Menger killed Yizhao three months ago,

558
00:32:40,636 --> 00:32:42,596
then it's very likely he hid the body

559
00:32:42,596 --> 00:32:44,556
in the ice cellar of the Great Buddha Temple

560
00:32:44,556 --> 00:32:46,216
and disguised himself as Yizhao,

561
00:32:46,216 --> 00:32:48,036
The temperature is extremely low
in the ice cellar,

562
00:32:48,036 --> 00:32:51,156
therefore,
Yizhao's body would decompose much slower,

563
00:32:53,516 --> 00:32:54,916
That's right,

564
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:56,296
But there's much more than that,

565
00:32:56,296 --> 00:32:57,796
I've discovered
the secret of the tearing Bronze Buddha statue

566
00:32:59,232 --> 00:33:00,316
as well,

567
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,116
What are you laughing at?

568
00:33:06,716 --> 00:33:07,936
Take a guess,

569
00:33:07,936 --> 00:33:09,116
You already knew?

570
00:33:09,836 --> 00:33:11,556
My Master is so smart,

571
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:13,636
How could such a small thing stump him?

572
00:33:14,476 --> 00:33:16,036
For sure, For sure,

573
00:33:17,876 --> 00:33:19,996
I filled that bronze pot with ice water,

574
00:33:20,716 --> 00:33:22,716
and it didn't take long for it
to become like that,

575
00:33:31,956 --> 00:33:33,276
You're one step ahead again,

576
00:33:35,756 --> 00:33:37,116
The truth is out there,

577
00:33:37,956 --> 00:33:39,072
We can close the case

578
00:33:39,904 --> 00:33:40,916
tomorrow,

579
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,176
<i>[The Great Hall]</i>

580
00:33:49,396 --> 00:33:50,516
The Buddha has shown his spirit,

581
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:02,304
Menger,

582
00:34:03,436 --> 00:34:04,636
do you know why today

583
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,196
I set up the public hall
in the Great Buddha Temple?

584
00:34:08,556 --> 00:34:10,716
I came for this Bronze Buddha,

585
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,156
The Bronze Buddha's mercy

586
00:34:13,916 --> 00:34:14,916
will prove my innocence,

587
00:34:17,676 --> 00:34:18,752
Okay,

588
00:34:20,716 --> 00:34:21,836
Then, as you wish,

589
00:34:23,156 --> 00:34:25,676
please let this Bronze Buddha bear witness
for you,

590
00:34:27,276 --> 00:34:29,476
However, I want to say something upfront,

591
00:34:31,316 --> 00:34:32,396
If the Bronze Buddha identifies

592
00:34:33,796 --> 00:34:34,916
you as the murderer,

593
00:34:35,716 --> 00:34:36,768
do you confess your crime?

594
00:34:44,676 --> 00:34:45,856
In front of the Buddha,

595
00:34:45,856 --> 00:34:47,156
I, Meng Er, swear

596
00:34:47,156 --> 00:34:49,236
to confess my guilt

597
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:51,176
if the Bronze Buddha identifies me
as the murderer,

598
00:34:51,176 --> 00:34:52,636
And I will not quibble,

599
00:34:52,636 --> 00:34:53,760
Good,

600
00:34:55,316 --> 00:34:56,384
Very good,

601
00:35:09,836 --> 00:35:11,196
I, Pei Xingjian, the Senior Official of Xizhou,

602
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:13,156
earnestly beseech the Buddha,

603
00:35:13,156 --> 00:35:14,596
This is for the Buddhist disciple, Yizhao,

604
00:35:15,156 --> 00:35:17,196
If he is killed
by his own younger brother Menger,

605
00:35:17,996 --> 00:35:19,676
please show us a miracle

606
00:35:20,396 --> 00:35:21,396
and tear for Yizhao,

607
00:35:22,076 --> 00:35:23,276
Please point out Menger in public

608
00:35:24,076 --> 00:35:25,276
and redress the dead,

609
00:36:02,756 --> 00:36:04,036
The Bronze Buddha is crying,

610
00:36:07,196 --> 00:36:08,636
The Bronze Buddha is crying,

611
00:36:08,636 --> 00:36:10,096
The Bronze Buddha has shown a miracle,

612
00:36:10,096 --> 00:36:11,556
Menger is the murderer,

613
00:36:12,116 --> 00:36:13,676
It was Menger who killed Yizhao,

614
00:36:13,676 --> 00:36:15,156
It was Menger,

615
00:36:19,396 --> 00:36:21,316
The Bronze Buddha sheds tears, it's him!

616
00:36:21,316 --> 00:36:22,876
He is the murderer!

617
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:24,036
The murderer!

618
00:36:42,752 --> 00:36:43,896
Master, Master,

619
00:36:43,896 --> 00:36:44,960
He's back!

620
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:48,416
He's back, he's back!

621
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:50,036
Stop the constant nagging,

622
00:36:50,036 --> 00:36:51,796
Speak slowly, What has returned?

623
00:36:51,796 --> 00:36:54,556
Lady Kudi has returned with Song'er,

624
00:36:55,436 --> 00:36:56,996
- They've returned?
- Yes, they've returned,

625
00:36:56,996 --> 00:36:59,276
Weren't they supposed to return in two days?
How come they have already returned?

626
00:36:59,276 --> 00:37:01,596
I don't know either,
Maybe they wanted to surprise you,

627
00:37:01,596 --> 00:37:02,624
They have already entered the city,

628
00:37:02,624 --> 00:37:04,216
- They've entered the city,
- Already?

629
00:37:04,216 --> 00:37:06,716
Then…then has the room been cleaned?

630
00:37:06,716 --> 00:37:09,156
Has the food that I asked to be prepared
been made ready?

631
00:37:09,156 --> 00:37:10,356
Not yet

632
00:37:10,356 --> 00:37:11,856
Why don't you hurry up and prepare?

633
00:37:11,856 --> 00:37:13,596
Hurry up, go now!

634
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:16,236
- That's great, that's great!
- Please take it easy, father-in-law

635
00:37:16,236 --> 00:37:18,036
- My grandson is back,
- Please be careful, Please take your time,

636
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:19,676
Amazing, my grandson is back!

637
00:37:19,676 --> 00:37:20,768
Please watch your step,

638
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,876
My grandson is back!

00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:14,911
<i>♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫</i>

720
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:19,743
<i>♫ Outside the pavilion, by the bridge ♫</i>

721
00:43:19,743 --> 00:43:23,231
<i>♫ Under the moonlight,
we parted at the doorstep ♫</i>

722
00:43:23,231 --> 00:43:29,727
<i>♫ I've endured hardship
to tell our lingering story ♫</i>

723
00:43:29,727 --> 00:43:33,119
<i>♫ Remembrance of past things ♫</i>

724
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,127
<i>♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫</i>

725
00:43:36,127 --> 00:43:39,679
<i>♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫</i>

726
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:42,783
<i>♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫</i>

727
00:43:42,783 --> 00:43:46,015
<i>♫ A snowy day, someone sings a sad song ♫</i>

728
00:43:46,015 --> 00:43:49,279
<i>♫ Against the window,
I had a drink for pleasure ♫</i>

729
00:43:49,279 --> 00:43:52,639
<i>♫ The moon still hangs in the sky,
but I'm no longer in the mood ♫</i>

730
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:57,535
<i>♫ It's quite and cold outside,
but I grab my pen again ♫</i>

731
00:44:10,994 --> 00:44:15,743
<i>♫ The destiny always comes with regrets ♫</i>

732
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:23,295
<i>♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫</i>

733
00:44:23,295 --> 00:44:26,862
<i>♫ Outside the pavilion, by the bridge ♫</i>

734
00:44:26,862 --> 00:44:30,158
<i>♫ Under the moonlight,
we parted at the doorstep ♫</i>

735
00:44:30,158 --> 00:44:36,654
<i>♫ I've endured hardship
to tell our lingering story ♫</i>

736
00:44:36,654 --> 00:44:40,046
<i>♫ Remembrance of past things ♫</i>

737
00:44:40,046 --> 00:44:43,342
<i>♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫</i>

738
00:44:43,342 --> 00:44:46,766
<i>♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫</i>

739
00:44:46,766 --> 00:44:49,998
<i>♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫</i>

740
00:44:49,998 --> 00:44:53,230
<i>♫ Winter comes again, and flowers wither ♫</i>

741
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:56,590
<i>♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫</i>

742
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:59,822
<i>♫ I look outside, like the poems asking ♫</i>

743
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:04,814
<i>♫ My love, have you
found someone good for you ♫</i>

744
00:45:04,814 --> 00:45:08,191
<i>♫ Remembrance of past things ♫</i>

745
00:45:08,191 --> 00:45:11,199
<i>♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫</i>

746
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:14,638
<i>♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫</i>

747
00:45:14,638 --> 00:45:17,599
<i>♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫</i>

748
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,422
<i>♫ Winter comes again, and flowers wither ♫</i>

749
00:45:21,422 --> 00:45:24,270
<i>♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫</i>

750
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:27,647
<i>♫ I look outside, like the poems asking ♫</i>

751
00:45:27,647 --> 00:45:33,198
<i>♫ My love, have you
found someone good for you ♫</i>
