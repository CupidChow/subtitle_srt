[Weaving A Tale of Love 2]

2
00:01:31,941 --> 00:01:35,905
[Episode 35]

3
00:01:36,887 --> 00:01:38,687
Ziyu, have you eaten lunch yet?

4
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:42,784
Yes, I have.

5
00:01:44,007 --> 00:01:48,047
Good. What did you eat?

6
00:01:49,807 --> 00:01:52,687
Just some ordinary soup buns.

7
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:57,847
Xizhou's government office is crudity,
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:58,687 --> 00:02:00,287
I beg your pardon.

9
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,376
Never mind.

10
00:02:02,487 --> 00:02:03,947
Since Ziyu does not disdain,

11
00:02:03,947 --> 00:02:06,047
now that it's already past noon,

12
00:02:06,047 --> 00:02:08,327
Minister and I have not yet had lunch,

13
00:02:09,327 --> 00:02:12,007
I will have someone fetch some lunch
from the kitchen.

14
00:02:12,847 --> 00:02:14,407
You won't mind, will you?

15
00:02:15,887 --> 00:02:17,967
My bad.

16
00:02:18,687 --> 00:02:21,607
Please wait a moment.

17
00:02:21,607 --> 00:02:24,247
I will order someone to fetch it immediately,
how's that?

18
00:02:24,807 --> 00:02:26,167
There's no need.

19
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:27,767
You are busy, Advisor.

20
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:30,207
For such small matters like getting food,
it is better for us to do it ourselves.

21
00:02:30,967 --> 00:02:34,287
Bai San, go to the kitchen
to fetch some food and water.

22
00:02:34,887 --> 00:02:36,064
Yes, sir.

23
00:02:39,607 --> 00:02:41,367
you guys go and help.

24
00:02:42,247 --> 00:02:44,407
Be careful not to spill the food.

25
00:02:45,527 --> 00:02:46,688
Yes, sir.

26
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:50,447
You and I have not had a drink together
for a long time.

27
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:52,407
How about taking advantage of the leisure time
today?

28
00:02:52,407 --> 00:02:54,607
Let's have a drink, how about it?

29
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:03,007
If you wish so,

30
00:03:04,287 --> 00:03:07,527
when the affairs of Xizhou have all settled,
we can discuss this.

31
00:03:08,807 --> 00:03:12,167
Now, you have a saber in one hand
and a wine jug in the other.

32
00:03:12,807 --> 00:03:14,127
You look extraordinary.

33
00:03:15,327 --> 00:03:18,807
I'm truly feels ashamed when I see you.

34
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:22,447
Don't worry, that day will not be too far off.

35
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:24,687
I can certainly wait.

36
00:03:26,447 --> 00:03:29,707
It's just that right now,
outside the Governor's Mansion,

37
00:03:29,707 --> 00:03:33,327
I don't know
if the anxious person can wait it out or not?

38
00:03:35,447 --> 00:03:37,207
It's bitterly cold today.

39
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:41,207
It really makes one…

40
00:03:41,207 --> 00:03:42,207
Young master!

41
00:03:42,727 --> 00:03:43,872
Young master!

42
00:03:45,047 --> 00:03:47,687
Young master,
where are you? Take me there quickly!

43
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:48,967
- The young master is inside.
- But…

44
00:03:53,447 --> 00:03:54,528
Be careful!

45
00:03:56,647 --> 00:03:58,247
Young master, there's trouble.

46
00:03:58,247 --> 00:03:59,328
what on earth has happened?

47
00:04:02,967 --> 00:04:04,288
Go on!

48
00:04:06,327 --> 00:04:08,927
The lady has been insulted.

49
00:04:09,727 --> 00:04:12,967
Master, a few young ladies
who just arrived at the house,

50
00:04:12,967 --> 00:04:14,207
they were dressed quite lavishly.

51
00:04:14,207 --> 00:04:16,447
The leader
who also calls herself lady's sister-in-law.

52
00:04:16,447 --> 00:04:17,807
I reported it to the lady,

53
00:04:17,807 --> 00:04:19,827
lady sent a message to let them in,

54
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:21,767
then I did, but who knows…

55
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:24,287
It's Lady Liuli.

56
00:04:24,287 --> 00:04:26,327
As soon as she entered the room,

57
00:04:26,327 --> 00:04:27,927
she slapped the lady twice without explanation.

58
00:04:28,847 --> 00:04:31,047
I wanted to protect the lady,

59
00:04:31,047 --> 00:04:33,167
but her people knocked me down.

60
00:04:33,687 --> 00:04:36,247
They also forced the lady to apologize.

61
00:04:36,887 --> 00:04:39,327
The lady fainted out of humiliation.

62
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:47,207
Master, it's not appropriate to publicize this.

63
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:49,367
Let the lady rest first.

64
00:04:49,887 --> 00:04:51,487
The fewer people who know, the better.

65
00:04:54,807 --> 00:04:56,007
How is the lady now?

66
00:04:57,927 --> 00:04:59,247
She woke up for a moment,

67
00:04:59,247 --> 00:05:02,727
but it's quite frightening
that she acts like wood.

68
00:05:07,127 --> 00:05:08,407
Go back and take good care of her.

69
00:05:09,527 --> 00:05:10,967
Tell her that I am already aware of the matter,

70
00:05:12,367 --> 00:05:14,247
let her rest and recuperate well.

71
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,927
I will deal with it once I return.

72
00:05:19,407 --> 00:05:20,567
Keep a good watch on the mansion's gate.

73
00:05:21,727 --> 00:05:22,967
If anyone else enters,

74
00:05:23,887 --> 00:05:25,007
I'll skin you!

75
00:05:26,087 --> 00:05:27,104
Yes, sir.

76
00:05:44,807 --> 00:05:47,887
Her slaps were truly beyond words.

77
00:05:49,727 --> 00:05:51,867
Her actions were really too rash and immature.

78
00:05:51,867 --> 00:05:55,087
In a fit of anger,
she disregarded her own safety.

79
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:01,087
Why did you refuse Master Su's kind invitation
just now?

80
00:06:01,607 --> 00:06:03,967
There're many limitations outside.

81
00:06:06,447 --> 00:06:08,527
He didn't stop us from going to get lunch.

82
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:11,487
This indicates that the situation outside
is still at a stalemate.

83
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:12,567
He doesn't dare to act rashly,

84
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,287
so,
he has adopted the strategy of divide and rule.

85
00:06:16,807 --> 00:06:18,607
Nowadays,

86
00:06:18,607 --> 00:06:21,327
we need our people to move around more
in our mansion,

87
00:06:21,887 --> 00:06:23,232
that's the most important thing.

88
00:06:30,367 --> 00:06:31,507
Just now, a man said

89
00:06:31,507 --> 00:06:33,167
that Nana just secretly threw a note.

90
00:06:34,967 --> 00:06:37,207
Before leaving, Nana told Laoliu secretly

91
00:06:38,487 --> 00:06:39,647
it was Yunyi's note to the Minister.

92
00:06:46,647 --> 00:06:48,427
Making Nana to deliver letters,

93
00:06:48,427 --> 00:06:50,967
it's indeed Yunyi's style,

94
00:06:50,967 --> 00:06:52,127
a person who is not bound by small details.

95
00:06:52,727 --> 00:06:55,107
When she and I were making Bai Die cloth,

96
00:06:55,107 --> 00:06:56,527
we found a kind of medicine.

97
00:06:56,527 --> 00:06:59,027
It can make the words disappear after writing.

98
00:06:59,027 --> 00:07:01,327
I didn't expect it could be put to such use.

99
00:07:01,327 --> 00:07:04,287
This method is truly amazing.

100
00:07:04,287 --> 00:07:06,607
That still doesn't compare to her two slaps.

101
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:39,456
[Raise an army from Nishu, Lord Su advances westward,
Xizhou is trapped, five hundred military members total]

102
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:44,247
Khan Xingxiwang is killed by Su Haizheng,
perhaps.

103
00:07:49,687 --> 00:07:51,727
What a frenzied man.

104
00:07:51,727 --> 00:07:54,127
Even if my family's troops breach the Xizhou
tomorrow,

105
00:07:54,127 --> 00:07:56,167
they probably won't let things rest at that.

106
00:07:57,127 --> 00:08:00,247
It's just,
how can my father's health endure this?

107
00:08:01,687 --> 00:08:03,040
It was my oversight.

108
00:08:04,407 --> 00:08:08,087
Su Haizheng must be pursuing and killing
the ranks of Wuduolu at this moment.

109
00:08:08,767 --> 00:08:10,047
He is taking the opportunity to loot wildly.

110
00:08:11,527 --> 00:08:12,767
Regardless of the outcome of this battle,

111
00:08:14,447 --> 00:08:15,807
the chaos in the Western Regions is set.

112
00:08:26,887 --> 00:08:28,447
Don't blame yourself.

113
00:08:28,447 --> 00:08:31,607
No one could have predicted
that Su Haizheng would be so rebellious.

114
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:34,487
It's too late to say these now.

115
00:08:36,407 --> 00:08:37,567
We should think about

116
00:08:39,367 --> 00:08:40,567
how to break the situation.

117
00:08:43,767 --> 00:08:46,507
What we arranged before
may not have much effect.

118
00:08:46,507 --> 00:08:49,207
It turns out that Su Haizheng
has fewer than 500 bodyguards by his side.

119
00:08:49,207 --> 00:08:51,687
Being on the battlefield,
he can't dispatch all troops here.

120
00:08:51,687 --> 00:08:53,247
They are bound to defend the government office
and the gate with all efforts.

121
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,787
Blocking all channels that could transmit information
from Xizhou to the capital.

122
00:08:55,787 --> 00:08:59,367
Forces outside mansion and within the city
should be border troops of Yizhou and Tingzhou.

123
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:01,847
They are just ordinary garrison soldiers
who farm military colonies in Western Regions.

124
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:04,687
Most of them probably do not know
the purpose of coming to Xizhou

125
00:09:04,687 --> 00:09:06,847
My father has been relying on drugs to hold on
for just three to five days.

126
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:09,267
I'm afraid my father won't be able to hold on
a few days later.

127
00:09:09,267 --> 00:09:10,967
As the saying goes,
divide a question and solve it.

128
00:09:11,807 --> 00:09:13,647
We must guard all the roads to Xizhou.

129
00:09:13,647 --> 00:09:15,207
The news that needs to be spread
should be disseminated.

130
00:09:15,207 --> 00:09:17,427
Those who need to be stopped and captured
should be stopped and captured.

131
00:09:17,427 --> 00:09:18,447
Now that things have come to this,

132
00:09:19,247 --> 00:09:20,727
how should we get our message out?

133
00:09:25,327 --> 00:09:26,560
Let me give it a try.

134
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,767
Look, he's coming out.

135
00:09:40,767 --> 00:09:42,127
Where are your supervisors?

136
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:50,127
Go tell Advisor Feng
that the food here is too unpalatable.

137
00:09:50,127 --> 00:09:52,247
I want to eat the vegetarian dishes
from Puzhao Temple.

138
00:09:52,247 --> 00:09:55,447
Please reserve a table for me tonight.

139
00:09:59,047 --> 00:10:01,447
I apologize, Minister.

140
00:10:02,247 --> 00:10:04,147
The Advisor has official duties.

141
00:10:04,147 --> 00:10:06,087
He has no time to deal with these.

142
00:10:06,727 --> 00:10:10,167
Minister,
if you find the meals at here unpleasant,

143
00:10:10,807 --> 00:10:13,287
I think it wouldn't hurt to be hungry.

144
00:10:14,287 --> 00:10:17,847
I'm sure it'll taste much better
when you eat it again.

145
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:22,767
Who do you think you are?

146
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:25,527
You even dare to act arrogantly
when Minister merely asked you to pass a message?

147
00:10:29,447 --> 00:10:31,727
Why bother arguing with this kind of person?

148
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:46,144
What are you going to do?

149
00:10:53,407 --> 00:10:55,347
[Send a vegetarian dish from Puzhao Temple to mansion]
Minister can eat anything

150
00:10:55,347 --> 00:10:57,247
as long as he wants to.

151
00:11:10,847 --> 00:11:12,527
People of Xizhou on the wall, listen up,

152
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:16,007
deliver this letter to Lady Liuli,
there will be a reward from Minister.

153
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:42,048
[Pei's Mansion]

154
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:57,687
My lady,
it was sent with an arrow by the Minister.

155
00:12:01,327 --> 00:12:02,587
These are Chongyu's characters.

156
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:04,707
But what time is it already?

157
00:12:04,707 --> 00:12:06,487
He still has the mood to be particular
about food and drink?

158
00:12:25,887 --> 00:12:29,247
Spreading the evil deeds of the Su family,
dividing the border army.

159
00:12:30,487 --> 00:12:33,327
It seems they've already received the message
by Nana.

160
00:12:34,807 --> 00:12:35,967
Indeed, it was a good idea.

161
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:40,067
Sister, Lady Jing, what are you talking about?

162
00:12:40,067 --> 00:12:41,247
There's no time to explain more.

163
00:12:41,807 --> 00:12:44,087
Xiao Tan, deliver the vegetarian dishes
from Puzhao Temple

164
00:12:44,087 --> 00:12:45,527
to Senior Official and Minister.

165
00:12:46,127 --> 00:12:48,527
In addition,
order some hot soup cakes and roast meat

166
00:12:48,527 --> 00:12:50,127
to the garrison soldiers of Xizhou.

167
00:12:50,127 --> 00:12:52,667
Take more care of the border troops
and chat with them more.

168
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:54,167
Understood, I'll do it right away.

169
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:30,767
Mr. Zhou,
Advisor Feng invites you to have a meal.

170
00:13:39,927 --> 00:13:43,167
There should be hot water and soup available
in the mansion.

171
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:45,027
It's just that I don't know about our dry food,

172
00:13:45,027 --> 00:13:46,567
how many days do we have to eat?

173
00:13:47,287 --> 00:13:49,567
How can we compare with them?

174
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:52,167
They're all trusted confidants
of the Chief Administrator.

175
00:13:53,087 --> 00:13:55,087
We, on the other hand, are just hard laborers,

176
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:58,627
not even as good as those
who follow the Chief Administrator into battle.

177
00:13:58,627 --> 00:14:00,287
At least
they can earn some military merits and rewards.

178
00:14:00,967 --> 00:14:04,487
The most we can do on this journey is to chill
in the cold wind.

179
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:11,887
Come, have more of the good roasted meat.

180
00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:26,127
Have the two of you had dinner?

181
00:14:37,647 --> 00:14:39,927
Speaking of which,
we are all soldiers of the great Tang.

182
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:42,807
We simply act according to the orders
from those above us.

183
00:14:42,807 --> 00:14:45,207
Our superiors are not inclined to call for war
now,

184
00:14:46,007 --> 00:14:47,927
so why should we turn our weapons
against each other?

185
00:14:50,047 --> 00:14:51,456
If you two gentlemen do not mind,

186
00:14:52,247 --> 00:14:57,167
consider this meal as an apology from me,
how about that?

187
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,327
We appreciate your kindness.

188
00:15:03,007 --> 00:15:04,807
It's just that we have already eaten today,

189
00:15:04,807 --> 00:15:05,807
so, we won't accept it.

190
00:15:05,807 --> 00:15:07,667
This is not ordinary food.

191
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:09,247
It's all high-quality roast meat.

192
00:15:14,927 --> 00:15:16,367
The two of you might eat in the evening,

193
00:15:17,687 --> 00:15:19,327
just remember to return the container to me
tomorrow.

194
00:15:22,407 --> 00:15:23,647
- Wu.
- Yes.

195
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:25,767
Distribute this among the brothers.

196
00:15:26,287 --> 00:15:27,552
Yes.

197
00:15:28,967 --> 00:15:31,287
You two are not the bodyguards
of Chief Administrator Su, are you?

198
00:15:32,487 --> 00:15:34,887
Unsure if you're from Yizhou or Tingzhou?

199
00:15:35,487 --> 00:15:37,727
Good one,
we are indeed the border troops of Yizhou.

200
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:41,007
Come on.

201
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:43,727
More than half of the personal troops
of Chief Administrator Su

202
00:15:43,727 --> 00:15:46,567
have been killed by robbers.

203
00:15:47,687 --> 00:15:49,807
Now, there are only a bit
more than four hundred of them left.

204
00:15:50,607 --> 00:15:52,807
How could you be
Chief Administrator Su's troops?

205
00:15:55,407 --> 00:15:57,287
Both of you
have also come from the military camp.

206
00:15:57,807 --> 00:16:01,407
Did you notice the central military tent
of Chief Administrator Su?

207
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:04,487
Is it surprising that there are so few tents
around?

208
00:16:30,487 --> 00:16:32,567
I've heard that you have not been well.

209
00:16:33,087 --> 00:16:35,087
I wonder if you are feeling better today.

210
00:16:35,807 --> 00:16:37,607
Thank you, Mr. Wang, for your concern.

211
00:16:38,327 --> 00:16:41,207
Every day I make it through is another day.

212
00:16:42,047 --> 00:16:44,567
Please have a seat.

213
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,464
To be frank with you,

214
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:58,927
one of the reasons I came here
was to apologize.

215
00:16:59,847 --> 00:17:03,127
The events of the past two days
must have startled you, sir.

216
00:17:04,407 --> 00:17:06,087
All you need is rest at home

217
00:17:07,087 --> 00:17:08,687
A conclusion will soon be reached.

218
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,767
Secondly,

219
00:17:10,767 --> 00:17:14,967
Chief Administrator Su appreciates the marriage
between your younger sister and young master.

220
00:17:16,727 --> 00:17:18,487
This time, we have come to Xizhou,

221
00:17:18,487 --> 00:17:20,867
and the Chief Administrator
has specifically instructed

222
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:24,487
to express his gratitude to Advisor Zhang
on his behalf.

223
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:31,047
Advisor Xie has always been closely allied
with the Su family.

224
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:39,607
I dare not assume such praise.

225
00:17:40,247 --> 00:17:43,487
Moreover, I must also inform you

226
00:17:44,767 --> 00:17:47,647
Khan Xingxiwang
was secretly plotting a rebellion.

227
00:17:47,647 --> 00:17:50,287
He has already been brought to justice
by the Chief Administrator.

228
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:04,387
As for the remnants of other rebel parties,

229
00:18:04,387 --> 00:18:08,767
they have been defeated by Chief Administrator
and the Khan Jiwangjue's joint forces.

230
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,767
Presumably,
they will be brought to justice soon after.

231
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:15,907
Well, about the battle in the valley,

232
00:18:15,907 --> 00:18:18,567
it was not robbers who came to rob the grain.

233
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:27,247
Chief Administrator once sent more than 600 bodyguards
to pursue and eliminate the robbers.

234
00:18:27,247 --> 00:18:29,007
That day they pursued them to the valley,

235
00:18:29,687 --> 00:18:31,087
those robbers have nowhere to escape,

236
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:35,527
so they wanted to seize those grain carts
for themselves.

237
00:18:36,327 --> 00:18:38,807
Fortunately, all the troops
fought to the death without retreat,

238
00:18:38,807 --> 00:18:40,367
only thus did those robbers fail to succeed.

239
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,927
Chief Administrator's bodyguards
carried out a block and slaughter from behind.

240
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:46,167
Who knew that just at that moment,

241
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,867
the cavalry of Khan Xingxiwang arrived.

242
00:18:48,867 --> 00:18:52,647
Seeing an opportunity,
he became eager to take the credit.

243
00:18:53,527 --> 00:18:56,727
They hacked away indiscriminately
without distinguishing friend from foe.

244
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:01,607
This was the so-called achievement of
annihilating hundreds of horse bandits in one battle.

245
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,527
Minister Qu was well aware of it all.

246
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:07,687
Therefore, he ordered no prisoners be taken.

247
00:19:07,687 --> 00:19:10,047
His aim was to create a false impression.

248
00:19:11,887 --> 00:19:15,207
Although Senior Official Pei knew of this,
he kept it hidden and did not report it.

249
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:19,887
Of course, you must be dealing with affairs
in the inner camp.

250
00:19:19,887 --> 00:19:21,687
Certainly, you were kept in the dark.

251
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:26,087
This battle caused a rare tragedy
for our great Tang.

252
00:19:27,487 --> 00:19:30,927
Now, on the side of Khan Xingxiwang,
someone has already confessed.

253
00:19:32,407 --> 00:19:35,327
If you are willing to come forward and confess,

254
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:39,607
not only can you clear yourself of suspicion
of complicity,

255
00:19:39,607 --> 00:19:43,007
but you can also establish great merit
for exposing the anti-party activities.

256
00:19:43,647 --> 00:19:46,967
Chief Administrator
will surely take credit for you.

257
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:56,307
You both are unaware of something.

258
00:19:56,307 --> 00:19:58,327
These robbers have not been
completely eradicated.

259
00:19:59,047 --> 00:20:00,567
Senior Official has left a few alive,

260
00:20:01,127 --> 00:20:04,247
they are probably already in Chang'an.

261
00:20:06,487 --> 00:20:10,467
Chief Administrator Su has tried
every possible means to conceal this matter,

262
00:20:10,467 --> 00:20:13,407
but in the world there is no paper
that can contain fire?

263
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:18,447
Even Officer Zhou and Advisor Feng

264
00:20:18,447 --> 00:20:19,447
may have noticed it.

265
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:23,567
Therefore, they dare not
argue with Lady Liuli again,

266
00:20:24,327 --> 00:20:28,567
so that the people in the Governor's Mansion
can get a taste of the finest vegetarian meals.

267
00:20:29,647 --> 00:20:32,087
Who wouldn't want to leave themselves
a way out?

268
00:20:43,447 --> 00:20:44,704
What are you doing?

269
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:51,707
Officer Zhou, I was just having a casual chat
with these two comrades.

270
00:20:51,707 --> 00:20:55,687
We were discussing Khan Xingxiwang
and the Minister,

271
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,867
about the matter
of annihilating those hundreds of robbers.

272
00:20:57,867 --> 00:20:59,607
I heard that those horse robbers
are well-trained.

273
00:21:00,247 --> 00:21:04,007
I fear they may not be much different
than the bodyguards of Chief Administrator Su.

274
00:21:04,767 --> 00:21:05,867
You're talking nonsense!

275
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:09,127
Yes, yes, you are right.

276
00:21:09,127 --> 00:21:11,327
I'm just talking nonsense.

277
00:21:11,327 --> 00:21:13,687
Why must you act as if facing a great enemy?

278
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:23,087
You two are connecting

279
00:21:23,087 --> 00:21:24,847
with rebels who stubbornly resist
in the face of adversity.

280
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:27,047
You are letting him
disrupt the military's morale.

281
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:29,327
Everyone goes to take ten military rods!

282
00:21:33,647 --> 00:21:36,647
Advisor, is inside this city of Xizhou today,

283
00:21:36,647 --> 00:21:38,967
even though the rumors are everywhere,

284
00:21:40,287 --> 00:21:42,647
there still are tens of thousands of troops
under the command of the Chief Administrator.

285
00:21:43,407 --> 00:21:46,287
Once they have wiped out the remnants
of Khan Xingxiwang,

286
00:21:46,287 --> 00:21:48,087
they will send troops down to the west.

287
00:21:49,087 --> 00:21:51,487
By then, for this tiny Xizhou city,

288
00:21:51,487 --> 00:21:53,047
how could it possibly resist to the end?

289
00:21:55,087 --> 00:21:57,827
The Qu family, father and son,
have committed such great evils,

290
00:21:57,827 --> 00:21:59,967
most certainly they cannot escape the law.

291
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:07,647
But when this major war is about to arrive,

292
00:22:07,647 --> 00:22:10,107
everyone will suffer,
whether innocent or guilty.

293
00:22:10,107 --> 00:22:12,907
All these old and young,
women and children inside the city,

294
00:22:12,907 --> 00:22:15,447
if even their family heads
cannot protect themselves,

295
00:22:15,447 --> 00:22:18,367
I am afraid they will also be involved
in this disastrous war.

296
00:22:21,527 --> 00:22:22,647
You are a wise man,

297
00:22:23,247 --> 00:22:27,087
you should make decisions
about what to do and where to go.

298
00:22:37,047 --> 00:22:39,767
I appreciate you for speaking truthfully.

299
00:22:44,287 --> 00:22:48,047
I wonder what I can do

300
00:22:48,607 --> 00:22:50,127
to serve the Chief Administrator?

301
00:22:50,847 --> 00:22:52,307
This matter is quite easy,

302
00:22:52,307 --> 00:22:54,927
you just need to write down the day's events
with me,

303
00:22:54,927 --> 00:22:57,207
and sign on it, and deliver it to me.

304
00:23:04,287 --> 00:23:05,632
Alright.

305
00:23:11,527 --> 00:23:15,727
Mr. Wang, come with me, to my study.

306
00:23:17,367 --> 00:23:19,247
You are indeed wise.

307
00:23:22,327 --> 00:23:25,207
I'm going to prepare paper
and grind ink for you right away.

308
00:23:47,607 --> 00:23:48,967
Are you okay?

309
00:23:48,967 --> 00:23:50,567
Don't touch me, my arm hurts!

310
00:24:01,687 --> 00:24:03,136
Go get the doctor quickly!

311
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:20,447
Mr. Zhang,
why did you have to trouble yourself like this?

312
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:24,627
You must know
you have made the right decision now,

313
00:24:24,627 --> 00:24:26,367
what you've saved is not just an arm,

314
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:28,807
but the lives of all our clan members.

315
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:35,007
I appreciate the kindness of you, Mr. Wang.

316
00:24:35,687 --> 00:24:37,907
It's just I am timid and unfortunate.

317
00:24:37,907 --> 00:24:40,887
I fear
this right hand will need some time to heal.

318
00:24:40,887 --> 00:24:43,847
Fortunately, the Chief Administrator
is suppressing the rebellious party.

319
00:24:43,847 --> 00:24:45,467
The day of the army's return is still far.

320
00:24:45,467 --> 00:24:48,747
After a month or two of recuperation,
this right hand will naturally recover.

321
00:24:48,747 --> 00:24:50,847
It will not interfere
with the Chief Administrator's affairs.

322
00:24:52,447 --> 00:24:53,487
Mr. Wang…

323
00:24:56,727 --> 00:24:57,952
Fine.

324
00:25:01,127 --> 00:25:06,687
I just hope you will recover soon.

325
00:25:32,527 --> 00:25:33,567
How are you?

326
00:25:34,247 --> 00:25:37,167
Rest assured, I am quite skilled
at injuring myself in a fall.

327
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:38,527
There is no match for me in Xizhou.

328
00:25:41,767 --> 00:25:43,707
I heard that Advisor Wang is very annoyed.

329
00:25:43,707 --> 00:25:46,047
How could they make up such nonsense?

330
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:49,207
But if we don't comply with them,

331
00:25:49,807 --> 00:25:51,487
will it cause a huge disaster?

332
00:25:52,087 --> 00:25:54,007
It is still unknown who will win.

333
00:25:54,847 --> 00:25:56,687
If the Mr. Su really had any certainty,

334
00:25:56,687 --> 00:25:58,327
why not dare to take the Governor
out of the city?

335
00:25:59,887 --> 00:26:01,327
Moreover,

336
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:03,387
yesterday, Lady Zhangmin was bullied.

337
00:26:03,387 --> 00:26:05,527
- He dared to show his face up until now.
- Indeed.

338
00:26:05,527 --> 00:26:08,087
This shows he is still afraid of the noble
behind the Kudi family.

339
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:12,067
If it is really as Advisor Wang says,

340
00:26:12,067 --> 00:26:14,147
when the moment comes
that troops reach the city walls,

341
00:26:14,147 --> 00:26:16,487
I myself shall write a confession
to preserve our family.

342
00:26:17,647 --> 00:26:18,847
As for now,

343
00:26:24,647 --> 00:26:26,647
go find an inconspicuous and clever maid

344
00:26:26,647 --> 00:26:28,187
to report what has been witnessed today,

345
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:29,887
then tell Madam Kudi quietly.

346
00:26:58,207 --> 00:27:00,447
Yunyi, take a seat and rest for a moment.

347
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:02,767
According to our plan,

348
00:27:03,407 --> 00:27:06,007
these past few days,
almost every border soldier in Yizhou

349
00:27:06,007 --> 00:27:09,247
has already partaken in the hot meals
sent by our Xizhou municipal troops.

350
00:27:09,247 --> 00:27:12,127
Meanwhile, Su Haizheng's bodyguards' issue
about posing as robbers

351
00:27:12,127 --> 00:27:14,867
and the massacre
of the innocent Khan Xingxiwang

352
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:17,127
has already spread among the troops in Yizhou.

353
00:27:17,127 --> 00:27:18,127
Their troops' morale is faltering.

354
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:19,947
But sister,

355
00:27:19,947 --> 00:27:22,687
Chongyu and my brother-in-law have been detained
in the Governor's Mansion for five days.

356
00:27:22,687 --> 00:27:24,007
I am really worried.

357
00:27:25,407 --> 00:27:27,907
Today, Nana took advantage
of Zhang Minniang's illness.

358
00:27:27,907 --> 00:27:30,147
She went to the Governor's Mansion again
to find Su Nanjin.

359
00:27:30,147 --> 00:27:33,087
She brought the news from outside
to the Minister and Senior Official.

360
00:27:33,087 --> 00:27:35,067
At the same time,
she also conveyed their messages.

361
00:27:35,067 --> 00:27:37,007
Both of them are well.

362
00:27:42,207 --> 00:27:43,407
Lady,

363
00:27:43,407 --> 00:27:46,167
Zhang Huaiji has someone
discreetly send a message.

364
00:27:46,967 --> 00:27:49,487
Advisor Wang visited to persuade him
to be a corroborating witness.

365
00:27:49,487 --> 00:27:52,447
He falsely accused Khan Xingxiwang cavalry
of seizing military merit,

366
00:27:52,447 --> 00:27:54,727
and even slaughtered the robbers
and bodyguards together.

367
00:27:54,727 --> 00:27:57,207
Advisor Zhang delayed with a broken arm.

368
00:27:57,207 --> 00:27:59,947
They really know how to twist the truth,
have they no shame?

369
00:27:59,947 --> 00:28:00,987
I'll go find them.

370
00:28:00,987 --> 00:28:02,727
Where are you going, Yunyi?

371
00:28:02,727 --> 00:28:03,727
I have important news.

372
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:10,167
Take a sip of water and speak slowly.

373
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:17,847
Firstly, the Officer Zhou noticed
something was amiss in the military atmosphere,

374
00:28:17,847 --> 00:28:18,967
after uncovering the mystery within,

375
00:28:18,967 --> 00:28:21,387
he caught a few soldiers in the act
and severely punished them with fifty military sticks.

376
00:28:21,387 --> 00:28:23,067
The internal conflicts
of the border troops intensified.

377
00:28:23,067 --> 00:28:24,927
Secondly, outside city gate,

378
00:28:24,927 --> 00:28:27,767
the number of sturdy soldiers and government troops
from various places who have rushed to Xizhou has exceeded a thousand.

379
00:28:31,087 --> 00:28:32,887
It seems the time has come.

380
00:28:32,887 --> 00:28:36,147
Instruct them to pay attention to
the arrows shot from within the Governor's Mansion.

381
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:37,927
If any, bring them over immediately.

382
00:28:37,927 --> 00:28:39,040
Yes.

383
00:29:11,807 --> 00:29:12,887
By tomorrow,

384
00:29:14,567 --> 00:29:16,887
I think I will change out of these robes.

385
00:29:20,687 --> 00:29:22,687
It is estimated the border troops
are already in disarray at this moment.

386
00:29:23,647 --> 00:29:25,127
It's very likely in the next few days,

387
00:29:25,127 --> 00:29:28,427
the remnants of Khan Xingxiwang
may start their vengeance against our border.

388
00:29:28,427 --> 00:29:30,607
At that time, we will be able to walk
out of this predicament.

389
00:29:30,607 --> 00:29:31,647
It is something one desires but cannot get.

390
00:29:34,367 --> 00:29:37,327
I'm only worried about father's entourage.

391
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:44,847
Minister.

392
00:29:44,847 --> 00:29:45,927
What's the matter?

393
00:29:45,927 --> 00:29:47,967
The Governor has been moved
to the small courtyard behind.

394
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:53,207
Because he is sick.

395
00:30:14,207 --> 00:30:15,552
Minister!

396
00:30:20,807 --> 00:30:22,607
You can't go.

397
00:30:22,607 --> 00:30:24,007
The people who were just guarding our study,

398
00:30:24,007 --> 00:30:25,927
they just didn't dare to
delay the Governor's illness,

399
00:30:25,927 --> 00:30:27,567
watched them

400
00:30:27,567 --> 00:30:29,327
moving the Governor into the backyard.

401
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,207
Even the Governor's entourage

402
00:30:31,207 --> 00:30:32,627
were all forced out by them.

403
00:30:32,627 --> 00:30:35,487
Now, their people are everywhere
in the small courtyard.

404
00:30:36,527 --> 00:30:39,567
Now is not the time for Chongyu to act rashly.

405
00:30:40,167 --> 00:30:42,767
If you walk right into the trap,
it will harm the Governor instead.

406
00:30:45,647 --> 00:30:46,687
Walking right into the trap?

407
00:30:48,367 --> 00:30:51,387
Either way, it's just a fight with
at least a fifty percent chance of winning.

408
00:30:51,387 --> 00:30:52,407
Shouyue,

409
00:30:52,407 --> 00:30:54,807
do you want me to just watch my father--

410
00:30:54,807 --> 00:30:56,087
If the Governor is still in the study,

411
00:30:58,007 --> 00:30:59,687
then our people are everywhere.

412
00:30:59,687 --> 00:31:01,887
At that time, there indeed was a fifty percent
chance of success in attacking.

413
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:03,807
But now, it's less than even thirty percent.

414
00:31:05,287 --> 00:31:07,447
If they lock up the courtyard
and then carry out the Governor,

415
00:31:07,447 --> 00:31:08,927
what can you do about it?

416
00:31:08,927 --> 00:31:10,607
Is it to surrender or fight until the end?

417
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:14,527
By then, not only will you
be unable to save the Governor,

418
00:31:15,327 --> 00:31:16,407
but you will also be risking your own life.

419
00:31:17,327 --> 00:31:18,887
Even I will be risking my own life?

420
00:31:18,887 --> 00:31:22,247
Then,
what if I trade my life for my father's life?

421
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:24,007
If you can trade, then go ahead and do it now.

422
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,207
I certainly won't stop you.

423
00:31:25,207 --> 00:31:26,487
But can one really trade lives?

424
00:31:27,447 --> 00:31:29,967
You must understand that if you're alright,
the Governor will be alright too.

425
00:31:30,687 --> 00:31:32,407
If you also fall under Su Nanjin's control,

426
00:31:33,047 --> 00:31:35,807
even if there are thousands of troops,
we might not necessarily be able to save the Governor.

427
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:50,247
Then, according to you,
what should be done now?

428
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:54,767
For now, the best plan is to
watch changes and then make plans.

429
00:31:55,527 --> 00:31:57,527
Surely,
Su Nanjin will come looking for you soon.

430
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:00,847
If he sees you in such a state
of desperate anxiety,

431
00:32:00,847 --> 00:32:02,247
then we will be completely defeated.

432
00:32:03,647 --> 00:32:04,647
Nothing is decided yet.

433
00:32:05,367 --> 00:32:06,567
They also don't want to see the Governor's

434
00:32:07,087 --> 00:32:08,887
unexpected thing in this situation.

435
00:32:10,127 --> 00:32:11,407
The easier you act,

436
00:32:12,207 --> 00:32:13,927
the less they dare to slight the Governor.

437
00:32:16,487 --> 00:32:20,247
Minister Qu,
your father's body is not very well.

438
00:32:21,007 --> 00:32:22,727
Don't you want to go and see him?

439
00:32:58,567 --> 00:33:00,407
I have understood what Mr. Su just said.

440
00:33:01,087 --> 00:33:04,127
You are taking care of my father,
I naturally feel much more at ease.

441
00:33:04,727 --> 00:33:08,247
But if something happens to my father,

442
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:10,487
please relay this to the imperial office,

443
00:33:11,087 --> 00:33:12,367
and let them see

444
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:15,687
how Chief Administrator Su
has imprisoned a third-rank official

445
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:17,367
neglected to death.

446
00:33:18,327 --> 00:33:20,407
Chongyu, you really have a heart of stone.

447
00:33:22,487 --> 00:33:23,967
Likewise.

448
00:33:24,887 --> 00:33:26,007
How about you, Shouyue?

449
00:33:27,127 --> 00:33:29,367
The Governor must have had a relapse
of his old illness,

450
00:33:32,607 --> 00:33:36,887
he is watched and pressured day and night
by Mr. Su's men,

451
00:33:37,567 --> 00:33:40,167
he can't eat well, nor can I sleep well.

452
00:33:41,087 --> 00:33:42,727
Not to mention
that he is a frail and sickly person.

453
00:33:43,487 --> 00:33:45,647
Some of us can hardly bear it anymore.

454
00:33:46,967 --> 00:33:48,567
Now we can only bother Zi Yu,

455
00:33:49,447 --> 00:33:52,687
apart from consulting the physician
for a prescription, the Governor should also try to relax.

456
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:54,527
If you're worried,

457
00:33:55,247 --> 00:33:57,807
it would be better to invite
the Governor's wife to this place.

458
00:33:57,807 --> 00:34:01,007
After all, some things are better handled
by the lady.

459
00:34:04,047 --> 00:34:07,047
As for me, I won't bother much anymore.

460
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:15,967
The two of you…

461
00:34:29,287 --> 00:34:30,592
Shouyue…

462
00:34:37,527 --> 00:34:39,647
I originally thought things had taken a turn!

463
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:43,647
Once Qu Chongyu enters that courtyard,
he shouldn't expect to leave unscathed!

464
00:34:44,927 --> 00:34:47,727
At the very least, with this medical affair,
we can force him to comply.

465
00:34:49,567 --> 00:34:51,040
But I never figure out

466
00:34:51,687 --> 00:34:54,807
that he could actually
disregard his sick father entirely.

467
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:03,207
Right now, we really can't ignore Governor Qu.

468
00:35:04,287 --> 00:35:05,487
If he truly remains untreated,

469
00:35:06,007 --> 00:35:08,607
Qu Chongyu will have no further concerns.

470
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:12,647
These people from Xizhou are even more united
in their hatred for the enemy.

471
00:35:13,927 --> 00:35:15,207
And as for that old fellow,

472
00:35:17,487 --> 00:35:19,447
according to you, how should he be dealt with?

473
00:35:22,327 --> 00:35:24,247
Fortunately, the physician just mentioned that

474
00:35:25,287 --> 00:35:28,087
Governor Qu's illness is difficult to cure,

475
00:35:28,647 --> 00:35:31,567
but he will not die immediately or anytime
soon.

476
00:35:32,887 --> 00:35:36,407
We can only find some famous physicians
to keep him breathing for now.

477
00:35:38,287 --> 00:35:40,887
Nowadays, Xizhou city is becoming
more unstable by the day.

478
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:47,047
Let's first figure out a way to bring Qu Chongyu
before the army and then discuss further

479
00:35:59,287 --> 00:36:01,007
Just now, the military physician
has already checked the pulse for the Governor.

480
00:36:02,047 --> 00:36:05,047
Although he is not in danger of losing his life,
he needs to go home and recuperate.

481
00:36:05,847 --> 00:36:08,707
If Chongyu is willing to go with me
to the military front,

482
00:36:08,707 --> 00:36:10,527
Governor Qu can then go home to rest.

483
00:36:11,927 --> 00:36:14,047
I wonder what Chongyu thinks about this?

484
00:36:15,247 --> 00:36:17,087
It's still more important
to treat the Governor's illness first.

485
00:36:18,087 --> 00:36:21,047
Whether to go to the military front or not,
we can discuss further at length.

486
00:36:30,487 --> 00:36:31,680
You,

487
00:36:32,407 --> 00:36:34,127
bring over a few physicians from Xizhou

488
00:36:35,047 --> 00:36:36,407
to diagnose the disease for Governor Qu.

489
00:36:40,487 --> 00:36:42,747
Su Haizheng killed Khan Xingxiwang

490
00:36:42,747 --> 00:36:44,992
together with the Dasi Jin
of the Five Duo Tribes under his command

491
00:36:44,992 --> 00:36:47,047
Deceived into the army camp
and executed at the camp gate

492
00:36:49,527 --> 00:36:52,107
Ashina Duzhi, who is under the command of Khan

493
00:36:52,107 --> 00:36:55,847
Leading five thousand cavalry
to rush for a thousand li and attack Tingzhou

494
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:57,547
Swear to avenge for Khan

495
00:36:57,547 --> 00:36:59,807
Kill the Tang army
whenever encountered on the way

496
00:37:01,407 --> 00:37:05,107
The city of Tingzhou is defended
only by new recruits and infirm soldiers

497
00:37:05,107 --> 00:37:06,847
The city is filled with women and children

498
00:37:09,525 --> 00:37:15,808
[Tingzhou]

499
00:37:19,372 --> 00:37:21,280
[Tingzhou]

500
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,931
[Prefectural Governor of Tingzhou, Lai Ji]

501
00:37:35,247 --> 00:37:36,887
I am Lai Ji, the Prefectural Governor
of Tingzhou.

502
00:37:37,687 --> 00:37:39,847
Are you the general from
the Fuyan Governor's Mansion?

503
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:43,072
[General of Fuyan, Ashina Duzhi]

504
00:37:43,072 --> 00:37:46,162
[Deputy General of Ashina Duzhi]

505
00:37:46,247 --> 00:37:50,567
In the past, our Tingzhou and Chumukun tribe
had no grudges and recent days have brought no feuds.

506
00:37:51,367 --> 00:37:52,807
You are leading troops to attack,

507
00:37:52,807 --> 00:37:55,767
and you are even planning to slaughter
all the people in our city to the last man,

508
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:57,647
I don't know what the justification for this?

509
00:37:58,967 --> 00:38:01,487
You Tang people are despicable and shameless,

510
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:06,787
Our Khan and his officers
kindly helped you to quell the rebellion,

511
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:09,407
but Chief Administrator Su Haizheng,

512
00:38:09,407 --> 00:38:12,767
took them to the Tang camp and had them killed.

513
00:38:16,487 --> 00:38:20,567
Naturally,
such deep hatred and blood feud fall upon you.

514
00:38:21,247 --> 00:38:25,727
Today,
I will not stop until all of you are dead.

515
00:38:25,727 --> 00:38:30,487
How can we calm the Khan's
and the soldiers' resentment?

516
00:38:54,247 --> 00:38:55,488
My lord.

517
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:58,272
What on earth has happened?

518
00:38:59,287 --> 00:39:01,347
The northerners have launched a massive invasion
and surrounded Tingzhou.

519
00:39:01,347 --> 00:39:02,847
The Prefectural Governor of Tingzhou, Lai Ji,
has died in battle.

520
00:39:03,847 --> 00:39:04,867
How many people have come?

521
00:39:04,867 --> 00:39:06,007
At least five thousand cavalry.

522
00:39:07,127 --> 00:39:09,467
Sir, the Prefectural Governor
of Tingzhou, Lai Ji,

523
00:39:09,467 --> 00:39:11,507
he gave his life to stop the Northern men
from attacking the city.

524
00:39:11,507 --> 00:39:13,807
But the Northern men not only did not retreat.

525
00:39:13,807 --> 00:39:16,127
On the contrary,
they tightly besieged Tingzhou.

526
00:39:16,127 --> 00:39:18,087
Please, sir, quickly save Tingzhou.

527
00:39:25,407 --> 00:39:27,487
These Northerners are so ruthless
in their attack

528
00:39:28,167 --> 00:39:29,447
They obviously want revenge

529
00:39:30,927 --> 00:39:32,687
Father killed Khan Xingxiwang

530
00:39:33,567 --> 00:39:35,527
If this leads to the fall of Tingzhou

531
00:39:36,087 --> 00:39:37,087
or even a massacred city

532
00:39:38,487 --> 00:39:40,327
How can this matter be hidden
from the imperial court?

533
00:39:41,647 --> 00:39:43,047
Not to mention, those people from the north may

534
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,527
turn around and attack Xizhou at any time.

535
00:39:46,327 --> 00:39:47,712
Sir,

536
00:39:52,327 --> 00:39:54,007
what do you think we should do
about this matter?

537
00:39:54,567 --> 00:39:58,087
Master, there's no need to rush.
Xizhou is easy to defend but hard to attack,

538
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:01,087
these northerners won't attack so easily.

539
00:40:04,367 --> 00:40:07,967
Mr. Su, you've mentioned before,

540
00:40:09,127 --> 00:40:10,727
if I am willing to go to the front,

541
00:40:11,607 --> 00:40:13,447
thus allowing my grandfather
to return home for rest and recuperation.

542
00:40:15,007 --> 00:40:17,287
Now Tingzhou is under siege,

543
00:40:18,127 --> 00:40:21,727
I am willing to go to Tingzhou
to relieve the distress there.

544
00:40:37,167 --> 00:40:39,687
Why don't you agree?

545
00:40:40,767 --> 00:40:44,587
Chief Administrator Su focuses on killing
to establish his authority,

546
00:40:44,587 --> 00:40:47,456
causing the beacon fires to erupt
across the Western Regions,

547
00:40:47,456 --> 00:40:49,856
putting Tingzhou into a predicament.

548
00:40:51,767 --> 00:40:54,327
Now I am willing to go
and alleviate the distress of Tingzhou,

549
00:40:55,807 --> 00:40:58,807
is it not better to go to the front lines
to benefit you all the more?

550
00:41:04,807 --> 00:41:08,527
Having succeeded,
my Qu family is naturally free of suspicion,

551
00:41:08,527 --> 00:41:12,487
if not successful, wouldn't that be exactly
what the chief steward wishes?

552
00:41:15,167 --> 00:41:16,407
As expected,
Minister is both benevolent and brave.

553
00:41:17,207 --> 00:41:20,887
However, with the enemy
having already besieged Tingzhou,

554
00:41:21,487 --> 00:41:25,087
the Xizhou garrison troops
cannot be easily deployed.

555
00:41:25,087 --> 00:41:27,487
The Xizhou garrison troops
naturally cannot be easily deployed,

556
00:41:28,247 --> 00:41:30,847
they must also ensure
the safety of the Xizhou citizens.

557
00:41:32,567 --> 00:41:35,007
From tonight to tomorrow morning,

558
00:41:36,807 --> 00:41:40,527
I intend to recruit warriors on the spot.

559
00:41:41,927 --> 00:41:45,087
How could a few civilian conscripts
lift the siege of Tingzhou?

560
00:41:45,887 --> 00:41:48,127
It's rather fanciful to think
you could ever achieve that?

561
00:41:49,847 --> 00:41:51,807
Losing the lives of civilian conscripts
is a minor matter,

562
00:41:52,447 --> 00:41:55,547
who will bear the responsibility
for delaying military affairs?

563
00:41:55,547 --> 00:41:57,287
Of course, I will take responsibility.

564
00:41:59,927 --> 00:42:02,007
If I cannot relieve the plight of Tingzhou,

565
00:42:05,087 --> 00:42:09,087
I am willing to accept military law punishment.

566
00:42:09,767 --> 00:42:13,847
But now, I am ready to die for my country,

567
00:42:14,647 --> 00:42:16,160
without regard for my own life.

568
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:20,367
If you dare to cast aspersions on me again
in the future,

569
00:42:21,127 --> 00:42:23,587
causing my father to
suffer an undeserved grievance,

570
00:42:23,587 --> 00:42:26,807
I assure you,
I have a way to make your Su family

571
00:42:29,527 --> 00:42:31,367
face consequences
from all your descendants in Chang'an

572
00:42:35,927 --> 00:42:37,807
to die for me.

589

♫ Against the window,
I had a drink for pleasure ♫

590
00:43:53,332 --> 00:43:56,948
♫ The moon still hangs in the sky,
but I'm no longer in the mood ♫

591
00:43:56,948 --> 00:44:01,812
♫ It's quite and cold outside,
but I grab my pen again ♫
