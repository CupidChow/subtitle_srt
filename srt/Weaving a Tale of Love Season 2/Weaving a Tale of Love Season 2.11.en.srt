00:01:32,704 --> 00:01:35,296
<i>[Episode 11]</i>

3
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,100
The attire and mannerism of Minister Qu

4
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,000
really resembles a peacock
with its tail fanned out,

5
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,800
Mr, Mu, have you really made up your mind?

6
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,920
Anyway, my lord also said

7
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,520
if you refused to listen to advice

8
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,728
and insisted on going,
you would bear the consequences,

9
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,136
Then please thank your lord for me, Move aside,

10
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,640
Mr, Mu San has arrived,

11
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,320
Now, it's going to be fun,

12
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,520
San, following the merchants,

13
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,320
your journey was very arduous,

14
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,488
But it doesn't matter,

15
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,440
From now on,
Chongyu will surely take good care of you all,

16
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,880
Just now, Minister said after passing Guazhou,

17
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,920
he would take Jiu and Lady Liuli
via the Ohaido,

18
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,960
taking a shortcut to Xizhou,

19
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,280
Our caravan's camels walk slowly,

20
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,912
With many people and goods,
we cannot take the Ohaido,

21
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,260
So when we reach Xizhou,

22
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,000
we will part ways with Minister,

23
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,080
So what?

24
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,800
San, I will prepare the best horse for you

25
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,440
to go to Xizhou,

26
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,504
But…

27
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,336
Sanniang,

28
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,200
Without listening to your dissuasion,

29
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,180
I was wrong to go to the banquet,

30
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,620
But I could have anticipated

31
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,760
Minister Qu actually has such a strange hobby,

32
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,600
Jiu, as the Senior Official of Xizhou,

33
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,420
Y-You must have a way,

34
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,920
You can't stand by and do nothing,

35
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,480
Shouyue, you have to come up
with a plan for your cousin,

36
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,592
As for the plan, there is one, But…

37
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,420
No, if I tell you this idea,

38
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,940
you'll definitely think
that I'm trying to harm you,

39
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,000
Jiu, you can rest assured,

40
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,820
As long as I can get rid of
Minister's entanglements,

41
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,160
whatever you say, I'll do,

42
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,620
The Qu family has a deep-rooted foundation
in the Xizhou,

43
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,760
As for me, I've just arrived here,

44
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,760
We haven't even entered Xizhou yet,

45
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,480
What if we offend Minister before that?
What do we do then?

46
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,640
Shouyue, San is like my own brother,

47
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,640
Please help him,

48
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,408
Hurry up,

49
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,640
B-B-Brother-in-law,
please help your elder brother,

50
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,840
What are you calling me?

51
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,320
Brother-in-law, please give me some advice,

52
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,792
Alright,

53
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,280
Cousin, rest assured,
Just do as I say tomorrow,

54
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,280
I will naturally help you
get rid of Minister's entanglements,

55
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,040
Well then, I'll take my leave first,

56
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,736
Take care,

57
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,480
You're up to no good again, aren't you?

58
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,840
Qu Chongyu is always testing me,

59
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,000
Then I can give him back his own way,

60
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,800
Maybe I can kill two birds with one stone,

61
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,600
I can help Mu San break the blockade,

62
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,960
And also send this rival in love away,
isn't that wonderful?

63
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,240
I knew your motives weren't pure,

64
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,720
Your beauty would put the flowers to shame,

65
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,440
To have such a cousin by your side,

66
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,640
I really can't be at ease,

67
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,140
This is very good,

68
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,640
Since we have to put on a performance
for Qu Chongyu to watch,

69
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,440
then I shall continue to
play the role of ignorant and shallow shrew,

70
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,200
Then I will cooperate with you,

71
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,560
instilling a fearful, submissive husband image
deep into people's hearts,

72
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,440
I am a shrew,

73
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,400
I'm henpecked,

74
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,448
Listen to me, okay?

75
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,704
Okay,

76
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,640
It's not a solution for me
to keep hiding in the carriage,

77
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,680
Liuli, can you urge Shouyue for me?

78
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
We've already reached Guazhou,

79
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,400
What about his idea?

80
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,960
Shouyue, you're so magnanimous,

81
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,840
Mu San and Madam Kudi get along well,

82
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,280
Don't you mind?

83
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,680
Bah, that dead peacock always talks nonsense,

84
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,080
Minister, you misunderstood,

85
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,000
San, like my wife's biological brother,
has joined under my command,

86
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,640
He should receive extra care,

87
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,220
But there are many people from An Family
in this merchant family,

88
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,240
Why do you view San differently?

89
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,240
It seems
Minister pays special attention to San,

90
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,720
Then I'll do a favor,

91
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,800
How about letting San attend to Minister?

92
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,000
Gu, stop it,

93
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,824
Hush,

94
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,736
San,

95
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,040
from now on, what about following Minister?

96
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,960
You want me to follow Minister?

97
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,240
This is a great opportunity
to rise rapidly through the ranks,

98
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,960
How lucky you are

99
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,600
to attracts the attention of Minister,

100
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,400
I am grateful to Minister for your support,

101
00:09:37,024 --> 00:09:38,320
Good,

102
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,400
Shouyue, will my elder brother
be considered as above his station?

103
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,800
I certainly wouldn't want my brother
to feel wronged,

104
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,260
Madam, why would you say something like that?

105
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,320
I can't love San enough as it is,

106
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,840
How could I possibly allow him to be wronged?

107
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,200
I'm afraid of taking away what you love,

108
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,680
Minister, you're joking,
You love talented people,

109
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,840
Brother loves the future, and Shouyue loves me,

110
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,800
Everyone takes what they need,

111
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,160
This is not about taking away someone's love,

112
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,140
Shouyue, the longer I sit in the car
the colder I get,

113
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,240
I want you to take me with you,

114
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,424
Okay,

115
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,328
Come here,

116
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,640
It's still warm like this,

117
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,200
With you by my side, it won't be boring,

118
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,336
As long as you're happy,

119
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,100
There are important matters to attend to
in my courtyard,

120
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,280
I shall take my leave now, Giddyap!

121
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,460
At last,
I know what this dead peacock is afraid of,

122
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,560
Shouyue, was my performance good just now?

123
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,912
Good,

124
00:11:09,812 --> 00:11:13,600
<i>[Respect and Trust the Talent]</i>

125
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,480
Tomorrow, after leaving Guazhou,
we'll be on the Ohaido route,

126
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,120
If you still don't reject Mu San now,

127
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,840
it won't be so easy
to get rid of him in the future,

128
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,720
Say something,

129
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,880
You wouldn't let Pei Xingjian
so easily place his confidant

130
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,160
beside us, would you?

131
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,120
Why are you anxious when I'm not?

132
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,160
It's because you're not worried
that I have to worry for you,

133
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,440
Keep calm,

134
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,560
Wait,

135
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,880
Wait for what?

136
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,360
Wait for Pei Xingjian to come for me,

137
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,320
He… Come for you?

138
00:12:13,888 --> 00:12:15,040
Minister,

139
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,320
Senior Official Pei can't stop ranting over
there,

140
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,040
Madam Kudi called over her servant girl

141
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,240
to invite Minister to persuade,

142
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,520
See, what did I tell you?

143
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:37,536
<i>[Respect and Trust the Talent]</i>

144
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,840
Here he comes,

145
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,740
Ni has brought Minister Qu with her,

146
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,360
Cheng, prepare quickly,

147
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,384
Yes,

148
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,980
Minister, you have finally arrived,

149
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,080
Shouyue just got angry for some unknown reason,

150
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,880
He ordered Cheng to bring my cousin in
for a scolding,

151
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,880
He's lost his temper badly,

152
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,000
No matter how much we call,
the door won't open,

153
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,040
Shouyue, San is your elder brother,

154
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,160
If you have something to say, say it properly,

155
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,140
<i>[Respect and Trust the Talent]</i>
Relying on the fact he's your elder brother,

156
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,480
he dares to deceive his superiors
and delude his subordinates,

157
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,200
Open the door, Shouyue, It's me, Chongyu,

158
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,680
Why are you coming, Minister?
Please come in now,

159
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,840
What in the world has happened
to make you so angry?

160
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,168
You ask him,

161
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,240
It's my carelessness, I mishandled the matter,

162
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,480
San is my wife's cousin, He's one of our own,

163
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,000
I specifically handed over
the matter of the Princess Linhai

164
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,180
to you,

165
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,340
After asking just now did I find out

166
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,680
that he didn't settle this for me,

167
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,040
You know full well the Princess Linhai

168
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,480
holds grudges against me and Shouyue,

169
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,120
Other tasks can be taken lightly,

170
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,200
but matters of Hedong Duke's Mansion
can't be handled carelessly,

171
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,480
I was indeed careless about this matter,

172
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,440
Then, how about I go back first?

173
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,940
After this matter is settled, I'll come back,

174
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,760
The day before yesterday,
I instructed you to serve Minister,

175
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,280
Today, you want to return,

176
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,920
Aren't you deliberately making things difficult
for me?

177
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,280
If this matter
is truly related to the Princess,

178
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,000
no wonder Shouyue would be so furious,

179
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,480
Princess Linhai might already be angered,

180
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,880
It's not too late to remedy problems
in a timely manner,

181
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,200
The princess loves ostentation the most,

182
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,200
She often invites the distinguished guests
from Chang'an,

183
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,960
At that feast,

184
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,280
she often talks about some romantic matters,

185
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,000
Back then, princess talks a lot
about my romantic matters,

186
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,816
San,

187
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,880
if you have time,

188
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,640
share the interesting things on this journey

189
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,840
to the eldest princess in detail,

190
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,080
Maybe if she's happy,

191
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,640
she'll forget your mistakes, right?

192
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,520
Minister, you always have a way,

193
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,420
Shouyue, since Minister said so,

194
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,760
let's send Brother back to Chang'an,

195
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,088
It seems this is the only way,

196
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,180
We've bothered Minister so late into the night,

197
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,320
Brother, you should escort
Minister back to rest

198
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,328
and say your goodbyes properly,

199
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,120
Then, after I say goodbye,

200
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,240
I'll set off the same night
to return to Chang'an,

201
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,220
Shouyue, you really guessed right,

202
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,320
This peacock is indeed putting on a show,

203
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,400
At the moment,
he can't wait to see my cousin off,

204
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,960
He simply turned my trick to his own use,

205
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,400
It seems that I have underestimated him,

206
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,160
The depth
of this man's scheming is truly terrifying,

207
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,980
Just now, within a few words,
he set up a small game,

208
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,240
He wants San to

209
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,860
pass his absurdities on to the princess Linhai,

210
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,640
and then let the princess bring this matter
into the palace,

211
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,400
so that His Majesty
would also know his absurdities,

212
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,920
and lower his guard,

213
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,020
Shouyue, henceforth,
you have to daily face this person,

214
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,600
It's indeed tough upon thinking,

215
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,584
Don't mention him anymore,

216
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,920
You have been traveling all day today,

217
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,896
You must be tired by now,

218
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,200
What about resting earlier?

219
00:17:35,732 --> 00:17:41,504
<i>[Respect and Trust the Talent]</i>

220
00:18:28,211 --> 00:18:29,760
<i>[Respect and Trust the Talent]</i>

221
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,240
You all are visiting late at night,

222
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,560
I wonder why you're here,

223
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,376
Kill,

224
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,480
Why look at me? They're disturbing my sleep,

225
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,600
Am I not allowed to be angry?

226
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,776
Yeah,

227
00:20:36,532 --> 00:20:37,664
<i>[Respect and Trust the Talent]</i>

228
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,720
There are still so many people here,

229
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,480
Don't be afraid, I'm here,

230
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,680
What should we do now?

231
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,488
Call someone,

232
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,120
Assassin! There's an assassin,

233
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,008
Kill,

234
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,544
Kill Pei Xingjian,

235
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,056
Liuli,

236
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,528
Spare his life,

237
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,760
Liuli, are you okay?

238
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,240
You said a bit late, I couldn't hold back,

239
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,512
Where do they come from?

240
00:23:40,512 --> 00:23:41,740
They come from Chang'an,

241
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,720
The leader is an imperial bodyguard,

242
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,080
Don't worry, They are all central Han people,

243
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,400
They have absolutely nothing to do with us,

244
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,960
How do you know so much about this?

245
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,040
Chongyu was careless
and let a few thieves slip in,

246
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,460
which disturbed
Mr, and Mrs, Pei's peaceful dream,

247
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,640
I am truly sorry,

248
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,200
A few thieves,

249
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,120
They were somewhat fierce,

250
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,040
You vile peacock,
I reckon you're up to no good,

251
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,240
No need to look, I'm talking about you,

252
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,560
Even if you look more, you won't find here

253
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,680
the second person
dressed like a peacock spreading its feathers,

254
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,976
Liuli,

255
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,700
Liuli, you can't be rude to Minister,

256
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,920
I am rude?

257
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,920
I live in his courtyard,

258
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,720
but in the middle of the night,
I was attached by some masked thieves,

259
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,920
I also narrowly escaped with my life,

260
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,400
But he told me it was just a few thieves,

261
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,280
- Recently in the north…
- Shut up,

262
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,500
That shield was thrown by you, wasn't it?

263
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,200
Yes, I…

264
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,320
You wanted to kill me, didn't you?

265
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,280
Just now, if not for my quick reaction
and timely evasion,

266
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,840
I would've been crushed to death
by that shield,

267
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,440
- You…
- What you…

268
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,040
Don't you know how heavy that shield is?

269
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,200
I'm such a delicate and weak woman,

270
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,160
If I were hit by that shield,
would I still be alive?

271
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,920
Just now, the situation was critical,

272
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,480
I admit I was indeed a bit reckless
in what I did,

273
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,360
But it was all to save your life,

274
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,912
It seems to me that you messed up
and accidentally saved me instead,

275
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,936
You…

276
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,280
If you had no intention of killing,

277
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,920
then how did that whole bunch
of assassins get in?

278
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,160
Could it be
that they sprouted from beneath the ground?

279
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,920
There's no need for excuses,
In my view, this group of assassins

280
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,760
are your people from your mansion
who are disguising themselves,

281
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,220
These people came from Chang'an,

282
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,800
The leader is the imperial bodyguard,

283
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,080
If you want to frame me,
please investigate thoroughly,

284
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,720
You seem to know clearly,

285
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,720
My lady, you must not speculate randomly,

286
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,560
If not for Minister arriving in time,

287
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,256
neither you nor I would be alive,

288
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,944
Apologize to Minister now,

289
00:25:50,944 --> 00:25:51,960
Thank you, Minister,

290
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,400
No need, I can't take it,

291
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,400
It's good that you know,

292
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,160
Why are you all standing still? Clean up,

293
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,840
Okay, don't be angry, Ni,

294
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,800
My lady,
I'll take you back to the room to rest,

295
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,000
The doors and windows are all broken like this,

296
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,200
How am I supposed to rest?

297
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,880
Order the servants to clean my room,

298
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,568
and let the Pei couple use it,

299
00:26:17,568 --> 00:26:18,680
Yes,

300
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,480
Minister, how could this be okay?

301
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,560
Chongyu cannot escape blame
for tonight's incident,

302
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,992
You all rest well,

303
00:26:24,992 --> 00:26:27,168
I have something else to do,
I'll take my leave first,

304
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,040
Since Minister has already said so,

305
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,320
then let's reluctantly make do for the night,

306
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,088
Alright,

307
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,160
Someone, escort Mr, Pei and Madam Kudi back

308
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,800
to the Minister's room to rest,

309
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,400
Increase guard shifts,

310
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,024
Let's go,

311
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,640
Sanniang, what's been going on
with Lady Liuli recently?

312
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,664
She wasn't like this before,

313
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,320
Such a rude and impolite woman!

314
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,380
Don't be so angry,

315
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,040
You don't need to be angry with

316
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,440
a lady, right?

317
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,160
But after all these years,

318
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,400
this is the first time I've seen you so angry,

319
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,740
This really shows

320
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,120
that Kudi Liuli is indeed extraordinary,

321
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,280
Extraordinarily crude,

322
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,760
Have some tea, and calm down,

323
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,400
Don't be angry, or you'll lose your beauty,

324
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,768
Today's events were treacherous,

325
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,440
If anything happens to you,

326
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,520
I really wouldn't know what to do,

327
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,640
I'm fine,

328
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,384
There was such a moment

329
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,200
that I'm really afraid of losing you,

330
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,520
Don't talk nonsense,

331
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,960
I swear I'm sticking with you for life,

332
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,120
Even if I become an old woman
with a face full of wrinkles,

333
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,480
Don't even think about getting rid of me,

334
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,400
It was the Protector-General
who made you do this, right?

335
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,840
Yes, I never intended to conceal it from you,

336
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,160
Why didn't you discuss it with me in advance?

337
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,160
There was no chance,

338
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,120
All your energy on this journey

339
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,120
was focused on that couple, right?

340
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,840
I wanted to find an opportunity to tell you,
but I never got the chance,

341
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,180
Alright, I admit it!

342
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,500
They come from Chang'an,

343
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,000
There are royal forces behind the scenes,

344
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,060
But I don't know who they precisely are,

345
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,860
I really don't know much,

346
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,960
Pei Xingjian was targeted by them
as soon as he left the capital,

347
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,780
As for why they have to take action here,

348
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,400
If they continue further,
it's the territory of our Qu family,

349
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,640
They can only do it here,

350
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,640
Hence, I provided the map of the courtyard,

351
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,040
I diverted the guards away,

352
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,480
But I didn't know about the murder,
It's none of my business,

353
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,500
What a case of murdering a person
with a borrowed knife!

354
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,880
All advantages and no disadvantages,
Why not do it?

355
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,460
Have you thought about the consequences?

356
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,920
I admittedly have not thought about it,

357
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,000
But the Protector-General
surely has thought about it, right?

358
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,140
They truly weren't killed by us,

359
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,480
Think about it, It is well known

360
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,260
why Pei Xingjian was convicted,

361
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:17,640
The family Wu
and Grand Commandant Party will not let him go,

362
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,440
At most,
we are just failing to protect him adequately,

363
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,340
I have prepared the bodyguard
to take the blame,

364
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,040
What if Pei Xingjian is

365
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,480
an undercover intentionally placed in Xizhou
by His Majesty?

366
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,860
That's also what Protector-General thought of,

367
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,160
Then it would be perfect
to remove him through others' hands,

368
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,528
Fool,

369
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,760
If Pei Xingjian dies,

370
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,120
our Qu family is close to

371
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,720
a great disaster,

372
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,320
No, we didn't kill him,

373
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,680
Does it matter who killed him?

374
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,680
D-D-Doesn't it matter?

375
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,220
Rebellion in the north,
His Majesty is about to use troops, tell me

376
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,240
what he most worried about is at this moment,

377
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,000
The loyalty of our Qu family,

378
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
It is the loyalty of our Qu family,

379
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,280
So he sent someone over,

380
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,880
I know his intentions,

381
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,640
So, we sent someone to greet him

382
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,320
to show our attitude,

383
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,400
We take a lots of people

384
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,360
to welcome Pei Xingjian,

385
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,040
but he was killed in Guazhou
under unclear circumstances,

386
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,120
What would the emperor think?

387
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,120
It doesn't matter who killed Pei Xingjian,

388
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,256
The important thing is that

389
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,280
he can't be dead now,

390
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,560
Are you saying that
the assassin was sent by the princess?

391
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,880
Before you leave Chang'an,

392
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,520
the princess loses both her wealth and face,

393
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,160
Given her vengeful nature,

394
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,400
how could she let us off?

395
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,400
But this courtyard has many houses
and is heavily guarded,

396
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,960
How did they manage to evade the guards

397
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,080
and accurately locate the place
where we can settle down?

398
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,760
This is precisely what I am worried about,

399
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,520
Do you mean the Qu family is colluding
with the princess?

400
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,360
Only this explanation makes sense,

401
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,560
But the actions of Qu Chongyu are puzzling,

402
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,520
This assassination plan
was meticulously prepared,

403
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,060
The timing of the attack
was also extremely precise,

404
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,480
If Qu Chongyu had not offered help in the end,

405
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,560
you and I would have surely
found it difficult to emerge unscathed,

406
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,160
Although we still can't get a precise answer,

407
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,520
what we can be certain about is that
there must be a problem with the Qu family,

408
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,360
Once we reach Xizhou, I will work with you
to investigate the Qu family,

409
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,760
It is too slow to proceed
with the trade caravan,

410
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,000
Starting tomorrow, with Qu Chongyu,

411
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,720
we will set off together lightly equipped,

412
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,200
Through the Ohaido,
it will take only two days to reach Xizhou,

413
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,540
We won't rest up ahead,

414
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,080
We will pass the mountain pass in one breath,

415
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,928
Is the weather changing?

416
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,960
It looks like the weather is changing,
It's going to snow soon,

417
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,000
However, ten more miles forward
and we will be out of this mountain pass,

418
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,620
Twenty miles further,
After we cross the gravel Gobi,

419
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,560
we would cross the Ohaido,

420
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,860
Really, Shouyue?

421
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,520
Are we really going to cross the Ohaido?

422
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,500
If all goes well, before nightfall,

423
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,200
we could reach a small village town,

424
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,820
Then we must congratulate Minister indeed,

425
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,420
Finally, you can be free,

426
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,720
You don't need to face me every day anymore,

427
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,680
You're joking,

428
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,360
To be acquainted with Madam Pei,

429
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,280
even in the cold of winter,
it feels like a warm spring breeze,

430
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,320
Really? I didn't mishear that, did I?

431
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,760
Shouyue, slow down,

432
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,240
Don't you see? Minister can't keep up,

433
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,480
Madam, you go first,
I will be able to follow shortly,

434
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,880
Minister, if you're so far away from me,

435
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,240
how can you bask in the spring breeze then?

436
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,840
Too much exposure to the spring breeze
will wear away my will,

437
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,920
I might as well temper my mind
in this cold winter,

438
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,328
Giddyap,

439
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,648
Well…

440
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,976
You little rascal!

441
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,080
Who's the bad one?
I've been obeying you all along,

442
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,700
Now,
both of our reputations are completely ruined,

443
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:24,100
Most of these people are laughing at
your timidity and fear,

444
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,860
They say that I am crude and disrespectful,

445
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,080
Even Official Liu looks at me
and laughs in a weird way,

446
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,760
Ni and Tan are even more hesitant to speak up,

447
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,980
They tried to persuade me twice,

448
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,760
saying that
I should be concerned about your reputation,

449
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,920
So what?

450
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,080
Everyone in the world knows that
Prime Minister Fang Xuanling is henpecked,

451
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,800
But nobody looks down on him because of this,

452
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,760
Now it's getting colder and colder,

453
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,760
If you get seriously frozen,

454
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,480
how much reputation can be redeemed?

455
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,520
Moreover, the more they look down on me,

456
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,320
the more peacefully we live,

457
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,320
Just for this peace,

458
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,320
now I have to wrong you,

459
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,280
Then let's both suffer together,

Good news, Madam,

466
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,720
What happened?

467
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,640
The news comes from the Advisor Su
of Liangzhou is that

468
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,240
Kudi Liuli is dead,

469
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,720
Is it true?

470
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,800
Absolutely true,

471
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,100
He said that
she was strangled to death by his deputy,

472
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,568
And he sent

473
00:36:41,568 --> 00:36:45,520
the Divorce Notice written
by Pei Xingjian himself as evidence,

474
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,680
Good, that's great,

475
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,840
Reward the messenger now,

476
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:54,240
Hupo, I'm going to host
a feast to celebrate today,

477
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,320
Madam, the operation
to assassinate Pei Xingjian has failed,

478
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,320
So many people were dispatched,
and yet they've failed,

479
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,520
The letter also mentions that

480
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,840
Pei Xingjian and Kudi Liuli
have crossed over the Ohaido,

481
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,160
They will soon arrive in Xizhou,

482
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,360
Didn't you say that Kudi Liuli was dead?

483
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,000
Indeed, Su Nanjin said
that Kudi Liuli was already dead,

484
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,040
Then how did she go to Xizhou
with Pei Xingjian?

485
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,160
I don't know,

486
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,400
Useless, a bunch of useless people,

487
00:37:30,592 --> 00:37:31,620

00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,240
Madam!

489
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,480
- Princess,
- Scram,

490
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,864
Get away,

491
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,136
Let's go,

00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,600
we are almost at Xizhou now,

Shouyue, you're here at last,

530
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,200
Thank you for your hospitality,
Protector-General,

531
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,320
No thanks,

532
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,280
Eat this, Shouyue,

533
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,720
- Thank you, Protector-General,
- A piece of meat,

534
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,480
It's extremely delicious,

535
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,240
Is the Protector-General's
acting a bit over the top?

536
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,020
Shouyue, let me toast the second drink to you,

537
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,160
Please sit,

538
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,720
I don't think so, I think

539
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,280
- Cheers, Senior Official,
- he's very sincere,

540
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,500
All of you greet him,

541
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,920
- Try this meat,
- I just want to drink,

542
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,220
Senior Official, let me offer a toast to you,

543
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,960
Isn't that a bit beneath his dignity?

544
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,840
Approachable and humble, Respectable!

549

we parted at the doorstep ♫</i>

561
00:43:44,815 --> 00:43:47,887
<i>♫ Against the window,
I had a drink for pleasure ♫</i>

562
00:43:47,887 --> 00:43:51,503
<i>♫ The moon still hangs in the sky,
but I'm no longer in the mood ♫</i>
