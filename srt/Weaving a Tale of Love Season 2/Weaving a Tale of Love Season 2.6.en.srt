00:01:32,164 --> 00:01:35,712
<i>[Episode 6]</i>

3
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,179
I'm flattered, your highness,

4
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:41,939
In the future, aside from asking for advice
from your highness,

5
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:45,979
I will also rely heavily
on all the ladies present here,

6
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:48,339
Lady Liuli, there is no need for modesty,

7
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:53,139
After tomorrow, you will be
the wife of the Pei family of Zhongjuan,

8
00:01:53,699 --> 00:01:57,539
Everyone present here
will be your maternal aunts and sisters-in-law,

9
00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:01,419
I'm afraid
they will need to rely heavily on you,

10
00:02:15,059 --> 00:02:17,939
I have just recovered from a serious illness
and am tired from sitting for a long time,

11
00:02:18,779 --> 00:02:22,339
Everyone, please don't be polite,
enjoy yourself,

12
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:24,739
Allow me to go inside and take a rest,

13
00:02:26,692 --> 00:02:29,824
<i>[Hall of Gold and Jade]</i>

14
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:55,659
Over the years, the people
the Pei family of Zhongjuan

15
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:58,619
have grown accustomed
to taking advantages from Pei Shouyue,

16
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:03,099
How can they be content
when the supply is suddenly cut off?

17
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:09,339
They are just refraining from making a scene
because of my presence,

18
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:17,179
It turns out that there really is such a thing
as a blessing in disguise in this world,

19
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:20,419
The Princess has summoned us to come today,

20
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:22,499
So it's for this generous gift,

21
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:27,779
However, accepting certain things
would weigh on one's conscience,

22
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:34,739
Sister-in-law, why don't you speak up for us
and say something fair?

23
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:37,299
Don't tell me it will be like what happened
to my family back then,

24
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:39,859
Where more than a dozen lives were lost
in vain,

25
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:41,439
Everyone present here,

26
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,859
are elders of Liuli and Shouyue's clan,

27
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:47,059
You should know the meaning
of solidarity of kinship,

28
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:49,539
The plan that Shouyue's elders made back then,

29
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:51,699
it was indeed for the greater good of the clan,

30
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,019
Responders in the clan
were also willing to follow,

31
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:57,139
no one was forced,

32
00:03:57,859 --> 00:03:59,019
If things had worked out back then,

33
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:02,979
Pei family of Zhongjuan would not be inferior
to the Pei of Xijuan in any way,

34
00:04:03,779 --> 00:04:06,939
Sadly, the time was not auspicious
and the plan failed,

35
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:10,839
As the saying goes,
'Either rise together or fall apart',

36
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:13,259
How can you and I regret or complain about it?

37
00:04:14,899 --> 00:04:16,859
Well, I have a question then,

38
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:19,979
There is already a common loss now,

39
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:22,499
Where is the common honor then?

40
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:25,979
Auntie asked a good question, May I ask you,

41
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:28,559
in these years,

42
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,659
have Shouyue ever used the earnings
from the Luoyang family property

43
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:32,179
for personal matters of your own family?

44
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:42,019
Never in the past, nor in the future,

45
00:04:43,179 --> 00:04:46,619
Shouyue once told me
about the earnings from the Luoyang property,

46
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:50,619
It will be used to repair the ancestral hall,
expand the school, and buy sacrificial fields,

47
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:53,059
We also need to buy several more residences,

48
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,579
to accommodate clan students
who come to the capital to take exams,

49
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:04,579
The clan's education is of great importance
for every household,

50
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:07,259
Is this really true, lady Liuli?

51
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:08,299
Of course it's true,

52
00:05:09,219 --> 00:05:11,659
How to spend these earnings

53
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:13,379
and what to do every year,

54
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:16,979
Liuli will also discuss
with all the aunts and sisters-in-law,

55
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,939
Princess just made it very clear,

56
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:25,039
the Luoyang industry only belongs to Shouyue,

57
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,079
But now you are saying that
the profits from this property,

58
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,059
will be shared with the family members
of the Pei family of Zhongjuan,

59
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:32,479
no private use,

60
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,619
This is exactly what Shouyue once said,

61
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:39,619
Too many lives of the clan are tied up
in these properties,

62
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:43,459
No matter what, he would never use it
for his own private affairs,

63
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:47,739
So, even when he was so poor
in the early years,

64
00:05:47,739 --> 00:05:49,659
he refused to make use of these properties
as well,

65
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:51,539
not to mention today,

66
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:56,739
As a wife of the Pei family,
Liuli shall obey my husband's wishes,

67
00:05:58,499 --> 00:06:01,779
Liuli hereby swears an oath,

68
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:03,499
For these money and silk,

69
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:07,079
Liuli will never use them
to satiate one's own desires,

70
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,799
or cover one household's expenses,

71
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:12,299
Otherwise, may Liuli not die a peaceful death,

72
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:15,424
Well,

73
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:20,199
you are the wife
of the Pei family of Zhongjuan,

74
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:22,139
how can you say such heavy words?

75
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:28,399
Come on,
let's toast to the imperial wife together,

76
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,472
Come on,

77
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:43,719
This Kudi Liuli has gone crazy,

78
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:44,979
To oppose me,

79
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:47,219
she cedes such a large amount of money,

80
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:53,659
No, I don't believe it,

81
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:56,179
There must be something fishy here,

82
00:06:57,179 --> 00:07:01,179
Perhaps she is doing this
to appease the clan members,

83
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:06,659
Maybe she will change her mind
after taking the position of the imperial wife,

84
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:10,179
She is feeling quite smug right now,

85
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:13,339
thinking that everything will be fine
from now on,

86
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:16,179
And enjoy the estates in Luoyang,

87
00:07:16,179 --> 00:07:17,859
steadily holding her position
as the imperial wife of the clan,

88
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:19,739
But unfortunately,

89
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:23,339
no one can take away what I want,

90
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:25,619
Something that Lady Luqi failed to do,

91
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:27,859
Kudi Liuli shouldn't think of accomplishing it,

92
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:54,339
This piece of calligraphy
finally has some interest,

93
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:57,299
The calligraphy has finished,

94
00:07:57,299 --> 00:08:00,579
then it would be better to return
Zhang Boying's authentic work to Chu Suiliang,

95
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:03,459
Although the characters look similar,

96
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:05,739
<i>[Calligraphy]</i>
but they're still imperfect,

97
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:09,024
No hurry,

98
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:12,192
It can't be hurried,

99
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:17,619
Shouyue, are you hiding something from me?

100
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:28,859
It seems that you are not only amazing
in painting skills now,

101
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:32,539
but also in calligraphy skills,

102
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:37,499
Everyone says,

103
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:40,579
your writing is famous in Chang'an,

104
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:43,979
As your wife, I can't fall behind,

105
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:46,539
That's why I thought of imitating your writing
to practice,

106
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:55,259
By the way,
you went to the Princess's banquet today,

107
00:08:56,899 --> 00:08:58,059
Did she embarrass you?

108
00:08:58,979 --> 00:09:00,099
So what?

109
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:02,139
You know I can handle it,

110
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:10,979
As the bride of me Pei Xingjian,

111
00:09:12,032 --> 00:09:13,099
it seems

112
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:14,779
you truly needs to have the guts,

113
00:09:16,819 --> 00:09:18,259
Daring to offend His Majesty,

114
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:20,739
and daring to defy the Princess,

115
00:09:21,739 --> 00:09:25,979
Liuli, I have never cared about
that family property,

116
00:09:26,819 --> 00:09:27,979
It's fine for you to dispose of it,

117
00:09:29,099 --> 00:09:31,819
Remember, no matter what you do,

118
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,299
I will always be your support,

119
00:09:36,099 --> 00:09:39,739
Besides, whether you can be the imperial wife
of the Pei family of Zhongjuan,

120
00:09:39,739 --> 00:09:41,219
it's not up to them to decide,

121
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:44,359
You are my wife,

122
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:45,659
and the imperial wife,

123
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:49,739
You are the most respected woman
in the Pei family of Zhongjuan,

124
00:10:03,099 --> 00:10:05,219
My lady, leave it to me,

125
00:10:18,788 --> 00:10:22,208
<i>[Calligraphy]</i>

126
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:28,259
My lady, why are you always staring blankly
at this calligraphy?

127
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:33,299
I always feel like Shouyue is hiding something,

128
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:38,759
How can Master hide his worries from you?

129
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:40,339
My lady, you are overthinking,

130
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:44,899
He won't hide other matters from me,

131
00:10:45,859 --> 00:10:49,139
The only thing he might hide from me
is probably a person,

132
00:10:49,939 --> 00:10:51,232
an affair,

133
00:10:55,099 --> 00:10:58,099
That is Lady Wu,

134
00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:02,059
As my lady stated,

135
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:05,259
could it be about His Majesty
wanting to make Lady Wu the queen?

136
00:11:05,859 --> 00:11:09,039
Lady Wu is my benefactor and also my savior,

137
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:12,139
Without Lady Wu,
I wouldn't be where I am today,

138
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:15,299
Shouyue and her are also old friends,

139
00:11:15,979 --> 00:11:17,859
I am also grateful to Lady Wu,

140
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,139
But Shouyue is a righteous person,

141
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:25,439
Establishing a new Empress
is not only about Lady Wu,

142
00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:27,379
It is related to the reputation of His Majesty,

143
00:11:27,379 --> 00:11:30,819
and the national affairs of great importance
and the stability of the country,

144
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:35,019
Recently, every time I mention Lady Wu,

145
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:37,459
Shouyue is always tight-lipped,

146
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:39,299
I understand his intention,

147
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:43,936
He also seems to think that
Lady Wu was a concubine of the late emperor,

148
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:45,099
It is not appropriate to make her the Empress,

149
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:49,979
Even if he is deeply favored by His Majesty,
he certainly will not act out of personal bias,

150
00:11:49,979 --> 00:11:53,619
and aid His Majesty and Lady Wu
in the matter of establishing the Empress,

151
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:55,299
My lady, what do you think?

152
00:11:55,859 --> 00:11:58,939
Master is considering your deep feelings
for Lady Wu,

153
00:11:58,939 --> 00:12:00,219
That's why he avoids talking about it,

154
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,099
because he is afraid that
it would put my lady in a tough spot,

155
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:05,459
If it's just this, it wouldn't matter much,

156
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,819
But I always feel that
Shouyue is planning something big,

157
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:12,259
This matter is related to Lady Wu,

158
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:14,400
Perhaps,

159
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:18,899
it might also be related to this calligraphy,

160
00:12:20,619 --> 00:12:21,664
My lady,

161
00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:27,459
Those manor heads have come again,
they said they want to see you,

162
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:28,819
They have also sent this,

163
00:12:31,908 --> 00:12:34,080
<i>[Slave Purchase Deed]</i>

164
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:43,488
<i>[Complying with Peace and Following Integrity]</i>

165
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:56,399
All of you
have just returned to Luoyang not long ago,

166
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,659
Today, you come again tirelessly,
it's indeed very hard work,

167
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:02,999
I just don't know why each of you
has brought your own indenture to see me,

168
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:04,259
For what reason, may I ask?

169
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:07,219
Greetings, my lady,

170
00:13:07,739 --> 00:13:11,259
The indentures of us are all in this box,

171
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:14,779
In the past, we were the house slaves
of the Princess,

172
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:17,699
These indentures were given to us
by the Princess,

173
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:19,979
We were told to bring them to you, my Lady,

174
00:13:20,619 --> 00:13:23,939
From now on, we will be house servants to you,

175
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:27,579
We have come specifically
to fulfill my Lady's orders,

176
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:31,019
When the Princess gave you the indentures,

177
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,499
did she say anything?

178
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:35,619
She said that it is inappropriate for us

179
00:13:35,619 --> 00:13:38,999
being servants of the Hedong Duke

180
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:42,779
to manage my Lady and Master's property
in Luoyang,

181
00:13:43,979 --> 00:13:46,059
It was her lack of consideration,

182
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:50,119
Now, it would be better
to give our indentures to my lady,

183
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:52,459
In this way, for the properties in Luoyang,

184
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:55,739
no matter how much the earnings would be,
it has nothing to do with her,

185
00:13:55,739 --> 00:13:58,419
That would also spare her from criticism,

186
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:06,259
Their wives and daughters
are all in the hands of the Princess,

187
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:13,819
Are you all the home-born serfs
of the Princess?

188
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:15,579
You are right, my lady,

189
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:20,139
We are indeed the home-born serfs
of the Residence of the Hedong Duke,

190
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:23,979
That is to say,

191
00:14:23,979 --> 00:14:26,419
even though
your indentures have been given to me,

192
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:30,419
but your families are still working as slaves
in the Residence of the Hedong Duke,

193
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:31,552
Is that true?

194
00:14:34,939 --> 00:14:38,619
Exactly, the Princess is considering for us,

195
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:42,739
letting us apologize to my Lady first,

196
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:44,019
The Princess said

197
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:48,299
if there are any future instances
where we act improperly,

198
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:51,819
feel free to scold or blame us as you wish,

199
00:14:51,819 --> 00:14:54,419
Just do not sell us off,

200
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:57,619
separating us from our families,

201
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:01,139
The Princess really played a good game,

202
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,939
Giving the indentures of the manor heads
to you,

203
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:06,899
while she still holds power
over these people's families,

204
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:08,579
What's the difference
between this and hostage-taking?

205
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:11,339
These manor heads' body in Cao Cao's camp,
heart in the Han dynasty,

206
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:12,539
They still listen to the Princess,

207
00:15:14,619 --> 00:15:16,619
The princess is really thoughtful,

208
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:20,059
It's really not easy for all of you,

209
00:15:21,579 --> 00:15:24,219
We were disrespectful in the past,

210
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:26,259
Please punish us, my Lady,

211
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,739
Please punish us, my Lady,

212
00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:32,079
All you have to do is working diligently
in the future,

213
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,499
It's better not to mention the past,

214
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:39,779
My lady, please don't be mad at us,

215
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:43,819
In the future,
we may still fail to live up to your trust,

216
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:46,459
It would be better to be punished all at once,

217
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:49,259
What do you mean by this?

218
00:15:49,939 --> 00:15:51,019
My lady,

219
00:15:52,939 --> 00:15:55,239
the harvest of the manor
in the first half of the year is decent,

220
00:15:55,239 --> 00:15:57,619
But recently,
Luoyang has been plagued by rainfall,

221
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:01,299
I'm afraid there will be no harvest to turn in
for the second half of the year,

222
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:03,859
This wretched old man is very calculating,

223
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:05,739
He handed over the indentures

224
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:09,239
while still tricking us out of our money
for the Princess,

225
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:12,219
What's even more infuriating is that
he has picked clean for the Princess,

226
00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:17,179
There's none for the second half of the year,
then how about next year, or the year after?

227
00:16:18,699 --> 00:16:20,739
This is also uncertain,

228
00:16:20,739 --> 00:16:23,099
It depends on the Heaven,

229
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:26,519
We, the humble ones,
will strive to try our best,

230
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,139
But having it
like the first half of the year annually,

231
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:30,979
it's absolutely impossible,

232
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:35,139
Since everyone is working hard
and there's still no guaranteed profit,

233
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:38,059
then what use is there for me
to keep these fields?

234
00:16:38,979 --> 00:16:41,259
It's a good thing
that the Princess has given her orders first,

235
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:44,059
not to see you
to be separated from your families,

236
00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:48,019
Even if you are incompetent,
I am not allowed to sell you off,

237
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:50,019
to replace you with someone
to manage the estate in Luoyang,

238
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:51,712
If so,

239
00:16:52,384 --> 00:16:55,479
I might as well sell the Luoyang estate
at a low price,

240
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:57,099
At least that way I could have some peace,

241
00:16:58,219 --> 00:17:01,979
As for you, in the future,
you should be given together to a new master,

242
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:04,859
However, the Princess had given orders,

243
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,819
then I have no choice but to send you back
to the Residence of the Hedong Duke,

244
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:18,419
This, this, how can this be done?

245
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:21,499
The farmlands in Luoyang
are all ancestral properties of your family,

246
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:24,219
And they are all fertile lands,
How incredibly rare,

247
00:17:24,219 --> 00:17:26,259
How can you say you'll sell them
just like that?

248
00:17:26,259 --> 00:17:27,979
That's what you just said,

249
00:17:28,579 --> 00:17:31,539
Even if you work hard,
it's not guaranteed that you'll make a profit,

250
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:35,579
If so, why bother keeping them?

251
00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:41,999
I'm going to sell all these farmlands,
leaving not one behind,

252
00:17:41,999 --> 00:17:43,072
The sooner, the better,

253
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:46,979
You can take this
and go report to the Princess,

254
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:51,219
I estimate that these dozens of farmsteads,

255
00:17:51,219 --> 00:17:53,379
should roughly total to three
or four hundred thousand strings of coins,

256
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:56,059
If the Princess is willing to take them over,

257
00:17:56,579 --> 00:17:58,659
even two hundred thousand strings of coins
would be acceptable,

258
00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:00,119
But if it's less,

259
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:03,459
I'm afraid it wouldn't be accepted by my clan,

260
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:05,139
How can the land be sold so easily?

261
00:18:09,699 --> 00:18:13,739
So, Kudi Liuli wants to sell me
the Luoyang manor,

262
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:16,479
Princess,

263
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:19,159
if you count it seriously,
two hundred thousand strings of coins,

264
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:21,839
is merely thirty percent
of those estates' total price,

265
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:24,179
No matter how you calculate it,
it's a good deal,

266
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:27,179
Don't miss this chance,

267
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:31,739
Over the years, I haven't spent a single cent,

268
00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:35,859
And annually,
I've been taking the profits from the estates,

269
00:18:37,459 --> 00:18:39,819
Now they ask me to take out
two hundred thousand strings of coins,

270
00:18:40,459 --> 00:18:42,539
isn't this clearly cutting my flesh?

271
00:18:46,699 --> 00:18:51,099
Old man, are you afraid of Kudi Liuli

272
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:53,019
to report you to the government?

273
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:57,939
So you coax me
into buying this Luoyang property,

274
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:00,899
You landlords in the future

275
00:19:00,899 --> 00:19:03,299
can avoid work and save trouble, right?

276
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:06,139
The humble one would never dare,

277
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:10,859
Lu, what do you think?

278
00:19:12,356 --> 00:19:15,072
<i>[Su's Residence]</i>

279
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,259
Mother, look, the general is back,

280
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,864
<i>[General Su Dingfang]</i>

281
00:19:39,172 --> 00:19:43,524
<i>[Su's Residence]</i>

282
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:46,539
Congratulations on the general's triumph,

283
00:19:48,459 --> 00:19:49,819
Thank you for your waiting, Madam,

284
00:19:57,139 --> 00:19:59,099
Don't just talk,

285
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:02,219
Put something in your stomach,
so you don't drink too much alcohol,

286
00:20:03,139 --> 00:20:04,224
Shouyue,

287
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:08,579
You are preoccupied all the way,

288
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:09,899
Tell me the truth,

289
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:13,459
Is there something else
happening in the court again?

290
00:20:17,939 --> 00:20:19,019
Now in the court,

291
00:20:19,979 --> 00:20:22,659
Ministers like Zhangsun Wuji and Chu Suiliang
monopolize power,

292
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:25,339
His Majesty is hampered at every turn,

293
00:20:27,219 --> 00:20:29,619
There is a great divergence
between them on court affairs,

294
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:31,619
Especially on deposing the empress
and installing a new one,

295
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:36,059
It could be said that
the situation is tense now,

296
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:39,799
You are a trusted minister of His Majesty,

297
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:43,719
Therefore,
you should naturally stand by his side,

298
00:20:43,719 --> 00:20:45,699
Of course, I support His Majesty
in reclaiming the imperial authority,

299
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,939
But about the matter
of establishing Lady Wu as the empress…

300
00:20:58,019 --> 00:20:59,040
The matter of establishing the empress,

301
00:20:59,616 --> 00:21:03,659
His Majesty urgently needs the support
of core ministers in the court,

302
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:08,059
Out of sentiment,
you should support His Majesty and Lady Wu,

303
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:12,379
Yet logically,
you can't convince yourself to do so,

304
00:21:13,459 --> 00:21:16,459
This is exactly where my dilemma lies,

305
00:21:18,499 --> 00:21:19,939
In life,

306
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:23,339
there are so many difficulties
in making decisions,

307
00:21:23,979 --> 00:21:27,139
Only through introspection without guilt,

308
00:21:27,939 --> 00:21:33,419
Only then, regardless of the future,
can one be without worries or fear,

309
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:40,219
Shouyue, as for how you should choose,

310
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:43,219
truly ask your own heart,

311
00:21:46,699 --> 00:21:47,819
Introspection without guilt,

312
00:21:49,939 --> 00:21:51,179
thus without worries or fear,

313
00:21:56,699 --> 00:21:57,792
Many thanks to you, mentor,

314
00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:00,800
I have been taught,

315
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:05,299
Madam, I have heard today,

316
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:07,379
the Empress Wang has already been grounded
by His Majesty,

317
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:10,579
All her maids have been replaced,

318
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:14,239
The palace maids and ladies-in-waiting
who originally served the Empress Wang,

319
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:16,779
most of them have been demoted
to the cold palace,

320
00:22:17,699 --> 00:22:21,179
Now, the palace is dominated by Lady Wu,

321
00:22:23,939 --> 00:22:27,259
Lately, I've been preoccupied
with the affairs of the Luoyang estate,

322
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:30,419
I almost missed such important news,

323
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:34,619
Lady Wu and Liuli are very close in private,

324
00:22:35,379 --> 00:22:37,439
On the day of Liuli and Shouyue's wedding,

325
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,859
Lady Wu sent a generous gift in a grand manner,

326
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:47,079
Madam,
if His Majesty really deposes the Empress Wang

327
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:48,619
and installs Lady Wu in the future,

328
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:50,699
wouldn't that make Liuli have a great backer?

329
00:22:52,979 --> 00:22:54,379
According to my view,

330
00:22:55,379 --> 00:22:58,099
why not spend some money now while we can

331
00:22:58,739 --> 00:23:02,279
and acquire Pei Shouyue's properties in Luoyang

332
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:03,739
to avoid future worries,

333
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:06,299
and not to miss a good opportunity,

334
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:10,459
If Lady Wu is really enthroned in the future,

335
00:23:10,459 --> 00:23:15,099
I'm afraid we can't afford
to provoke Liuli and Pei Shouyue,

336
00:23:21,899 --> 00:23:22,979
I didn't expect,

337
00:23:23,859 --> 00:23:27,819
Lu, you still have moments
of such thoughtfulness and intelligence,

338
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:33,179
Alright, go tell Kudi Liuli right now,

339
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:34,779
The matter is settled,

340
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:37,139
But two hundred thousand is not a small number,

341
00:23:38,379 --> 00:23:42,899
Allow me some time to gather the funds,

342
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:45,888
Yes,

343
00:23:47,779 --> 00:23:49,979
This feat is merely a minor victory,

344
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:53,979
It targets those
who incessantly harass our northern border,

345
00:23:53,979 --> 00:23:55,699
driving them back to their place,

346
00:23:56,419 --> 00:23:59,039
I intended to follow them,
but His Majesty urgently summoned us,

347
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,019
we had to return to the court in the end,

348
00:24:02,379 --> 00:24:03,456
Mentor,
there is no need for excessive humility,

349
00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:05,619
Having demonstrated our might
through this battle,

350
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:07,819
presumably those foreign enemies
will not dare to invade easily,

351
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:10,139
It now seems on the northeast border,

352
00:24:10,139 --> 00:24:11,419
there will be a period of peace,

353
00:24:12,939 --> 00:24:15,139
These people are not to be feared,

354
00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:19,379
What I'm worried about now is the West,

355
00:24:20,619 --> 00:24:22,899
There are frequent rebellions in the north,

356
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:26,099
and the Turpans are also watching intently,

357
00:24:27,139 --> 00:24:30,539
The situation in the West is unstable,
which quite bothers His Majesty,

358
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:35,739
In my humble opinion,
His Majesty will march against the West soon,

359
00:24:36,939 --> 00:24:39,479
Mentor, you have been training troops daily
for many years,

360
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,959
and reading military books night after night,

361
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:42,419
It won't be long, presumably,

362
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:44,819
you'll be able to defend your home and country,
and fulfill your aspirations,

363
00:24:45,579 --> 00:24:46,619
As long as the nation needs,

364
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:52,099
I can always take up arms and ride a horse,
giving my allegiance to the nation,

365
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:56,099
Then I will definitely become the vanguard
for you, mentor,

366
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:58,859
I will prepare thoroughly for your expedition
to the West,

367
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:00,640
Good,

370
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:36,539
The robust youth remain to die for the nation,

371
00:25:37,179 --> 00:25:39,579
How can they be murdered
by the hand of a mere stripling?

372
00:25:44,019 --> 00:25:45,259
Today, I listened to a speech
from my benevolent mentor,

373
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:48,979
It was as if receiving a sudden enlightenment,
my mind became clear and bright,

374
00:25:52,739 --> 00:25:53,779
What's wrong, Liuli?

375
00:25:58,499 --> 00:25:59,839
I was just thinking,

376
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:01,739
why have you changed your mind today,

377
00:26:01,739 --> 00:26:03,459
no longer copying calligraphy
from Zhang Boying's copybook,

378
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:10,019
When the timing is perfect,
the calligraphy will be done naturally,

379
00:26:14,859 --> 00:26:16,059
In these few days, I have been thinking that,

380
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:20,579
If I, Pei Xingjian,
were only Kudi Liuli's husband,

381
00:26:22,139 --> 00:26:24,899
no need to worry about anything else,
or anyone else,

382
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:27,419
just to grow old with you,

383
00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:29,664
how wonderful that would be?

384
00:26:30,459 --> 00:26:33,459
You are my husband,
but you are also a minister of His Majesty,

385
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:37,379
a caretaker official for the people,
and a subject of the Tang Dynasty,

386
00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:41,459
Shouyue, no matter what you do,

387
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:45,379
I will follow and support you
with no regrets or complaints,

388
00:26:46,379 --> 00:26:47,456
It's just that…

389
00:26:51,499 --> 00:26:52,899
you must promise me one thing,

390
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:57,760
What thing?

391
00:26:58,739 --> 00:26:59,819
I only need you to trust me,

392
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:02,899
and be willing to tell me
your thinking and feelings in your heart,

393
00:27:03,899 --> 00:27:08,219
Only in this way
can I share weal and woe with my husband,

394
00:27:08,219 --> 00:27:10,659
advance and retreat together,
and to be with each other forever,

395
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:25,179
Will you promise me that?

396
00:27:26,339 --> 00:27:27,424
As my lady commands,

397
00:27:30,219 --> 00:27:31,219
how dare I not comply as the husband?

Today, I have truly experienced it,

It's no effort at all,

I'm flattered, Grand Marshal Zhangsun,
Chancellor Chu,

403

Anything to do tonight?

408
00:29:01,219 --> 00:29:05,259
Liuli, you used to want to go to Xizhou,

409
00:29:05,899 --> 00:29:08,459
But do you really like Xizhou?

410
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:11,899
In the past, my mother sent me to Xizhou,

411
00:29:11,899 --> 00:29:13,339
it was to protect me,

412
00:29:13,899 --> 00:29:16,839
She wanted me to find a place
where no one could find me,

413

and to live well,

414
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:21,819
My mother's unjust case has been redressed now,

415
00:29:21,819 --> 00:29:24,139
So I won't have to go to Xizhou
to suffer anymore,

416
00:29:25,979 --> 00:29:28,699

His Majesty has urgently summoned Mr, Pei
to the palace,

Mr, Pei, please mount up and follow me
into the palace to see His Majesty,

426
00:30:11,299 --> 00:30:13,819
Director Wang,
why is His Majesty in such a hurry,

427
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:15,339
couldn't wait until morning?

428
00:30:15,339 --> 00:30:17,299
I wonder if Mr, Pei and Madam

429
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:19,659
know Madam Yang, the mother of Lady Wu?

430
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,979
Madam Yang has just entered the palace
with an extremely displeased expression,

431
00:30:26,739 --> 00:30:28,619
I do not know what she said to His Majesty,

432
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:30,579
His Majesty was greatly angered,

433
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,659
asking me to summon Mr, Pei immediately,

434
00:30:34,939 --> 00:30:38,339
Seeing that Mr, Pei came out so quickly
and was fully dressed,

435
00:30:38,899 --> 00:30:40,459
I'm afraid
you must have been prepared beforehand,

436
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:48,899
However, you should be more cautious later,

437
00:30:49,619 --> 00:30:51,699
His Majesty is truly angry today,

438
00:30:53,139 --> 00:30:54,139
I understand,

439
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:56,019
Thank you for the reminder, Director Wang,

00:33:14,499 --> 00:33:19,259
Shouyue,
do you know why I summoned you late at night?

455
00:33:19,859 --> 00:33:20,896
Your Majesty,

456
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:24,419
Your Majesty summoned me late at night,

457
00:33:25,099 --> 00:33:27,299
it may because I went to the East Hall today,

458

A few days ago,

459
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:32,659
Chancellor Chu asked me to help him
copy a calligraphy model,

After the court this morning,

461
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:36,759
I went to find him
with the calligraphy model script,

462
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:39,299
His minor official
asked me to wait in the East Hall,

463

Excuse me, are you Mr, Pei?

464
00:33:44,219 --> 00:33:45,399
Chancellor Chu has already given orders,

465
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:46,739
If Mr, Pei comes,

466
00:33:46,739 --> 00:33:48,379
let him go directly to the East Hall and wait,

467
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:51,539
<i>[Benevolence and Respect for the Wise]</i>
It was time for the Chancellor's meal,

468
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:55,979
Grand Marshal Zhangsun and Chancellor Chu
made an exception to meet me in the East Hall,

469
00:33:56,939 --> 00:34:00,019
After chatting with Grand Marshal Zhangsun
and Chancellor Chu,

470
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,568
they asked for my opinion

471
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:04,779
on the matter of making Lady Wu the empress,

472
00:34:05,979 --> 00:34:07,104
I spoke honestly,

473
00:34:08,939 --> 00:34:11,739
Just now, Director Wang said that
Your Majesty wanted to see me,

474
00:34:12,459 --> 00:34:15,179
I guessed that it's probably because of this,

475
00:34:16,299 --> 00:34:18,019
Do you know, after the Chancellor's meal,

476
00:34:19,299 --> 00:34:20,919
the ministers were all discussing it,

477
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:23,979
Everyone in the palace was also discussing it,

478
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,259
They said,

479
00:34:25,779 --> 00:34:27,059
Shouyue has said,

480
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:31,379
If His Majesty insists on making Lady Wu
the queen,

481
00:34:32,019 --> 00:34:35,859
the nation's calamity will arise from this,

482
00:34:36,779 --> 00:34:40,699
It's evident that
these are not just words from his heart,

483
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:43,619
but also the enlightenment from the heaven,

484
00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:48,619
Shouyue,
how can you defend yourself in this matter?

485
00:34:56,819 --> 00:34:59,219
I have such words, yet I'm unable to refute,

486
00:35:00,259 --> 00:35:03,039
But my remarks are truly out of concern
for the nation,

487
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:06,179
Putting Your Majesty in a dilemma,
I'm too ashamed to face Your Majesty,

488
00:35:18,939 --> 00:35:20,099
Before I came to the study,

489
00:35:21,379 --> 00:35:22,579
Meiniang said,

490
00:35:23,139 --> 00:35:25,539
Shouyue is not an ungrateful person,

491
00:35:26,899 --> 00:35:27,939
Now, it seems

492
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:30,579
You are not only ungrateful,

493
00:35:31,179 --> 00:35:33,339
but also get carried away,

494
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:36,739
I wanted to promote you
to the Ministry of Personnel,

495
00:35:37,379 --> 00:35:40,739
Many ministers have made representations
to obstruct and disobey my will,

496
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:42,499
attracting the attention of everyone
in the court,

497
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:44,659
You are supposed to be very cautious,

498
00:35:45,979 --> 00:35:49,579
Yet, now you act rashly without cause,
provoking criticism out of nowhere,

499
00:35:49,579 --> 00:35:51,619
embarrassing me and Lady Wu,

500
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:57,259
Shouyue, speak your mind,

501
00:35:57,259 --> 00:36:01,339
How do you expect me to believe
that you did not do this intentionally?

502
00:36:02,539 --> 00:36:03,552
I have failed Your Majesty's grace,

503
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:06,339
I ask Your Majesty to mete out punishment,

504
00:36:09,139 --> 00:36:11,499
Very well,

505
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:14,819
Do you even refuse to defend yourself now?

506
00:36:17,739 --> 00:36:19,939
Don't you think
that I will consider your past merits,

507
00:36:19,939 --> 00:36:21,019
giving you a light punishment,

508
00:36:21,939 --> 00:36:24,739
Do you know what is happening nowadays
inside and outside the court and harem?

509
00:36:25,299 --> 00:36:27,339
Everyone is waiting to see
how I will deal with you,

510
00:36:31,259 --> 00:36:32,288
Your Majesty, please give a severe punishment,

511
00:36:35,979 --> 00:36:37,056
Severe punishment,

512
00:36:40,259 --> 00:36:41,344
Severe punishment,

513
00:36:43,939 --> 00:36:45,779
May Your Majesty calm your anger,
I deserve to die,

514
00:36:49,699 --> 00:36:52,059
Do you want me to punish you severely? Okay,

515
00:36:53,059 --> 00:36:54,539
I am sending you to Xizhou
to serve as a government official,

516
00:36:54,539 --> 00:36:56,739
Your servant received the order,
Thank you for your grace,

517
00:37:13,259 --> 00:37:14,272
Shouyue,

518
00:37:16,939 --> 00:37:20,779
Xizhou is perilous,
You brought this on yourself,

519
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:23,259
Do not blame me for being heartless,

520
00:37:25,659 --> 00:37:27,579
Your servant will now bid farewell,

521
00:37:28,339 --> 00:37:32,379
I wish Your Majesty a healthy body,
happiness and longevity forever,

523
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:47,712
Wait a moment,

524
00:38:16,179 --> 00:38:20,859
Shouyue, everyone knows
you are a disciple of Su Dingfang,

525
00:38:21,459 --> 00:38:22,819
But few are aware

526
00:38:22,819 --> 00:38:26,859
that you have also learnt deduction
from a famous master,

527
00:38:28,059 --> 00:38:31,219
Tell me about it,

528
00:38:32,459 --> 00:38:35,299
whether Lady Wu has the appearance
befitting the mother of the nation?

529
00:38:51,659 --> 00:38:52,779
Judging from physiognomy,

530
00:38:54,579 --> 00:38:56,659
Lady Wu's appearance is unspeakably noble,

531
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:00,619
but her fate with children is weak,

532
00:39:07,819 --> 00:39:08,899
not suitable to be the mother of the nation,

533
00:39:30,739 --> 00:39:33,339
I command you to go to Xizhou for your post
the day after tomorrow,

534
00:39:33,979 --> 00:39:35,968
no delay is permitted,

535
00:39:35,968 --> 00:39:38,976
<i>[Benevolence and Respect for the Wise]</i>

536
00:40:29,859 --> 00:40:30,944
Take a look,

537
00:40:32,459 --> 00:40:33,536
Miss, take a look,

538
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:48,939
It's better for you to go back and wait,
my lady

539
00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:53,999
You haven't been in good health these years,
and the morning chill

540
00:40:53,999 --> 00:40:55,419
Be careful not to catch a cold,

541
00:40:56,779 --> 00:40:58,979
<i>What I'm worried about now is the West,</i>

542
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:03,939
<i>The situation in the West is unstable,
which quite bothers His Majesty,</i>

543
00:41:04,739 --> 00:41:06,659
<i>In my opinion, not long after,</i>

544
00:41:07,579 --> 00:41:09,539
<i>His Majesty will soon send troops to the West,</i>

545
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:15,779
<i>Liuli, you used to want to go to Xizhou,</i>

546
00:41:16,419 --> 00:41:19,179
<i>But do you really like Xizhou?</i>

547
00:41:20,299 --> 00:41:21,312
Cheng,

548
00:41:22,259 --> 00:41:23,679
You go prepare more carriages and horses,

549
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:26,519
And pick a few reliable and robust servants,

550
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:28,579
It is the best
if they have no family or relatives,

551
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:30,499
Why is this, my lady?

552
00:41:30,499 --> 00:41:32,059
Are we going on a long journey? To where?

553
00:41:33,259 --> 00:41:35,979
Xizhou, Shouyue is taking us to Xizhou,

554
00:41:36,896 --> 00:41:37,979
Xizhou?

555
00:41:37,979 --> 00:41:39,104
Hurry,

556
00:41:44,659 --> 00:41:46,839
Ni, Tan, go pack your things,

557
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:49,219
This house is big, there's a lot to sort out,

558
00:41:49,219 --> 00:41:50,539
It's better to start early,

559
00:41:51,899 --> 00:41:52,928
Yes,

560
00:42:00,219 --> 00:42:01,280
Stop,

561
00:42:05,499 --> 00:42:06,499
Didn't I ask you to sleep?

562
00:42:07,779 --> 00:42:10,059
Why didn't you listen to me?
You're frozen stiff,

563
00:42:11,059 --> 00:42:13,019
Did His Majesty tell you when to leave?

564
00:42:15,579 --> 00:42:17,059
It's a long journey to Xizhou,

565
00:42:17,779 --> 00:42:19,739
I also don't know
how big the trouble is you've caused,

566
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:21,719
How long will His Majesty let you stay there?

567
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:23,419
So, if there's time,

568
00:42:23,419 --> 00:42:25,439
I want to finish up
with the Luoyang estates stuff,

569
00:42:25,439 --> 00:42:28,419
To visit uncle, aunt, foster mother,
grandpa and Xiaoshun,

570
00:42:29,779 --> 00:42:32,619
I also want to say goodbye to Lady Wu,

571
00:42:32,619 --> 00:42:33,779
Will you let me go?

572
00:42:37,299 --> 00:42:38,299
You little smarty,

573
00:42:39,499 --> 00:42:40,619
Really, I can't hide anything from you
