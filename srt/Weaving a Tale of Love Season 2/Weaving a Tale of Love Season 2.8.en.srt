<i>[Episode 8]</i>

3
00:01:37,445 --> 00:01:39,485
Pei Shouyue hit the jackpot

4
00:01:41,605 --> 00:01:43,565
when he married you,

5
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:46,245
Let me be honest,

6
00:01:47,605 --> 00:01:51,285
If you hadn't handled the Pei family estate

7
00:01:52,285 --> 00:01:55,145
so well this time

8
00:01:55,145 --> 00:01:57,685
and made a good name for Lady Wu,

9
00:01:58,325 --> 00:02:00,925
I would have been a lot tougher on you,

10
00:02:03,085 --> 00:02:05,365
and I wouldn't let Pei Shouyue off the hook,

11
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,325
Please rest assured, Madam,

12
00:02:08,005 --> 00:02:10,405
I won't ever forget
how much Lady Wu's helped out,

13
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:14,205
I'll make sure my husband
remembers his place, too,

14
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,645
I've got to leave now,

15
00:02:19,645 --> 00:02:22,285
Please take good care, Madam and Lady Wu

16
00:02:54,685 --> 00:02:57,405
Liuli, thank you so much,

17
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,605
Please accept a bow from me,

18
00:03:04,805 --> 00:03:06,605
I should be the one thanking you

19
00:03:08,045 --> 00:03:09,725
for being so smart and taking care of things,

20
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:11,685
After my sister passed away,

21
00:03:13,045 --> 00:03:14,525
my brother-in-law's been really down,

22
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,965
Now that he's got you,

23
00:03:19,405 --> 00:03:22,405
I bet my sister's smiling down on us,

24
00:03:28,605 --> 00:03:32,725
Thanks for getting justice for her,

25
00:03:34,445 --> 00:03:35,885
Not protecting my sister has always been

26
00:03:36,805 --> 00:03:38,805
Shouyue's deepest regret,

27
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:42,405
I'm not just helping myself today,

28
00:03:43,045 --> 00:03:45,925
but I'm also easing a worry for Shouyue,

29
00:03:50,085 --> 00:03:51,365
I gotta go,

30
00:03:52,045 --> 00:03:53,125
Take care,

31
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,325
Look how gorgeous the sky is, my dear,

32
00:04:21,325 --> 00:04:23,325
The moon's gonna look amazing tonight,

33
00:04:23,325 --> 00:04:24,945
As long as we hurry along the way,

34
00:04:24,945 --> 00:04:26,965
we will soon catch up with Master,

35
00:04:29,085 --> 00:04:30,245
Who said I was going to chase after him?

36
00:04:31,085 --> 00:04:34,045
My uncle's got a whole caravan set up for me
thirty miles from here, just outside town,

37
00:04:35,085 --> 00:04:36,965
We're heading straight to Western Regions
to do some trading,

38
00:04:38,965 --> 00:04:41,485
Let's go to Xizhou,

<i>Wishing you a long and prosperous life

64
00:07:21,765 --> 00:07:24,265
Ever since you left Chang'an,

65
00:07:24,265 --> 00:07:26,185
You drink alcohol every day
as if you were drinking water,

66
00:07:26,185 --> 00:07:27,885
No matter how fine the alcohol, it's no good,

67
00:07:28,885 --> 00:07:31,885
I'm worried that if we continue like this,
your body won't be able to take it,

Hey sis, we should hit the road,

75
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,525
<i>[Liuli's sister, An Sanniang]</i>
I know you are worried about Senior Official Pei,

76
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,205
but we have been traveling non-stop these days,

77
00:08:18,205 --> 00:08:20,005
I'm just worried you might be pushing yourself
too hard,

78
00:08:21,525 --> 00:08:22,685
At least you should eat something,

79
00:08:23,995 --> 00:08:25,581
<i>[Liuli's cousin, Mu Sanlang]</i>

80
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:32,965
People say that fine wine is a cure for sorrow,

81
00:08:32,965 --> 00:08:34,525
Why do I become more sober the more I drink?

82
00:08:36,405 --> 00:08:38,165
It's because you have such a great tolerance
for alcohol,

83
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,285
Exactly,

84
00:08:40,965 --> 00:08:42,885
But if you wanna talk about getting rid of
the blues, that's easy,

85
00:08:42,885 --> 00:08:45,645
Now, let's turn around
and gallop back to Chang'an,

86
00:08:45,645 --> 00:08:47,765
Then, take Madam with us to Xizhou,

87
00:08:48,925 --> 00:08:52,325
Doing that will just wash all those worries

88
00:08:52,845 --> 00:08:54,365
out of your heart,

89
00:08:54,365 --> 00:08:55,525
Not to mention, Master,

90
00:08:55,525 --> 00:08:56,785
we've been on this journey together

91
00:08:56,785 --> 00:08:58,325
with no big hassles or dangers,

92
00:08:58,885 --> 00:08:59,925
Maybe you're just overthinking things a bit?

93
00:09:00,605 --> 00:09:04,565
The spot we're headed to is basically
the wild place of the country,

94
00:09:08,525 --> 00:09:11,965
Sister, I am now a stranger
to Senior Official Pei,

95
00:09:12,605 --> 00:09:13,605
The rush is more
because I've always been drawn to Xizhou

96
00:09:13,605 --> 00:09:16,205
since I was a kid,

97
00:09:16,925 --> 00:09:19,605
That's where my mom's from,
with all that wide-open space,

98
00:09:21,485 --> 00:09:23,485
I wanna tag along with you
and get into the merchant game out there,

99
00:09:23,485 --> 00:09:25,965
Perhaps I'll even
make a significant accomplishment,

100
00:09:26,485 --> 00:09:28,705
Ok, if you say so,

101
00:09:28,705 --> 00:09:29,885
However, there's one thing,

102
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,745
If your body can't handle it,
you have to tell me,

103
00:09:32,745 --> 00:09:33,765
Don't be out there acting all tough,

104
00:09:34,485 --> 00:09:37,425
Don't mention Pei Xingjian anymore,

105
00:09:37,425 --> 00:09:39,025
It's really bringing everyone down,

106
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:40,865
He is so heartless and unrighteous,

107
00:09:40,865 --> 00:09:42,165
What's this about leaving a divorce letter?

108
00:09:43,445 --> 00:09:45,005
Liuli, what else were you expecting?

109
00:09:45,765 --> 00:09:47,725
In Xizhou, there are plenty of fine young men

110
00:09:49,765 --> 00:09:51,085
You'll find someone way better!

111
00:09:52,165 --> 00:09:54,225
We have grown up together,

112
00:09:54,225 --> 00:09:55,525
Please zip it with the comments,

113
00:09:56,365 --> 00:09:57,405
So as not to trouble you,

114
00:10:02,005 --> 00:10:03,925
Do you know why I left a divorce letter,

115
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,445
Please enlighten me, Master,

116
00:10:07,365 --> 00:10:08,965
Only by doing this can I sever ties with her,

117
00:10:10,205 --> 00:10:12,805
Then, Lady Wu and Madam Yang

118
00:10:12,805 --> 00:10:14,485
would not get angry with her because of me,

119
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:18,845
Also, I have already discussed this with Liuli,

120
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,245
We let go of the Luoyang property for cheap
to the Princess,

121
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:26,405
Without the burden of me and the lands,

122
00:10:27,565 --> 00:10:31,685
Only then could she truly live
a free and comfortable life in Chang'an,

123
00:10:32,805 --> 00:10:34,965
But Master, life doesn't always go as planned,

124
00:10:34,965 --> 00:10:37,925
What if we end up back in Chang'an
in two years?

125
00:10:37,925 --> 00:10:39,445
- What if Madam--
- Two years?

126
00:10:41,205 --> 00:10:43,565
Don't even think about going back
without five to ten years,

127
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:45,952
No,

128
00:10:47,445 --> 00:10:50,205
Maybe I'll never be able to return to Chang'an
in this lifetime,

129
00:10:55,925 --> 00:10:57,665
It's just my luck

130
00:10:57,665 --> 00:10:58,885
dragging you down,

131
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:03,445
I should really stop getting others involved,

132
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:07,325
You sound truly resolute,

133
00:11:07,325 --> 00:11:08,905
but we're moving so slowly,

134
00:11:08,905 --> 00:11:10,205
Who are we waiting on?

135
00:11:29,611 --> 00:11:34,624

If you feel it's not strong enough,

138
00:12:22,205 --> 00:12:23,565
you can try some of my other moves again,

139
00:12:27,005 --> 00:12:31,245
A proud wolf will never give in
to a vicious dog,

140
00:12:34,445 --> 00:12:38,285
You better figure out where you stand,

00:12:39,365 --> 00:12:40,485
A lowly slave girl,

142
00:12:40,485 --> 00:12:43,285
Forget about having
a high-status or fancy family,

143
00:12:43,885 --> 00:12:45,405
Your name is now Ahong,

144
00:12:46,245 --> 00:12:47,685

This is your last warning,

00:14:45,725 --> 00:14:47,285
Don't push my limits,

152

because trust me,

153
00:14:52,645 --> 00:14:54,445
you don't want to deal with what comes next,

00:14:59,805 --> 00:15:01,405
You are a coward,

- It's just a misunderstanding,
- Yes, you're right,

Dear guests, it's cold and windy outside,

174
00:16:42,725 --> 00:16:44,285
Let's chat indoors,

175
00:16:48,045 --> 00:16:49,465
We've got some great wine,

176
00:16:49,465 --> 00:16:51,705
The taste is sweet and has a long aftertaste,

177
00:16:51,705 --> 00:16:53,645
Let's all have some to warm up,

178
00:16:55,045 --> 00:16:56,045
What are we waiting for then?

179
00:16:56,045 --> 00:16:57,205
Let's go inside and have some,

180
00:16:57,205 --> 00:16:58,525
After you, Mr, Pei,

181
00:17:02,205 --> 00:17:05,645
Don't let this female slave spoil our mood,

182
00:17:06,645 --> 00:17:08,205
- Yelun,
- Yes,

183
00:17:08,205 --> 00:17:09,405
Lock her in the stable,

184
00:17:10,165 --> 00:17:11,425
Don't give her food tonight,

185
00:17:11,425 --> 00:17:12,805
Yes, sir,

186
00:17:12,805 --> 00:17:14,085
Mr, Pei, please come in,

187
00:17:18,285 --> 00:17:19,392
After you,

188
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,472
Welcome,

189
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,005
Sir, are you here for a meal
or for a stay this time?

190
00:17:29,005 --> 00:17:30,525
Not for staying,

191
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:32,665
I heard that your place is full of fine wine
from Chang'an,

192
00:17:32,665 --> 00:17:33,725
so I came here,

193
00:17:33,725 --> 00:17:35,765
That's right, Welcome,

194
00:17:36,285 --> 00:17:38,365
So Mr, Pei is also a wine lover,

195
00:17:57,885 --> 00:18:00,925
I am also a wine lover, How about--

196
00:18:00,925 --> 00:18:02,005
Mr, Pei prefers quietness,

197
00:18:02,925 --> 00:18:03,965
He likes drinking by himself,

198
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:08,160
Cheng,

199
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,485
Thank you for your hospitality,

200
00:18:12,205 --> 00:18:14,365
However, I have always preferred to be alone,

201
00:18:15,365 --> 00:18:16,605
I hope for your understanding,

202
00:18:16,605 --> 00:18:18,205
Well, that's all right then,

203
00:18:35,005 --> 00:18:36,325
Take a seat, Cheng,

204
00:18:41,925 --> 00:18:44,165
Today you're lucky, having escaped death,

205
00:18:45,765 --> 00:18:47,085
But don't get too happy too soon,

206
00:18:48,205 --> 00:18:50,525
Clearly, that weak man didn't want to buy you,

207
00:18:51,205 --> 00:18:53,045
You'll see how I'll deal with you
after they leave,

208
00:18:54,805 --> 00:18:57,005
Just kill me,

209
00:18:57,605 --> 00:18:59,285
Bitch,

210
00:18:59,285 --> 00:19:00,512
Wait a moment,

211
00:19:02,645 --> 00:19:03,936
What is this?

212
00:19:04,605 --> 00:19:06,305
This is freshly cooked mutton soup,

213
00:19:06,305 --> 00:19:07,945
The sheep was freshly slaughtered
in the kitchen today,

214
00:19:07,945 --> 00:19:09,845
The meat in this soup is extremely fresh,

215
00:19:10,765 --> 00:19:11,825
Then you have a look at

216
00:19:11,825 --> 00:19:13,088
that table

217
00:19:15,005 --> 00:19:16,544
and then take another look at this table,

218
00:19:17,165 --> 00:19:18,464
What's all this?

219
00:19:19,285 --> 00:19:20,768
Sir…

220
00:19:22,205 --> 00:19:23,488
Cheng,

221
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:27,385
Master,

222
00:19:27,385 --> 00:19:29,025
They're really treating us unfairly,

223
00:19:29,025 --> 00:19:31,525
Do they think we have no money?

224
00:19:32,245 --> 00:19:33,885
No, No, No,

225
00:19:33,885 --> 00:19:37,805
Such differential treatment
is simply too outrageous,

226
00:19:40,325 --> 00:19:41,725
It's a misunderstanding!

227
00:19:42,645 --> 00:19:44,165
Sir,

228
00:19:44,165 --> 00:19:47,185
the food for those two guests was brought
by themselves,

229
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:48,905
My little shop is in the wilderness,

230
00:19:48,905 --> 00:19:52,445
How could we possibly provide such
precious and exquisite delicacies here?

231
00:20:00,285 --> 00:20:02,405
<i>All of these are popular dishes in Chang'an,</i>

232
00:20:03,205 --> 00:20:05,285
<i>and they are all coveted
by the elite and noble families,</i>

233
00:20:06,085 --> 00:20:07,485
<i>Although they are nothing surprising
in Chang'an,</i>

234
00:20:08,725 --> 00:20:11,045
<i>this place is thousands of miles away
from Chang'an,</i>

235
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:16,645
<i>From his attire, this man is clearly a person
from the West,</i>

236
00:20:17,245 --> 00:20:20,485
<i>but his temperament presents him
as a person of high society from Chang'an,</i>

237
00:20:21,685 --> 00:20:25,645
<i>His demeanor is calm and collected,
relaxed yet extraordinary,</i>

238
00:20:26,365 --> 00:20:27,465
<i>How would such a person</i>

239
00:20:27,465 --> 00:20:29,805
<i>appear in this wilderness tavern?</i>

240
00:20:33,485 --> 00:20:36,725
Have you heard about that troublemaker
everyone in Chang'an is talking about?

241
00:20:36,725 --> 00:20:38,085
Do you mean Pei Xingjian?

242
00:20:38,085 --> 00:20:39,945
He has become arrogant because of favoritism,

243
00:20:39,945 --> 00:20:44,085
He criticized the forbidden areas and even said
the chaos of the nation would start from this,

244
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:46,445
His Majesty was furious,

245
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:50,045
he got knocked down and sent to Xizhou,

246
00:21:29,485 --> 00:21:30,976
I also heard that

247
00:21:31,565 --> 00:21:34,525
this person is arrogant because of his talent,

248
00:21:34,525 --> 00:21:35,865
Relying on the Emperor's favor,

249
00:21:35,865 --> 00:21:38,405
he even disregards the elders of his family,

250
00:21:40,005 --> 00:21:42,165
This person has a corrupt character,

251
00:21:42,165 --> 00:21:45,445
He loves wine like life
and is greedy and lustful,

252
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,725
If such a person came to Xizhou,

253
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:52,885
it would be like
one rotten apple spoils the whole barrel,

254
00:21:54,405 --> 00:21:55,520
Excuse me,

255
00:21:56,725 --> 00:21:57,745
another pot of wine, please,

256
00:21:57,745 --> 00:21:59,200
Alright,

257
00:22:45,525 --> 00:22:47,485
You can really hold your liquor,

258
00:22:48,485 --> 00:22:49,645
It's because your wine is brewed so well,

259
00:22:50,165 --> 00:22:53,205
It's even more fragrant than the wine
I buy in Chang'an,

260
00:22:53,925 --> 00:22:55,445
You flatter me, Enjoy,

261
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,472
Enjoy,

262
00:22:59,085 --> 00:23:01,885
Do you often go to the West Market?

263
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:06,565
When I'm not on duty,

264
00:23:07,605 --> 00:23:09,125
I tend to go there every two or three days,

265
00:23:10,805 --> 00:23:13,365
What kind of position do you hold?

266
00:23:14,885 --> 00:23:17,565
I'm just a minor official,
not worth mentioning,

267
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:21,785
So it turns out
that you are from the government,

268
00:23:21,785 --> 00:23:23,725
My bad,

269
00:23:27,845 --> 00:23:30,165
I heard that your last name is also Pei,

270
00:23:34,245 --> 00:23:35,525
That's quite a coincidence,

271
00:23:47,285 --> 00:23:49,525
I am so boring,

272
00:23:49,525 --> 00:23:50,545
Yelun

273
00:23:50,545 --> 00:23:52,385
- Keep an eye on them,
- Okay,

274
00:23:52,385 --> 00:23:53,845
I need to use the restroom,

275
00:24:13,325 --> 00:24:15,965
Such a pity, It was so close,

276
00:24:18,605 --> 00:24:20,565
I have lived here for thirty years,

277
00:24:20,565 --> 00:24:22,405
It's my first time getting hurt by a woman,

278
00:25:11,445 --> 00:25:13,885
Got you now, Do you think you can run away?

279
00:25:30,565 --> 00:25:31,776
Dalang,

280
00:25:37,845 --> 00:25:38,965
Why did you save him?

281
00:25:39,845 --> 00:25:43,325
This man has committed many misdeeds and
has persecuted so many respectable women,

282
00:25:45,725 --> 00:25:47,168
The one I saved is you,

283
00:25:53,965 --> 00:25:54,965
Master, are you alright?

284
00:25:55,565 --> 00:25:56,640
I'm fine,

285
00:25:57,165 --> 00:26:00,525
I am eternally grateful to you, Mr, Pei,
for saving my life,

286
00:26:01,045 --> 00:26:04,005
Like I said, I was saving her,
You don't need to thank me,

287
00:26:04,005 --> 00:26:05,568
I don't need your help,

288
00:26:06,205 --> 00:26:09,405
No matter what, you saved my life,

289
00:26:10,245 --> 00:26:12,025
If you need me in the future,

290
00:26:12,025 --> 00:26:13,485
just give the order anytime,

291
00:26:14,765 --> 00:26:16,405
How do you plan to deal with this female slave?

292
00:26:18,445 --> 00:26:19,805
If you like her,

293
00:26:19,805 --> 00:26:21,605
I can give her to you,

294
00:26:24,565 --> 00:26:25,925
I've said the descendants of the wolf

295
00:26:25,925 --> 00:26:29,365
will never be slaves,

296
00:26:30,445 --> 00:26:31,712
If you don't want her,

297
00:26:32,765 --> 00:26:34,005
I can't keep her either,

298
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:40,125
Even if I die, I won't let you manipulate me,

299
00:26:49,325 --> 00:26:50,645
Even ants fight for survival,

300
00:26:50,645 --> 00:26:52,005
Why don't you take care of yourself?

301
00:27:58,005 --> 00:27:59,045
Madam,

302
00:28:22,805 --> 00:28:24,096
Liuli,

303
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,645
You must have mistaken me for someone else,

304
00:28:27,485 --> 00:28:28,685
I don't know you,

305
00:29:15,365 --> 00:29:16,765
Liuli, wait for me,

306
00:29:24,685 --> 00:29:25,685
Greetings, Sanniang,

307
00:29:27,965 --> 00:29:28,965
That was all a misunderstanding,

308
00:29:30,125 --> 00:29:31,405
Please let me explain,

309
00:29:31,925 --> 00:29:33,205
Senior Official Pei, please don't be like this,

310
00:29:33,925 --> 00:29:35,405
You don't have to be so polite,

311
00:29:35,925 --> 00:29:38,885
Moreover, there is no need
for you to explain to me,

312
00:29:43,165 --> 00:29:44,285
What's going on?

313
00:29:47,565 --> 00:29:48,928
I don't know,

314
00:29:56,005 --> 00:29:57,605
My lady, you were traveling day and night

315
00:29:58,125 --> 00:29:59,605
to see Master as early as possible,

316
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:01,605
I didn't expect him to be so excessive,

317
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:12,065
Tan, you are becoming more and more unruly,

318
00:30:12,065 --> 00:30:14,245
Is Master someone you can casually comment on?

319
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:15,985
I'm just distressed for you,

320
00:30:15,985 --> 00:30:17,325
I'm feeling indignant on behalf of you,

321
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:21,485
Based on my understanding of him, I'm afraid--

322
00:30:25,605 --> 00:30:27,325
Liuli,

323
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:30,445
What just happened is not as you think,

324
00:30:31,405 --> 00:30:33,005
- I--
- Senior Official Pei, please leave,

325
00:30:33,805 --> 00:30:36,045
Since you have written the divorce letter,
there are no longer any ties between us,

326
00:30:36,605 --> 00:30:37,765
Chancellor Pei, please show some respect,

327
00:30:41,085 --> 00:30:42,325
- Liuli,
- Mr, Pei,

328
00:30:42,885 --> 00:30:45,565
Mr, Pei, I've been looking for you,

329
00:30:46,365 --> 00:30:50,305
I have prepared a feast
and a performance for you,

330
00:30:50,305 --> 00:30:53,485
Tonight, we two must have a great time,

331
00:30:54,005 --> 00:30:55,085
Let's go, Let's go,

332
00:30:55,085 --> 00:30:56,985
I've been looking for you for ages,

333
00:30:56,985 --> 00:30:58,165
We must have a great time tonight,

334
00:31:41,605 --> 00:31:42,976
Cheers,

335
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,560
Come on,

336
00:32:29,488 --> 00:32:31,764
<i>[Letter of Divorce]</i>

337
00:32:49,845 --> 00:32:51,040
Come on,

338
00:33:00,925 --> 00:33:02,805
What are you going to do? Sit here,

339
00:33:03,645 --> 00:33:04,685
Have a seat,

340
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:09,485
Don't rush, Let's keep drinking,

341
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:46,445
My lady didn't eat anything tonight,

342
00:33:47,605 --> 00:33:49,605
Let's bring her a bowl of hot wonton soup,

343
00:34:11,525 --> 00:34:12,765
Ni, Tan,

344
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:15,365
Allow me to say a few words to Liuli, please,

345
00:34:17,045 --> 00:34:18,205
She is very angry,

346
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,845
It's probably not something
that can be soothed with just a few words,

347
00:34:22,805 --> 00:34:25,285
Thank you for the reminder,

348
00:35:33,485 --> 00:35:34,525
The cold wind has been blowing all day,

349
00:35:35,565 --> 00:35:36,765
Even if you're not hungry,
you should eat something hot,

350
00:35:39,645 --> 00:35:41,125
Hurry up and eat some

351
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:42,405
before it gets cold,

352
00:35:46,485 --> 00:35:47,648
Liuli,

353
00:35:48,925 --> 00:35:50,400
you have lost a lot of weight,

354
00:35:58,005 --> 00:36:00,605
I'll eat once you leave,

355
00:36:03,045 --> 00:36:04,608
Okay,

356
00:36:34,645 --> 00:36:36,384
He has really been kicked out,

357
00:36:43,285 --> 00:36:45,965
How can this person be so shameless?

358
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:48,445
He is standing at the door without leaving,

359
00:36:52,485 --> 00:36:53,485
What did I tell you?

360
00:36:54,165 --> 00:36:55,445
We should wait in Dunhuang,

361
00:36:55,445 --> 00:36:57,885
Why did you insist on coming over here?
What's the point?

362
00:36:58,605 --> 00:36:59,725
I want to see him,

363
00:37:02,245 --> 00:37:03,445
You have seen him now,

364
00:37:04,045 --> 00:37:06,125
Yeah, he's just like this,

365
00:37:06,765 --> 00:37:08,605
Did you see the way he looks at women?

366
00:37:08,605 --> 00:37:12,765
Did you see him mingling with a slave trader?

367
00:37:12,765 --> 00:37:16,245
I really doubt if he knows
that he's the Senior Official,

368
00:37:16,245 --> 00:37:18,465
Do you think the man you just saw

369
00:37:18,465 --> 00:37:20,405
is what Pei Xingjian is really like?

370
00:37:21,645 --> 00:37:23,085
Whether it's real or not, I don't care,

371
00:37:23,085 --> 00:37:24,245
I am not his wife anyway,

372
00:37:24,245 --> 00:37:25,565
Anyway, the Pei Xingjian I see is

373
00:37:25,565 --> 00:37:28,265
this person standing outside, That's all,

374
00:37:28,265 --> 00:37:29,725
Don't judge a book by its cover,

375
00:37:30,965 --> 00:37:35,045
Mi Dalang is a well-known slave trader
in Xizhou,

376
00:37:36,765 --> 00:37:39,925
He is familiar with the local people
and has deep connections,

377
00:37:40,845 --> 00:37:41,925
So what?

378
00:37:42,925 --> 00:37:46,885
I find this Senior Official Pei
quite interesting,

379
00:37:49,525 --> 00:37:52,485
Fine, whatever you say,

380
00:37:54,085 --> 00:37:56,125
The Tang army is going to deploy troops
to Western Regions,

381
00:38:22,285 --> 00:38:23,680
Thank you,

382
00:38:25,365 --> 00:38:26,624
My pleasure,

383
00:38:27,645 --> 00:38:29,885
I cannot bear this honor,

384
00:38:30,925 --> 00:38:32,485
I hope you can show some respect from now on

385
00:38:33,005 --> 00:38:34,125
to avoid embarrassment,

386
00:38:35,165 --> 00:38:38,845
Liuli, are you angry with me?

387
00:38:39,805 --> 00:38:40,925
I know it was my fault,

388
00:38:40,925 --> 00:38:42,245
Senior Official Pei, please don't say that,

389
00:38:43,165 --> 00:38:44,685
How dare a person like me get angry with you?

390
00:38:45,885 --> 00:38:48,205
In the future,
I still need to establish myself in Xizhou,

391
00:38:49,045 --> 00:38:51,325
I may have to rely on
the wise administration of yours,

392
00:38:52,245 --> 00:38:54,525
Our fortuitous meeting today is nothing
more than a coincidence,

393
00:38:55,645 --> 00:38:57,165
You don't need to worry about it,

394
00:38:59,245 --> 00:39:00,768
Liuli,

395
00:39:03,165 --> 00:39:04,445
it is all my fault,

396
00:39:06,085 --> 00:39:07,325
I have wronged you,

397
00:39:08,005 --> 00:39:09,005
I underestimated you

398
00:39:11,765 --> 00:39:13,445
but why do you belittle yourself like this?

399
00:39:15,405 --> 00:39:17,045
Even if you never look at me again from now on,

400
00:39:18,885 --> 00:39:20,565
I will never let you suffer in that way,

401
00:39:21,085 --> 00:39:22,560
Senior Official Pei,

402
00:39:23,325 --> 00:39:24,845
you have never looked down on me,

403
00:39:25,565 --> 00:39:26,685
Instead, you have overestimated me by

404
00:39:28,245 --> 00:39:29,965
thinking that I have the elegance and ability

405
00:39:30,925 --> 00:39:33,325
to respond gracefully in the flourishing

406
00:39:34,085 --> 00:39:36,125
and elegant city of Chang'an
as if I were at ease,

407
00:39:36,965 --> 00:39:39,885
But the truth is I'm carefree
and don't have big ambitions,

408
00:39:40,925 --> 00:39:43,865
All I want is to not be controlled by others

409
00:39:43,865 --> 00:39:44,965
and to be free from
all the scheming and deceit,

410
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,885
Liuli…

411
00:39:49,885 --> 00:39:51,445
Liuli wasn't of noble birth to begin with,

412
00:39:52,605 --> 00:39:54,205
but I never saw myself as inferior

413
00:39:55,445 --> 00:39:57,685
for working in the marketplace,

414
00:39:58,645 --> 00:40:03,325
I came to Xizhou because this vast land here
is enough to satisfy me,

415
00:40:05,085 --> 00:40:06,645
It has nothing to do with you,
Senior Official Pei,

416
00:40:07,925 --> 00:40:09,405
Please don't overthink about it,

417
00:40:15,685 --> 00:40:17,125
From the moment I saw you today,

418
00:40:20,045 --> 00:40:21,485
I realized that I was terribly wrong,

419
00:40:23,285 --> 00:40:24,405
but I never imagined

420
00:40:26,005 --> 00:40:27,485
that I had made such grave mistakes,

421
00:40:29,405 --> 00:40:30,485
You have every right to be angry with me,

422
00:40:32,885 --> 00:40:34,285
I judged you with a petty mind,

423
00:40:35,405 --> 00:40:37,965
I should not have had any expectations of you,

424
00:40:46,205 --> 00:40:47,725
Actually, I not only belittled you

425
00:40:49,965 --> 00:40:51,245
but also overestimated myself,

426
00:40:52,805 --> 00:40:54,325
I always feel that
as long as you are doing well,

427
00:40:54,925 --> 00:40:59,645
it wouldn't matter
even if I never see you again in this life,

428
00:41:01,485 --> 00:41:02,765
But I didn't expect that

429
00:41:05,085 --> 00:41:06,685
these days have been so difficult to endure,

430
00:41:09,765 --> 00:41:11,285
Can you forgive me?

433
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:19,325
Good morning, Mr, Pei,

434
00:42:20,765 --> 00:42:22,685
The young lady living in this room
set off early in the morning

435
00:42:22,685 --> 00:42:24,205
with the caravan,

436
00:42:24,205 --> 00:42:25,985
- That early?
- Yes,

437
00:42:25,985 --> 00:42:28,085
The caravan always has long and tiring days,
leaving early and coming back late,

438
00:42:28,085 --> 00:42:29,365
That young lady must

439
00:42:29,365 --> 00:42:31,365
have a very good relationship with her fiance,

440
00:42:31,365 --> 00:42:33,005
Otherwise, she would definitely not travel
such a long distance

441
00:42:33,005 --> 00:42:34,405
with her fiance doing business,

442
00:42:34,405 --> 00:42:35,485
Fiance?
