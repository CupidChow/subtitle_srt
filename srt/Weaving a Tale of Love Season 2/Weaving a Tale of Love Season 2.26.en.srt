[Weaving A Tale of Love 2]

2
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:36,243
[Episode 26]

3
00:01:36,243 --> 00:01:37,243
I am just an innocent woman,

4
00:01:37,243 --> 00:01:38,263
lack of knowledge.

5
00:01:38,263 --> 00:01:39,603
Advisor, please forgive me.

6
00:01:41,443 --> 00:01:43,263
Since it is not the Chief Administrator
who wants the man,

7
00:01:43,263 --> 00:01:44,523
then it's easier to handle.

8
00:01:45,283 --> 00:01:47,563
Anyway, Master. Mi is
seriously injured like this,

9
00:01:47,563 --> 00:01:48,823
can't go anywhere.

10
00:01:48,823 --> 00:01:50,703
Advisor, please wait

11
00:01:50,703 --> 00:01:52,223
until his injuries are slightly better,

12
00:01:52,223 --> 00:01:54,223
then take the official paper to bring him,

13
00:01:54,223 --> 00:01:56,283
to prevent people to think

14
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,923
that someone is slaughtering the merchants

15
00:01:57,923 --> 00:02:00,803
in order to steal the money and goods.

16
00:02:03,563 --> 00:02:05,603
Madam, you are indeed kind.

17
00:02:07,963 --> 00:02:10,323
Just make sure not to get yourself involved.

18
00:02:11,963 --> 00:02:13,003
You are funny.

19
00:02:13,683 --> 00:02:15,003
It is said that good and
evil have their own rewards.

20
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:17,423
I have never slaughtered in the city
or trafficked in goods unlawfully.

21
00:02:17,423 --> 00:02:18,923
How could I get myself involved?

22
00:02:20,123 --> 00:02:21,823
There are gods watching.

23
00:02:21,823 --> 00:02:23,243
Only those

24
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:25,563
who are full of sin and greatly evil

25
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:26,803
will have their evil actions repaid with evil.

26
00:02:27,603 --> 00:02:29,803
The souls of those who died at their hands

27
00:02:29,803 --> 00:02:31,583
are waiting for these bastards
in the underworld

28
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:35,183
to tear out their hearts and torture them.

29
00:02:35,183 --> 00:02:37,563
Don't worry for me.

30
00:02:46,043 --> 00:02:47,723
Madam, I will remember

31
00:02:48,523 --> 00:02:51,123
what you said today.

32
00:02:57,843 --> 00:02:59,323
Master. Mi.

33
00:03:03,563 --> 00:03:05,760
Master. Mi can't stand this fierce medicine.

34
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,823
Save him.

35
00:03:06,823 --> 00:03:08,803
We can't let him die for no reason.

36
00:03:39,603 --> 00:03:41,843
Physician Han, keep treating him.

37
00:03:42,483 --> 00:03:43,783
If he were to die now,

38
00:03:43,783 --> 00:03:45,363
many things are not clear,

39
00:03:45,363 --> 00:03:46,503
what should we do then?

40
00:03:46,503 --> 00:03:47,552
Save him now.

41
00:04:10,603 --> 00:04:11,843
Madam.

42
00:04:11,843 --> 00:04:12,928
Please forgive me

43
00:04:13,923 --> 00:04:15,603
for not being able to
bring the dead back to life.

44
00:04:21,003 --> 00:04:22,203
Don't be sad, Madam.

45
00:04:23,403 --> 00:04:24,763
Everyone has their own destiny,

46
00:04:25,443 --> 00:04:27,763
that's what some lowly people deserve.

47
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:32,083
It's not something that can be
changed by anyone's words.

48
00:04:34,603 --> 00:04:35,643
It's still too early

49
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,723
to talk about destiny.

50
00:04:40,883 --> 00:04:42,683
Madam, I guess you still
have matters to take care of.

51
00:04:44,043 --> 00:04:46,443
Then I won't bother you any longer.

52
00:05:02,683 --> 00:05:03,776
What is it?

53
00:05:11,723 --> 00:05:13,683
Wang Wendu is filled with greed,

54
00:05:13,683 --> 00:05:16,483
slaughtering the merchants
in the city for money.

55
00:05:17,123 --> 00:05:19,123
However, Su Dingfang and Pei Xingjian

56
00:05:19,123 --> 00:05:20,723
are not willing to join in.

57
00:05:22,003 --> 00:05:23,763
In order to force Su Dingfang accepts,

58
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:27,283
Wang Wendu frames Master. Mi as a Dadu spy,

59
00:05:27,883 --> 00:05:29,103
also detains Pei Xingjian

60
00:05:29,103 --> 00:05:30,403
in the name of

61
00:05:30,403 --> 00:05:31,623
ineffective dispatch of provisions

62
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,203
and tries to convict him.

63
00:05:34,003 --> 00:05:36,423
Later he escorts Pei Xingjian to Xizhou,

64
00:05:36,423 --> 00:05:38,303
wanting to use the knife of Qu family

65
00:05:38,303 --> 00:05:40,203
to remove Pei Xingjian.

66
00:05:57,344 --> 00:05:58,363
Mr. Bai San.

67
00:05:58,363 --> 00:05:59,456
Shopkeeper.

68
00:05:59,456 --> 00:06:00,543
Is the battle over?

69
00:06:00,543 --> 00:06:02,063
Is Senior Official Pei safe and sound?

70
00:06:02,063 --> 00:06:03,463
The Tang army has already returned.

71
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,823
The Chancellor is detained in the army.

72
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,923
The Chancellor has gone through great pains
to get provisions and hasn't received merits,

73
00:06:08,923 --> 00:06:09,963
how did he end up getting detained?

74
00:06:09,963 --> 00:06:12,083
Yes, what should we do?

75
00:06:13,883 --> 00:06:14,976
In the past three months,

76
00:06:15,683 --> 00:06:17,323
Shouyue has worked pretty hard,

77
00:06:17,323 --> 00:06:20,203
using just the few tens of thousands
of laborers and carriages that he had at hand,

78
00:06:20,203 --> 00:06:22,443
to support the provisions for
the army of a hundred thousand,

79
00:06:22,443 --> 00:06:23,583
but in the end,

80
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,163
what he got in return is a bloody massacre

81
00:06:26,163 --> 00:06:28,163
and an accusation
of ineffective dispatch of the provisions.

82
00:06:28,923 --> 00:06:30,343
Madam, don't worry.

83
00:06:30,343 --> 00:06:32,523
Although Deputy Commander Wang Wendu
is up to something evil,

84
00:06:32,523 --> 00:06:33,963
the Chancellor has a reputation,

85
00:06:33,963 --> 00:06:35,923
has even won the trust
of people in the military.

86
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:38,403
The soldiers are extremely caring
towards the Chancellor.

87
00:06:38,403 --> 00:06:39,424
Therefore,

88
00:06:40,203 --> 00:06:41,323
he has not suffered too much.

89
00:06:44,923 --> 00:06:47,403
Calculating the days, the queen
must have already received the news.

90
00:06:47,403 --> 00:06:49,883
Perhaps His Majesty's decree has been issue.

91
00:06:49,883 --> 00:06:51,903
We just need to wait a few more days,

92
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,243
there will be good news.

93
00:06:54,563 --> 00:06:55,583
The matters this time,

94
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:56,723
I must thank you.

95
00:06:57,323 --> 00:06:59,163
Your trip this time was indeed dangerous.

96
00:06:59,683 --> 00:07:01,483
Thanks to the Chancellor,

97
00:07:01,483 --> 00:07:03,323
those of us who prepare provisions for army

98
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:04,723
could escape unscathed.

99
00:07:05,283 --> 00:07:06,336
What do you mean?

100
00:07:06,963 --> 00:07:08,983
The army provisions officer sent by Wang Wendu

101
00:07:08,983 --> 00:07:11,123
intended to detain all those merchants.

102
00:07:12,003 --> 00:07:13,463
Fortunately, the Chancellor said,

103
00:07:13,463 --> 00:07:14,523
" Deputy Director Wang

104
00:07:14,523 --> 00:07:16,843
if you want to have no more provisions
on the return journey,

105
00:07:16,843 --> 00:07:18,083
then detain people as you wish."

106
00:07:18,603 --> 00:07:20,563
After pondering for a long time,
that officer still did not dare to do so,

107
00:07:20,563 --> 00:07:22,243
so only the Chancellor alone is detained.

108
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,123
They intended to interrogate
the Chancellor day and night

109
00:07:25,123 --> 00:07:26,303
to convict his crime.

110
00:07:26,303 --> 00:07:28,803
But once the word about the ineffective
dispatch of provisions spread,

111
00:07:28,803 --> 00:07:31,383
Li Lang, who's in charge of
the military granary, immediately fell out.

112
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:33,523
Because the Chancellor does not
hold any position in the military granary,

113
00:07:33,523 --> 00:07:35,323
just helping Mr. Li with what he's doing.

114
00:07:35,323 --> 00:07:37,823
If he was guilty
of ineffective dispatch of provisions,

115
00:07:37,823 --> 00:07:39,323
how could Mr. Li be innocent?

116
00:07:40,723 --> 00:07:41,923
The soldiers in the military granary
couldn't stand by and seeing it,

117
00:07:41,923 --> 00:07:42,983
seizing the chance to make a noise.

118
00:07:42,983 --> 00:07:45,643
Wang Wendu's soldiers didn't
dare to commit the public anger,

119
00:07:45,643 --> 00:07:48,523
plus, Mr. An had managed things
thoroughly, from top to bottom,

120
00:07:48,523 --> 00:07:50,083
thus the matter was postponed.

121
00:07:52,963 --> 00:07:54,483
Wang Wendu is filled with greed.

122
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:55,923
First, in order to make money,

123
00:07:55,923 --> 00:07:57,603
he slaughtered the merchants in the city.

124
00:07:58,283 --> 00:08:00,863
Then he framed Master. Mi as a Dadu spy.

125
00:08:00,863 --> 00:08:02,463
Now, he has arrested Shouyue

126
00:08:02,463 --> 00:08:05,003
to force General Su Dingfang to submit.

127
00:08:05,003 --> 00:08:06,503
He even took the initiative

128
00:08:06,503 --> 00:08:07,683
to frame him for a crime.

129
00:08:08,723 --> 00:08:10,123
Is Protector-General Qu aware of this?

130
00:08:13,803 --> 00:08:15,963
Someone in the army tipped me off,

131
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:18,363
saying Deputy Director Wang will
send the Chancellor back to Xizhou.

132
00:08:19,643 --> 00:08:22,443
Probably he wanted to use
Qu family's knife to kill people.

133
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:25,523
That's why the two of us rushed back,

134
00:08:25,523 --> 00:08:26,923
so you can be mentally prepared.

135
00:08:30,123 --> 00:08:32,003
Both Protector-General Qu and Minister
are not fools.

136
00:08:32,003 --> 00:08:33,803
How could they be used by others?

137
00:08:34,483 --> 00:08:36,043
It's just the Chancellor is being
remanded back to Xizhou,

138
00:08:36,563 --> 00:08:37,683
saying Protector-General Qu

139
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,203
is afraid of offending those generals.

140
00:08:40,043 --> 00:08:41,583
Even if the decree arrives soon,

141
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,523
what should we do these days?

142
00:08:44,283 --> 00:08:46,843
Protector-General Qu's original intention must be
to avoid making things difficult for Shouyue.

143
00:08:46,843 --> 00:08:48,883
All we need to do is to find him a reason.

144
00:08:56,283 --> 00:08:57,312
I'll take care of it

145
00:08:58,003 --> 00:08:59,283
from here.

146
00:09:01,243 --> 00:09:04,003
Trust me and I'm not going to let
anything happen to Shouyue.

147
00:09:05,803 --> 00:09:07,623
You and Mr. Bai San have had a hard journey,

148
00:09:07,623 --> 00:09:09,123
please go back and rest for now.

149
00:09:10,203 --> 00:09:11,763
Please send my sister
and Mr. Bai San off for me.

150
00:09:11,763 --> 00:09:12,800
Yes.

151
00:09:34,176 --> 00:09:38,944
[Pei's Mansion]

152
00:09:39,603 --> 00:09:40,704
Mr. Bai San.

153
00:09:46,923 --> 00:09:48,003
Is Cheng doing well?

154
00:09:48,643 --> 00:09:49,728
Cheng?

155
00:09:57,803 --> 00:10:00,443
Cheng is staying with the Chancellor,
he's fine.

156
00:10:03,523 --> 00:10:04,576
Thank you.

157
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,232
My lady.

158
00:11:21,203 --> 00:11:22,283
As the wise men once said,

159
00:11:22,843 --> 00:11:24,123
in order for a tree to grow,

160
00:11:24,843 --> 00:11:26,083
its roots must be well-anchored;

161
00:11:26,803 --> 00:11:28,083
for a river to flow far,

162
00:11:28,603 --> 00:11:29,923
its headwaters must be properly dredged;

163
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,243
to hope the nation is content,

164
00:11:32,243 --> 00:11:33,723
righteousness must be practiced;

165
00:11:34,563 --> 00:11:36,843
a nation can be content
without prevalent righteousness,

166
00:11:36,843 --> 00:11:37,963
how is that possible?

167
00:11:38,816 --> 00:11:39,840
Therefore,

168
00:11:40,363 --> 00:11:42,243
in order to restrain those
who obtain high merits,

169
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,243
the former emperor developed
the system of punishment.

170
00:11:45,883 --> 00:11:48,443
Currently, the Commander
of the Congshan Route, Cheng Zhijie,

171
00:11:49,163 --> 00:11:50,603
and Deputy Director Wang Wendu,

172
00:11:51,883 --> 00:11:53,043
have been promoted

173
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,583
and entrusted with the duty of a general.

174
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,263
But they fail to abide
by the law with integrity

175
00:11:57,263 --> 00:11:58,843
to repay His Majesty's grace.

176
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,423
They are greedy, brutal, and indulgent.

177
00:12:00,423 --> 00:12:02,123
Because of their own selfish desires,

178
00:12:02,123 --> 00:12:03,883
they slaughtered within
the walled cities of the Tang dynasty,

179
00:12:04,563 --> 00:12:05,903
killed thousands of people,

180
00:12:05,903 --> 00:12:07,203
and plundered goods without measure,

181
00:12:07,203 --> 00:12:08,443
letting people outside the territory

182
00:12:08,963 --> 00:12:10,283
bear the hatred of a thousand years,

183
00:12:11,043 --> 00:12:12,443
and the honest officials

184
00:12:12,443 --> 00:12:13,803
suffer from an unjust accusation.

185
00:12:14,403 --> 00:12:15,943
They wish to deceive His Majesty,

186
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,923
they are especially condemnable.

187
00:12:18,723 --> 00:12:19,776
My lady.

188
00:12:22,203 --> 00:12:23,243
I beg Your Majesty,

189
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,523
with the great power,

190
00:12:25,523 --> 00:12:27,083
to punish the criminal according to the law,

191
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:29,203
letting people of the Western Regions

192
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:31,563
to feel the grace of Your Majesty.

193
00:12:44,352 --> 00:12:45,408
What's wrong?

194
00:12:46,923 --> 00:12:49,243
My lady, you should take a look outside.

195
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,203
Madam, nice to meet you.

196
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,463
Hearing that the Chancellor is detained,

197
00:13:12,463 --> 00:13:13,683
the people of Xizhou are really indignant,

198
00:13:14,283 --> 00:13:17,443
wanting to go the Protector-General's Mansion
to petition for the Chancellor.

199
00:13:18,163 --> 00:13:19,643
I think this matter is important,

200
00:13:20,483 --> 00:13:22,163
so I want to ask your advice.

201
00:13:22,163 --> 00:13:24,363
- Right. Please give us advice.
- Right.

202
00:13:25,683 --> 00:13:27,083
On behalf of Shouyue, I thank

203
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,203
all your deep affection.

204
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:31,003
You arrived just in time.

205
00:13:31,763 --> 00:13:33,283
I have a favor to ask.

206
00:13:52,403 --> 00:13:54,683
This is a petition written by me,

207
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:58,223
if you can sign this petition,

208
00:13:58,223 --> 00:13:59,663
you could help Shouyue.

209
00:13:59,663 --> 00:14:00,672
No problem.

210
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:02,783
Yes, every household,

211
00:14:02,783 --> 00:14:04,023
regardless of men, women, old or young,

212
00:14:04,023 --> 00:14:06,483
everyone in Xizhou would sign their names.

213
00:14:06,483 --> 00:14:07,823
Right, we'd sign it.

214
00:14:07,823 --> 00:14:10,003
We'd sign it.

215
00:14:10,003 --> 00:14:12,523
We'd sign it.

216
00:14:35,723 --> 00:14:38,503
We'd sign it.

217
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:39,584
Everyone.

218
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:43,003
This petition

219
00:14:43,723 --> 00:14:45,523
will eventually be presented to

220
00:14:45,523 --> 00:14:46,923
His Majesty in Chang'an.

221
00:14:47,843 --> 00:14:49,623
If you sign your names

222
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:50,963
on this petition,

223
00:14:51,563 --> 00:14:53,723
will offend those who frame the Chancellor.

224
00:14:58,643 --> 00:15:00,523
If you could jointly sign it,

225
00:15:00,523 --> 00:15:01,963
I would be grateful.

226
00:15:02,643 --> 00:15:05,843
If you are concerned about
the safety of yourself or your family,

227
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:09,123
I won't mind it either.

228
00:15:26,523 --> 00:15:28,160
Ni, bring the brush pen and ink.

229
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,184
Yes.

230
00:15:29,184 --> 00:15:30,336
No need to bring the brush pen and ink.

231
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:47,803
With the foundation of the people petition,

232
00:16:47,803 --> 00:16:49,903
Protector-General Qu took this as a reason

233
00:16:49,903 --> 00:16:52,963
to release Pei Xingjian home on the second day.

234
00:17:06,963 --> 00:17:08,123
What happened?

235
00:17:08,963 --> 00:17:10,243
How did I hear that the people of Xizhou today

236
00:17:10,243 --> 00:17:12,363
embraced Pei Xingjian
all the way back to Pei's Mansion,

237
00:17:13,363 --> 00:17:14,603
even singing and dancing on the way?

238
00:17:15,603 --> 00:17:16,963
This is outrageous.

239
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,083
Why didn't you care about it?

240
00:17:22,003 --> 00:17:24,263
Didn't Deputy Director Wang notify in advance?

241
00:17:24,263 --> 00:17:26,003
As soon as Pei Xingjian entered Xizhou,

242
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,603
he has to be immediately jailed
and severely interrogated.

243
00:17:28,163 --> 00:17:29,723
Be jailed and severely interrogated?

244
00:17:30,944 --> 00:17:32,083
No way.

245
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,443
What do you mean?

246
00:17:36,163 --> 00:17:37,883
Did Kudi Liuli say something

247
00:17:38,603 --> 00:17:39,843
to Protector-General today,

248
00:17:41,203 --> 00:17:42,683
and you changed your mind?

249
00:17:43,883 --> 00:17:47,243
Now Pei Xingjian is someone
that we cannot touch or interrogate.

250
00:17:48,043 --> 00:17:49,383
Not only me,

251
00:17:49,383 --> 00:17:50,643
but also my father.

252
00:17:53,883 --> 00:17:55,523
If you must know why,

253
00:17:56,203 --> 00:17:57,283
let me show you.

254
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,160
Okay.

255
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,363
Minister.

256
00:18:36,563 --> 00:18:38,003
Mr. Su, you arrived just in time.

257
00:18:38,643 --> 00:18:41,043
Even though I have written a letter
to Deputy Director Wang,

258
00:18:41,043 --> 00:18:43,163
you need to see it

259
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,203
for yourself.

260
00:18:45,723 --> 00:18:46,923
When you get to the camp,

261
00:18:47,443 --> 00:18:49,923
you can tell the Chief Administrator in detail.

262
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:51,648
This is…

263
00:18:52,363 --> 00:18:53,443
This is

264
00:18:53,963 --> 00:18:55,123
the people petition,

265
00:18:55,123 --> 00:18:56,863
which is written

266
00:18:56,863 --> 00:18:58,563
with the blood of the people.

267
00:18:58,563 --> 00:18:59,903
This morning,

268
00:18:59,903 --> 00:19:01,883
Ms. Kudi brought it over,

269
00:19:01,883 --> 00:19:03,103
claiming

270
00:19:03,103 --> 00:19:06,003
if we are to imprison Pei Xingjian,

271
00:19:06,003 --> 00:19:07,323
she would lead

272
00:19:07,323 --> 00:19:09,123
the merchants and monks of Xizhou

273
00:19:09,123 --> 00:19:11,123
holding up this people petition all the way

274
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,083
to Chang'an.

275
00:19:13,763 --> 00:19:15,243
She…

276
00:19:15,243 --> 00:19:17,083
How dare she act so recklessly!

277
00:19:18,483 --> 00:19:20,143
She openly slandered the court officials

278
00:19:20,143 --> 00:19:21,563
and incited the ignorant people.

279
00:19:23,123 --> 00:19:25,303
Why don't you take her to jail immediately?

280
00:19:25,303 --> 00:19:27,403
Are we supposed to be threatened by her?

281
00:19:28,704 --> 00:19:29,728
Mr. Su.

282
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:31,803
You might as well

283
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:35,783
go back to the camp and
report this to Deputy Director Wang.

284
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:38,443
If Deputy Director Wang
wants to take her to jail,

285
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:42,123
then let him send someone to do so.

286
00:19:42,123 --> 00:19:44,843
I will not stop you.

287
00:19:45,883 --> 00:19:46,883
But…

288
00:19:48,643 --> 00:19:50,283
if you want me to take her to jail,

289
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:53,683
I may not dare to.

290
00:19:55,163 --> 00:19:57,223
Now this people petition

291
00:19:57,223 --> 00:19:59,803
is already known to everyone in the city.

292
00:19:59,803 --> 00:20:01,283
If you take her to jail now,

293
00:20:01,923 --> 00:20:03,883
you can't hide it to…

294
00:20:18,003 --> 00:20:19,103
What?

295
00:20:19,103 --> 00:20:20,443
You have been away from
Chang'an for a long time,

296
00:20:20,443 --> 00:20:22,723
maybe there's something you don't know.

297
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:24,283
This Ms. Kudi is very powerful,

298
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:27,643
she has a deep friendship with the queen.

299
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,483
Even the Princess Linhai

300
00:20:29,483 --> 00:20:30,883
could do nothing about her.

301
00:20:31,723 --> 00:20:33,603
She dared to incite people
to write this people petition,

302
00:20:33,603 --> 00:20:35,403
she must have thought of a foolproof plan.

303
00:20:36,363 --> 00:20:37,563
Unless,

304
00:20:42,643 --> 00:20:45,883
you can turn Xizhou into Dadu overnight.

305
00:20:47,123 --> 00:20:48,243
Otherwise,

306
00:20:48,243 --> 00:20:50,783
if anyone dares to touch a hair of hers,

307
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:53,483
everyone in Chang'an will
know about it at once.

308
00:20:54,203 --> 00:20:55,363
In this way,

309
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:58,483
are you going to sit idly by

310
00:20:59,043 --> 00:21:00,963
letting them get away with it?

311
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,563
Mr. Su, do not blame me.

312
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:06,583
I have always been timid.

313
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:07,923
In the past half month,

314
00:21:07,923 --> 00:21:09,743
I think we have
a pretty tight lockdown in Xizhou.

315
00:21:09,743 --> 00:21:11,083
But there are always

316
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,923
some merchants and monks going east.

317
00:21:13,923 --> 00:21:15,763
Who knows if they

318
00:21:15,763 --> 00:21:18,403
would take such a people petition?

319
00:21:19,963 --> 00:21:21,963
If anyone left the city half a month ago

320
00:21:21,963 --> 00:21:23,643
and traveled day and night,

321
00:21:23,643 --> 00:21:24,923
I'm afraid at this moment,

322
00:21:25,443 --> 00:21:27,003
they are already not far from Chang'an.

323
00:21:36,352 --> 00:21:37,376
I…

324
00:21:38,883 --> 00:21:40,483
I'll go and tell the Chief Administrator.

325
00:21:54,683 --> 00:21:55,744
Chongyu.

326
00:21:56,803 --> 00:21:57,963
In your opinion,

327
00:21:59,043 --> 00:22:01,723
could this Ms. Kudi really

328
00:22:02,403 --> 00:22:05,003
send someone to take
another copy of the people petition?

329
00:22:05,883 --> 00:22:08,003
I do not know whether
there is another blood letter.

330
00:22:08,643 --> 00:22:09,723
However, these past two days,

331
00:22:10,523 --> 00:22:12,083
Pei Xingjian's coachman is no longer

332
00:22:12,923 --> 00:22:14,683
in Xizhou.

333
00:22:35,323 --> 00:22:36,416
Come often when you're free.

334
00:22:40,243 --> 00:22:41,312
Come often when you're free.

335
00:22:52,448 --> 00:22:53,523
My lady, rest assured.

336
00:22:53,523 --> 00:22:55,603
My lady, go inside and accompany your husband.

337
00:22:55,603 --> 00:22:57,123
We're here.

338
00:22:57,963 --> 00:22:59,883
Cheng, you've also worked hard.
Go and take some rest.

339
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,400
You give this to me and hurry up to rest.

340
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,603
It's okay.

341
00:23:03,603 --> 00:23:05,723
I spent so much time in the camp with Master,

342
00:23:05,723 --> 00:23:07,123
it's so difficult for me
to come back to see you…

343
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,763
all.

344
00:23:11,763 --> 00:23:13,803
I'm not tired and I'm happy.

345
00:23:18,003 --> 00:23:19,043
I'll leave it to you.

346
00:23:19,563 --> 00:23:20,704
Yes.

347
00:23:25,643 --> 00:23:26,883
Sister.

348
00:23:26,883 --> 00:23:28,123
Dance with me once more.

349
00:23:28,763 --> 00:23:29,903
Lady Yun.

350
00:23:29,903 --> 00:23:31,923
There's a long separation
between My lady and My Master.

351
00:23:31,923 --> 00:23:33,563
You better find someone else to dance with.

352
00:23:36,723 --> 00:23:37,728
Sister.

353
00:23:42,112 --> 00:23:43,203
Tan.

354
00:23:43,203 --> 00:23:45,603
Don't you want to learn to dance?
I'll teach you.

355
00:23:45,603 --> 00:23:46,883
Tan.

356
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,763
I have quite a few holes in this clothes,

357
00:23:48,763 --> 00:23:49,863
could you help me mend them?

358
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:51,163
Thank you for your kind offer, Lady Yun.

359
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,343
I have to mend his clothes. Maybe another day.

360
00:23:53,343 --> 00:23:54,400
Thank you, Tan.

361
00:23:59,123 --> 00:24:00,963
Sanniang, since you're free,

362
00:24:00,963 --> 00:24:02,123
come dance with me.

363
00:24:02,683 --> 00:24:03,712
Lady boss.

364
00:24:05,563 --> 00:24:07,363
I have something to do. I have to go.

365
00:24:10,368 --> 00:24:11,392
Sanniang.

366
00:24:11,963 --> 00:24:13,163
What are you all doing?

367
00:24:13,163 --> 00:24:14,163
Dance.

368
00:24:23,403 --> 00:24:25,443
Today, my brother-in-law came back.

369
00:24:26,763 --> 00:24:27,803
He didn't come either.

370
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,064
Shouyue.

371
00:24:55,123 --> 00:24:56,128
Shouyue.

372
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,768
Shouyue.

373
00:25:05,283 --> 00:25:06,336
Shouyue.

374
00:25:07,616 --> 00:25:08,640
What's wrong?

375
00:25:09,963 --> 00:25:11,723
I have not called you
in over a hundred days and nights.

376
00:25:12,563 --> 00:25:13,963
I'm going to make it up today.

377
00:25:18,912 --> 00:25:19,968
As long as you want to,

378
00:25:20,923 --> 00:25:22,443
I will answer you a thousand times.

379
00:25:33,203 --> 00:25:34,208
Liuli.

380
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,483
I know you're worried about me,

381
00:25:38,592 --> 00:25:39,616
but

382
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:41,443
don't do such silly things next time.

383
00:25:42,723 --> 00:25:44,063
It's just a small cut.

384
00:25:44,063 --> 00:25:45,123
It doesn't hurt much.

385
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,403
You're

386
00:25:49,723 --> 00:25:51,603
putting yourself in danger by doing this.

387
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,083
I return to Xizhou,

388
00:25:55,163 --> 00:25:57,323
at most, I'll be held in
Protector-General's Mansion for a few days.

389
00:25:59,123 --> 00:26:00,403
Protector-General Qu and Minister

390
00:26:01,163 --> 00:26:02,643
will not make it difficult for me.

391
00:26:04,203 --> 00:26:06,043
Why would you want to take that risk?

392
00:26:07,904 --> 00:26:08,992
Furthermore,

393
00:26:09,643 --> 00:26:10,923
if this matter were to be spread out,

394
00:26:11,883 --> 00:26:13,123
it would harm the reputation of the Tang army.

395
00:26:15,003 --> 00:26:16,523
A little mishandling by His Majesty

396
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:18,923
could hurt people of Xizhou.

397
00:26:20,923 --> 00:26:21,923
For me alone,

398
00:26:23,403 --> 00:26:24,603
why would you do so?

399
00:26:26,272 --> 00:26:27,328
Liuli.

400
00:26:28,443 --> 00:26:29,603
Can you promise me

401
00:26:31,243 --> 00:26:33,083
not to act rashly like this in the future?

402
00:26:37,312 --> 00:26:38,464
Shouyue.

403
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:40,883
I have never acted rashly,

404
00:26:40,883 --> 00:26:42,243
I can't promise you either.

405
00:26:43,323 --> 00:26:45,003
I am not you.

406
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,563
I have no ambition.

407
00:26:47,243 --> 00:26:48,723
To me,

408
00:26:48,723 --> 00:26:49,903
reputation,

409
00:26:49,903 --> 00:26:51,483
family, country, His Majesty,

410
00:26:51,483 --> 00:26:53,403
are not as important as your safety.

411
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:55,363
No matter what,

412
00:26:55,923 --> 00:26:57,443
I can't watch you suffer.

413
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,523
If there really is a next time,

414
00:27:00,163 --> 00:27:01,443
I would definitely do it again.

415
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:17,181
[Pei's Mansion]

416
00:27:23,883 --> 00:27:26,483
There is still no word from the camp.

417
00:27:30,003 --> 00:27:31,543
If the decree comes later,

418
00:27:31,543 --> 00:27:32,763
it doesn't matter.

419
00:27:33,363 --> 00:27:34,883
But Ni came back to say

420
00:27:34,883 --> 00:27:37,183
that Master. Mi in the warehouse
of the medicine shop

421
00:27:37,183 --> 00:27:38,483
is about to go crazy from the suppression.

422
00:27:40,363 --> 00:27:41,643
Considering his character,

423
00:27:41,643 --> 00:27:42,723
it's good for him to suppress a bit.

424
00:27:43,803 --> 00:27:45,943
But that Han Si is really amazing,

425
00:27:45,943 --> 00:27:47,683
has such kind of miraculous medicine.

426
00:27:48,843 --> 00:27:50,923
In fact, that medicine is not that miraculous.

427
00:27:50,923 --> 00:27:52,923
It was originally used by doctors,

428
00:27:52,923 --> 00:27:55,883
an antique method used for limb continuation,
bone connecting, or cutting flesh to remove decay.

429
00:27:56,563 --> 00:27:59,243
After taking it, one would fall
into a deep unconscious state,

430
00:27:59,243 --> 00:28:01,743
the breath and heartbeat become slow,

431
00:28:01,743 --> 00:28:03,483
and one would feel no pain at all.

432
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:05,243
It looks frightening.

433
00:28:05,243 --> 00:28:06,903
But if you look closely,

434
00:28:06,903 --> 00:28:08,363
you would definitely know it.

435
00:28:09,643 --> 00:28:12,803
It's just that Han Si tampered
with Master. Mi's body and face,

436
00:28:12,803 --> 00:28:14,643
so his look scared people first,

437
00:28:15,243 --> 00:28:17,683
then he stabbed him in the palm
with a silver needle,

438
00:28:18,203 --> 00:28:20,203
other saw that Master. Mi had no reaction,

439
00:28:20,203 --> 00:28:21,643
of course would believe he's dead.

440
00:28:22,643 --> 00:28:24,483
It's nothing but a deceptive trick, after all.

441
00:28:25,043 --> 00:28:26,323
But that Master. Mi

442
00:28:26,323 --> 00:28:28,623
had been sleeping for more than two days.

443
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,143
I heard from Han Si,

444
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:31,943
he might give him too much dose.

445
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:33,803
It turns out that the dose
for a calf and a human

446
00:28:33,803 --> 00:28:35,243
is somewhat different.

447
00:28:36,963 --> 00:28:39,723
And Sister runs a medicine shop in the city,

448
00:28:39,723 --> 00:28:41,603
there is a vacancy for a resident doctor,

449
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:43,443
so I recommended Han Si.

450
00:28:43,443 --> 00:28:45,003
As time goes by,

451
00:28:45,003 --> 00:28:46,683
looks like they're
having a thing for each other.

452
00:29:25,923 --> 00:29:26,923
It's you.

453
00:29:28,323 --> 00:29:29,983
My lady is held up by something.

454
00:29:29,983 --> 00:29:32,603
She asks you to take the last two days
of homework and do some practice.

455
00:29:32,603 --> 00:29:34,763
She'll come to teach you
drawing when she's done.

456
00:29:35,403 --> 00:29:37,163
She has nothing to do,

457
00:29:37,723 --> 00:29:39,383
but her husband has returned,

458
00:29:39,383 --> 00:29:41,603
so she doesn't want to accompany me.

459
00:29:42,523 --> 00:29:43,723
They are all

460
00:29:43,723 --> 00:29:45,043
in pairs.

461
00:29:45,043 --> 00:29:46,443
I'm all alone,

462
00:29:46,443 --> 00:29:47,763
lonely and miserable.

463
00:29:48,723 --> 00:29:50,223
You misunderstood.

464
00:29:50,223 --> 00:29:52,283
It's Minister Qu coming
to visit the Chancellor.

465
00:29:52,283 --> 00:29:53,843
My lady is with him,

466
00:29:53,843 --> 00:29:55,163
getting held up.

467
00:29:55,163 --> 00:29:56,443
Minister is here?

468
00:29:56,443 --> 00:29:57,632
Yes.

469
00:30:00,992 --> 00:30:02,080
My lady.

470
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:05,152
Minister.

471
00:30:08,443 --> 00:30:09,803
Why didn't you come

472
00:30:10,523 --> 00:30:11,523
to see brother-in-law that day?

473
00:30:11,523 --> 00:30:12,683
Everyone came that day.

474
00:30:12,683 --> 00:30:14,443
It's so lively with singing and dancing.

475
00:30:15,843 --> 00:30:17,963
Yunyi, that doesn't make any sense.

476
00:30:17,963 --> 00:30:19,083
Minister is busy with official duties,

477
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:20,363
why would he come for that?

478
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:25,423
Chancellor, please rest for a few days.

479
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:26,583
No need to worry about official business.

480
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:28,563
I have something to do and must leave now.

481
00:30:35,843 --> 00:30:36,896
I…

482
00:30:43,003 --> 00:30:44,064
Minister.

483
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:47,923
I have something to ask you.

484
00:30:48,443 --> 00:30:49,600
What is it?

485
00:30:57,163 --> 00:30:58,176
I…

486
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,303
I'll leave if you don't mind.

487
00:31:01,303 --> 00:31:03,003
I heard that you don't like women.

488
00:31:08,123 --> 00:31:09,603
Is this true?

489
00:31:13,363 --> 00:31:14,723
Who told you so?

490
00:31:14,723 --> 00:31:16,543
Zhang Minniang told me.

491
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:19,203
She said she was worried that
I would suffer due to unrequited love.

492
00:31:20,043 --> 00:31:21,603
So I want to ask you in person.

493
00:31:22,323 --> 00:31:24,043
Although Zhang Minniang doesn't mean well,

494
00:31:25,043 --> 00:31:26,203
she did help me.

495
00:31:30,643 --> 00:31:31,712
Indeed.

496
00:31:33,203 --> 00:31:34,803
I just don't like women.

497
00:31:34,803 --> 00:31:36,483
What's so good about men?

498
00:31:36,483 --> 00:31:37,843
What's so good about women?

499
00:32:12,603 --> 00:32:13,632
Yunyi.

500
00:32:14,803 --> 00:32:15,872
Yunyi.

501
00:32:17,443 --> 00:32:19,163
You must have seen him clearly this time.

502
00:32:31,123 --> 00:32:32,603
You just went after him,

503
00:32:32,603 --> 00:32:34,283
what did you say to Minister?

504
00:32:34,283 --> 00:32:36,763
Why have you been so distracted
since you got back?

505
00:32:41,363 --> 00:32:42,496
Sister.

506
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,643
Well,

507
00:32:44,523 --> 00:32:46,323
Minister is so handsome

508
00:32:46,323 --> 00:32:47,843
and so intelligent.

509
00:32:48,723 --> 00:32:50,203
Machinery manufacturing,

510
00:32:50,203 --> 00:32:51,763
managing a business,

511
00:32:51,763 --> 00:32:53,243
governing Xizhou,

512
00:32:53,243 --> 00:32:54,523
and benefiting the people,

513
00:32:55,403 --> 00:32:56,483
he knows everything.

514
00:32:57,803 --> 00:33:00,283
But why doesn't he like women?

515
00:33:04,192 --> 00:33:05,248
Sister.

516
00:33:05,843 --> 00:33:06,843
What are you laughing at?

517
00:33:06,843 --> 00:33:07,963
Are you laughing at me?

518
00:33:09,283 --> 00:33:10,563
I am not laughing at you.

519
00:33:11,283 --> 00:33:12,303
Silly girl.

520
00:33:12,303 --> 00:33:14,843
Where did you hear such nonsense?
Don't believe it.

521
00:33:15,443 --> 00:33:16,563
I am not laughing at you.

522
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,663
I just suddenly remembered

523
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:19,963
what happened before.

524
00:33:19,963 --> 00:33:22,003
What happened before? Is it about Minister?

525
00:33:22,643 --> 00:33:24,123
Sister, tell me.

526
00:33:24,883 --> 00:33:27,163
When Minister was a hostage in Chang'an before,

527
00:33:27,163 --> 00:33:29,323
he was entangled by many noble and royal women.

528
00:33:29,323 --> 00:33:30,683
So Minister

529
00:33:30,683 --> 00:33:32,963
made a deliberate act of liking men

530
00:33:32,963 --> 00:33:34,003
to stay away from trouble.

531
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:37,983
Is this true?

532
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:39,523
Absolutely.

533
00:33:40,363 --> 00:33:42,883
In order to let me and Shouyue be worried,

534
00:33:42,883 --> 00:33:46,043
so Minister deliberately expressed
his affection to my cousin, Mr. Mu San.

535
00:33:46,043 --> 00:33:48,443
So Shouyue decided to play along,

536
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,683
planning to send Mr. Mu San to Minister,

537
00:33:50,683 --> 00:33:52,043
Minister was quite scared.

538
00:33:56,603 --> 00:33:57,683
Where are you going to?

539
00:33:58,243 --> 00:33:59,563
I'm going to tell Zhang Minniang

540
00:33:59,563 --> 00:34:00,803
to make sure she doesn't wrong Minister.

541
00:34:39,163 --> 00:34:41,163
My lady, Miss Yun is here,

542
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:42,403
saying it's an urgent matter.

543
00:34:44,043 --> 00:34:45,403
What urgent matter could she possibly have?

544
00:34:46,163 --> 00:34:48,163
Find an excuse to send her away.

545
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,240
Wait.

546
00:34:51,243 --> 00:34:54,443
If she comes again, just reject her.
Don't come to inform me.

547
00:34:55,523 --> 00:34:56,544
Yes.

548
00:35:22,123 --> 00:35:23,163
I heard

549
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:25,743
when Minister was a hostage in Chang'an before,

550
00:35:25,743 --> 00:35:27,803
he was entangled by many noble and royal women.

551
00:35:27,803 --> 00:35:30,823
So Minister made a deliberate act of liking men

552
00:35:30,823 --> 00:35:31,883
to stay away from trouble.

553
00:36:35,043 --> 00:36:36,096
Lady Zhang.

554
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,168
Lady Zhang.

555
00:36:40,384 --> 00:36:41,472
Lady Zhang.

556
00:36:42,243 --> 00:36:43,663
Lady Yun, you are also here.

557
00:36:43,663 --> 00:36:44,843
We really have a fate.

558
00:36:44,843 --> 00:36:47,003
I came to your mansion to look for you
several times, but you weren't there.

559
00:36:47,563 --> 00:36:48,883
Why do you come to me?

560
00:36:48,883 --> 00:36:50,163
I wanted to tell you

561
00:36:50,163 --> 00:36:52,523
last time you told me Minister likes men,

562
00:36:52,523 --> 00:36:53,643
it was a misunderstanding.

563
00:36:54,243 --> 00:36:55,923
She said Minister likes men.

564
00:36:57,243 --> 00:36:58,803
I didn't tell you that before.

565
00:36:58,803 --> 00:37:00,683
Why are you slandering Minister and me?

566
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,603
Lady Zhang.

567
00:37:04,243 --> 00:37:06,323
It's what you said last time
in the courtyard of Village Mayor Zhou.

568
00:37:06,323 --> 00:37:07,643
Did you forget it?

569
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:08,763
I wanted to tell you

570
00:37:08,763 --> 00:37:11,043
it's not good for Minister's reputation

571
00:37:11,043 --> 00:37:12,723
to spread such rumors like this.

572
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,803
My lady.

573
00:37:14,803 --> 00:37:15,904
Lady Zhang.

574
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,023
Yunyi.

575
00:37:17,023 --> 00:37:18,443
I tried to reason you properly,

576
00:37:18,443 --> 00:37:19,483
why did you push me?

577
00:37:20,443 --> 00:37:22,483
It's bleeding. You are bleeding a lot.

578
00:37:22,483 --> 00:37:24,503
What are you still doing?
Hurry and report to Minister.

579
00:37:24,503 --> 00:37:25,643
Yes, yes.

580
00:37:26,243 --> 00:37:27,243
She's bleeding.

581
00:37:45,683 --> 00:37:48,123
I really, really didn't push Zhang Minniang.

582
00:37:48,123 --> 00:37:49,403
I just wanted to tell her

583
00:37:49,403 --> 00:37:51,083
Minister does not like men.

584
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:55,283
Lady Zhang is a noblewoman in Xizhou.

585
00:37:55,283 --> 00:37:57,363
Why would she intentionally frame you?

586
00:37:58,123 --> 00:38:00,563
Is there some kind of misunderstanding?

587
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:03,363
You don't trust me?

588
00:38:03,363 --> 00:38:04,643
I…

589
00:38:04,643 --> 00:38:05,683
Sister, what about you?

590
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:07,763
Do you also trust Zhang Minniang
and not trust me?

591
00:38:08,683 --> 00:38:11,683
I swear I really, really didn't push her.

592
00:38:11,683 --> 00:38:13,803
Yes, I certainly trust you.

593
00:38:17,483 --> 00:38:20,563
Were there people around
who could testify for you?

594
00:38:22,723 --> 00:38:23,963
The one who can testify

595
00:38:23,963 --> 00:38:25,683
is only Zhang Minniang's maid.

596
00:38:27,923 --> 00:38:29,023
Don't worry.

597
00:38:29,023 --> 00:38:31,283
You said Zhang Minniang
can still shout and yell

598
00:38:31,283 --> 00:38:32,543
after falling down,

599
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:34,683
I think the fall is not serious.

600
00:38:35,323 --> 00:38:36,923
Let's bring a doctor and supplements

601
00:38:36,923 --> 00:38:38,383
to visit Zhang Minniang.

602
00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:40,223
Make a big deal small.

603
00:38:40,223 --> 00:38:42,283
What? I didn't push her at all.

604
00:38:42,283 --> 00:38:44,823
She wronged me. Why are we going to visit her?

605
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,163
She's a noblewoman in Xizhou,

606
00:38:46,163 --> 00:38:47,983
also a relative of the Qu family.

607
00:38:47,983 --> 00:38:49,483
We could not just leave her.

608
00:38:50,363 --> 00:38:52,423
The necessary courtesies must be observed.

609
00:38:52,423 --> 00:38:53,443
I promise you

610
00:38:53,443 --> 00:38:54,723
I never let you be wronged.

611
00:38:54,723 --> 00:38:55,883
Do you trust me?

612
00:39:01,323 --> 00:39:02,464
I…

613
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,243
Ni, go get Physician Han.

614
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:08,243
Ask him to accompany us to Zhang's Mansion.

615
00:39:08,243 --> 00:39:09,344
Yes.

616
00:39:31,043 --> 00:39:32,443
You are not seriously injured.

617
00:39:33,843 --> 00:39:35,483
How does your maid serve her duties?

618
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:38,083
The word got around quite a bit.

619
00:39:38,723 --> 00:39:39,983
You don't know that.

620
00:39:39,983 --> 00:39:42,323
When Yunyi pushed My lady,

621
00:39:42,323 --> 00:39:43,523
how ruthless she was.

622
00:39:44,163 --> 00:39:46,063
Thankfully, My lady has a light body,

623
00:39:46,063 --> 00:39:47,683
but she still injured her arm

624
00:39:47,683 --> 00:39:48,963
and lost so much blood.

625
00:39:48,963 --> 00:39:50,208
It hurts.

626
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:51,328
My lady.

627
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,912
My lady.

628
00:39:58,323 --> 00:39:59,323
For no reason at all,

629
00:40:00,683 --> 00:40:02,003
why would Yunyi push you?

630
00:40:03,563 --> 00:40:04,883
It's not for no reason.

631
00:40:05,843 --> 00:40:07,443
T-That Yunyi

632
00:40:07,443 --> 00:40:09,323
heard some rumors

633
00:40:10,123 --> 00:40:12,003
that you like men,

634
00:40:12,003 --> 00:40:14,023
so she ran to ask My lady for verification.

635
00:40:14,023 --> 00:40:15,203
My lady

636
00:40:15,203 --> 00:40:16,763
couldn't stand someone slandering you,

637
00:40:16,763 --> 00:40:18,243
so she earnestly advised her.

638
00:40:18,243 --> 00:40:19,943
There are many worshippers
in the Great Buddha Temple,

639
00:40:19,943 --> 00:40:21,603
how could she say something like this,

640
00:40:21,603 --> 00:40:23,343
spreading the rumor about you

641
00:40:23,343 --> 00:40:24,763
and damaging your reputation?

642
00:40:25,363 --> 00:40:27,083
Yunyi refused to listen to it,

643
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:29,243
but also argued with My lady
at the top of her voice.

644
00:40:29,883 --> 00:40:31,463
She got so angry

645
00:40:31,463 --> 00:40:32,723
because she couldn't convince My lady,

646
00:40:32,723 --> 00:40:34,403
so she pushed My lady to the ground.

647
00:40:44,683 --> 00:40:46,683
Madam, please wait a moment.

648
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,616
Shut up.

649
00:40:52,323 --> 00:40:54,043
Don't stir up trouble in front of Minister.

650
00:40:54,643 --> 00:40:56,263
Yunyi is the sister
of the lady of the Chancellor,

651
00:40:56,263 --> 00:40:58,263
she knows the rules and etiquette well.

652
00:40:58,263 --> 00:40:59,923
Why would she hurt me on purpose?

653
00:41:00,483 --> 00:41:02,603
It's just a momentary mistake.

654
00:41:02,603 --> 00:41:03,744
I…

655
00:41:06,563 --> 00:41:07,683
That's not true.

656
00:41:08,443 --> 00:41:09,523
I did not push you at all.

657
00:41:09,523 --> 00:41:10,763
Why would you lie to frame me?

658
00:41:13,203 --> 00:41:16,043
I-I was just explaining to Minister

659
00:41:16,043 --> 00:41:17,723
that you didn't push me on purpose.

660
00:41:18,283 --> 00:41:19,403
Pardon me.

661
00:41:23,723 --> 00:41:25,443
I've heard about what happened

662
00:41:25,443 --> 00:41:26,563
at the Great Buddha Temple today.

663
00:41:27,123 --> 00:41:28,583
So I brought a doctor here.

664
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:30,003
No matter who is right or wrong,

665
00:41:30,003 --> 00:41:31,803
it's crucial to treat
Lady Zhang's injuries first.

666
00:41:32,643 --> 00:41:35,723
How can you not care about
who's right or wrong, Sister?

667
00:41:35,723 --> 00:41:37,403
I must speak to her face to face

668
00:41:37,403 --> 00:41:38,803
to make things clear,

669
00:41:38,803 --> 00:41:40,883
and not allow her to slander me
in front of Minister.

670
00:41:41,443 --> 00:41:42,483
Be patient and stay calm.

671
00:41:43,232 --> 00:41:44,323
I trust you.

672
00:41:52,923 --> 00:41:54,283
I trust what Lady Yun said.

673
00:41:58,643 --> 00:42:01,003
I have examined Lady Yun's injuries,
and they are not serious.

674
00:42:01,003 --> 00:42:03,243
No need to trouble your doctor.

675
00:42:03,243 --> 00:42:04,363
Please get back.

676
00:42:12,643 --> 00:42:14,163
It's not a big deal.

677
00:42:14,843 --> 00:42:16,643
I just suffered a minor injury.

678
00:42:16,643 --> 00:42:18,403
It's all my maid's fault

679
00:42:18,403 --> 00:42:20,363
to bother Minister and Madam Kudi.

680
00:42:21,003 --> 00:42:22,163
I'm so sorry.

681
00:42:28,163 --> 00:42:29,663
Minister is smart,

682
00:42:29,663 --> 00:42:31,583
and Lady Zhang is tolerant.

683
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:33,523
It seems as if I failed to
teach my sister properly.

684
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:41,568
♫ I write my longing for you in Spring ♫

685
00:42:43,648 --> 00:42:48,096
