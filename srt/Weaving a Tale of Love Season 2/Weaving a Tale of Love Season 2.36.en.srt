[Weaving A Tale of Love 2]

2
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:36,180
[Episode 36]

3
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,820
Now, I pledge my loyalty to the nation,

4
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,776
willing to sacrifice my life.

5
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,340
If anyone dares to defame me in the future,

6
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,560
bringing unjust accusations upon my Father,

7
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,780
I promise that the Su family will face

8
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,340
dire consequences in Chang'an.

9
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,780
Your entire bloodline will be eradicated.

10
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,540
What absurdity are you spouting?

11
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,700
If you don't believe it,

12
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,180
go ahead and try me!

13
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,320
As Minister possesses such ambition,

14
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,660
I am prepared to lead three hundred
skilled soldiers

15
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,660
to bolster Minister.

16
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,020
Remember,

17
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,780
they are colluding with the commander
of Khan Xingxiwang.

18
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,060
If they join forces,

19
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,400
how should we handle this?

20
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,500
If that's the case,

21
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,144
so what?

22
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,320
his time, we bring troops to Xizhou

23
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,780
to expose the collusion

24
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,740
between the Qu family and the rebels.

25
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,900
If this plan comes to fruition,

26
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,460
Chief Administrator
will have sufficient grounds

27
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,940
to take many lives.

28
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,660
However, we only have limited manpower.

29
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,500
If he brings those five thousand
northern cavalry…

30
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Don't panic.

31
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,460
Xizhou is easy to defend
but difficult to conquer.

32
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,380
As long as we have hundreds of
skilled soldiers guarding it,

33
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,780
we can ensure the city's safety.

34
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,700
Additionally,

35
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,540
we still have Governor Qu under our control.

36
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,780
I bet those Xizhou garrison soldiers

37
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,460
wouldn't dare to resist easily.

38
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,700
I will embark on this journey
with three hundred skilled soldiers

39
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,680
merely to prevent them
from smuggling treasures in secret

40
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,980
to bribe the Northern soldiers to retreat

41
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,020
or to

42
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,220
bluff and falsely claim victory.

43
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,580
He is willing to issue a military order
either way.

44
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,780
If he fails to break the siege this time,

45
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,380
he will find himself in a fatal situation.

46
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,660
If he does break the siege,

47
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,000
how many of the villagers he leads

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,100
will be left to return?

49
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,340
It is up to us

50
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,540
how to deal with him then.

51
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,460
Master, all we need to do today

52
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,240
is destroy all the token seals

53
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,500
found in the Governor's Mansion,

54
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,020
leaving them no chance
to report to the Emperor.

55
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,152
That's all.

56
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,820
Have you worked it out yet?

57
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,620
Do you wish to accompany me in solving

58
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,780
the siege of Tingzhou or not?

59
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,140
With Minister Qu's willingness
to issue a military order,

60
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,180
I will naturally place my trust in you.

61
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,224
Wait a minute.

62
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,020
How can you leave me out of the equation?

63
00:04:40,768 --> 00:04:41,856
I have a plan.

64
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,820
It may allow us to resolve the predicament

65
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,140
in Tingzhou without shedding blood.

66
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,860
Su Nanjin

67
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,460
suffered from us reporting to the Emperor.

68
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,520
Last night, he tirelessly searched

69
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,880
the Governor's Mansion

70
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,520
and discovered various tokens and seals.
He promptly destroyed them,

71
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,540
severing our communication channels
with the imperial court.

72
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,340
We will set off early tomorrow.

73
00:05:31,872 --> 00:05:32,980
Within a day's time, you and Chongyu

74
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,900
must organize a hundred large carts
and gather five hundred warriors.

75
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,260
The time is really a bit hurried.

76
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,900
I have gotten Xiao Tan to prepare food,

77
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,120
giving it to Cheng to carry.

78
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,140
You are not allowed to be hungry.

79
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,140
Do you hear me?

80
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,216
Don't worry.

81
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,340
I will surely return unscathed.

82
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,340
Today, I shall visit the Great Buddha Temple

83
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,620
to recite scriptures and pray for you.

84
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,940
I will bring back a protective charm.

85
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,900
If I happen to return late,
you may go to sleep without waiting up for me.

86
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,820
You never believe in these things.

87
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,340
I'm just a woman with no strength.

88
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,000
I can't put on armor and follow you into battle

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,100
or gather chariots and warriors for you.

90
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,540
If you won't let me go and get a blessing
from the temple,

91
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,240
to ask for a protective charm for you,

92
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,540
isn't it obvious I'm not of much help here?

93
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,408
My dear Liuli,

94
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,620
even though you're a woman,

95
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,660
you've got more guts

96
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,260
and smarts than a lot of guys I know.

97
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,220
I can tell

98
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,260
something's bothering you.

99
00:06:27,872 --> 00:06:28,992
It's okay.

100
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,848
Go if you really want to.

101
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,580
Just make sure to come back early.

102
00:07:09,152 --> 00:07:13,888
[Su's Mansion]

103
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,980
Master,

104
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,920
Pei Xingjian and Qu Chongyu

105
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,260
worked through last night,

106
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,260
and now they've got like four or five hundred

107
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,540
huge carts full of provisions.

108
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,860
And this Qu Chongyu guy,

109
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,180
he promised he'd

110
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,460
break the siege at Tingzhou.

111
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,860
They have only managed to get a little over
500 troops together from Xizhou,

112
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,820
but they're up against 5000 trained soldiers
from the North.

113
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,300
What is he planning to do?

114
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,260
Chongyu, don't worry.

115
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,700
Your sister and I have got things
covered here at home.

116
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,576
Moreover,

117
00:08:16,576 --> 00:08:18,400
Governor can always take a breather
back at his place.

118
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,940
Don't worry about what's going on at home.

119
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,580
Those Mukun people really are something.

120
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,380
They dare not trouble Chief Administrator,

121
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,860
but they sure like to stir up trouble
in Tingzhou.

122
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,580
But they are nothing more than cowards.

123
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,140
When you drive them away,

124
00:08:30,688 --> 00:08:31,720
perhaps

125
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,340
you can even return to celebrate the festival
and have sticky rice balls with me.

126
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,460
Then you should leave some for me, okay?

127
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:35,136
[Pei's Mansion]

128
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,860
I've got a package for you

129
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,360
with some clean clothes

130
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,040
and new shoes and socks I made myself.

131
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,940
Remember to try them on
and see whether they fit

132
00:09:52,672 --> 00:09:53,728
Do not worry.

133
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,540
I know people in all 10 tribes in the North,

134
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,180
so it should be a safe trip to Tingzhou.

135
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,620
Although it's sunny today,

136
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,740
it's still a bit cold.

137
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,220
Have a bowl of ginger soup after you go back.

138
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,912
And don't forget to take your medicine.

139
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,980
You can't catch a cold again this year.

140
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,552
Okay.

141
00:10:13,568 --> 00:10:14,624
Liuli,

142
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,980
I can't be with you for the new year this year,

143
00:10:18,944 --> 00:10:20,064
but at the Lantern Festival,

144
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,060
I will certainly bring back good news.

145
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,224
I'll be waiting for you.

146
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,180
Senior Official Pei's carriage

147
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,740
just looked great,

148
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,940
so many broke down on the road
after just one day.

149
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,180
We had to camp out way earlier than planned.

150
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,500
At this rate,

151
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,100
it'll take us at least half a month

152
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,380
to reach Tingzhou.

153
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,060
Master,

154
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,700
these are the shoes that
Madame specifically made for you.

155
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,896
Please put them on.

156
00:12:13,664 --> 00:12:14,912
Token of passage.

157
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,300
Today, I shall visit the Great Buddha Temple

158
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,580
to recite scriptures and pray for you.

159
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,780
will bring back a protective charm.

160
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,780
lf I happen to return late
you may go to sleep without waiting up for me.

161
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,740
You never believe in these things

162
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,580
What is actually going on?

163
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,520
I still have matters to discuss with Shouyue.

164
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,100
Is there something
you can't say in front of him?

165
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,620
Madam, what's the matter?

166
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,260
I have concealed something from Shouyue.

167
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,220
That's why I asked Yunyi
to invite Minister over,

168
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,220
so we can have a word in private.

169
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,880
Madam, what have you been keeping from Shouyue?

170
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,660
I would like to hear the details.

171
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,540
I wish to get a protective charm

172
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,740
for Shouyue and Minister.

173
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,360
but I can't get a protective charm

174
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,940
all by myself.

175
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,140
I need your help.

176
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,020
What's it about the protective charm,

177
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,100
and why does it have to be a secret
from Shouyue?

178
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,980
Shouyue is a great guy and all,

179
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,540
but he's just too strict about following rules.

180
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,340
Things are pretty pressing right now,

181
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,260
and sometimes
you've got to do what's necessary in a crunch.

182
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,980
For someone like Shouyue,

183
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,380
if he knew about this,

184
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,540
I'm afraid he might not agree.

185
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,380
So, I had to act first and tell him later.

186
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,840
I decided to meet Minister privately

187
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,060
to get this protective charm first.

188
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,620
I want to ask

189
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,900
what exactly is this protective charm.

190
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,512
Token of passage.

191
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,104
Token of passage.

192
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,680
But Madam, you may not know about this,

193
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,300
but Su Nanjin has already worked overnight

194
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,100
and destroyed all my tokens of passage.

195
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,180
Now, I can't get even one.

196
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,700
If you have token of passage,

197
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,820
I wouldn't have to worry.

198
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,980
Please lend me a few craftsmen immediately

199
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,800
who are skilled in crafting delicate objects.

200
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
These people have to be not only skillful

201
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,420
but also undyingly loyal to you.

202
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,300
Are you planning to fabricate it privately?

203
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,460
The problem is
that I don't have the mode for that.

204
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,340
Even if someone's craftsmanship is exquisite,

205
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,940
he can't do much without the mode.

206
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,900
To tell you the truth,

207
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,500
I have prepared for this matter long ago.

208
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,980
Previously, I hid this from Shouyue

209
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,000
and secretly made a mode of token of passage.

210
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,140
I just did not expect

211
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,360
that I would need to use it

212
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,540
so soon.

213
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,220
Another thing being hidden from Shouyue.

214
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,256
However,

215
00:14:40,256 --> 00:14:41,280
Madam,

216
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,220
you've come through for us big time again.

217
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,380
So this is the protective charm
that you got for me

218
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,180
Is the token of passage
something you can casually make?

219
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,100
You even give four pieces.

220
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,620
I don't know how many you have made.

221
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,860
Hurry up.

222
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,000
Okay.

223
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,060
Make sure it's tight.

224
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,176
Okay.

225
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:11,200
Make sure it's tight.

226
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,620
- Okay.
- Now, tighter.

227
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,904
Cheng.

228
00:15:22,848 --> 00:15:23,904
Master.

229
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,620
You bring several experienced carters

230
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,580
to gather the carts from behind.

231
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,180
Bring back those that can be fixed to the camp.

232
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,220
When you come back,
I'm afraid it's too late for hot meals.

233
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,980
There is some food in the saddlebag.

234
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,820
This pot of wine is for you.

235
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,940
Make sure to deliver he memorial to Chang'an

236
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,300
before the Lantern Festival.

237
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,800
Master, rest assured.

238
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,856
Go ahead.

239
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,460
Giddyap. Giddyap. Giddyap.

240
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,140

241
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,300
Giddyap. Giddyap.

242
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,328
Giddyap. Giddyap.

243
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,440
Stop.

244
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,100
Stop. Stop. Stop.

245
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,220
All of you, follow the orders of the Master.

246
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,580
- Take the repaired carts back to the camp.
- Yes.

247
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,780
Giddyap. Giddyap. Giddyap.

248
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,000
Giddyap. Giddyap. Giddyap.

249
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,088
Giddyap.

250
00:16:37,088 --> 00:16:38,208
Giddyap.

251
00:16:42,048 --> 00:16:43,104
Giddyap.

252
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,104
Stop.

253
00:16:52,896 --> 00:16:57,536
[Post House]

254
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,944
I'm coming.

255
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,980
It's pretty late.

256
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:10,464
I'm here for urgent official business.

257
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,900
Bring me the fastest horse in your post house.

258
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,580
Please wait a moment.
I'll go get the horse right away.

259
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,392
Hurry up.

260
00:17:29,696 --> 00:17:34,336
[One month later]

261
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,800
Have a seat quickly

262
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,580
Have a cup of hot tea to warm your body.

263
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,080
I just prepared New Year gifts
for several families.

264
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,420
You guys can go after taking some rest.

265
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,900
My lady, when we were at An Family,

266
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,660
I heard that the merchants were all discussing

267
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,460
the battles in Kunling and Tingzhou.

268
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,500
Is there any news?

269
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,180
Some merchants who returned from Qiuci
a few days ago.

270
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,880
heard some news.

271
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,580
They say that Su Haizheng is
together with Khan Jiwangjue

272
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,440
hunting down the troops of five tribes.

273
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,500
One tribe was subdued before the new year.

274
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,760
Now they are still chasing the other two.

275
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,340
It is said that the pillage
was extremely ruthless.

276
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,140
All the grain carts that followed are now
full of gold and silver utensils

277
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,500
How is the crisis in Tingzhou?

278
00:18:33,408 --> 00:18:34,500
The day before,

279
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,780
when the Northerners attacked Tingzhou,

280
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,400
Bai San led the team to burn their provisions.

281
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,020
The crisis in Tingzhou has been eased.

282
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,900
Now, it's snowing.

283
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,540
Presumably, these Northerners will
retreat soon.

284
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,060
How could Bai San calculate
such a delicate timing?

285
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,060
It must be Mr. Pei.

286
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,700
Shouyue's been learning from the top master.

287
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,580
He masters in the law of astronomy
and chronology.

288
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,460
He is using reinforcements to delay time.

289
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,820
Just waiting for this snow.

290
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,620
Now, everyone says that Khan Xingxiwang
was wrongfully killed.

291
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,540
That's why his subordinates would besiege
Tingzhou and massacre the Tang people.

292
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,140
The merchants from the North are all mad,

293
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,200
saying Chief Administrator and Khan Jiwangjue

294
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,420
will surely be retributed.

295
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,920
But now,

296
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,380
how come these people from Tingzhou
suffered the retribution?

297
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,820
No one knows when this war can end.

298
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,060
When will Master

299
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,900
and Cheng come back?

300
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,300
Shouyue got the tokens of passage I made

301
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,620
The memorial against Su Haizheng and his son
should have been sent already.

302
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,260
Shouyue just needs to keep Su Nanjin busy

303
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,980
while waiting for the feedback.

304
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,460
I wonder how the court will deal with
these damned people.

305
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,544
Liuli.

306
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,184
Liuli.

307
00:19:53,184 --> 00:19:54,660
The soldiers Su Nanjin left
at the Governor's Mansion

308
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,340
are absolutely outrageous.

309
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,400
Today,

310
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,780
they even blocked all the festival gifts

311
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,100
for the Governor's Mansion out.

312
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,460
Yunyi,

313
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,460
let's take care of those troubles today.

314
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,824
This is a good idea.

315
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,944
Guys, hold it there.

316
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,896
Who are you?

317
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,980
Why are you blocking the door
of the Governor's Mansion?

318
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,260
I am a guard working for Chief Administrator.

319
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,380
I am ordered to guard here.

320
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,100
Not to let idlers and others

321
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,420
disturb the Governor's rest.

322
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,820
You better leave quickly.

323
00:20:44,928 --> 00:20:45,984
Is that so?

324
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,180
Show me the order from Chief Administrator.

325
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,300
Let me have a look.

326
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,380
These are the instructions given
by Young Master Su before his departure.

327
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,380
There is no written order.

328
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,020
Su Nanjin? Who does he think he is?

329
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,100
Since when Xizhou needs

330
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,900
a nobody like him to give orders?

331
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,240
Since you don't have the order
from Chief Administrator,

332
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,720
just get out of my way.

333
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,980
Otherwise, you'll suffer the consequences.

334
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,952
Get out of the way.

335
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,860
Young Master has an order

336
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,820
Anyone who dares to disobey the order
and trespasses the Governor's Mansion

337
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,968
will be killed without mercy.

338
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,500
Will be killed without mercy?

339
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,820
Then do it.

340
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,900
Don't harm My lady.

341
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,160
How dare you?

342
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,420
How dare you?

343
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,256
Yunyi.

344
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,432
You dare to hurt me.

345
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,240
Are you okay?

346
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,140
Madam Kudi, what happened?

347
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,460
Captain Lin,

348
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,860
these brazen people

349
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,220
know full well that the Nishu Tribe
is working for Chief Administrator.

350
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,040
Yet, in broad daylight,

351
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,460
they hurt the younger sister
of the Nishu Tribe's Irkin.

352
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,440
If the soldiers of the Nishu Tribe
learn of this

353
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,260
and think it was ordered by
Chief Administrator,

354
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,376
what should we do then?

355
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,820
Captain Lin must capture these lunatics

356
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,960
to give an explanation to the Nishu Tribe,

357
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,700
so as not to hurt
the officers and soldiers' feelings.

358
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,952
I understand.

359
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,660
Take down these people for me.

360
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,340
How dare you frame us?

361
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,940
What do you mean by 'frame'?

362
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,820
Chief Administrator and Mr. Su

363
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,940
know these methods best.

364
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,700
You should also be very clear, right?

365
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,060
All I know is that there is such thing
as 'retribution' in this world.

366
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,820
You can try it today if you dare.

367
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,900
Let's see if this retribution will fall on you.

368
00:23:35,616 --> 00:23:47,360
[Tingzhou]

369
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,696
Giddyap.

370
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,712
Giddyap.

371
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,304
Stop.

372
00:23:58,656 --> 00:23:59,820
Report to Tudun.

373
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,160
A large convoy of grain carts appeared
in the valley of the Yimo.

374
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,380
But…

375
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,380
What happened?

376
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,500
It's just that I am incapable,

377
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,740
and I got caught squarely by them.

378
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,840
The leader is the Chancellor of Xizhou,
Pei Xingjian.

379
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,300
He asked me to bring a message.

380
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,620
He will meet you with provisions himself.

381
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,576
Giddyap.

382
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,696
Stop.

383
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,776
Stop.

384
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,860
Tudun, Generals, it's been a long time
since we last met.

385
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,400
Indeed, it has been a long time
since I've gone hunting and drinking

386
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,420
with Chancellor Pei.

387
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,460
I didn't know it was you,

388
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,144
so I came presumptuously.

389
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,820
But…

390
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,860
No need to explain.

391
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,580
About what happened before,

392
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,700
I've heard a bit about it.

393
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,824
This time,

394
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,740
I want to make a deal with Tudun.

395
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,740
The provisions at your headquarters
have been burned out by me.

396
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,060
Do you want the five hundred carts of
provisions escorted by me?

397
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,140
I am willing to give these

398
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,740
five hundred carts of provisions to you.

399
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,020
But there are two things

400
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,100
I need your help with.

401
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,820
You really are a straightforward person.

402
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,220
I will not beat around the bush
with Chancellor Pei then.

403
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,760
The death of Khan Xingxiwang

404
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,280
and the Irkin Wuxing

405
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,420
were all caused by Su Haizheng.

406
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,220
For such deep hatred and resentment,

407
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,580
we can't just let go.

408
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,980
Besides, the Tang army burned our provisions
some days ago.

409
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,580
These provisions carts you had

410
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:48,820
are now the livelihood reliance
of our tribesmen and warhorses.

411
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,020
If your request is a private matter,

412
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,340
with the favor you have shown us,

413
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,120
we will not hesitate to respond,

414
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,740
but if it concerns the Tang,

415
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,900
it's better if you don't bring it up,

416
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,980
so as not to hurt our friendship.

417
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,980
The matter I want to bring up

418
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,860
happens to be a personal matter.

419
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,900
There's something Tudun doesn't know.

420
00:26:09,696 --> 00:26:10,752
I

421
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,060
have a good relationship with
the Prefectural Governor of Tingzhou.

422
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,060
Senior Official,

423
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,980
it's not us who wants to kill him.

424
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,020
Actually,

425
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,660
he really did not want to live anymore.

426
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,580
I am already aware of this matter.

427
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,140
Prefectural Governor Lai sacrificed himself
for the country.

428
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,900
It was his long-cherished wish.

429
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,340
It is just that his body

430
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,100
remains in the camp at Tudun.

431
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,288
Mr. Pei

432
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,180
want to ask you to return it,

433
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,700
so that Prefectural Governor Lai's soul
may return to his homeland.

434
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,900
Pei is endlessly grateful.

435
00:26:40,672 --> 00:26:41,760
Okay.

436
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,460
This matter will proceed as you wish.

437
00:26:45,152 --> 00:26:46,160
What is the second matter

438
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,820
Chancellor Pei mentioned?

439
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,720
Tudun needs to know

440
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,140
losing provisions

441
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,400
to the hands of enemies

442
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,500
is a serious crime.

443
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,840
Chief Administrator Su

444
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,860
is eager to take my life.

445
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,800
If so, in the presence of His Majesty,

446
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,180
I cannot defend himself,

447
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,500
but if the provisions are

448
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,660
given to the autonomous prefectures of Tang,

449
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,540
it'll clear up this misunderstanding.

450
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,700
Then, this matter

451
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,780
wouldn't be a big issue.

452
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,384
So I hope

453
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,340
Tutun and all the generals can
temporarily return

454
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,820
after collecting the provisions,

455
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,820
waiting for the court

456
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,500
handling of Chief Administrator Su.

457
00:27:26,016 --> 00:27:27,136
Then, you can make a decision again.

458
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,260
Pei Xingjian wants me to

459
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,940
let go of this and

460
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,560
not take this opportunity

461
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,020
to vie for the Khan's position.

462
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,620
He wants me to continue to be
the governor of an autonomous prefecture.

463
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,220
If that's the case,

464
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,140
why would I even come to Tingzhou?

465
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,380
Tudun.

466
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,620
Please do not take offense at Pei's abruptness.

467
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,060
There is no perfect solution in the world.

468
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,980
If you

469
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,400
want to take the provisions

470
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,500
and immediately muster troops.

471
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,500
There is nothing I can do about it.

472
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,300
It's just I'll be destined to die either way.

473
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,220
I would rather burn these provisions

474
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,540
and die at your hands

475
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,860
than being victimized by Chief Administrator Su
with fabricated charges and

476
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,968
die a wrongful death.

477
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,760
In the river valley behind me,

478
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,420
my people are prepared to set fire
and abandon the vehicle.

479
00:28:21,696 --> 00:28:22,720
Today,

480
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,000
if Tutun does not accept these provisions,

481
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,860
it would be better to take my life

482
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,700
to fulfill my lifetime reputation.

483
00:28:38,336 --> 00:28:39,360
I, Pei Xingjian

484
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,660
guarantee to you all with my life that

485
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,040
within ten days,

486
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,380
Su Haizheng will surely withdraw troops ad

487
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,300
will never infringe upon your tribes again.

488
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,460
And the Tang court will

489
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,820
absolutely not allow him to act recklessly.

490
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,860
Guys,

491
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,460
as long as you won't raise
troops to rebel against the Tang,

492
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,660
I will

493
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,380
ensure everyone's safety.

494
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,816
Duzhi.

495
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,860
Senior Official Pei has a reputation for
holding execution to his words.

496
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,900
I dare not disbelieve.

497
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,540
Since today you have kindly gifted us
with provisions,

498
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,140
we naturally wouldn't want to
make it difficult for you.

499
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,260
We will return to our base first.

500
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,960
As for the court.

501
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,720
When can they vindicate
the Khan's unjust accusation and

502
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,260
make the prime culprit be brought to justice?

503
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,260
We will wait and see.

504
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,140
Thank you, Tudun.

505
00:29:43,008 --> 00:29:44,064
I certainly

506
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,140
won't let you all down.

507
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,080
See you.

508
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,660
Take a look.

509
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,680
Move aside please.

510
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,380
Move aside.

511
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,380
Come again next time.

512
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,448
Excuse me.

513
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,900
Madam is here.

514
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,920
Madam,

515
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,300
if only it weren't for my inconvenient legs,

516
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,920
I should have personally visited you

517
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,660
to properly thank you.

518
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,880
Have a seat.

519
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,980
You are too polite, Governor Qu.

520
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,340
How could I let you take a personal trip to me?

521
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,180
But I think

522
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,760
your complexion does seem much better.

523
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,380
Yes. Right.

524
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,580
Madam, a few days ago,

525
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,620
you helped me remove those soldiers
guarding the door.

526
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,980
This shortness of breath problem of mine

527
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,380
got better all of a sudden,

528
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,100
so naturally, my body also felt a lot better.

529
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,780
Please have a seat.

530
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,840
I can even take more food

531
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,780
for dinner now.

532
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,392
The troops have retreated.

533
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,860
The troops have retreated.
The troops have retreated.

534
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,180
The northern troops have retreated.

535
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,540
What you're saying is all over the place.

536
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,584
What actually happened?

537
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,180
What's the situation? Tell us quickly.

538
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,700
Let me catch my breath.

539
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,240
This time, we have over a thousand soldiers.

540
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,480
According to Chancellor Pei's plan,
the troops are divided into three routes.

541
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,600
One went to Fuyan to burn the provisions,

542
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,700
leaving the North with no provisions
to survive the winter.

543
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,420
The second one heads to Tingzhou
to harass the enemy,

544
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,840
preventing them from sieging the city.

545
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,100
The third one is led by Chancellor Pei himself.

546
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,220
They are responsible for

547
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,100
transporting provisions.

548
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,860
This is how my brother-in-law has arranged it.

549
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,060
Regardless of whether the northern people
take Tingzhou or not,

550
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,740
as long as the people in Fuyan

551
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,360
burn the provisions,

552
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,100
the rebels in the North

553
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,600
will surely go to rob the provisions from
the people on my brother-in-law's route.

554
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,048
Is this not putting himself in danger?

555
00:31:58,048 --> 00:31:59,180
Yes.

556
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,380
Yunyi, please don't interrupt me now.

557
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,860
Senior Official Pei arranged it in this way

558
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,060
is deliberately luring the North away

559
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,820
with provisions.

560
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,940
Speaking of which

561
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,260
Junmeng just mentioned the troops
have been withdrawn.

562
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,340
Look at how happy he is.

563
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,376
This means

564
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,220
Senior Official Pei must be alright.

565
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,660
This is a strategy of making a feint
to the east while attacking in the west.

566
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,980
Having burned their provisions

567
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,260
and relieving the siege of Tingzhou,

568
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,780
this forced them to have no choice
but to withdraw their troops.

569
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,860
Don't interrupt me.

570
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,780
You continue.

571
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,840
Okay.

572
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,740
Originally,

573
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,980
everything is within
the expectations of Senior Official Pei,

574
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,100
but suddenly Ashina Duzhi acted insane,

575
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,940
not withdrawing troops no matter what.

576
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,660
They just hesitated on the spot

577
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:52,300
as if they wanted to die with us.

578
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,720
Right at this critical moment,

579
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,340
Senior Official Pei made a decisive move
and took the initiative to strike,

580
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,860
delivering the provisions we carried

581
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,820
all to Ashina Duzhi.

582
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,220
Not only did this move successfully retrieve
the Prefectural Governor's body,

583
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,680
but it also persuaded them to surrender.

584
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,380
In the end, Ashina Duzhi had no choice

585
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,340
but to leave with his people dejectedly.

586
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,740
The strategy is to subdue the enemy
without fighting.

587
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,220
This time

588
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,580
can be described as winning without a fight

589
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,260
but bending the enemy's forces.

590
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,420
Senior Official Pei

591
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,420
is truly a master of strategy,

592
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,920
but as for him

593
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,680
sending provisions to

594
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,580
persuade surrender,

595
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:37,100
how did Su Nanjin agree to this?

596
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,200
Why do we need his approval?

597
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,400
Governor, let me tell you.

598
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,780
Su Nanjin is a man facing imminent death.

599
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,580
He's finished, completely finished.

600
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,180
How is he finished? Tell us quickly.

601
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,800
The Su family

602
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,300
originally thought they could

603
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,960
seal off all the passages in and out of Xizhou.

604
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,360
He never expected

605
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,820
Senior Official Pei somehow

606
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,620
had Cheng bring the memorial

607
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,700
to Chang'an without rest,

608
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,220
exposing the terrible act of those two

609
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,620
to His Majesty in full detail.

610
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,140
His Majesty was greatly furious

611
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,420
and decreed immediately for Su Haizheng

612
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,560
to return to Shule right away,

613
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,160
waiting for the court's decision.

614
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,640
As for Su Nanjin,

615
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,540
His Majesty immediately imprisoned him.

616
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:23,420
Moreover, he can be handed over to
the northerners for arbitrary punishment.

617
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:29,880
The ringleader who killed Khan Xingxiwang

618
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,900
are Su Haizheng and Su Nanjin.

619
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,260
If Su Nanjin

620
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,900
really falls into the hands of the northerners,

621
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,140
he would certainly be doomed.

622
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,620
Certainly.

623
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,500
This damn Su Nanjin is a coward.

624
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,580
Once he heard he was to be handed over
to the people of the North, H-H-He…

625
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:54,752
What happened?

626
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,320
Speak up.

627
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,780
There are ladies present here.

628
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,100
It's inappropriate for me to say.

629
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,100
I want to hear the inappropriate part now.

630
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,740
This damn man wet its pants right away.

631
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,460
What a loser.

632
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,620
This time, Shouyue used provisions

633
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,860
to exchange the withdrawal
of the northern troops

634
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,440
and take back the corpse
of Prefectural Governor Lai,

635
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,620
having protected Tingzhou

636
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,220
and also preserved His Majesty's reputation.

637
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,700
Why do you seem to

638
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,660
have something bothering you at this moment?

639
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,312
Although the North has withdrawn troops

640
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,800
Ashina Duzhi's ambition has already flared up.

641
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,060
The momentum has been established.

642
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,480
I did everything I could.

643
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,060
But it was just to blunt his edge,

644
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,100
making him dare not to rebel immediately.

645
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,760
But the five tribes in the north

646
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,140
could no longer truly submit.

647
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,500
I hope the court can make a firm decision.

648
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,980
Otherwise, what will happen to Western Regions
in the future

649
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,632
is really hard to say.

650
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,540
Are you all deaf?

651
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,660
I said I need to change clothes.

652
00:37:06,656 --> 00:37:07,680
Pei Xingjian,

653
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,420
you just want to use me to threaten my father.

654
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,120
If I really die from the cold,

655
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,820
what good would that do for you?

656
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,600
Master Su,

657
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,080
I think you misunderstood.

658
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,620
We originally wanted to capture you

659
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,180
to exchange for
Prefectural Governor Lai's corpse.

660
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,380
However, since you are a citizen of the Tang,

661
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,660
we will be ashamed to send you to the North

662
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,560
with you looking like this.

663
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,740
So we have no choice but
to spend a few more food on you

664
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,360
until the court makes a decision.

665
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,620
If something happens to you on the way,

666
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,760
we will have to report to the court.

667
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,100
Master Su died from incontinence

668
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,460
due to excessive fright
and subsequent exposure to cold

669
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,740
because of the northern army is approaching.

670
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,140
Presumably, it is indeed so.

671
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,860
Your Su family will also become
world-renowned, right?

672
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,752
Let's go.

673
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,180
Guys.

674
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,340
Guys, please hasten the journey.

675
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,220
Before nightfall,

676
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,820
we must reach Xizhou by then.

677
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,420
To Xizhou.

678
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,480
Giddyap.

679
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,856
Stop.

680
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:30,060
Governor, why are you waiting here?

681
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,020
You should rest more

682
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,340
It's okay. It's okay.

683
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,900
Hearing you have upset the Su family,

684
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,540
I felt better immediately.

685
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,140
In the Lantern Festival day,

686
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,520
when you sent the news back to Xizhou,

687
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,900
I've gotten a lot better.

688
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,720
Nowadays,

689
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,020
my body

690
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,940
feels great,

691
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,740
truly great.

692
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,940
Then, let's talk inside.

693
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,300
Okay. Okay.

694
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,660
Let's go.

695
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,816
Let's go. Let's go.

696
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,032
Master Su,

697
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,900
long time no see.

698
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,500
How did you end up looking like this?

699
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,100
Please be at ease.

700
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,420
Now the North

701
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,460
will not invade Xizhou anymore.

702
00:39:47,072 --> 00:39:48,128
Otherwise,

703
00:39:48,128 --> 00:39:50,380
I need to find another set of clothes

704
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,420
for you.

705
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,540
It is really too troublesome.

706
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,200
Also,

707
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,580
I forgot to tell you.

708
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,060
There is one more thing.

709
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,980
The other day,

710
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,240
Officer Zhang Huaiji

711
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,940
handed over a plaint to me,

712
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,740
saying you swindled a marriage

713
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,940
with his sister, Lady Zhangmin.

714
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,140
You've been married for three months,

715
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,040
but she hasn't even visited your temple,

716
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,660
nor has she met your family.

717
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,160
Even the marriage contract

718
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,700
was written by unrelated people.

719
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,680
How can that count?

720
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,700
Now,

721
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,940
he has already returned the gift to your house.

722
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,660
His sister, Lady Zhangmin, also says that

723
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,180
she willingly returns to her original family

724
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:40,540
and will have no more ties
with the Su family hereafter.

725
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,220
That bitch.

726
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,220
Master Su, you can be fully assured.

727
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,620
A true man will never lack a wife.

728
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,740
Wait for you,

729
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,340
On the day of implementing penalties,

730
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,660
even if no one sends you off,

731
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:25,100
I will also burn two pieces of paper money
as travel money for you.

732
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,980
After all, we've know each other.

733
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,140
Take him to the dungeon.

734
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,980
Take good care of him.

735
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,960
Come with us.

736
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:44,896
♫ I write my longing for you in Spring ♫

737
00:42:46,976 --> 00:42:51,424
♫ The red plum is in full bloom like you ♫

738
00:42:52,928 --> 00:42:55,744
♫ By the pond, next to the willow trees ♫

739
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,424
♫ I write a poem
to tell our story from the past ♫

740
00:42:59,936 --> 00:43:04,672
♫ The years pass by like a bird♫

741
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,072
♫ The destiny always comes with regrets ♫

742
00:43:13,184 --> 00:43:17,632
♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫

743
00:43:19,072 --> 00:43:22,464
♫ Outside the pavilion, by the bridge ♫

744
00:43:22,464 --> 00:43:25,952
♫ Under the moonlight,
we parted at the doorstep ♫

745
00:43:25,952 --> 00:43:32,448
♫ I've endured hardship
to tell our lingering story ♫

746
00:43:32,448 --> 00:43:35,840
♫ Remembrance of past things ♫

747
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,848
♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫

748
00:43:38,848 --> 00:43:42,400
♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫

749
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,504
♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫

750
00:43:45,504 --> 00:43:48,736
♫ A snowy day, someone sings a sad song ♫

751
00:43:48,736 --> 00:43:52,000
♫ Against the window,
I had a drink for pleasure ♫

752
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,360
♫ The moon still hangs in the sky,
but I'm no longer in the mood ♫

753
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:00,256
♫ It's quite and cold outside,
but I grab my pen again ♫

754
00:44:13,715 --> 00:44:18,464
♫ The destiny always comes with regrets ♫

755
00:44:20,275 --> 00:44:26,016
♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫

756
00:44:26,016 --> 00:44:29,583
♫ Outside the pavilion, by the bridge ♫

757
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:32,879
♫ Under the moonlight,
we parted at the doorstep ♫

758
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:39,375
♫ I've endured hardship
to tell our lingering story ♫

759
00:44:39,375 --> 00:44:42,767
♫ Remembrance of past things ♫

760
00:44:42,767 --> 00:44:46,063
♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫

761
00:44:46,063 --> 00:44:49,487
♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫

762
00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:52,719
♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫

763
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:55,951
♫ Winter comes again, and flowers wither ♫

764
00:44:55,951 --> 00:44:59,311
♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫

765
00:44:59,311 --> 00:45:02,543
♫ I look outside, like the poems asking ♫

766
00:45:02,543 --> 00:45:07,535
♫ My love, have you
found someone good for you ♫

767
00:45:07,535 --> 00:45:10,912
♫ Remembrance of past things ♫

768
00:45:10,912 --> 00:45:13,920
♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫

769
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,359
♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫

770
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,320
♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫

771
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:24,143
♫ Winter comes again, and flowers wither ♫

772
00:45:24,143 --> 00:45:26,991
♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫

773
00:45:26,991 --> 00:45:30,368
♫ I look outside, like the poems asking ♫

774
00:45:30,368 --> 00:45:35,919
♫ My love, have you
found someone good for you ♫
