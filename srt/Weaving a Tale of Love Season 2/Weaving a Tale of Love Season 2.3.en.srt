00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,552
<i>[Episode 3]</i>

3
00:01:36,147 --> 00:01:38,827
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!

4
00:01:38,827 --> 00:01:42,227
Where's everyone, Jesus!

5
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,987
No, this way, my lady,

6
00:01:45,667 --> 00:01:47,567
Lady Lu has already brought the guests over,

7
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:48,608
Quick, this way!

8
00:01:51,347 --> 00:01:52,967
Jesus Christ!

9
00:01:52,967 --> 00:01:54,027
Where's everyone, Jesus!

10
00:01:54,027 --> 00:01:55,947
Isn't that the newly wedded wife
of the Crown Prince?

11
00:01:55,947 --> 00:01:57,247
What has happened?

12
00:01:57,247 --> 00:01:58,547
Jesus!

13
00:02:00,747 --> 00:02:02,347
Lady Lu, there had an accident,

14
00:02:02,347 --> 00:02:03,547
What's the matter?

15
00:02:03,547 --> 00:02:05,687
I don't know which guest at the banquet

16
00:02:05,687 --> 00:02:07,707
flirted with Lady Liuli in the peach grove,

17
00:02:07,707 --> 00:02:09,067
We really couldn't stop it,

18
00:02:09,987 --> 00:02:11,847
Such a thing actually happened?
Take me there quickly!

19
00:02:11,847 --> 00:02:12,864
Yes, my lord,

20
00:02:21,867 --> 00:02:24,327
Li Xian, quickly escort Pei Yan back,

21
00:02:24,327 --> 00:02:25,467
Where is that lecher?

22
00:02:26,267 --> 00:02:29,227
Dared to do such a shameful thing
in the Residence of the Hedong Duke!

23
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:32,367
It's him!
It's him who did that disgraceful act,

24
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:34,387
You hussy! full of nonsense,
now get out of my sight!

25
00:02:35,587 --> 00:02:38,107
Your Highness, I'm not spouting nonsense,

26
00:02:40,307 --> 00:02:43,267
Your Highness,
this person broke into the inner courtyard,

27
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,027
He came to have a private meeting with her,

28
00:02:51,387 --> 00:02:52,707
The Crown Prince was just absent,

29
00:02:52,707 --> 00:02:55,547
Didn't see the two of them, they--

30
00:02:56,507 --> 00:02:57,667
Do not speak nonsense,

31
00:02:58,467 --> 00:03:01,147
It was her, she said it clearly…

32
00:03:06,467 --> 00:03:08,627
<i>I'm here to deliver a message to you
on behalf of Lady Liuli,</i>

33
00:03:09,387 --> 00:03:10,587
<i>She wishes to meet you,</i>

34
00:03:15,747 --> 00:03:17,987
<i>Could it be a pretense
that Lady Liuli invited me to meet?</i>

35
00:03:19,027 --> 00:03:21,427
<i>The truth is someone wants to frame me
for having an affair with her,</i>

36
00:03:22,587 --> 00:03:24,187
<i>If I reveal the truth now,</i>

37
00:03:24,867 --> 00:03:27,667
<i>to others, it would seem
that I admit to a private meeting with her,</i>

38
00:03:30,387 --> 00:03:31,747
<i>What should I do now?</i>

39
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:37,427
Your Highness, I'm not spouting nonsense,

40
00:03:37,987 --> 00:03:41,427
Tao and I accompanied the newly-married Lady
of the Crown Prince Just before,

41
00:03:41,427 --> 00:03:43,987
and picked this up
when we passed by the peach grove,

42
00:03:48,867 --> 00:03:50,272
The Lady worried

43
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:51,712
<i>[Please meet me]</i>
that someone in the Residence of the Hedong Duke

44
00:03:51,712 --> 00:03:53,447
<i>[Please meet me]</i>
has done something detrimental to their reputation,

45
00:03:53,447 --> 00:03:55,907
That's why we rushed over to see
what is actually going on,

46
00:03:57,227 --> 00:03:58,336
I didn't expect to see

47
00:03:58,987 --> 00:04:01,227
my own maternal cousin, Lady Liuli,

48
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:03,427
Your Highness, look!

49
00:04:03,427 --> 00:04:05,967
Lady Liuli's skirt is also painted
with ink lotus,

50
00:04:05,967 --> 00:04:07,947
It is identical as the one sketched
on this paper,

51
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:10,907
Then we can conclude
that this lotus was painted by Lady Liuli,

52
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:14,147
So naturally,
the words were written by her as well,

53
00:04:16,827 --> 00:04:17,888
You… You're talking nonsense!

54
00:04:19,587 --> 00:04:21,547
Cuizhu, hold your tongue for now,

55
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,487
If you have anything else to say,
it can still be addressed later,

56
00:04:24,487 --> 00:04:26,547
I'm afraid this show is not over yet,

57
00:04:26,547 --> 00:04:28,307
Let's not disturb their pleasure for now,

58
00:04:57,147 --> 00:05:00,707
Princess, I want to die! Lady Liuli…

59
00:05:06,227 --> 00:05:08,787
I didn't know all the ladies are here,
beg your pardon,

60
00:05:09,547 --> 00:05:11,147
What's to be afraid of?

61
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,467
What happened to Lady Liuli?

62
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:15,680
I…

63
00:05:18,627 --> 00:05:19,744
I…

64
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,267
There are no outsiders here, speak up,

65
00:05:25,347 --> 00:05:27,707
I accidentally passed by the peach grove
just now,

66
00:05:28,267 --> 00:05:35,187
I saw Lady Liuli and a man secretly talking,

67
00:05:37,952 --> 00:05:38,987
This…

68
00:05:38,987 --> 00:05:42,887
Shanhu, this is not a matter to joke about,

69
00:05:42,887 --> 00:05:44,227
Did you see it clearly?

70
00:05:44,907 --> 00:05:48,107
Madam, I just passed by the peach grove,

71
00:05:48,107 --> 00:05:50,787
and I saw Liuli's maidservant standing
outside the peach grove,

72
00:05:51,307 --> 00:05:52,507
I went up to ask her,

73
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:54,947
Lady told her to wait,

74
00:05:55,707 --> 00:05:57,547
then entered the peach grove
for quite long time,

75
00:05:57,547 --> 00:06:00,807
She… She is also concerned for the safety
of Lady Liuli,

76
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:03,107
The two of us decided to take a look
inside the peach grove,

77
00:06:03,107 --> 00:06:04,192
And then…

78
00:06:05,827 --> 00:06:08,747
And then, we saw Liuli

79
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:11,587
was having a secret rendezvous with a man,

80
00:06:19,987 --> 00:06:24,187
To do such an indecent thing in front of us!

81
00:06:24,187 --> 00:06:25,827
If you ladies do not believe it,

82
00:06:25,827 --> 00:06:27,227
please follow me to the peach grove to see,

83
00:06:28,627 --> 00:06:29,987
Perhaps this is true,

84
00:06:43,907 --> 00:06:44,992
You need to sober up a bit,

85
00:06:45,827 --> 00:06:46,912
What…

86
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,147
What…

87
00:06:52,147 --> 00:06:53,216
Elder brother,

88
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,787
What… what on earth is going on here?

89
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,667
Just now, Shanhu

90
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:00,787
was crying her eyes out
at the Princess's place,

91
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,487
She said
she witnessed a terribly shameful scene,

92
00:07:03,487 --> 00:07:05,027
She was crying and said
she didn't want to live anymore,

93
00:07:05,027 --> 00:07:06,467
The Princess let us

94
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,107
quickly came over to see what happen,

95
00:07:08,107 --> 00:07:10,327
Now we seeing this disheveled appearance,

96
00:07:10,327 --> 00:07:12,027
Apparently, she has done something indecent,

97
00:07:12,747 --> 00:07:14,807
If the Princess knows this is all true,

98
00:07:14,807 --> 00:07:15,987
she will definitely punish severely
without leniency,

99
00:07:18,787 --> 00:07:19,904
You guys…

100
00:07:19,904 --> 00:07:21,024
Hold on a moment!

101
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,088
Lady Cen…

102
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:31,587
Excuse me, Lady Liuli,

103
00:07:32,147 --> 00:07:34,787
what exactly happened here just now?

104
00:07:35,547 --> 00:07:38,387
Good question, I've been wondering, too,

105
00:07:38,947 --> 00:07:40,787
I don't know what exactly happened,

106
00:07:41,387 --> 00:07:45,207
Chun, Tao, and I saw with our own eyes,
how could it be false?

107
00:07:45,207 --> 00:07:47,427
Obviously you two were in love first,

108
00:07:47,427 --> 00:07:49,587
You dare to deny it in front of us,

109
00:07:49,587 --> 00:07:50,987
You let us down!

110
00:07:50,987 --> 00:07:53,347
Shanhu, you are slinging mud at others!

111
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,464
Shut up!

112
00:07:54,987 --> 00:07:57,187
You are just my concubine,
You have no right to talk nonsense here!

113
00:07:57,827 --> 00:07:59,467
This matter shows

114
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:01,547
that someone deliberately framing my husband,

115
00:08:02,947 --> 00:08:04,887
If this matter is not investigated today,

116
00:08:04,887 --> 00:08:06,427
I will certainly not let it go,

117
00:08:13,147 --> 00:08:14,587
What on earth is going on here?

118
00:08:24,707 --> 00:08:25,947
Look at you,

119
00:08:29,747 --> 00:08:32,307
May I ask, Lady Shanhu,
what exactly did you see?

120
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:34,387
Why do you want to die?

121
00:08:35,907 --> 00:08:39,107
Simply because
they were doing something indecent,

122
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:43,667
Their disheveled looking scared me,

123
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:49,307
Shanhu, you mean

124
00:08:49,307 --> 00:08:52,147
Mr, Pei and I were on this busy road,

125
00:08:52,147 --> 00:08:53,427
and our clothes were disheveled?

126
00:08:53,427 --> 00:08:57,587
Of course not, you… you were in that grove,

127
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:02,227
I just happened to be passing by
with a few maidservants,

128
00:09:02,227 --> 00:09:04,707
and I found the ink lotus painting you drew,

129
00:09:05,427 --> 00:09:08,527
It has words about arranging a private meeting,

130
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:09,787
This aroused my suspicion just now,

131
00:09:10,627 --> 00:09:12,027
I didn't expect that just a few steps away,

132
00:09:12,587 --> 00:09:16,047
you all would be in… in that grove--

133
00:09:16,047 --> 00:09:17,347
Don't spout malicious accusations!

134
00:09:21,147 --> 00:09:23,967
When you and the two maidservants recognized
it was me,

135
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,627
you were so frightened and hurried away,

136
00:09:25,627 --> 00:09:28,107
And all three of you were running away

137
00:09:28,107 --> 00:09:29,747
with crying loudly, right?

138
00:09:33,627 --> 00:09:35,547
As Lady Shanhu just mentioned,

139
00:09:35,547 --> 00:09:37,707
she caught her own sister in an illicit affair,

140
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:39,707
not a ghost,

141
00:09:39,707 --> 00:09:41,827
Why does she have to cry all the way
with her maidservant?

142
00:09:42,547 --> 00:09:44,387
- Deliberately letting people know,
- Yeah,

143
00:09:44,387 --> 00:09:46,027
This is already strange enough,

144
00:09:46,027 --> 00:09:47,887
and she is still making a fuss
about seeking death,

145
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,667
even let the Princess intervene personally,

146
00:09:50,627 --> 00:09:52,067
What intentions are behind this gesture?

147
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:55,227
May I ask you, Lady Shanhu,

148
00:09:55,947 --> 00:09:59,127
If this truly drives you to seek death,

149
00:09:59,127 --> 00:10:02,387
then, how should the coroner record your death?

150
00:10:03,587 --> 00:10:06,827
Could it really be written
that you died of shame for your own sister?

151
00:10:11,347 --> 00:10:12,387
May I ask you, Your Highness?

152
00:10:13,387 --> 00:10:16,587
How long did it take you to hurry here
from seeing Shanhu?

153
00:10:16,587 --> 00:10:18,147
How much time did it take in total?

154
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:22,307
These few steps
took merely the time of two or three breaths,

155
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:25,427
When the Crown Prince arrived,
I was already standing here,

156
00:10:26,227 --> 00:10:29,307
Imagine, within two or three breaths,

157
00:10:29,307 --> 00:10:31,587
could I have run out from the grove

158
00:10:31,587 --> 00:10:33,047
and then wade through water to here?

159
00:10:33,047 --> 00:10:35,587
All while managing to tidy my clothes and hair?

160
00:10:35,587 --> 00:10:36,707
Yes, indeed,

161
00:10:40,227 --> 00:10:42,747
So, by these words, has Lady Shanhu been lying?

162
00:10:42,747 --> 00:10:44,967
This hussy, what audacity!

163
00:10:44,967 --> 00:10:46,667
Lady, are you confused?

164
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:49,147
We clearly ran away in fear at first,

165
00:10:49,147 --> 00:10:50,627
We did not know what to do,

166
00:10:50,627 --> 00:10:53,647
the two of them chased us here from the grove,

167
00:10:53,647 --> 00:10:56,307
Lady Liuli even made verbal threats,

168
00:10:56,307 --> 00:10:57,667
She scared you into not telling anyone,

169
00:10:58,467 --> 00:11:00,627
that's why you started crying and ran away,

170
00:11:01,307 --> 00:11:04,547
Exactly, I was really scared and confused,

171
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:07,547
so… so I could not articulate properly,

172
00:11:07,547 --> 00:11:08,640
Fine,

173
00:11:09,707 --> 00:11:11,427
You remembered it wrong, I see,

174
00:11:12,267 --> 00:11:13,547
I don't know if you still remember

175
00:11:14,987 --> 00:11:17,467
where was this maid at that time?

176
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:20,067
She is your maid,

177
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:22,947
so she'll be at the intersection to watch out
for both of you!

178
00:11:23,787 --> 00:11:27,087
Cuizhu, since Shanhu has said so,

179
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:28,867
then you can tell everyone about it,

180
00:11:28,867 --> 00:11:30,227
Tell them what just happened,

181
00:11:37,307 --> 00:11:40,707
Just now Sister Ni and I

182
00:11:40,707 --> 00:11:43,967
served Lady Liuli
as she painted in the Princess's Palace,

183
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:46,307
She was painting that ink lotus,

184
00:11:47,267 --> 00:11:50,287
After we left the Princess's Palace,

185
00:11:50,287 --> 00:11:52,507
Lady Shanhu insisted on escorting us,

186
00:11:52,507 --> 00:11:54,227
She also said this is a shortcut,

187
00:11:54,787 --> 00:11:57,467
then led Lady Liuli through here,

188
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,707
When we were here, she came up,

189
00:12:00,227 --> 00:12:02,667
She came up with her drunken husband,

190
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:04,307
They hadn't even walked up to the front,

191
00:12:04,827 --> 00:12:07,267
Lady Shanhu ran away,
crying and howling like a ghost,

192
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:11,267
In the blink of an eye,
the Crown Prince came over,

193
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:14,047
Then, everyone also came over,

194
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:15,767
She is my sister's servant girl,

195
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:17,627
How can we trust her words?

196
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:22,547
Look at you, you are so muddled,

197
00:12:23,387 --> 00:12:25,667
If you protect your master, it's fine,

198
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:27,947
but why fabricate lies to frame Lady Shanhu?

199
00:12:28,627 --> 00:12:32,027
The Princess clearly said
you all came out earlier,

200
00:12:32,947 --> 00:12:36,187
And yet you claim
that you came from Princess's place

201
00:12:36,187 --> 00:12:37,587
by taking a shortcut here directly,

202
00:12:38,187 --> 00:12:40,027
Are you suggesting that the Princess

203
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:41,827
is also slandering Lady Liuli?

204
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,360
Madam,

205
00:12:48,187 --> 00:12:50,547
Lady Cen doesn't know
if the Princess has ever said so,

206
00:12:51,627 --> 00:12:55,747
all I know is that Cuizhu is a maidservant
of we Cui family,

207
00:12:56,507 --> 00:12:58,307
She has been with me as part of my dowry
to the General's Mansion,

208
00:12:58,307 --> 00:13:00,187
and she has been with me
for a full fifteen years,

209
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:02,887
Whether it's my own home
or the General's Mansion,

210
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:04,107
everyone knows Cuizhu,

211
00:13:04,707 --> 00:13:07,547
Just now,
the Princess called Lady Liuli to go and paint,

212
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:10,707
it just so happens that the maid was not there,

213
00:13:11,507 --> 00:13:13,632
I kindly sent Cuizhu to help,

214
00:13:14,144 --> 00:13:16,807
Cuizhu, you go with Lady Liuli,

215
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:17,856
Okay,

216
00:13:23,227 --> 00:13:25,267
This all together does not exceed one hour,

217
00:13:26,427 --> 00:13:29,907
How could my personal maid help outsiders
to deceive me?

218
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:33,187
If according to what Lady Shanhu said,

219
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:34,947
my personal maidservant

220
00:13:35,467 --> 00:13:38,147
assisted my husband in secret rendezvous
with other women,

221
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:42,027
and also acted as a lookout,
what sense does this make?

222
00:13:42,027 --> 00:13:44,627
Yes, that's right,

223
00:13:46,587 --> 00:13:50,627
I also beseech you to explain this
to everyone on my behalf,

224
00:13:51,147 --> 00:13:54,427
Yes, Cuizhu has no reason to lie,

225
00:13:54,427 --> 00:13:55,520
That's right,

226
00:13:58,067 --> 00:13:59,267
Isn't she just lying?

227
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:08,307
How… how is it possible? How could it be?

228
00:14:10,027 --> 00:14:12,187
You're talking nonsense! Nonsense!

229
00:14:13,307 --> 00:14:16,107
This servant girl is with my elder sister,

230
00:14:16,107 --> 00:14:17,747
She is my elder sister's servant girl,

231
00:14:17,747 --> 00:14:19,427
How come she is your maid?

232
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:23,387
Everyone knows
I don't like to move around much,

233
00:14:24,227 --> 00:14:26,907
So it's normal
that people in the mansion don't know Cuizhu,

234
00:14:27,427 --> 00:14:30,187
Fortunately,
here is crowded with honorable guests,

235
00:14:30,867 --> 00:14:35,167
Anyway, someone from Pei family and Cui family
can recognize Cuizhu,

236
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,007
They are unaware of this sudden change,

237
00:14:37,007 --> 00:14:39,147
Therefore,
they will not be partial to me and my husband,

238
00:14:39,787 --> 00:14:41,387
nor will they be biased towards Lady Liuli,

239
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:44,347
Please join me in asking together,

240
00:14:45,347 --> 00:14:46,827
then you will know
if I am talking nonsense or not,

241
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,480
Lady Cen,

242
00:14:49,787 --> 00:14:53,187
Lady Cen,
it was my momentary oversight in this matter,

243
00:14:53,187 --> 00:14:55,556
Lady Cen, it's best not to make a big fuss
about this matter,

244
00:14:55,556 --> 00:14:56,768
Otherwise, I'm afraid…

245
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,027
I'm just afraid
it might tarnish the reputation Pei family,

246
00:15:00,027 --> 00:15:01,467
You know this matter

247
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,167
is about the Pei family's reputation,
don't you?

248
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,567
Is my husband not a descendant
of the Pei family?

249
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:08,167
Is not Lady Liuli a woman of the Pei family?

250
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:10,507
If this matter isn't thoroughly investigated
today,

251
00:15:11,107 --> 00:15:12,567
the reputation of the Pei family

252
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:14,387
would truly be left
with not even a shred remaining,

253
00:15:17,987 --> 00:15:19,507
Lady, please wait for me a moment,

254
00:15:36,147 --> 00:15:39,927
Lady Liuli, look how this turned out,

255
00:15:39,927 --> 00:15:42,547
Lady Liuli,
please hurry and persuade Lady Cen for me,

256
00:15:42,547 --> 00:15:45,667
She has come to clear my grievances
and to vindicate my husband,

257
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:46,707
Why should I persuade her then?

258
00:15:51,027 --> 00:15:53,867
Lady Liuli, as long as you are willing to stop,

259
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:56,587
then you'll be in charge of the Luoyang estate
from now on,

260
00:15:57,267 --> 00:16:00,487
I will help you get the deed to the property,
how about that?

261
00:16:00,487 --> 00:16:02,387
Are you losing your mind?

262
00:16:03,107 --> 00:16:05,447
Today's matter concerns the reputation of
Pei family,

263
00:16:05,447 --> 00:16:08,227
What does it have to do with the property
in Luoyang?

264
00:16:08,227 --> 00:16:09,547
How can this be used as a transaction?

265
00:16:09,547 --> 00:16:11,707
- Isn't this just someone having a guilty conscience?
- Yes, it is,

266
00:16:12,267 --> 00:16:13,312
It's a disgrace to me!

267
00:16:19,267 --> 00:16:21,907
Lady, get up, Quickly help her up,

268
00:16:22,947 --> 00:16:24,667
Come on,

269
00:16:39,387 --> 00:16:42,707
Princess,
take care of your body, don't be angry,

270
00:16:48,987 --> 00:16:52,347
Where is Cui? And that hussy, Shanhu?

271
00:16:52,347 --> 00:16:53,987
Where the hell are they going?

272
00:17:00,907 --> 00:17:01,952
Madam,

273
00:17:05,787 --> 00:17:07,827
you are becoming more and more 'smart',

274
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:10,427
What were you thinking?

275
00:17:11,187 --> 00:17:13,747
Mentioned Luoyang estate
in front of everyone to Liuli?

276
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:16,507
Are you not making trouble out of nothing?

277
00:17:19,187 --> 00:17:20,667
I'm not efficient in handling things,

278
00:17:21,587 --> 00:17:24,627
Madam, punish me,

279
00:17:31,507 --> 00:17:32,640
Where is Shanhu?

280
00:17:33,147 --> 00:17:36,947
Madam, Shanhu is now resting in her room
after being heavily punished,

281
00:17:36,947 --> 00:17:38,147
Rest?

282
00:17:41,547 --> 00:17:46,227
Very good, messed things up,

283
00:17:46,227 --> 00:17:49,547
and she dare to lie down and rest comfortably
in the room?

284
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:17,427
I have let you down, Madam,

285
00:18:17,427 --> 00:18:20,227
Please, give me another chance,

286
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:23,867
Madam!

287
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:31,547
I'll find an imperial physician
from the Imperial Hospital now,

288
00:18:36,747 --> 00:18:38,547
Give you another chance?

289
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:42,827
I'm afraid what you're saying isn't sincere,

290
00:18:45,387 --> 00:18:46,707
I am speaking from the heart,

291
00:18:47,307 --> 00:18:49,647
Where the Princess can make use of me,

292
00:18:49,647 --> 00:18:53,667
I would willingly be crushed to dust
and broken to pieces,

293
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:58,947
Willingly be crushed to dust
and broken to pieces?

294
00:19:02,187 --> 00:19:05,947
Alright, keep your word,

295
00:19:11,227 --> 00:19:14,627
I… I would even be crushed to dust

296
00:19:15,867 --> 00:19:17,107
and be willingly broken to pieces,

297
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,827
Fine, Shanhu,

298
00:19:25,027 --> 00:19:29,107
Then, I will give you another chance,

299
00:19:30,947 --> 00:19:34,947
Take Shanhu away and punish her heavily!

300
00:19:35,787 --> 00:19:37,427
Beat her heavily!

301
00:19:37,987 --> 00:19:40,387
Do not stop without my orders,

302
00:19:42,027 --> 00:19:43,547
No, no!

303
00:19:44,787 --> 00:19:48,947
Please! Please!

304
00:19:49,587 --> 00:19:52,907
Please! My Princess!

305
00:19:54,307 --> 00:19:55,392
Cui,

306
00:19:59,587 --> 00:20:01,467
Go and receive ten planks by yourself,

307
00:20:02,507 --> 00:20:04,907
If you dare to do wrong things again,
you'll end up like Shanhu,

308
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:30,784
<i>[House of Gold and Jade]</i>

309
00:20:34,587 --> 00:20:38,267
Lu, I have a task for you to handle,

310
00:20:41,467 --> 00:20:42,547
Please give your instructions, Madam,

311
00:20:43,267 --> 00:20:46,787
This matter, we still need to pin it on Shanhu,

312
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:51,507
Just say it's a joke stemming from the discord
between the sisters,

313
00:20:54,827 --> 00:20:55,840
If that's the case,

314
00:20:56,947 --> 00:20:59,227
then we must cheat Shanhu,

315
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:02,867
I wonder
why Madam wants to teach her a lesson again?

316
00:21:17,827 --> 00:21:19,027
My lord, my lady,

317
00:21:20,267 --> 00:21:22,027
There is new activity
in the Residence of the Hedong Duke again,

318
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:24,507
The imperial physician
who was invited into the mansion a few days ago

319
00:21:24,507 --> 00:21:25,747
was came in three times a day,

320
00:21:25,747 --> 00:21:27,707
But as of yesterday,
it was changed to once a day,

321
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:30,387
However, today they have invited another one,

322
00:21:30,387 --> 00:21:32,867
A familiar traumatologist
has entered the mansion,

323
00:21:32,867 --> 00:21:34,187
I don't know

324
00:21:35,507 --> 00:21:38,447
why they visit three times a day
instead of visiting once a day,

325
00:21:38,447 --> 00:21:40,587
which indicates
that the Princess is getting better,

326
00:21:41,427 --> 00:21:44,507
But why did they call for a trauma doctor?

327
00:21:46,427 --> 00:21:50,307
Cheng, send someone to closely watch them
in the Residence of the Hedong Duke,

328
00:21:50,827 --> 00:21:52,067
Also find someone to go to the Kudi's Mansion,

329
00:21:52,627 --> 00:21:56,147
Just say that I will visit my father-in-law
today,

330
00:21:56,827 --> 00:21:57,888
Yes, my lord,

331
00:22:06,187 --> 00:22:07,707
Cao, don't blame me for being ruthless,

332
00:22:08,507 --> 00:22:09,807
I have warned you long ago

333
00:22:09,807 --> 00:22:11,707
that Liuli has already changed a lot now,

334
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:12,867
You must not make the mistake again,

335
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:15,667
Shanhu has just been married to them
for a few days,

336
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,947
and there has this kind of trouble,

337
00:22:18,387 --> 00:22:20,187
Even though Liuli hasn't told me personally,

338
00:22:20,187 --> 00:22:21,947
but it's already being wildly talked about
outside,

339
00:22:21,947 --> 00:22:24,347
They say that Shanhu holds a grudge
against her own sister,

340
00:22:24,347 --> 00:22:27,327
and plotted against her sister
at the Princess's Lotus Banquet

341
00:22:27,327 --> 00:22:28,907
to set a trap
to ruin her elder sister's reputation,

342
00:22:29,787 --> 00:22:31,467
Shouyue has made an appointment to come over
today,

343
00:22:31,467 --> 00:22:32,787
certainly to demand an explanation,

344
00:22:33,467 --> 00:22:34,827
If you guys don't want to make things well,
then forget it,

345
00:22:35,347 --> 00:22:37,107
Why do you have to jeopardize my future?

346
00:22:39,267 --> 00:22:41,707
My lord, Mr, Pei's carriage has arrived,

347
00:22:42,787 --> 00:22:43,872
Really?

348
00:22:45,347 --> 00:22:46,467
Quickly, lock her door,

349
00:22:52,147 --> 00:22:53,184
You go first, I'll handle this,

350
00:22:58,387 --> 00:22:59,456
Shouyue,

351
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:02,400
Father-in-law,

352
00:23:02,944 --> 00:23:04,047
No need to be polite,

353
00:23:04,047 --> 00:23:06,627
I have some business matters to consult you on,

354
00:23:06,627 --> 00:23:07,707

356
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,347
I have just prepared some fine tea,

357
00:23:13,347 --> 00:23:15,867
and I have never had the heart to drink it,
waiting for you to come and brew it,

358
00:23:15,867 --> 00:23:17,267
Come inside, please have a try,

359
00:23:23,587 --> 00:23:25,227
Taste it, Shouyue,

360
00:23:27,307 --> 00:23:28,320
Thank you very much,

361
00:23:30,227 --> 00:23:32,507
Why haven't I seen Lady Cao today?

362
00:23:37,507 --> 00:23:38,907
She is sick,

363
00:23:39,987 --> 00:23:41,147
She's so confused because of sickness,

364
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,647
I've had a doctor look at her,

365
00:23:43,647 --> 00:23:46,307
The doctor said
she's suffering from a phlegm obstruction,

366
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,467
It's not convenient for her to meet others,

367
00:23:49,547 --> 00:23:52,187
So I've arranged for her to recuperate
in the side room,

368
00:23:54,067 --> 00:23:56,787
I suspect she's suffering from some heatstroke
due to the sweltering summer,

369
00:23:57,547 --> 00:23:58,627
Yes, that's right,

370
00:23:58,627 --> 00:24:02,127
Luckily,
I've prepared some platters of melon and fruit

371
00:24:02,127 --> 00:24:03,787
to relieve the summer heat at home,

372
00:24:03,787 --> 00:24:06,887
This time I want to invite you and Lady Cao

373
00:24:06,887 --> 00:24:08,307
to spend a couple of days at my place,

374
00:24:08,867 --> 00:24:11,427
It seems that only you can go to my place now,

375
00:24:11,987 --> 00:24:13,947
I wonder if you have any other arrangements
in the next two days?

376
00:24:15,227 --> 00:24:16,387
No arrangements,

377
00:24:17,107 --> 00:24:18,112
That's great,

378
00:24:19,067 --> 00:24:21,247

Why don't you come with me right now?

381
00:24:26,144 --> 00:24:27,187
Now?

382
00:24:27,187 --> 00:24:28,224
Yes,

383
00:24:28,827 --> 00:24:31,927
Okay then, wait here, Shouyue,

384
00:24:31,927 --> 00:24:33,187
I'll go get ready,

385
00:24:33,187 --> 00:24:34,208
Alright,

Shouyue, ignore her, just ignore her,

00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:03,667
Pei Xingjian, every debt has its debtor,
every wrong has its wrongdoer,

391
00:25:04,827 --> 00:25:09,792
I was the one
who wronged Liuli and her mother back then,

I'd like to hear Lady Cao's thought,

401
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,907
Why don't you take care of your illness,
what are you messing around for?

402
00:26:03,027 --> 00:26:05,667
Mr, Pei, Sir,

403
00:26:06,587 --> 00:26:07,907
Think about it, Mr, Pei,

404
00:26:09,187 --> 00:26:10,787
Although Shanhu is immature,

405
00:26:11,627 --> 00:26:13,667
she has only been married for a few days,

406
00:26:14,667 --> 00:26:16,627
How dare she do such a thing?

407
00:26:18,067 --> 00:26:20,147
They are under someone's orders and dispatch,

408
00:26:21,147 --> 00:26:22,176
If you and Liuli

409
00:26:22,176 --> 00:26:24,567
are willing to visit Princess Linhai
and persuade her,

410
00:26:24,567 --> 00:26:26,227
you will definitely be able to save her life,

411
00:26:26,227 --> 00:26:27,296
What do you mean by this?

412
00:26:28,147 --> 00:26:30,027
Shanhu is the daughter-in-law of them,

413
00:26:31,027 --> 00:26:33,067
since she is following the orders
of the Princess,

414
00:26:33,827 --> 00:26:35,147
then how can there be any concerns
about her life?

415
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:41,067
I heard that something happened
at the Lotus Banquet that day,

416
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:45,027
then I secretly visited there,
the Residence of the Hedong Duke for twice,

417
00:26:46,347 --> 00:26:47,747
But I didn't see anyone at all,

418
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:51,247
Later on, I cost some money,

419
00:26:51,247 --> 00:26:53,707
only then did a servant secretly tell me,

420
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:57,267
Princess Linhai became furious,

421
00:26:57,987 --> 00:26:59,907
She wished she could take Shanhu's life,

422
00:27:01,507 --> 00:27:02,592
This…

423
00:27:03,467 --> 00:27:08,267
If you… if you are willing to persuade them,

424
00:27:09,307 --> 00:27:11,067
I will be indebted to you in my next life,
whatever it cost,

425
00:27:11,867 --> 00:27:14,227
Never will I forget your great kindness,

426
00:27:15,827 --> 00:27:19,847
Neither I nor my daughter
dare to offend Liuli anymore,

427
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:23,927
If we dare to offend Liuli again,
we'll go to hell and never be reincarnated,

428
00:27:23,927 --> 00:27:25,187
There's no need to swear oaths anymore,

429
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:30,147
Mostly thanks to you
that Shanhu has what she has today,

430
00:27:31,707 --> 00:27:34,227
If I remember correctly,
you made a venomous oath last time,

431
00:27:34,867 --> 00:27:37,987
saying that if auntie crosses Liuli again
in any way,

432
00:27:38,547 --> 00:27:40,387
you and your daughter
will never have a good day,

433
00:27:42,187 --> 00:27:43,427
It seems that heaven has eyes,

434
00:27:44,427 --> 00:27:46,227
Oaths are not made lightly,

435
00:27:47,187 --> 00:27:49,707
Your aunt simply fulfilled the vow you made,

436
00:27:51,307 --> 00:27:52,667

You didn't allow me to visit father's house
today,

and you didn't allow me to stay at home either,

She says the sick lady has come to apologize,

457
00:29:29,847 --> 00:29:32,067
I told her you both were out,
but she insisted on waiting,

458
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:35,267
It was too undignified for them to stay
outside the door,

459
00:29:35,267 --> 00:29:36,587
so I sent them in,

460
00:29:36,587 --> 00:29:37,667

that the matter of the Lotus Banquet that day
has been clarified,

481
00:30:54,787 --> 00:30:56,667
It was all planned by your sister alone,

482
00:30:57,627 --> 00:31:00,347
The Princess gave me the divorce letter
written by the Crown Prince

483
00:31:00,347 --> 00:31:01,408
and hand it to you,

484
00:31:01,947 --> 00:31:05,227
After this, Shanhu has nothing to do with us,

485
00:31:05,747 --> 00:31:07,667
You can deal with her at will,

486
00:31:07,667 --> 00:31:10,307

how could you decide to divorce just like that?

Shanhu's marriage arrangements

490
00:31:21,947 --> 00:31:24,267
was agreed by the Residence of the Hedong Duke
and my father,

491
00:31:24,267 --> 00:31:25,667
Liuli was not informed,

492
00:31:26,387 --> 00:31:29,627
No matter what the issue is today,
it should still be decided by my father,

493
00:31:31,187 --> 00:31:33,707
Father, what do you think?

494
00:31:38,987 --> 00:31:40,827
It's all because of my confusion,

495
00:31:42,307 --> 00:31:44,547
This has not only caused complete unrest,

496
00:31:46,147 --> 00:31:48,547
but… but also delayed Shanhu's future,

497
00:31:50,387 --> 00:31:52,707
The Residence of the Hedong Duke destroy people
utterly,

498
00:31:53,507 --> 00:31:54,827
it's okay if we don't go back,

499
00:32:03,387 --> 00:32:04,448
Shanhu,

500
00:32:06,147 --> 00:32:07,427
I will take you home,

501
00:32:13,627 --> 00:32:14,688
Please,

502
00:32:31,067 --> 00:32:33,007
Mr, Pei, may I be bold to ask,

503
00:32:33,007 --> 00:32:35,587
how did this young lady's injury delay
until this time?

504
00:32:36,467 --> 00:32:38,767
It seems okay now,

505
00:32:38,767 --> 00:32:41,587
but it's the affection of ginseng soup,

506
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:46,467
I… I'm afraid it won't last more than two days,

507
00:33:04,307 --> 00:33:06,147
Don't let Shanhu live,

508
00:33:07,827 --> 00:33:11,707
Beat her half to death and then keep her alive
with ginseng soup,

509
00:33:12,267 --> 00:33:16,187
Send her into Pei Shouyue's mansion,
and let Liuli deal with her,

510
00:33:17,067 --> 00:33:19,547
As long as Shanhu dies in Liuli's mansion,

511
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:24,067
everyone will naturally believe it was discord
between the sisters,

512
00:33:24,827 --> 00:33:27,187
Shanhu wanted to frame Liuli but failed,

513
00:33:27,827 --> 00:33:31,747
Then Liuli developed a grudge and killed her
in return,

514
00:33:34,707 --> 00:33:36,747
Liuli's concubine mother is a shrew,

515
00:33:37,547 --> 00:33:39,387
she won't let it go easily,

516
00:33:40,467 --> 00:33:42,427
After they making a fuss,

517
00:33:45,147 --> 00:33:47,547
everyone will then believe it,

518
00:33:48,747 --> 00:33:51,467
This matter has nothing to do
with the Residence of the Hedong Duke,

519
00:33:52,267 --> 00:33:56,707
It also helps preserve the reputation of us,

520
00:33:59,067 --> 00:34:02,707
May I ask if what Mr, Xiao just said is true,
Lady Lu?

521
00:34:03,507 --> 00:34:05,787
So it turns out
that you've hurt Shanhu to this extent,

522
00:34:09,307 --> 00:34:10,787
We didn't harm her at all,

523
00:34:10,787 --> 00:34:13,667
It was the Crown Prince losing control
in his fury,

524
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:17,287
He kicked her,
I think he might have kicked too hard,

525
00:34:17,287 --> 00:34:20,347
Drinking the soup was also to cure her,

526
00:34:21,107 --> 00:34:23,187
How did it turn out to be our fault?

527
00:34:32,587 --> 00:34:34,347
Shanhu, what do you want to say?

528
00:34:47,427 --> 00:34:51,147
Madam, I smelled medicine on her body earlier,

529
00:34:51,147 --> 00:34:52,967
Based on the current situation,

530
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:55,187
she must have taken a drug
that could make her mute,

531
00:34:56,747 --> 00:34:58,987
Mute drug, is there a cure?

532
00:34:58,987 --> 00:35:01,587
If there's still a glimmer of hope,
please try your best, Mr, Xiao,

533
00:35:02,227 --> 00:35:04,067
This drug is the deadliest,

534
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:08,067
Once taken,
you won't be able to speak again in the future,

535
00:35:20,707 --> 00:35:21,707
Please, Mr, Xiao,

536
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:25,167
What… what about her besides her voice?

537
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:26,627
Can her illness still be cured?

538
00:35:26,627 --> 00:35:30,987
Mr, Pei, I'm afraid this kind of injury…

539
00:35:42,027 --> 00:35:44,627
I beg you to try one more time,
I appreciate it,

540
00:35:44,627 --> 00:35:46,147
This is too kind, Mr, Pei,

541
00:35:48,227 --> 00:35:52,307
Alright then, borrow me a pen and paper,

542
00:35:52,307 --> 00:35:54,867
I will write another prescription
and give it a try,

543
00:35:54,867 --> 00:35:55,872
Please,

544
00:36:00,307 --> 00:36:03,387
Shanhu is blessed with good fortune,
and Mr, Xiao has superb medical skills,

545
00:36:03,947 --> 00:36:05,067
There will certainly be fine,

546
00:36:12,387 --> 00:36:14,867
The Residence of the Hedong Duke took Shanhu
as a bride,

547
00:36:14,867 --> 00:36:17,147
so she will then belong to you,

548
00:36:17,667 --> 00:36:19,787
Now Shanhu has made a mistake in your care,

549
00:36:19,787 --> 00:36:22,127
Princess failed to properly discipline her,

550
00:36:22,127 --> 00:36:23,667
and tortured her to this state,

551
00:36:24,187 --> 00:36:26,667
Sending her to my place
with an irresponsible attitude,

552
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:28,907
If anything happens to Shanhu at this point,

553
00:36:28,907 --> 00:36:32,027
Princess can make me bear the notoriety
of killing sister, right?

554
00:36:35,267 --> 00:36:36,347
Please forgive me, sister-in-law,

555
00:36:37,067 --> 00:36:40,167
The Princess wants to vent your anger,

556
00:36:40,167 --> 00:36:43,347
Moreover,
Princess has not been feeling well recently,

557
00:36:44,227 --> 00:36:46,627
The imperial physician repeatedly admonished
not to get angry again,

558
00:36:47,467 --> 00:36:51,547
so I dare not to disobey Princess's order,

559
00:36:51,547 --> 00:36:52,987
I'm afraid of making her angry again,

560
00:36:55,467 --> 00:36:56,544
See you, Lady Liuli,

561
00:37:27,667 --> 00:37:28,787
Lady Lu,

562
00:37:29,307 --> 00:37:30,347
Why are you here?

563
00:37:30,867 --> 00:37:34,847
Lady Lu, Luoyang's estates have a good harvest
this summer,

564
00:37:34,847 --> 00:37:37,667
We are here to report to the Princess,

565
00:37:46,212 --> 00:37:51,147
<i>[Wealth fills the halls]</i>

566
00:37:51,147 --> 00:37:52,427
Madam,

567
00:37:52,427 --> 00:37:54,587
Have you properly handled the tasks I assigned?

568
00:37:56,227 --> 00:37:57,387
Madam,

569
00:37:57,947 --> 00:37:59,967
I have already sent the Shanhu
to the Pei's Mansion,

570
00:37:59,967 --> 00:38:01,267
I handed it personally to Liuli,

571
00:38:02,187 --> 00:38:03,287
Before this,

572
00:38:03,287 --> 00:38:06,007
I also let her drink the mute drug as you said,

573
00:38:06,007 --> 00:38:08,067
in case she still had the strength
to talk nonsense,

574
00:38:13,907 --> 00:38:15,467
Did you go to the Kudi's Mansion?

575
00:38:16,907 --> 00:38:19,427
I wanted to send the Shanhu to Pei's Mansion
at first

576
00:38:19,427 --> 00:38:20,987
and then go to see her parents,

577
00:38:21,947 --> 00:38:25,707
I didn't expect
Pei Xingjian and Liuli to be one step ahead,

578
00:38:25,707 --> 00:38:27,547
Kudi Yanzhong was brought to the mansion
by them,

579
00:38:28,427 --> 00:38:31,367
just as I was sending Shanhu away,

580
00:38:31,367 --> 00:38:33,907
Shanhu's injuries couldn't be hidden,

581
00:38:34,987 --> 00:38:36,107
He saw all of these injuries,

582
00:38:38,467 --> 00:38:40,547
Didn't I ask you to give her the soup first,

583
00:38:40,547 --> 00:38:41,647
and then send her away?

584
00:38:41,647 --> 00:38:43,087
Indeed, it was done as you instructed,

585
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:44,627
She was sent away
after drinking the ginseng soup,

586
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:47,867
But… Pei Xingjian called for a doctor,

587
00:38:48,947 --> 00:38:52,767
It was diagnosed on the spot
that Shanhu was severely injured and would die,

588
00:38:52,767 --> 00:38:54,987
We want to make sure that Liuli killed Shanhu,

589
00:38:55,947 --> 00:38:57,027
I'm afraid it won't work,

590
00:38:58,427 --> 00:38:59,488
You,

591
00:39:00,747 --> 00:39:02,707
call those supervisors over for me,

592
00:39:03,947 --> 00:39:04,960

Everything that happened

599
00:40:15,267 --> 00:40:17,587
