00:01:32,128 --> 00:01:35,840
<i>[Episode 16]</i>

3
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,480
Prefect Wang solves the case

4
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,540
cautiously and carefully,

5
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,260
I know that,

6
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,180
But too cautious

7
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,580
may not necessarily be a good thing,

8
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,140
Since you say this case is very simple,

9
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,680
then why

10
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,320
is it still so today?

11
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,660
why has it been dragging on for a long time?

12
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,680
It's embarrassing to talk about this matter,

13
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,780
But it is actually simple,

14
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,880
Take the herd of cows in Qiao Liu's place,

15
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,820
there are over forty cows,

16
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,540
Indeed, there will be twenty newborn calves
in this spring,

17
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,260
In Zhang Er's place,

18
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,240
there are indeed more than twenty calves
out of the blue,

19
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,600
But there's no evidence to prove
that this is what Qiao Liu lost,

20
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,540
At this moment, Zhang Er is adamant about it,

21
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,560
he says the cow was bought from the herders
in the north,

22
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,760
He also holds the title
of a low-level meritorious officer,

23
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,540
and it is not good for us to resort to torture,

24
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,500
If he doesn't confess on his own accord,

25
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,340
then how is this case to be concluded?

26
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,060
What about the meritorious officer?

27
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,660
Merely a low-level meritorious officer,

28
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,820
we can handle him,

29
00:02:48,384 --> 00:02:49,408
Prefect Wang,

30
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,660
Qiao Liu left his hometown to take exams,

31
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,200
now he is back in his hometown,

32
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,820
but he found his property had been embezzled
by his relatives,

33
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,940
The case is being dragged on and on,

34
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,300
wouldn't that discourage all the students
in Xizhou?

35
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,500
I'll give you one more month,

36
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,020
I wonder if you could settle this case,

37
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,720
Senior Official Pei,
please forgive my incompetence,

38
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,420
Please tell me

39
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,780
how might we swiftly conclude this case?

40
00:03:35,072 --> 00:03:36,140
It is not difficult
when you come to speak of it,

41
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,940
Zhang Er is merely an insignificant villager,

42
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,780
he could not have any experience,

43
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,260
Give him a good scare,

44
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,540
he wouldn't dare not to confess,

45
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,420
Perhaps both cases could be settled together,

46
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,060
I wonder what Senior Official Pei really means
by this?

47
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,460
In my view, these two cases

48
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,180
are nothing extraordinary,

49
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,700
It's just about how to get Zhang Er

50
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,700
to confess his own crime in court, that's all,

51
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,460
It's simply a matter of being heartless,

52
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,220
In this world,
who isn't afraid of being beaten?

53
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,140
As for that rustler,

54
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,340
in my opinion,

55
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,160
it's also undoubtedly Zhang Er,

56
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,860
These two cases are just one after all,

57
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,680
I want to know,

58
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,480
if you decide the case,

59
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,620
how many days will you take?

60
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,140
I'm not a person who judges cases,

61
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,940
If I were Prefect Wang,

62
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,900
I will post the notice tomorrow,

63
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,900
and the court will hear the case
three days after,

64
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,200
I must make Zhang Er confess

65
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,540
to admit his guilt and face punishment
before the people of Xizhou,

66
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,480
- Junmeng,
- Yes?

67
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,240
let's post the notice,

68
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,540
saying that the rustler has been found,

69
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,140
and trial will be held three days after,

70
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,940
Let the people of Xizhou witness

71
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,420
the methods of Senior Official Pei,

72
00:04:54,176 --> 00:04:55,264
Yes,

73
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,728
Go away!

74
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,552
Go away!

75
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,432
Out of the way!

76
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,504
Move!

77
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,700
Knock on the door, break the door!

78
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,944
Han Si!

79
00:05:20,576 --> 00:05:21,664
Han Si!

80
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,660
Han Si, open the door!

81
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,780
Open the door quickly, Han Si!

82
00:05:45,536 --> 00:05:46,720
Mr, Zhang

83
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,700
draws in a lot of people to find me,

84
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,700
What's the matter?

85
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,752
Han Si,

86
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,280
stop pretending to be confused
when you know what's going on,

87
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,360
Tell me,

88
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,340
how many times I look for you?

89
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,500
Why haven't you come sooner?

90
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,060
Too many sick animals, no time to spare,

91
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,056
You're talking nonsense!

92
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,220
Listen, Han Si, I'm telling you,

93
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,980
either you come home with me today
and treat my cows,

94
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,700
or I will have you beaten up like them,

95
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,720
Fine,

96
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,620
Then pay up the medical fees you owe me,

97
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,660
Then I'll go with you,

98
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,900
Once you've treated those cows for me,

99
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,120
I'll pay you the medical fee,

100
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,620
I am Commandant of Militant Cavalry,

101
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,500
Do you care about those consultation fees
from me?

102
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,820
It's been two years already!

103
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,960
I'll pay you, anyway,

104
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,500
Bye,

105
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,300
Han Si, stay here!

106
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,060
Take him back with ropes if necessary,
catch him!

107
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,608
Here I am,

108
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,700
who dares to tie him up?

109
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,940
Look at you,

110
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,780
are you Bai Sanlang
from the Protector-general's Mansion?

111
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,940
How come it has been several days
since I last saw you?

112
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,900
How did it come to this dreadful state?

113
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,912
You must have offended the master, haven't you?

114
00:07:30,912 --> 00:07:32,040
This is really awful,

115
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,660
Your leg is broken, just like a dog's,

116
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,096
Zhang Er,

117
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,100
Did I not hit you hard enough last time?

118
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,900
You can't remember in your pig head, don't you?

119
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,740
Once the scar has healed,
you forget the pain, right?

120
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,768
Bah!

121
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,000
Last time you took advantage of me
when I wasn't prepared,

122
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,860
Otherwise,
how could I have fallen for your trick?

123
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,064
Bai San,

124
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,740
you know what?

125
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,060
Our affair is not over yet,

126
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,040
Why I haven't settled scores with you?

127
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,500
It's because Minister Qu,
He went to plead with my father,

128
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,300
Or I would have already chopped you
and fed you to the dogs,

129
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,360
Fine,

130
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,880
Minister Qu isn't here today,

131
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,300
If you have the ability, just…

132
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,340
come and try,

133
00:08:17,632 --> 00:08:18,688
What are you doing?

134
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,340
Do you understand now that you're injured?

135
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,728
What are you trying to prove here?

136
00:08:21,728 --> 00:08:22,820
Go back,

137
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,224
What will you do if I go back?

138
00:08:24,224 --> 00:08:25,260
I have my ways,

139
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,900
What? You have your ways? Go back quickly,

140
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,340
Here, you are my patient,
Listen to me, go back,

141
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,700
Hey, are you two finished?

142
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,860
None of you can escape today,

143
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,020
Beat them up!

144
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,880
If there's a fight, I'm in,

145
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,940
Same here,

146
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,940
Fighting? I'm in,

147
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,912
Count me in,

148
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:01,312
And me,

149
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,560
Mr, Zhang, Sanlang is unwell,

150
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,500
I, Lao Si, took care of his matter,

151
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,340
You few stinky brats,

152
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,780
you should serve in Senior Official's Mansion,

153
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,420
Why run over here?

154
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,780
Inviting you for a drink,

155
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,580
Mr, Zhang, if you want to fight,

156
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,980
please be quick,

157
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,460
Our time is precious,

158
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,300
we can't linger here for too long,

159
00:09:33,696 --> 00:09:34,848
Today

160
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,580
I will let it go
in consideration of Minister Qu,

161
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,700
I will not fuss with you,

162
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,980
We have a long way to go,

163
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,220
Bai San, let's wait and see,

164
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,392
Zhang Er,

165
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,980
You've knocked over the medicine basket,

166
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,860
Pick up the medicine,

167
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,500
Put things back where they belong,

168
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,300
This is what Madam Qu brought a few days ago,

169
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,940
It's said to be from Madam Kudi,

170
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,380
Liuli drew the pattern of the padder,

171
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,300
She asked Madam Qu to find someone
to make it for her,

172
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,420
Madam Qu then gave it to me,

173
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,540
I have been trying it for two days,

174
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,180
I've got some clues,

175
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,620
Still, it feels somewhat lacking,

176
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,740
I was just thinking of asking you for advice,

177
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,420
This lady, the Senior Official's wife,
nearly lost her life,

178
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,420
She neither hid in fear,

179
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,740
nor did she investigate everywhere,

180
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,420
Instead, she was doing the padder at home,

181
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,560
You said padder can remove Bai Die's seeds?

182
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,900
Indeed it can,

183
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,860
But at this stage,
there are still many shortcomings,

184
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,980
It can't completely remove the seeds yet,

185
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,580
Further improvements are needed,

186
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,360
In recent days,

187
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,980
I have been wondering,

188
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,160
Maybe the practice of fine Bai Die cloth

189
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,280
relates to…

190
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,460
Are you trying to say

191
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,880
if our padder can remove the Bai Die's seeds,

192
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,460
then we can weave fine Bai Die cloth, right?

193
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,504
It's possible,

194
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,260
Tell me the current progress one by one,

195
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,920
Yes,

196
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,200
This is what has been completed,

197
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,740
These still have doubts,

198
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,620
Lady, the sun is about to set,

199
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,540
Let's draw the blueprint of this padder
tomorrow,

200
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,060
Lady,

201
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,480
If it can't be finished today,
there's always tomorrow,

202
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,580
If it can't be finished tomorrow,
there's always the day after tomorrow,

203
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,580
There will be a day when it can be finished,

204
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,200
You don't understand,

205
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,020
Shouyue said,

206
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,640
if we can weave fine Bai Die cloth,

207
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,260
it would be a great thing
for the people of Xizhou,

208
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,420
It's even of immeasurable merit,

209
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,140
So, you see,

210
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,620
designing this padder earlier

211
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,580
would allow the people of Xizhou
to earn money sooner,

212
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,180
They can be rich by working in the fields,

213
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,500
My lady, even if

214
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,540
you wish Xizhou's people cultivate money
from the fields,

215
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,620
you must not overwork yourself to ruin,

216
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,660
Besides,

217
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,180
we've only been in Xizhou for a few days,

218
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,300
You and Mr, Pei
have both encountered many dangers,

219
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,740
and yet you two still consider others
at every turn,

220
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,320
I think it's not worth it for you,

221
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,140
The dangers that I and Shouyue have encountered

222
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,580
are not related to the people of Xizhou,
am I right?

223
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,220
You're not allowed to say such words anymore,

224
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,688
Fine,

225
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,848
My Lady,

226
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,280
you were just shocked a few days ago,

227
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,940
You should really take a good rest,

228
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,420
Some things really don't need to be rushed,

229
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,980
You don't understand,

230
00:13:13,696 --> 00:13:14,780
You're right,

231
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,900
One more step
and the mother's last wish can be fulfilled,

232
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,940
Some people must be curious about
what this step is lacking,

233
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,200
If he is curious, he will ask,

234
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,460
For some questions,

235
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,660
there will have answers

236
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,740
in seemingly unrelated moments inadvertently,

237
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,820
these two wooden shafts,

238
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,900
should not be of the same thickness,

239
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,100
The one above should be thinner,

240
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,900
go find a wooden shaft that is half as thick
and plane it to be smoother,

241
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,860
the material should be a bit harder,

242
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,220
Pear wood, I think,

243
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,700
I get it,

244
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:07,340
But grinding and processing the pear wood
will take some time,

245
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,420
Minister, it's better to rest first,

246
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,820
I have already informed Zhang Er
about the lost cow case,

247
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,100
He finds the village junior officer
to provide testimony,

248
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,580
Don't worry, you should take a rest,
take care of your health,

249
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,620
I think
this turns out to be a good opportunity,

250
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,580
which can make Pei Xingjian a great fool,

251
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,440
We can benefit without efforts,

252
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,140
Don't look at me like that,

253
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,580
You make me feel nervous,

254
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,740
Just say what you have to say,

255
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,020
If you mess up this matter again,

256
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,740
I will definitely find a new husband
for my sister,

257
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:52,928
I…

258
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,940
What a strong wind,

259
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,020
Everyone has been working hard staying here,

260
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,220
This is the hot soup that Lady has prepared
for everyone,

261
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,660
Please have some while it's hot,

262
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,416
Here,

263
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,780
I really didn't expect,

264
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,220
the wind in Xizhou in spring is really strong,

265
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,260
A gale blows every few days,

266
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,180
It can blow people away even on flat ground,

267
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,488
Senior Official Pei,

268
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,180
Shouyue is back,

269
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,780
Lady must be missing him,

270
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,380
It's Cheng,

271
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,344
Cheng is…

272
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,100
It's Mr, Pei who brings Cheng back,

273
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,780
I'll get a cup of water for Mr, Pei,

274
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,340
I'm going to prepare the food,

275
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,380
Such a strong wind,

276
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,940
why did you hurry back on the road at night?

277
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,260
Your face is frozen stiff,

278
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,080
Should have stayed in Chang'an Workshop
if I had known earlier,

279
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,340
It's more convenient,

280
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,940
What?

281
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,060
Could I be blown away by the wind
while on the road?

282
00:16:54,912 --> 00:16:55,936
Don't worry,

283
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:59,100
I'm adept in martial arts,
I won't be blown away,

284
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,900
Shouyue,

285
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,540
I have something

286
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,300
to discuss with you,

287
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,536
What is it?

288
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,140
Would you be able to talk to Minister Qu

289
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,860
to withdraw our guards outside the mansion?

290
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,020
Being surrounded in the mansion all day long,

291
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,300
I always feel inconvenient,

292
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,320
Furthermore,

293
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,900
let them watch day and night,

294
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,540
won't all our movements be known to him?

295
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,340
It's good as long as you're safe,

296
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,980
Let him be aware of our movements,

297
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,060
What harm would that do?

298
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,616
Come,

299
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:44,740
This is the Bai Die produced by the padder
you improved,

300
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,260
There will still be some impurities,

301
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:53,060
After the Bai Die is seeded and pressed
by the padder,

302
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,500
it will become hard and solid,

303
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,820
This kind of Bai Die

304
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,620
can't weave fine Bai Die cloth,

305
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,820
I always doubt

306
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,900
that there is still one process missing,

307
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,580
When Lady Jing gave you the blueprint,

308
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,480
did she mentioned why did Lady Liuli

309
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,820
made a padder?

310
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,740
Lady Liuli

311
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,660
told Lady Qu

312
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,620
that if she could derive a method
to weave fine Bai Die cloth,

313
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,720
and then taught it to Xizhou's people,

314
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,960
they will earn money

315
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,820
by farming,

316
00:18:47,648 --> 00:18:48,672
Liuli,

317
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,656
In recent days,

318
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,540
I leave early and return late every day,

319
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,100
Whenever I come back, I can always see

320
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,660
you waiting for me in the courtyard,

321
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,540
I feel both heartache

322
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,460
but also a warm feeling inside,

323
00:19:02,528 --> 00:19:03,616
Therefore,

324
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,740
I painted these two lanterns to hang here,

325
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,800
When I go out,

326
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,460
they can accompany you,

327
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,920
Shouyue,

328
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,460
These two lanterns are really beautiful,

329
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,240
Liuli,

330
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,460
As long as you are here,
lanterns will shine for you,

331
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,456
How wonderful,

332
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,464
Shouyue,

333
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,448
Where you are,

334
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,048
there is a home,

335
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,060
How nice,

336
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,552
<i>[Pei's Mansion]</i>

337
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,660
Lady, sir, Minister Qu is coming,

338
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,420
He is waiting in the main room now,

339
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,660
Let's go, let's meet that 'dead peacock',

340
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,824
Minister Qu,

341
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,420
Shouyue, Lady Liuli,

342
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,880
You are here today,

343
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,700
Do you want to inquire about the progress
of the case?

344
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,500
I believe in your ability,

345
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,500
I come here today
because I have something to consult the Lady,

346
00:21:13,216 --> 00:21:14,304
Lady Liuli?

347
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,300
Chongyu comes uninvited, hope you won't mind,

348
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,660
We made the padder by lady's blueprint,

349
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,660
The Bai Die's black seeds are removed,

350
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,320
but we still can't make

351
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,100
that kind of fine Bai Die cloth,

352
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,500
So…

353
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,300
Since you're here to ask the Lady for advice,

354
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,780
then I will leave you alone,

355
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,300
I still have official duties to attend to,

356
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,780
Follow me, please,

357
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,820
Even if the padder is done well,

358
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,980
the de-seeded Bai Die is still too hard,
and there are too many impurities,

359
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,960
that's why it's impossible
to weave a fine and soft Bai Die cloth,

360
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,260
If we really want to use the de-seeded Bai Die
well

361
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,520
I'm afraid we need a specialized loom
for this purpose,

362
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,820
Only by beating the Bai Die
until it's soft and even,

363
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,140
will it be good for weaving cloth,

364
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,380
By that time,

365
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,460
the Bai Die cloth woven by ordinary women

366
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,700
will be finer and softer than burlap,

367
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,408
Loom,

368
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,600
May I ask
if you have the blueprint for this loom, Lady?

369
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,860
The blueprint is not ready yet,

370
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,940
Currently, there are only some crude ideas,

371
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,980
I am not talented,

372
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,740
but I have some insights into manual work,

373
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,980
If the lady needs anything,

374
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,780
I am willing to help you to make this loom,

375
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,420
Has the padder been brought?

376
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,740
In the workshop,

377
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,540
Then let's go and take a look at the padder,

378
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,460
Why does the lady want to move my peacock here?

379
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,180
I just think this peacock is very interesting,

380
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,180
But I'm too lazy to go take a look,

381
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,380
Do you think I resemble this peacock, Lady?

382
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,020
Do you think you're very interesting?

383
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,620
Why does it take so long to serve refreshments?

384
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,660
This tastes awful,

385
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,140
We watched the peacock,
and we ate the refreshments,

386
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,260
Can we talk about serious matters now?

387
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,144
Let's talk,

388
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,340
Based on the blueprint,
I have already made improvements,

389
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,136
Please review it, Madam,

390
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,580
The blueprint had two logs of the same size
at first,

391
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,940
Now one of them has been replaced

392
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,060
with a pear log half the size by you,

393
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,500
You are indeed brilliant,

394
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,620
But there is still something lacking,

395
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,980
What does that mean?

396
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,260
How about replacing it
with a regular-sized iron rod?

397
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,900
The reason why you use pear wood is

398
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,640
because pear wood is firm and hard,

399
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,660
and it is easier to crush Bai Die seeds,

400
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,420
But in terms of hardness and crushing power,

401
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,860
isn't an iron rod stronger than a wooden rod?

402
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,180
Go grab an iron rod,

403
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,080
Yes,

404
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,780
You should know

405
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,820
how precious these fine Bai Die are,

406
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:49,140
I only seen it once in the Bureau of Garment
of the Imperial Palace,

407
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,580
Well, I have also seen it once
at the Princess's palace,

408
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,240
I heard that when you were in Chang'an,

409
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,500
you had a good relationship with the Princess,

410
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,700
It was not really a relationship,

411
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,220
But I have received a lot of care,

412
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,140
All due to the respect for my father,

413
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,220
So, Protector-general Qu had a relationship
with the Princess,

414
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,660
That's not surprising then,

415
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,920
What do you mean?

416
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,460
Those assassins from Guazhou

417
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,540
were sent by the Princess,
even Lady Jing knows that,

418
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,100
Don't you know?

419
00:26:27,072 --> 00:26:28,140
First of all,

420
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,740
I don't know what grievances you have
with the Princess,

421
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,960
and I don't want to know
why she wants to kill you,

422
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,260
Secondly,
even though my father associates with her,

423
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,040
he certainly has no reason to take orders
from her,

424
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,180
Furthermore,
the foundation of my Qu family is in Xizhou,

425
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,860
There is no need to please

426
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,840
the Princess, who is far away in Chang'an,

427
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,660
Assassinating a court-appointed official
is a major issue,

428
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,980
Including their families,

429
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,700
I know that the lady
has been frightened recently,

430
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,980
it is normal to have unfounded thoughts,

431
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,420
However, I have already promised Pei Shouyue
that I will protect you well,

432
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,580
As long as I, Qu Chongyu, am here,

433
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,940
no one dares to harm a single hair on you
in Xizhou,

434
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,180
Minister Qu has already made grand promises,

435
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,140
Then we'll just have to wait and see,

436
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,700
Let's hope
there are no more thieves and rascals

437
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,340
Disturb my peaceful dreams
in the deep of night,

438
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,360
Madam, there's no need to provoke me,
I always do as I say,

439
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,540
I hope so,

440
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,580
Well, it would be even more perfect
with an iron rod,

441
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,304
I shall take my leave first,

442
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,660
Throw it away, it's so dirty,

443
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,660
Madam, wait a miniute,

444
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,100
Is there anything else, Minister?

445
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,660
About the idea of this loom,

446
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,420
For you,

447
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,700
it's still very rudimentary at the moment,

448
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,980
But as long as we work together,

449
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,160
it shouldn't be a big problem to make one,

450
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,380
It's just…

451
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:47,100
I would like to ask the lady about the loom,

452
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,820
How do you plan to deal with it
after finishing?

453
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,300
Obviously,
ask the official workshop to make more,

454
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,220
and distribute them to everyone in Xizhou,

455
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,340
Regarding the matter of the loom and padder,

456
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,100
may I have a word with you?

457
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,220
Go on, please,

458
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,820
These items should only be controlled
by the state,

459
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,120
Then how can the ordinary villagers
make use of them?

460
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,740
They should obey the rules
rather than know more,

461
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,520
You mean,

462
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,060
these items must not be known to the public,

463
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:17,060
or the technique of it can't be spread
out of Xizhou?

464
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,260
The second one, of course,

465
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,580
The rarer something is,
the more precious it becomes,

466
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,880
Xizhou is originally a small place,
with scarce farmlands,

467
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,940
This technique here is part of a grand scheme
for recuperation and regeneration,

468
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,140
Once this technique leaks out,
it can no longer be deemed precious,

469
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,980
You are sure to discern the pros and cons here,

470
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,500
What you worry about is reasonable,

471
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,700
Let's follow what you say on this matter,

472
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,460
can you decide
without consulting with Senior Official?

473
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,540
This idea is mine,

474
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,900
I can naturally make the decision,

475
00:28:48,096 --> 00:28:53,376
<i>[Benefit of the People]</i>

476
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,540
Shouyue, just as you expected,

477
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,740
there is indeed collusion
between Protector-general Qu and the Princess,

478
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,980
But Qu Chongyu doesn't seem to know that,

479
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,580
In this way,
his behavior in Guazhou can be explained,

480
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,380
The risks you face are the same,

481
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,520
But what I cannot understand is

482
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,220
why
does Protector-general Qu obey the Princess?

483
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,500
Could it be that she has some kind of hold
on him?

484
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,800
And that must have something to do
with Qu Chongyu,

485
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,700
That's why it would be hidden from Qu Chongyu,

486
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,140
Nobody tells him about that,

487
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,824
You are right,

488
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,860
I don't know

489
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,780
what exactly does the Princess hold
against the Qu family,

490
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,700
It makes Protector-general Qu hesitant,

491
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,900
and make him listen to obey her,

492
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,020
The coachman that day must have been ordered
by Wang Junmeng,

493
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,120
We can infer

494
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,800
that those assassins from Guazhou

495
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,140
were also let in by him,

496
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,800
So I think except Protector-general Qu,

497
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,100
he should be the person
who knows the truth best,

498
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,740
You wouldn't look for Wang Junmeng, would you?

499
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,860
No, it's too dangerous

500
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,220
Let's go over there,

501
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,340
Wait for me,

502
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,392
Hurry up,

503
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,820
Come on, just let us in, sir,

504
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,460
- What are you going in for?
- Just want to have a look,

505
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,420
Sir, let us go inside, please,

506
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,512
- Out of my way,
- Let us go inside, please,

507
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,020
Sir, did it get captured?

508
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,180
We're just looking at the cow; we won't--

509
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,300
Step back, what do you think you're doing?

510
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,352
I am a veterinarian,

511
00:30:57,344 --> 00:30:58,496
Get in,

512
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,340
Back off, back off,

513
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,520
Why can that person get in?

514
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,020
- Why we can't get in then?
- Yes, why?

515
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,460
Can you treat cows and sheep?

516
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,900
Haven't you seen the notice
posted by the Senior Official?

517
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,880
Apart from scholars and gentry
related to this case,

518
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,220
even livestock dealers and veterinarians
can enter the mansion to look,

519
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,380
So many cows were lost,

520
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,500
Let's see how the Master judges this,

521
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,940
Senior Official Pei is coming out!

522
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:30,220
Senior Official Pei,

523
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,500
So, this is him,

524
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,600
I can't recognize at all,

525
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,780
This is Senior Official Pei,

526
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,140
Bring the relevant people here!

527
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,560
Who are you?

528
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,500
I come from Shangxian Township,
Gaochang County,

529
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,460
I am Zhang Yuanshan,
the Commandant of Militant Cavalry,

530
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,260
It's you, Mr, Zhang,

531
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,860
Give him a seat,

532
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,496
Thank you, Senior Official,

533
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,120
People say that in this place,

534
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,340
no one is willing to offend
for the sake of a scholar

535
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,720
to offend the Zhang family of Dunhuang,

536
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,580
On the contrary, this Senior Official Pei

537
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,040
would rather suffer a loss himself,

538
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,820
also has to bear the thing of austerity
in the government office,

539
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,040
Originally I thought he was incorruptible,

540
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,020
I didn't expect it, before the trail,

541
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,220
he's already started treating the Zhang family
differently,

542
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,340
That's right,

543
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,820
Minister, the trail has begun,

544
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,816
I see,

545
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,580
Shouldn't we really go take a look?

546
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,340
The case has already been handed over to him,

547
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,980
It's inappropriate for us to intervene,

548
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,020
Let's wait and see,

549
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,300
I wonder what trouble that Zhang Er will cause,

550
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:10,900
Zhang Er,

551
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:15,180
he's a legitimate descendant
of Zhang family from Dunhuang,

552
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,260
Even if he is a bit incompetent,

553
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,460
he's not someone ordinary people can provoke,

554
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,860
Senior Official Pei wants to scare him,

555
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,020
I'm afraid he's miscalculated,

556
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,740
Lady, I have found out clearly,

557
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,060
Prefect Wang and Minister Qu are together,
in the official residence,

558
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,128
Mr, Zhang,

559
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,300
you are invited here today,

560
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,220
There is something I would like to ask,

561
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,300
A man named Qiao Qi Yu has a complaint, he said

562
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,900
he went to Chang'an for an examination,

563
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,500
you were entrusted with the forty cows
from his household,

564
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,920
You had an agreement,

565
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,060
the cows will be split fifty-fifty
one year later,

566
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,300
But now,

567
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,120
you did not abide by the previous agreement,

568
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,060
You seized his twenty calves,

569
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:11,620
You even asked him for a year's worth
of grazing income,

570
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,300
Mr, Zhang, how do you explain this?

571
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,660
Senior Official,

572
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,340
Let me explain this matter slowly,

573
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,940
Refer to Qiao Liu,

574
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,700
it's clear that he's blaming me
because he can't shirk the account,

575
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,540
I was thinking of the affection
between uncle and nephew,

576
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:37,100
I devotedly took care of the herd for him,

577
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,500
But the luck this year was unfavorable,

578
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,500
Not one of the calves born survived,

579
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,820
What does it have to do with me?

580
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,640
Since there are no calves to give,

581
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:49,260
he should have given me three cows as payment
for tending to the cows,

582
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,860
But he liked the group of calves
that I recently bought,

583
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,580
- Talking nonsense, twisting the truth!
- Claiming cows belong to him!

584
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:57,600
Such a greedy and unethical person
who defames elders,

585
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,060
Senior Official should add to his crimes,
and exile him thousands of miles away,

586
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,144
Nonsense!

587
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,820
It's clearly because you saw Qiao Liu fail,
and now his father is ill again,

588
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,340
He's waiting to pay expenses and drugs,
you know that,

589
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,660
Yet, you take advantage of the situation
deliberately

590
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,220
How can there be such a heartless elder as you
in this world?

591
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,520
Where did you come from, you little scoundrel?

592
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,020
- How dare you slander me in such a place?
- Silence!

593
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,896
Mr, Zhang,

594
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,020
This is the court,

595
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,180
if you wish to stand, then remove the seat,

596
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,300
It was that scoundrel who slandered me first,

597
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,408
Remove the seat!

598
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,464
Yes,

599
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,540
Now,

600
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:37,700
expel the person who just blurted out nonsense!

601
00:35:42,752 --> 00:35:43,780
Why?

602
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,300
Yes, why?

603
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,820
Whoever disturbs the court again,

604
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,860
I will handle him in this manner,

605
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,580
If Senior Official Pei tortures Zhang Er,

606
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,980
I hope he won't blame us
for handing over this case to Senior Official Pei,

607
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,140
Bai San is here today,

608
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,620
Hitting Zhang Er with sticks ten times,

609
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,220
then Zhang Er won't leave the court alive,

610
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,920
How could the Zhang Family of Dunhuang bear it?

611
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,620
They will certainly not spare
Senior Official Pei,

612
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,540
Minister, Lady Liuli is coming this way,

613
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,456
I see,

614
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,540
Wang Junmeng,

615
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,020
Why do you look a bit nervous?

616
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,620
How… can I not be nervous?

617
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,740
Kudi Liuli is naturally stubborn,

618
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,560
rude and always seeking revenge,

619
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,660
Previously, she had such a fright,

620
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,920
Although this matter has nothing to do with us,

621
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,860
but the coachman is from my mansion after all,

622
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,180
How can she let me off easily today?

623
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,460
Anyway, I have to go find a place to hide,

624
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,980
I think you can't hide anymore,

625
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,208
Why is that?

626
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,000
Don't scare me,

627
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,180
Minister Qu,

628
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,780
Is Prefect Wang here?

629
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,500
Mr, Zhang,

630
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,940
you are the maternal uncle of Mr, Qiao,

631
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,660
You can't be considered as his relative,

632
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,580
According to the law,

633
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:18,000
Mr, Qiao accuses you
of fraudulently obtaining property,

634
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,540
which is not the case
of the inferior accusing the superior,

635
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,540
But according to your statement,

636
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,900
Mr, Qiao is making a false accusation,

637
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,520
The twenty calves newly added to your household

638
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,140
have absolutely nothing to do with him,

639
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,220
Am I right?

640
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,220
Definitely Yes,

641
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,500
Then, where did you get

642
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,780
these twenty calves?

643
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,380
Last year, in late autumn,

644
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,500
some northern herders passed through,

645
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,900
I saw that their calves were very good,

646
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,260
so, I bought twenty,

647
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,420
Our village junior officer can prove that,

648
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,140
Moreover, all the villagers can prove that,

649
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,180
Good,

650
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,180
Bring them all up here,

651
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,060
Minister Qu, Prefect Wang,

652
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,460
Madam Kudi,

653
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,940
Madam, you are hanging around like this,

654
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,460
aren't you afraid of being attacked
by villains again?

655
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,000
I'm timid,

656
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,100
If it weren't for your oath yesterday,

657
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,040
boasting

658
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,280
that as long as you are here,

659
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,460
no one in Xizhou can harm me,

660
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,780
then how dare I roam around like this?

661
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,820
Or probably I still hiding at home now,

662
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,920
shivering in fright and dread,

663
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,620
It's better for you to be careful,

664
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,980
Otherwise, even with twice the manpower,

665
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,800
I may not be able to protect you,

666
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,380
Minister, you can't scare me,

667
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,220
I'm thinking as long as Prefect Wang

668
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,160
can properly restrain the coachman,

669
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,100
Xizhou is still safe,

670
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,380
Prefect Wang, am I right?

671
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,860
I will restrain the coachman, I-I will,

672
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,940
Sir,

673
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,264
You guys,

674
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,980
the words said by Mr, Zhang,

675
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,780
you all shall be aware, right?

676
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,520
Yes,

677
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,500
These calves all belong to Mr, Zhang,

678
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,120
He purchased from the herders in the north,

679
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,848
Exactly,

680
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,512
Good,

681
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,900
According to the laws of our dynasty,

682
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,160
if there are more than three witnesses,
it becomes conclusive,

683
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,380
This is indeed very good,

684
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,440
You are very wise, Senior Official,

685
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,584
Now,

686
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,580
bring the brush and paper,

687
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,100
Since we're concluding the case,

688
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,220
Mr, Zhang, I want you to write down

689
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,940
the entire process of buying the cow,

690
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,420
When, where,
and from whom the purchase was made,

691
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:59,020
This person's approximate age, appearance,
and name,

692
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,360
After writing clearly, press your handprint,

693
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,540
Then you can leave,

694
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,540
You don't need to pay attention to me,

695
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,500
just continue to talk about your things,

696
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,460
Now you are here, I can't talk about anything,

697
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,780
I'm just here for a cup of tea,

698
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,060
I won't disturb you,

699
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,976
I'm leaving,

700
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,140
Junmeng suddenly cares about the case--

701
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,216
Prefect Wang,

702
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,180
don't rush to leave,

703
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,780
I still have something to ask you,

704
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,940
Thank you for your efforts, Mr, Zhang,

705
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,940
Please wait a moment on the side,

706
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,380
Lao Si, bring him a stool,

707
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,600
Take care of him,

708
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,820
Thank you, Senior Official,

709
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,808
Why…

710
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,792
You

711
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,820
were all witnessing Mr, Zhang buying cows,

712
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,940
I wonder
if you still remember what happened then,

713
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,420
Of course,

714
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,904
Now,

715
00:41:44,416 --> 00:41:45,820
take all of them away,

716
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,420
Each of you write down what happened,

717
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:54,080
When and where did Mr, Zhang buy the cow,
and from whom?

718
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,420
What did the person selling the cow look like?
How old were they?

719
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,620
After writing everything down one by one,

720
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,160
press the handprint,

721
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,460
Then bring it back to me,

722
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,180
You guys, no need to worry,

723
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,540
As long as your testimonies don't differ
from Mr, Zhang's,

724
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,380
then the charge of fraud

725
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,220
will naturally not fall upon you all,

726
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,420
How wise you are, your honor!

727
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:27,100
I have heard about this from Zhang Er,

728
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,280
but I did not witness it with my own eyes,

729
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,380
Therefore, I have no idea either,

730
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,160
I was confused just now,

731
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,340
I complied with the…

732
00:42:39,923 --> 00:42:44,479
<i>♫ I write my longing for you in Spring ♫</i>

733
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:51,007
<i>♫ The red plum is in full bloom like you ♫</i>

734
00:42:52,511 --> 00:42:55,327
<i>♫ By the pond, next to the willow trees ♫</i>

735
00:42:55,903 --> 00:42:59,007
<i>♫ I write a poem
to tell our story from the past ♫</i>

736
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:04,255
<i>♫ The years pass by like a bird♫</i>

737
00:43:06,143 --> 00:43:10,655
<i>♫ The destiny always comes with regrets ♫</i>

738
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:17,215
<i>♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫</i>

739
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:22,047
<i>♫ Outside the pavilion, by the bridge ♫</i>

740
00:43:22,047 --> 00:43:25,535
<i>♫ Under the moonlight,
we parted at the doorstep ♫</i>

741
00:43:25,535 --> 00:43:32,031
<i>♫ I've endured hardship
to tell our lingering story ♫</i>

742
00:43:32,031 --> 00:43:35,423
<i>♫ Remembrance of past things ♫</i>

743
00:43:35,423 --> 00:43:38,431
<i>♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫</i>

744
00:43:38,431 --> 00:43:41,983
<i>♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫</i>

745
00:43:41,983 --> 00:43:45,087
<i>♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫</i>

746
00:43:45,087 --> 00:43:48,319
<i>♫ A snowy day, someone sings a sad song ♫</i>

747
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:51,583
<i>♫ Against the window,
I had a drink for pleasure ♫</i>

748
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:54,943
<i>♫ The moon still hangs in the sky,
but I'm no longer in the mood ♫</i>

749
00:43:54,943 --> 00:43:59,839
<i>♫ It's quite and cold outside,
but I grab my pen again ♫</i>

750
00:44:13,298 --> 00:44:18,047
<i>♫ The destiny always comes with regrets ♫</i>

751
00:44:19,858 --> 00:44:25,599
<i>♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫</i>

752
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,166
<i>♫ Outside the pavilion, by the bridge ♫</i>

753
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:32,462
<i>♫ Under the moonlight,
we parted at the doorstep ♫</i>

754
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:38,958
<i>♫ I've endured hardship
to tell our lingering story ♫</i>

755
00:44:38,958 --> 00:44:42,350
<i>♫ Remembrance of past things ♫</i>

756
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:45,646
<i>♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫</i>

757
00:44:45,646 --> 00:44:49,070
<i>♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫</i>

758
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:52,302
<i>♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫</i>

759
00:44:52,302 --> 00:44:55,534
<i>♫ Winter comes again, and flowers wither ♫</i>

760
00:44:55,534 --> 00:44:58,894
<i>♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫</i>

761
00:44:58,894 --> 00:45:02,126
<i>♫ I look outside, like the poems asking ♫</i>

762
00:45:02,126 --> 00:45:07,118
<i>♫ My love, have you
found someone good for you ♫</i>

763
00:45:07,118 --> 00:45:10,495
<i>♫ Remembrance of past things ♫</i>

764
00:45:10,495 --> 00:45:13,503
<i>♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫</i>

765
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:16,942
<i>♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫</i>

766
00:45:16,942 --> 00:45:19,903
<i>♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫</i>

767
00:45:19,903 --> 00:45:23,726
<i>♫ Winter comes again, and flowers wither ♫</i>

768
00:45:23,726 --> 00:45:26,574
<i>♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫</i>

769
00:45:26,574 --> 00:45:29,951
<i>♫ I look outside, like the poems asking ♫</i>

770
00:45:29,951 --> 00:45:35,502
<i>♫ My love, have you
found someone good for you ♫</i>
