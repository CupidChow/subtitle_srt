00:01:37,651 --> 00:01:39,971
It's about time, They should be arriving soon,

4
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:42,400
Wait a moment, Ziyu,

<i>[Drill Ground]</i>

6
00:02:31,131 --> 00:02:33,331
Shouyue, what's going on here?

7
00:02:34,811 --> 00:02:37,211
Master, this is Mr, Su,

8
00:02:38,051 --> 00:02:40,051
The son of General Su Haizheng,
the Prefectural Governor of Yizhou,

9
00:02:40,731 --> 00:02:43,931
This time, he came here on the Prefectural
Governor's orders to supervise the grain collection,

10
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:47,531
Mr, Su,

11
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:54,091
Ziyu, this is Master Juexuan
from the Great Buddha Temple,

12
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,371
Master Juexuan is not only the head
of the Buddhist community in Xizhou,

13
00:02:58,091 --> 00:03:01,091
He was also quite familiar
with Master Xuanzang back in the day,

14
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,291
<i>Master Xuanzang?</i>

15
00:03:04,611 --> 00:03:06,211
<i>That was during the time
of the previous emperor,</i>

16
00:03:06,211 --> 00:03:07,971
<i>He was the most respected person
in the Buddhist community,</i>

17
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,371
<i>His present position is even more
like the shining sun at midday,</i>

18
00:03:13,491 --> 00:03:14,496
Greetings, Master,

19
00:03:16,651 --> 00:03:19,011
I wonder what's the purpose
of your visit this time,

20
00:03:19,531 --> 00:03:21,851
Ziyu, I presume you've heard it,

21
00:03:22,731 --> 00:03:24,311
The resources for buying food
and fodder this time

22
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:26,411
are the meritorious contributions donated
by the Great Buddha Temple,

23
00:03:27,411 --> 00:03:30,451
Since you are worried
that these businessmen from Xizhou

24
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:31,811
are shortchanging,

25
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:34,291
Why not let the high monks
of the Great Buddha Temple

26
00:03:34,971 --> 00:03:37,991
purchase the grains in this drill ground
with their own money

27
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:39,136
and then send it to the military warehouse?

28
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:43,911
You should know that this money contains
the compassion of Buddha

29
00:03:43,911 --> 00:03:45,251
and the merit of the believers,

30
00:03:46,531 --> 00:03:49,411
Who in this world would dare not
to fear retribution

31
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:52,211
and to shortchange at this very moment?

32
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:57,931
Indeed, this is the merit
donated by the believers,

33
00:03:58,651 --> 00:04:00,851
We must watch carefully

34
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:02,891
the exchange for an equal amount of grain,

35
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:06,131
Only then can it be considered worthy
of the Buddha's compassion,

36
00:04:09,451 --> 00:04:10,731
<i>Let monks to collect grain?</i>

37
00:04:13,491 --> 00:04:16,131
Perhaps we should not trouble you
with these mundane matters,

38
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:19,371
Amitabha,

39
00:04:21,171 --> 00:04:25,571
These are the responsibilities of our temple,
it's not trouble at all,

40
00:04:27,491 --> 00:04:32,051
Ziyu, the temple uses its own funds
to buy this grain and fodder,

41
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:33,931
Then it's sent to the military warehouse,

42
00:04:33,931 --> 00:04:36,011
This is merely the way things are,

43
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:40,951
Besides, how could there be any shortchanging
when the temple purchases the grain and fodder?

44
00:04:40,951 --> 00:04:42,811
How could they let those outsiders
try to deceive Buddha?

45
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:47,131
In this way, neither of us need to worry

46
00:04:47,131 --> 00:04:48,611
there's a shortage of military rations,

47
00:04:49,491 --> 00:04:52,091
No need to worry that the merchants in Xizhou

48
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,611
would claim that there is
a discrepancy in the bushels,

49
00:04:54,691 --> 00:04:57,171
Even the soldiers and officers
are seeking leisure,

50
00:04:57,771 --> 00:04:59,531
Wouldn't that be killing several birds
with one stone?

51
00:05:03,651 --> 00:05:05,251
Senior Official Pei's words make some sense,

52
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:10,144
Yes, yes,

53
00:05:10,771 --> 00:05:12,051
It's tied up, put it here,

54
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:14,531
Come on, lend a hand, Amitabha,

55
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:17,091
Thank you,

56
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:18,931
Come on, take it, be careful,

57
00:05:18,931 --> 00:05:20,411
- Thanks, thanks,
- Slow down,

58
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:26,771
Senior Official Pei's idea is really good,

59
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:27,872
Yes,

60
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,224
Slow down,

61
00:05:36,091 --> 00:05:37,451
This way, we won't have to pay extra,

62
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:39,584
Great,

63
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:45,051
What is this all about?

64
00:05:45,051 --> 00:05:46,144
Come on, yours,

65
00:06:15,611 --> 00:06:20,431
Senior Official Pei, Mr, Su, please look
at this well-collected grain,

66
00:06:20,431 --> 00:06:23,051
Will it be donated
to the military warehouse as such?

67
00:06:23,051 --> 00:06:25,011
Or should it be weighed again?

68
00:06:26,611 --> 00:06:29,291
Never mind, I believe in your integrity,

69
00:06:29,971 --> 00:06:32,611
These bags of grain will be counted
and stored directly,

70
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:36,691
Ziyu, you will not weigh them again?

71
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:40,211
Haven't you already said it?

72
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:43,211
How could the temple's grain collection
be short in weight?

73
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,651
You feel

74
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:49,851
the corn weighed by the Great Buddha Temple
will not be short of weight?

75
00:06:51,131 --> 00:06:52,192
It is indeed so,

76
00:06:53,171 --> 00:06:56,256
That's good, Come, someone,

77
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,211
Take a bag of the corn weighed
by the Great Buddha Temple

78
00:06:59,771 --> 00:07:00,800
and pour it into this military measure,

79
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:05,691
Ziyu, think about it,

80
00:07:06,691 --> 00:07:09,131
The previous commotion was all caused
by this military measure,

81
00:07:09,811 --> 00:07:11,211
Now we have the testimony of a high monk,

82
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:13,211
These merchants from Xizhou can all see

83
00:07:13,931 --> 00:07:16,131
the official measures used
in our Tang military warehouse

84
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:17,891
have no slightest error,

85
00:07:18,691 --> 00:07:20,451
This way, they will be thoroughly convinced,

86
00:07:21,731 --> 00:07:23,171
Moreover, the great army is about to arrive,

87
00:07:23,971 --> 00:07:25,131
We must not let the military warehouse

88
00:07:25,131 --> 00:07:27,251
bear the reputation of cheating merchants
with larger measures,

89
00:07:28,091 --> 00:07:29,120
Do you agree?

90
00:07:36,004 --> 00:07:42,304

91
00:07:50,491 --> 00:07:53,871
Ziyu, this…

92
00:07:53,871 --> 00:07:55,851
Amitabha,

93
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,368
This is…

94
00:08:00,004 --> 00:08:04,256
<i>[Official]</i>

95
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:12,171
You've got quite the nerve,

96
00:08:14,491 --> 00:08:16,451
Daring to deceive the advisor
with this large measure,

97
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:21,051
I see you want to use this specially made
large measure

98
00:08:21,691 --> 00:08:24,131
to make things difficult for the merchants
and profit from it,

99
00:08:27,851 --> 00:08:29,491
If it weren't for the timely arrival
of the master,

100
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:31,511
if it were not for the advisor to prioritize
the people's sentiment,

101
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,211
today, you would have your way,

102
00:08:36,051 --> 00:08:39,411
The big battle is imminent, How important it is
to prepare for grain and grass,

103
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:42,851
You carry a heavy responsibility, but you
do not take grain and grass seriously,

104
00:08:42,851 --> 00:08:45,611
For the sake of self-interest, you tarnish
the reputation of the army,

105
00:08:45,611 --> 00:08:49,011
To put it lightly, that's
being blinded by greed,

106
00:08:50,091 --> 00:08:53,251
To put it heavily, that's
having ulterior motives,

107
00:08:55,931 --> 00:08:57,371
Senior Official Pei, please be cautious
with your words,

108
00:08:58,571 --> 00:08:59,731
This may not necessarily be the case,

109
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:01,051
What is the meaning of your words, Mr, Su?

110
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:06,971
Could it be that our Great Buddha Temple

111
00:09:06,971 --> 00:09:08,771
has donated tens of thousands of merit coins

112
00:09:09,651 --> 00:09:12,731
just to deliberately use a small measuring unit
to collect grains

113
00:09:12,731 --> 00:09:16,011
and to under-collect military rations
and harm the great army of the Tang Dynasty?

114
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:21,191
If this is the case, I ask Mr, Su
to take these measures

115
00:09:21,191 --> 00:09:23,731
and lead us monks to Chang'an,

116
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:26,331
I am determined to seek justice,

117
00:09:27,851 --> 00:09:31,051
<i>If the events of today are exposed,
they definitely won't end well,</i>

118
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:35,776
<i>But if we take these monks, I'm afraid…</i>

119
00:09:40,768 --> 00:09:44,411
Master, rest assured, the present Emperor
holds Buddhism in great reverence,

120
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,451
Who would dare commit such a heinous crime
under heaven,

121
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,131
relying on the tiny bit of power in their hands

122
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:53,011
to dare to slander
a highly respected master like you,

123
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:54,811
who is also a Buddhist high monk
devoted to serving the country?

124
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:56,691
If one commits such acts,

125
00:09:57,691 --> 00:09:59,331
who will be willing to support the great army
in the future

126
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:01,531
with money, grain, and effort?

127
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:06,531
If it's so, Xizhou will be shaken,
and the borderlands will be uneasy,

128
00:10:06,531 --> 00:10:08,371
Before the grand army arrives,
the people's morale has already dispersed,

129
00:10:10,451 --> 00:10:12,451
When the time comes,
not to mention the military law,

130
00:10:13,131 --> 00:10:15,971
it can't be tolerated
by the family law or the state law,

131
00:10:19,171 --> 00:10:22,851
Master, please don't talk about escorting you
to Chang'an anymore,

132
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:26,611
If I dare to do so, His Majesty
would be the first not to spare me,

133
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:29,011
Today's matters

134
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:31,491
are merely these petty military officers
corrupting and bending the law,

135
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:35,251
You understand the greater good deeply,
Please don't bother with them,

136
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:46,451
Ziyu, such scums in the army,

137
00:10:47,331 --> 00:10:49,491
I hope you punish them severely
to boost military discipline,

138
00:10:50,211 --> 00:10:51,611
If they are not severely punished today,

139
00:10:52,211 --> 00:10:55,811
the ignorant people will only suspect
that you directed them,

140
00:10:56,411 --> 00:10:57,472
If this gets out…

141
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:04,251
Ziyu, don't let small mistakes
lead to big losses,

142
00:11:04,811 --> 00:11:06,331
It will tarnish the reputation of General Su,

143
00:11:15,971 --> 00:11:16,992
Come here,

144
00:11:28,211 --> 00:11:33,811
Take these people, who secretly swapped
big measures, away and cane them fifty times,

145
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:43,331
If anyone dares to commit this evil act again,
they will be punished double,

146
00:11:50,116 --> 00:11:52,736
<i>[Official]</i>

147
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:26,171
You have all witnessed today's events,

148
00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:28,931
It is said that before the army arrives,
provisions go first,

149
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:31,931
The provisions are of utmost importance
to the army,

150
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:35,891
If the provisions are insufficient,
how can the front line troops repel the enemy?

151
00:12:36,811 --> 00:12:39,131
Then, those who die or get injured will all
be our Tang's soldiers,

152
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:43,711
If one forgets the greater good
of the country for selfish and petty gains

153
00:12:43,711 --> 00:12:46,691
putting their brothers in mortal danger
and abandoning the court,

154
00:12:46,691 --> 00:12:48,211
what's their difference from the beasts?

155
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:50,691
Yes, yes, exactly,

156
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:57,056
You all need to take today as a warning
and not make a single mistake,

157
00:12:57,056 --> 00:12:59,851
Otherwise, you will bring disaster to your
family and regret for your whole life,

158
00:13:10,171 --> 00:13:14,131
Those soldiers who were collecting grain
were really beaten?

159
00:13:16,331 --> 00:13:17,791
I saw it very clearly,

160
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:20,751
Those dozen or so people were pinned down,
their robes were lifted, and they were beaten,

161
00:13:20,751 --> 00:13:22,411
Halfway through the beating,
blood became visible,

162
00:13:22,411 --> 00:13:24,491
By the time the beating was done,
not a single person could move,

163
00:13:25,051 --> 00:13:26,611
Everyone was dragged out by others,

164
00:13:27,611 --> 00:13:29,411
Those men were quite tough,

165
00:13:30,091 --> 00:13:32,451
Despite being beaten into such a state,
none of them cried out,

166
00:13:32,451 --> 00:13:35,171
Just looking at them was even more chilling
than hearing them scream,

167
00:13:36,011 --> 00:13:37,024
Go down, go down,

168
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:49,211
Chongyu, unexpectedly,
Senior Official Pei was so bold,

169
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:51,211
Pei Xingjian's

170
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:54,691
grasp of the situation was just right,

171
00:13:54,691 --> 00:13:56,480
Although today that Mr, Su

172
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,072
hasn't been beaten down to the dust,

173
00:13:59,811 --> 00:14:01,731
he has given everyone

174
00:14:01,731 --> 00:14:03,331
a significant handle against him,

175
00:14:06,411 --> 00:14:09,211
Chongyu, what you said is very true,

176
00:14:10,331 --> 00:14:14,051
You see, as a commander, you can be ruthless,

177
00:14:15,091 --> 00:14:17,611
You can also be unreasonable,

178
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:21,411
But you must have the ability
to protect your own people,

179
00:14:24,411 --> 00:14:26,271
After this turn of events,

180
00:14:26,271 --> 00:14:29,971
I think if Su Nanjin wants to make a name
for himself in the army,

181
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:32,771
it will be like a fool's dream,

182
00:14:35,011 --> 00:14:36,531
But even so,

183
00:14:37,131 --> 00:14:41,531
I heard that this time the Western Army
was led by Su Haizheng,

184
00:14:43,931 --> 00:14:47,351
Then if some tricks are used
on the battlefield,

185
00:14:47,351 --> 00:14:51,051
Pei Xingjian and his disciples
won't be able to turn the tide,

186
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:54,771
General Su Dingfang is a veteran in the army,

187
00:14:55,571 --> 00:14:57,731
His rank is not lower than that of Su Haizheng

188
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:00,371
Presumably, Su Haizheng wouldn't dare
to treat him poorly,

189
00:15:01,331 --> 00:15:04,851
He would just found an excuse
to keep him at a distance,

190
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:06,011
Just not let him make any merit,

191
00:15:09,011 --> 00:15:10,080
Father,

192
00:15:11,571 --> 00:15:15,771
the way you'll think about things
in the future…

193
00:15:16,931 --> 00:15:18,451
I understand, I understand,

194
00:15:23,524 --> 00:15:26,112
<i>[Pei's Mansion]</i>

195
00:15:47,011 --> 00:15:48,211
What is the great joy of today?

196
00:15:48,811 --> 00:15:50,771
You have prepared such a rich feast,

197
00:15:52,491 --> 00:15:53,971
Today is April 17th,

198
00:15:54,571 --> 00:15:56,251
We have been married for a full year,

199
00:15:56,811 --> 00:16:00,571
I just didn't expect you to forget this day,

200
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:15,611
My foolish Liuli, how could I forget it?

201
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,224
Look,

202
00:16:25,411 --> 00:16:27,491
This glaze hairpin matches your name perfectly,

203
00:16:28,771 --> 00:16:30,771
I know you like glaze objects the most,

204
00:16:31,371 --> 00:16:33,851
That's why I specially chose
this glaze hairpin for you,

205
00:16:35,051 --> 00:16:37,531
It's so beautiful, I really like it,

206
00:16:40,171 --> 00:16:41,971
Shouyue, take a seat,

207
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:48,091
I've also prepared a gift for you,

208
00:16:52,891 --> 00:16:54,771
A pair of jade seals I carved
with my own hands,

209
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:03,200
The Seal of Shouyue,

210
00:17:03,851 --> 00:17:04,864
April in the human world,

211
00:17:09,851 --> 00:17:11,091
The beautiful April in the human world,

212
00:17:12,571 --> 00:17:14,451
The April in the human world
that belongs to just the two of us,

213
00:17:16,331 --> 00:17:18,931
The day of the grand wedding feels
as if it were yesterday,

214
00:17:19,931 --> 00:17:21,011
A year has passed in the blink of an eye,

215
00:17:23,691 --> 00:17:27,731
Liuli, I will treat you with the fondness
of our first meeting for all my life,

216
00:17:31,331 --> 00:17:36,811
Shouyue, I wish to walk hand in hand
with you until we are gray and old,

217
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,808
<i>[Rising Sun and Forever Moon]</i>

218
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,488
<i>[Zhang's Mansion]</i>

219
00:18:15,904 --> 00:18:22,848
<i>[Zhang Minniang, a noble lady from Xizhou,
cousin of Zhang Huaiji]</i>

220
00:18:33,491 --> 00:18:36,971
My lady, it is said that the young master
returned a few days ago,

221
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:39,891
Has she returned?

222
00:18:40,851 --> 00:18:44,011
<i>[Nana, maid of Zhang Minniang]</i>
No, no, Madam Murong did not come along,

223
00:18:44,011 --> 00:18:46,011
Only the young master has returned,

224
00:18:47,331 --> 00:18:48,771
My lady, you don't need to worry,

225
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:52,051
I believe Protector-General
has not changed his mind,

226
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:55,531
He still hopes that Minister can marry you,

227
00:18:59,131 --> 00:19:02,851
Even if Protector-General has the intention
to matchmake, Chongyu is…

228
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:09,051
You always consider Minister first
in everything,

229
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:10,891
So many years have passed,

230
00:19:10,891 --> 00:19:13,291
Even a piece of wood should
have been warmed up by now,

231
00:19:14,211 --> 00:19:15,351
I really don't know

232
00:19:15,351 --> 00:19:17,891
what exactly Minister's heart is made of,

233
00:19:26,491 --> 00:19:28,411
He is wholeheartedly thinking
of revitalizing Xizhou

234
00:19:28,411 --> 00:19:30,331
and restoring the prosperity
of Gaochang from back then,

235
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:32,811
Ambitious goals yet to be achieved,

236
00:19:34,251 --> 00:19:36,291
Inevitably, he cannot spare time
for romantic affairs,

237
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:40,011
I know him and understand him,
How can I blame him?

238
00:19:41,331 --> 00:19:45,291
My lady, you are the most beautiful
and talent-rich noble woman in Xizhou,

239
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:47,971
Protector-General Qu also
has always been intentional

240
00:19:47,971 --> 00:19:49,611
to facilitate your marriage with Minister,

241
00:19:50,531 --> 00:19:53,731
All these years, you have been trying
to be worthy of Minister,

242
00:19:53,731 --> 00:19:56,531
How much effort have you made?
How much hardship have you endured?

243
00:19:57,611 --> 00:20:00,171
I don't understand why Minister…

244
00:20:00,171 --> 00:20:01,216
Stop talking,

245
00:20:02,131 --> 00:20:03,571
After all these years of waiting,

246
00:20:04,091 --> 00:20:05,651
what does it hurt to wait a little longer?

247
00:20:07,411 --> 00:20:08,491
I will marry into the Qu family,

248
00:20:09,531 --> 00:20:10,931
I will make him fall for me,

249
00:20:11,931 --> 00:20:14,011
I want everyone in Xizhou to know

250
00:20:14,011 --> 00:20:15,971
that I will become the matron of the Qu family

251
00:20:16,571 --> 00:20:18,211
and the future mistress of Xizhou,

252
00:20:29,668 --> 00:20:35,040
<i>[Warbler Chirp]</i>

253
00:20:35,571 --> 00:20:36,651
Still so tight?

254
00:20:36,651 --> 00:20:37,696
Yes,

255
00:20:38,691 --> 00:20:39,891
I heard that the workshop was very hot,

256
00:20:39,891 --> 00:20:42,771
I specially made a summertime sweet soup
to relieve you from the heat,

257
00:20:45,891 --> 00:20:46,944
Minister,

258
00:20:55,931 --> 00:20:57,451
Be careful, Minister,

259
00:20:57,451 --> 00:20:58,851
I'm fine,

260
00:20:58,851 --> 00:21:01,691
Minister, I'm afraid you'll need
to put on a ring to do this,

261
00:21:02,851 --> 00:21:04,571
In my opinion, to fluff this cotton well,

262
00:21:04,571 --> 00:21:06,251
we only need to make an ordinary small bow,

263
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:09,651
Why did Madam Kudi
make this four-foot large bow?

264
00:21:09,651 --> 00:21:11,851
The bowstring was also made
with the strongest bull tendon,

265
00:21:11,851 --> 00:21:12,991
How to fluff cotton like this?

266
00:21:12,991 --> 00:21:14,051
What do you know?

267
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:21,371
Why hasn't Madam Kudi arrived yet?

268
00:21:21,891 --> 00:21:24,571
She said she was coming to try this bow today,

269
00:21:36,891 --> 00:21:39,611
To fluff all the cotton here
with such a large bow,

270
00:21:39,611 --> 00:21:41,571
could it be that we need to find
a strong man from the army to help?

271
00:21:42,771 --> 00:21:43,872
This is…

272
00:21:44,891 --> 00:21:46,791
Greetings to you, Madam, I'm Zhang Minniang,

273
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,011
So, you are Miss Zhang,

274
00:22:01,211 --> 00:22:05,651
If this bow doesn't work well, Madam,
we can just remake it,

275
00:22:05,651 --> 00:22:07,451
Why would you want to smash it?

276
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,091
Smashing it is also good, If outsiders see it,

277
00:22:10,091 --> 00:22:12,451
they might think that we are building
a bed crossbow to siege a city,

278
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:25,771
Look, Minister,

279
00:22:25,771 --> 00:22:28,691
The cotton has been loosened a lot
by the bowstring,

280
00:22:40,331 --> 00:22:42,611
How do you think of using it this way,
Miss Zhang?

281
00:22:43,451 --> 00:22:47,411
That's great, Madam,
How did you come up with this?

282
00:22:48,491 --> 00:22:50,411
My lady is so smart,

283
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,491
It's not something
an ordinary person can match,

284
00:22:55,091 --> 00:22:57,131
This hammer seems too heavy,

285
00:22:57,651 --> 00:23:00,291
Why not make a handheld hammer
wrapped in iron or lead?

286
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,611
It might be easier to use,
What do you think, Minister?

287
00:23:03,171 --> 00:23:05,771
Your wit is superior, I'm a far cry from you,

288
00:23:06,611 --> 00:23:07,651
Do you understand?

289
00:23:07,651 --> 00:23:10,411
Understood, Sir, I'll get on
with it immediately,

290
00:23:11,908 --> 00:23:13,632
<i>[Warbler Chirp]</i>

291
00:23:15,411 --> 00:23:17,731
Now that the issue has been resolved,
I will take leave,

292
00:23:18,251 --> 00:23:19,331
I'll see you off,

293
00:23:40,651 --> 00:23:41,696
Minister, please stay,

294
00:23:42,491 --> 00:23:43,552
Take care, Madam,

295
00:24:00,932 --> 00:24:04,771
<i>[Hearing Warbler Pavilion]</i>

296
00:24:04,771 --> 00:24:05,792
Don't be anxious,

297
00:24:15,571 --> 00:24:19,131
Chongyu, Song'er has been back for a while now,

298
00:24:19,811 --> 00:24:22,611
The days of his returning to Chang'an
are drawing closer and closer,

299
00:24:23,411 --> 00:24:26,651
This time, on the return to the capital,
I intend to have Lady Jing take him back,

300
00:24:27,171 --> 00:24:29,131
You see, neither you nor I can leave,

301
00:24:29,651 --> 00:24:32,992
Junmeng is also entangled
in governmental affairs,

302
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,451
Moreover, a conflict is about to begin,

303
00:24:36,971 --> 00:24:39,971
I don't want her to stay
in this place of disputes,

304
00:24:40,611 --> 00:24:44,611
We can't trouble the wife
of Senior Official again, can we?

305
00:24:46,211 --> 00:24:47,691
Then let's follow your advice,

306
00:24:54,131 --> 00:24:56,891
Before Song'er leaves,

307
00:24:57,491 --> 00:25:00,851
shall we invite Minniang to come over
for a meal together?

308
00:25:02,811 --> 00:25:05,331
Look, you've been back for three years now,

309
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:09,651
Fuxian is in Chang'an and can't return,

310
00:25:10,651 --> 00:25:14,091
As your father, I just hope

311
00:25:14,091 --> 00:25:17,011
there could be someone understanding
to take care of you,

312
00:25:18,051 --> 00:25:19,771
Minniang is very fond of you,

313
00:25:20,491 --> 00:25:25,931
In terms of character, looks, and talent,
she could be considered one in a million,

314
00:25:27,011 --> 00:25:29,751
I think we should choose a good day,

315
00:25:29,751 --> 00:25:33,111
How about you take Minniang as a concubine?

316
00:25:33,111 --> 00:25:34,811
Why must you bring up old matters again?

317
00:25:37,211 --> 00:25:40,531
I stand by my words, I will not marry
Zhang Minniang,

318
00:25:41,651 --> 00:25:43,131
Nor will I take any concubines,

319
00:25:47,531 --> 00:25:51,371
You also know who stands behind Zhang Minniang,

320
00:25:51,371 --> 00:25:54,091
She represents the prestigious families
of Xizhou,

321
00:25:54,891 --> 00:25:58,731
Currently, Senior Official Pei is increasingly
winning the people's hearts in Xizhou,

322
00:25:58,731 --> 00:26:03,371
You need the support of Xizhou's
prominent families even more,

323
00:26:03,371 --> 00:26:05,011
Indeed, the aid of Xizhou's noble houses
is needed,

324
00:26:06,571 --> 00:26:09,751
However, for so many years, the noble families
of Xizhou have relied on our Qu family,

325
00:26:09,751 --> 00:26:10,971
They have also gained quite a few benefits,

326
00:26:11,491 --> 00:26:12,691
Consider it a mutually beneficial situation,

327
00:26:13,891 --> 00:26:18,291
A marital union would make
this mutual benefit even more stable,

328
00:26:19,931 --> 00:26:23,011
It's just to let you marrying
a woman as a concubine,

329
00:26:23,011 --> 00:26:25,891
Can be described as all advantages
and no disadvantages,

330
00:26:27,011 --> 00:26:30,971
Chongyu, you, you are so clever,

331
00:26:31,531 --> 00:26:33,408
How can you not understand this point?

332
00:26:33,408 --> 00:26:34,411
Without a marital union,

333
00:26:34,411 --> 00:26:36,571
I can still hold them tightly in my hand,

334
00:26:43,211 --> 00:26:47,131
Father, if you get distracted again,

335
00:26:48,051 --> 00:26:52,011
you will lose this round,

336
00:26:53,331 --> 00:26:54,571
Just let it be,

337
00:26:55,211 --> 00:26:58,011
After all, she has waited for you
for so many years,

338
00:26:58,011 --> 00:27:00,771
I have made up my mind, Father, say no more,

339
00:27:01,891 --> 00:27:03,331
All these years have been waited out,

340
00:27:04,171 --> 00:27:08,051
Settling for less is even more
of a hardship for her,

341
00:27:10,371 --> 00:27:13,152
Let's stop playing, You should also stop,

342
00:27:19,812 --> 00:27:21,691
<i>[Hearing Warbler Pavilion]</i>

343
00:27:21,691 --> 00:27:22,851
Don't eat sweets,

344
00:27:50,131 --> 00:27:53,971
My lady, my lord, several guests
from Chang'an have arrived at the door,

345
00:27:53,971 --> 00:27:55,631
The leader said his surname was Mi,

346
00:27:55,631 --> 00:27:57,531
He's here to deliver a letter
on behalf of General Su Dingfang,

347
00:28:36,731 --> 00:28:38,291
Greetings to you, Senior Official Pei,

348
00:28:39,411 --> 00:28:40,871
Sir, no need for excessive courtesy,

349
00:28:40,871 --> 00:28:42,751
I still have to thank you,

350
00:28:42,751 --> 00:28:45,371
It was you who introduced me
to General Su Dingfang,

351
00:28:45,931 --> 00:28:49,211
I have come this time to serve
as a guide in the general's army,

352
00:28:49,211 --> 00:28:50,611
I've come together with the army,

353
00:28:52,091 --> 00:28:53,891
This is a personal letter from General Su,

354
00:29:08,292 --> 00:29:09,451
<i>[To Shouyue, Letter from your foster father]</i>

355
00:29:09,451 --> 00:29:14,971
Senior Official, this lady's surname is Ashina,
Her given name is Yunyi,

356
00:29:15,571 --> 00:29:16,611
You should still remember her,

357
00:29:17,691 --> 00:29:19,651
General Su asked me to bring her here,

358
00:29:20,251 --> 00:29:22,451
She is to be entrusted
to the care of your wife,

359
00:29:24,731 --> 00:29:25,760
Thanks for your hard work,

360
00:29:32,091 --> 00:29:35,211
Darling, you take Miss Ashina

361
00:29:35,211 --> 00:29:36,731
to settle down well in the backyard first,

362
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:47,491
Miss Ashina, please follow me,

363
00:29:48,971 --> 00:29:51,031
No matter where this person wants to take me,

364
00:29:51,031 --> 00:29:52,531
I am absolutely unwilling,

365
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,531
General Su's wife explained it to me,

366
00:29:55,531 --> 00:29:57,991
She said they would take me to your home,
claiming you are good people,

367
00:29:57,991 --> 00:29:59,051
I trust her,

368
00:29:59,051 --> 00:30:01,171
That's why I reluctantly agreed
to her arrangement,

369
00:30:03,131 --> 00:30:05,031
You speak quickly and to the point,

370
00:30:05,031 --> 00:30:06,571
Indeed, it's very much to my liking,

371
00:30:07,091 --> 00:30:08,931
Now that you trust General Su's wife,

372
00:30:08,931 --> 00:30:10,411
feel at ease to stay at our place,

373
00:30:10,411 --> 00:30:12,791
I will slowly explain
the previous matters to you,

374
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:15,131
Calling me Miss Ashina,

375
00:30:15,131 --> 00:30:16,224
Aren't you finding it a mouthful?

376
00:30:18,611 --> 00:30:19,611
Just call me Yunyi,

377
00:30:28,011 --> 00:30:30,331
Please forgive me, Senior Official,
It's all my fault,

378
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:32,591
Miss Ashina

379
00:30:32,591 --> 00:30:34,811
is the daughter of the leader
of the Nishu Tribe in the northeast,

380
00:30:35,771 --> 00:30:38,451
Nishu Tribe and Ashina Helu
have always been at odds,

381
00:30:39,451 --> 00:30:41,451
Last year, they were defeated
and scattered by Helu,

382
00:30:42,051 --> 00:30:44,351
Many of their female relatives
have been reduced to captives,

383
00:30:44,351 --> 00:30:45,651
It was at that time

384
00:30:45,651 --> 00:30:48,291
I bought this lady and her maid with money,

385
00:30:49,211 --> 00:30:50,491
Later, following your orders,

386
00:30:51,011 --> 00:30:52,731
I brought her to the mansion
of General Su in Chang'an,

387
00:30:53,971 --> 00:30:56,491
Only after inquiring in detail did General Su
find out her identity,

388
00:30:57,491 --> 00:31:00,251
General Su plans to send her back to Xizhou
in this Western expedition,

389
00:31:01,411 --> 00:31:03,931
As long as we can contact the Nishu Tribe,

390
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:06,931
General Su will send her back,

391
00:31:08,131 --> 00:31:10,731
If so, we could gain an ally in the north,

392
00:31:11,251 --> 00:31:13,691
Naturally, this can also be beneficial
to the war effort,

393
00:31:14,651 --> 00:31:15,771
My master is meticulous,

394
00:31:16,731 --> 00:31:19,291
Thanks to his thoughtful consideration,

395
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,771
Yes, Senior Official,

396
00:31:22,331 --> 00:31:25,131
This lady is a straightforward
and outspoken person,

397
00:31:25,131 --> 00:31:27,771
She always seeks vengeance for her grievances,

398
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:30,531
I repaid the service of General Su,

399
00:31:30,531 --> 00:31:33,391
The general said a lot
to encourage me to reform,

400
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,911
He also said a lot to persuade this lady
not to bear grudges,

401
00:31:35,911 --> 00:31:37,931
But this lady is still
unyielding and relentless,

402
00:31:37,931 --> 00:31:40,891
She chased after me and scolded me
a few times before her anger subsided,

403
00:31:42,451 --> 00:31:44,811
Senior Official, you must be extra careful,

404
00:31:46,811 --> 00:31:47,872
Thanks for the reminder,

405
00:32:27,171 --> 00:32:29,171
Go, go to your father,

406
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:40,224
<i>[The spiritual tablet of Mrs, Qu, Ms, Zhang,
maiden name Wanling]</i>

407
00:33:00,851 --> 00:33:03,171
Grandmother, I have come to see you,

408
00:33:03,171 --> 00:33:05,571
I'm very obedient,

409
00:33:05,571 --> 00:33:07,991
You can rest assured in heaven,

410
00:33:07,991 --> 00:33:10,891
I will return to Chang'an soon,

411
00:33:10,891 --> 00:33:15,771
It may be a long time before I can come
to see you again,

412
00:33:15,771 --> 00:33:19,251
I won't be able to accompany
my grandpa and my father, either,

413
00:33:19,251 --> 00:33:22,851
Please bless them on behalf of me in heaven,

414
00:33:22,851 --> 00:33:26,371
May they be healthy
and everything goes smoothly with them,

415
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:29,071
The most important thing is
to win a big victory,

416
00:33:29,071 --> 00:33:32,391
In this way, the emperor and empress
will be happy,

417
00:33:32,391 --> 00:33:35,331
I could then come to play in Xizhou again,

418
00:33:35,331 --> 00:33:36,672
<i>[The spiritual tablet of Mrs, Qu, Ms, Zhang,
maiden name Wanling]</i>

419
00:34:14,331 --> 00:34:18,336
Madam, why are you here? I'm exhausted,

420
00:34:19,731 --> 00:34:20,896
Everything is well prepared,

421
00:34:21,664 --> 00:34:22,731
I have carefully

422
00:34:22,731 --> 00:34:25,271
checked every part of that carriage,

423
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,531
And I have

424
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:27,831
given instructions
to each and every one of the servants,

425
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:30,011
Also, there are things you need to deliver
to others after you arrive in Chang'an,

426
00:34:30,011 --> 00:34:31,651
Inside, there is a yellow box,

427
00:34:31,651 --> 00:34:33,291
That box is prepared for Madam Zheng,

428
00:34:35,451 --> 00:34:36,571
There is also a red box,

429
00:34:36,571 --> 00:34:37,731
It's prepared for Madam Liu,

430
00:34:37,731 --> 00:34:39,171
There are also the items for our sister-in-law,

431
00:34:39,171 --> 00:34:40,691
I specifically placed them in the carriage…

432
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,691
Darling, Darling,

433
00:34:46,371 --> 00:34:48,811
what's wrong? What makes you so sad?

434
00:34:48,811 --> 00:34:50,571
Do you really want me to leave?

435
00:34:54,331 --> 00:34:59,451
Darling, how could you have
such a preposterous thought?

436
00:34:59,971 --> 00:35:01,411
If only I were not entangled
with official duties,

437
00:35:01,411 --> 00:35:03,251
I would have gone to Chang'an
to send Song'er on your behalf,

438
00:35:03,251 --> 00:35:05,651
See, there is no difference
whether you go or I go,

439
00:35:05,651 --> 00:35:07,051
You just don't want to stay with me,

440
00:35:07,051 --> 00:35:09,251
Darling, you wrong me,
it's a serious misunderstanding,

441
00:35:09,251 --> 00:35:10,811
I have no such intention at all, Darling,

442
00:35:11,451 --> 00:35:12,971
Well, if you don't believe it,

443
00:35:12,971 --> 00:35:14,931
I'll go to Protector-General now
to have someone else sent,

444
00:35:14,931 --> 00:35:16,011
Stop right there,

445
00:35:18,171 --> 00:35:19,891
I wouldn't feel at ease sending someone else,

446
00:35:20,611 --> 00:35:23,891
I am now the most suitable person
in the entire Xizhou,

447
00:35:29,531 --> 00:35:30,531
Your words make sense,

448
00:35:31,931 --> 00:35:35,331
Darling, do you find it hard to part with me?

449
00:35:37,011 --> 00:35:39,891
Who would find it hard to part with you?
I can't wait,

450
00:35:39,891 --> 00:35:42,211
Then I'll go to Protector-General
to say both of us…

451
00:35:50,651 --> 00:35:52,451
I just can't bear to part with you,

452
00:35:57,251 --> 00:35:58,691
I can't bear to part with you, either,

453
00:36:16,612 --> 00:36:19,072
<i>[Qu's Residence]</i>

454
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:22,531
Everything with Lady Jing
has been arranged, right?

455
00:36:22,531 --> 00:36:23,584
It's been arranged,

456
00:36:25,011 --> 00:36:27,431
Song'er and the rest are now
under the care of Empress Wu,

457
00:36:27,431 --> 00:36:28,691
We can also rest assured,

458
00:36:33,131 --> 00:36:36,211
This is made by Minniang herself
to show filial piety to me,

459
00:36:40,171 --> 00:36:45,611
It is said to be made from the new cotton
from your workshop,

460
00:36:47,211 --> 00:36:48,971
This is indeed comfortable,

461
00:36:49,691 --> 00:36:52,791
It is no less than those in the palace
of those years,

462
00:36:52,791 --> 00:36:54,531
I knew early on that you were capable of this,

463
00:36:56,971 --> 00:37:00,331
Zhang Minniang does know how
to use the stuff from our house

464
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:01,651
to go with the flow,

465
00:37:06,211 --> 00:37:09,451
Minniang said she also made you
a pair of white cotton socks,

466
00:37:10,171 --> 00:37:11,891
She is too shy to hand it to you in person,

467
00:37:12,811 --> 00:37:15,411
It's given to your stepmother
to pass it on to you,

468
00:37:15,411 --> 00:37:16,512
No more massaging for today,

469
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,171
Where are you going?

470
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:21,611
To the workshop,

471
00:37:21,611 --> 00:37:24,331
Sit down quickly, sit down quickly,
you haven't finished doing the massage yet,

472
00:37:28,931 --> 00:37:32,091
You doing massage is more comfortable
than when others do,

473
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:35,551
A little higher, a little higher,

474
00:37:35,551 --> 00:37:38,451
Right, right, just that place,

475
00:37:45,811 --> 00:37:47,011
Well,

476
00:37:48,651 --> 00:37:52,111
you call me in the middle of the night
to accompany you for a drink,

477
00:37:52,111 --> 00:37:53,651
That's not unacceptable,

478
00:37:53,651 --> 00:37:55,371
At least there should be a dish,

479
00:37:58,131 --> 00:38:01,091
There is no dish, It's not like
it's not doable without one,

480
00:38:02,011 --> 00:38:03,291
You at least have something to say, right?

481
00:38:04,931 --> 00:38:07,011
Okay, then I'm asking you,

482
00:38:08,371 --> 00:38:11,531
the finished products from the cotton workshop
are still not for sale at present,

483
00:38:11,531 --> 00:38:13,291
How did Zhang Minniang get them?

484
00:38:17,851 --> 00:38:19,651
How could I know?

485
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:22,251
After all, I am the magistrate of the county,

486
00:38:22,251 --> 00:38:24,131
I can't stand guard at the door every day,

487
00:38:24,131 --> 00:38:25,251
I'm not a gatekeeper,

488
00:38:25,251 --> 00:38:26,811
Am I right or not? You're really…

489
00:38:30,731 --> 00:38:32,051
I lost composure, lost composure,

490
00:38:35,171 --> 00:38:38,011
In everyone's eyes, Zhang Minniang

491
00:38:38,011 --> 00:38:39,851
will be your concubine in the future,

492
00:38:41,851 --> 00:38:43,571
Not to mention the subordinates,

493
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,931
even if she goes to me,
don't I have to give it to her?

494
00:38:48,051 --> 00:38:50,571
Don't let her into the cotton workshop
in the future,

495
00:39:39,651 --> 00:39:42,531
Senior Official Pei, please hold on,
Are you going to the military today?

496
00:39:42,531 --> 00:39:43,891
Will you meet General Su Dingfang?

497
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,291
I have matters to attend to
and cannot disclose that,

498
00:39:48,091 --> 00:39:50,051
It is said that General Su has already arrived
outside the city,

499
00:39:50,051 --> 00:39:51,191
Take me to see him,

500
00:39:51,191 --> 00:39:52,551
I am most familiar with the roads here,

501
00:39:52,551 --> 00:39:53,971
I will certainly be able to lend him
a helping hand,

502
00:39:53,971 --> 00:39:55,611
May he soon annihilate that bandit Helu,

503
00:39:56,651 --> 00:39:57,728
Yunyi,

504
00:40:04,531 --> 00:40:06,331
Yunyi, don't be anxious,

505
00:40:07,251 --> 00:40:09,991
This time, 100,000 valiant troops of the Tang Dynasty
embarked on a campaign to the Western Regions,

506
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:12,151
Their purpose is to quell the rebel army,

507
00:40:12,151 --> 00:40:15,771
Once there is good news,
you will be sent back immediately,

508
00:40:16,371 --> 00:40:18,931
Why rush to reunite with your family?

509
00:40:19,651 --> 00:40:21,491
How can we reunite if Helu is not killed?

510
00:40:22,051 --> 00:40:23,891
You always say these words to appease me,

511
00:40:23,891 --> 00:40:25,291
But you're just treating me as a burden,

512
00:40:28,731 --> 00:40:31,131
Yunyi, if you don't want to be a burden,

513
00:40:31,851 --> 00:40:34,251
you'd better wait patiently
in the city of Xizhou

514
00:40:34,251 --> 00:40:35,691
for the news at the front line,

515
00:40:36,451 --> 00:40:39,651
Not to mention the strict discipline of the Tang army,
Women are not allowed in the camp,

516
00:40:39,651 --> 00:40:41,171
Even if you can go to the army camp,

517
00:40:41,691 --> 00:40:44,691
can you still join the battle and fight the enemy
when the two armies face each other?

518
00:40:45,291 --> 00:40:48,671
At that time, General Su has to deploy
manpower to protect you instead,

519
00:40:48,671 --> 00:40:50,211
You will be truly a burden then,

520
00:40:55,211 --> 00:40:56,331
You first settle down with peace of mind,

521
00:40:56,891 --> 00:40:59,811
Let's go out and check out furniture
and appliances later,

522
00:40:59,811 --> 00:41:02,651
What about decorating the courtyard next door?

523
00:41:04,731 --> 00:41:07,271
No need to decorate it, just pitch a tent here,

524
00:41:07,271 --> 00:41:08,451
As long as I can fit, it's fine,

525
00:41:09,491 --> 00:41:10,751
You have a special status,

526
00:41:10,751 --> 00:41:13,291
It's best not to let outsiders know for now,

527
00:41:13,291 --> 00:41:15,131
Didn't we agree on this?

528
00:41:15,131 --> 00:41:17,031
To outsiders, you're my younger sister,

529
00:41:17,031 --> 00:41:20,011
If you live in a tent, who would believe
you're my younger sister?

530
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,031
Wait for me to freshen up,

531
00:41:25,031 --> 00:41:26,731
I'll go with you
to stroll the streets right away,

532
00:41:29,371 --> 00:41:30,464
I don't need your company,

533
00:41:32,731 --> 00:41:34,251
Ni, Ni,

534
00:41:34,251 --> 00:41:35,328
My lady,

535
00:41:35,328 --> 00:41:37,551
Quickly follow Yunyi, Don't let her get lost,

536
00:41:37,551 --> 00:41:38,592
Yes,

00:41:44,804 --> 00:41:49,156

My lady, there's a small shop over there
specializing in ornaments,

539
00:41:57,211 --> 00:41:58,272
Do you want to take a look?

00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,811

that specializes in Chang'an silk and satin,

541
00:42:03,811 --> 00:42:05,152
