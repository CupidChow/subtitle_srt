00:01:23,127 --> 00:01:30,583
<i>[Weaving A Tale of Love 2]</i>

2
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:36,023
<i>[Episode 7]</i>

3
00:01:36,815 --> 00:01:38,295
The journey to the Xizhou is far and long,

4
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,975
I don't know how much trouble you've caused

5
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,955
or how long His Majesty will keep you there,

6
00:01:42,955 --> 00:01:44,655
So, if there's enough time,

7
00:01:44,655 --> 00:01:46,675
after I get things done in the Luoyang estates,

8
00:01:46,675 --> 00:01:48,155
I'd like to visit uncle, auntie,

9
00:01:48,155 --> 00:01:49,655
my foster mother, grandpa, and Shun,

10
00:01:51,015 --> 00:01:53,855
I also want to say goodbye to Lady Wu,

11
00:01:53,855 --> 00:01:55,015
Will you allow me to go or not?

12
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,535
You little downy bird,

13
00:02:00,735 --> 00:02:01,855
I can't hide anything from you

14
00:02:04,175 --> 00:02:06,135
Lady Wu is affectionate and loyal to you,

15
00:02:07,855 --> 00:02:09,135
Naturally, you should go and see her,

16
00:02:13,295 --> 00:02:18,095
By the way, why don't you ask why I was demoted

17
00:02:19,255 --> 00:02:21,755
and why was I banished to Xizhou?

18
00:02:21,755 --> 00:02:23,275
Wait until these matters are settled,

19
00:02:23,275 --> 00:02:25,435
I'll surely give you a thorough interrogation,

20
00:02:25,435 --> 00:02:27,735
You'll have to explain everything to me,

21
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,815
Xizhou is extremely perilous and savage,

22
00:02:33,495 --> 00:02:34,775
Are you truly willing to go with me?

23
00:02:34,775 --> 00:02:36,275
What do you mean by this?

24
00:02:36,275 --> 00:02:37,535
You are my husband,

25
00:02:37,535 --> 00:02:38,575
I am your wife,

26
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,975
Wherever you go, I should go too,

27
00:02:45,535 --> 00:02:46,935
Why are you doing this? Put me down!

28
00:02:48,015 --> 00:02:49,215
Wherever I go, you shall go too,

29
00:02:49,935 --> 00:02:51,655
Now, your husband is going to bed

30
00:02:52,295 --> 00:02:53,895
Naturally, you should go to bed with me,

31
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:56,415
This time, you cannot escape,

32
00:03:08,615 --> 00:03:10,775
The Crown Prince has just sent a message,

33
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:13,135
stating that His Majesty issued a decree
during the court,

34
00:03:13,855 --> 00:03:16,175
For privately discussing imperial matters,
Pei Shouyue has been demoted

35
00:03:17,135 --> 00:03:18,695
to the Senior Official of Xizhou,

36
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:20,832
I am extremely sorry!

37
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:23,552
Keep talking!

38
00:03:24,295 --> 00:03:25,995
Pei Shouyue thanked His Majesty on the spot,

39
00:03:25,995 --> 00:03:28,695
Great! Excellent!

40
00:03:29,495 --> 00:03:31,975
This… this is really self-inflicted,

41
00:03:32,575 --> 00:03:34,055
Word came from the palace that

42
00:03:34,055 --> 00:03:35,855
His Majesty was greatly angered last night

43
00:03:35,855 --> 00:03:38,015
and ordered Pei Shouyue to set off tomorrow

44
00:03:38,015 --> 00:03:39,375
with no delay,

45
00:03:39,895 --> 00:03:42,495
It can be seen that he is utterly discarded,

46
00:03:43,295 --> 00:03:44,575
Pei Shouyue's residence

47
00:03:44,575 --> 00:03:47,655
is probably turned into complete chaos by now,

48
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:52,775
I wonder if they can attend to the transfer
of the Luoyang estates,

49
00:03:53,895 --> 00:03:56,055
Just a few days ago, Liuli told me

50
00:03:56,575 --> 00:03:57,855
no credit

51
00:03:57,855 --> 00:03:59,455
or monetary settlement is allowed,

52
00:04:01,055 --> 00:04:02,055
I bet at this moment

53
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,895
she must be eager for us
to settle with gold and silver,

54
00:04:04,895 --> 00:04:07,415
Otherwise, the 200,000 strings of cash

55
00:04:07,415 --> 00:04:11,455
could cost her numerous carriages and manpower
to transport to Xizhou,

56
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:18,495
You simpleton,

57
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,935
Are you still thinking about sending her money?

58
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:25,095
Who said I'm going to give her that much money?

59
00:04:28,775 --> 00:04:30,135
Pei Shouyue

60
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:32,055
has lost his mind now,

61
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:35,015
He has even offended his two backers,

62
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:38,255
As for Kudi Liuli,

63
00:04:39,015 --> 00:04:41,755
without Lady Wu being her backer,

64
00:04:41,755 --> 00:04:43,915
she is just a fish on the chopping board,

65
00:04:43,915 --> 00:04:46,495
Why should I give her 200,000 strings of cash?

66
00:04:48,495 --> 00:04:50,375
As for the Pei family of Zhongjuan,

67
00:04:52,695 --> 00:04:55,015
now that Pei Xingjian is down,

68
00:04:55,975 --> 00:04:58,935
who among them dares to confront me?

69
00:05:05,575 --> 00:05:06,695
Madam is so wise

70
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:16,785
<i>[Fortuitous Tranquility]</i>

71
00:05:19,744 --> 00:05:20,815
My lord,

72
00:05:20,815 --> 00:05:23,055
this is the invitation sent by Madam Yang
from the Wu's Mansion

73
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:24,979
<i>[Invitation from Wu's Mansion]</i>

74
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:27,360
<i>[Presenting to Lord Pei,
Shouyue, please come to appreciate tea,]</i>

75
00:05:33,735 --> 00:05:35,095
No need to follow,

76
00:05:35,095 --> 00:05:36,935
If Madam asks, tell her I've gone
to the county office,

77
00:06:07,036 --> 00:06:08,842
<i>[Mother of Lord Wu, Madam Yang]</i>

78
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:16,815
Greetings to Madam Yang from Xingjian,

79
00:06:20,055 --> 00:06:23,095
Shouyue, you are a clever person,

80
00:06:23,895 --> 00:06:25,535
I do not like to beat around the bush,

81
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,375
The Pei and Wu families have been friends
for many years,

82
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,255
I have always regarded you as a close nephew,

83
00:06:33,335 --> 00:06:34,415
All these years,

84
00:06:35,335 --> 00:06:39,455
Lady Wu has also looked out for you and Liuli,

85
00:06:39,975 --> 00:06:41,655
To speak presumptuously

86
00:06:42,455 --> 00:06:45,415
without Lady Wu's mediation and planning,

87
00:06:47,095 --> 00:06:50,855
Liuli might have lost her life long ago,

88
00:06:51,975 --> 00:06:55,895
and you two would never have the chance
to tie the knot,

89
00:07:10,135 --> 00:07:14,135
Now, Lady Wu needs assistance,

90
00:07:15,015 --> 00:07:16,535
You have won the Emperor's deep favor,

91
00:07:17,535 --> 00:07:21,255
You are capable to help Lady Wu,

92
00:07:26,015 --> 00:07:29,095
Yet how can you be so ungrateful,

93
00:07:29,095 --> 00:07:31,015
and even adding insult to injury?

94
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:37,095
It truly bitterly disappointing,

95
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,015
The Wu family has always treated me
with great kindness,

96
00:07:41,935 --> 00:07:44,855
My spouse and I have also been greatly favored
by Lady Wu,

97
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,495
We dare not forget her magnanimity,

98
00:07:47,495 --> 00:07:49,815
What about the deeds you have done recently

99
00:07:51,455 --> 00:07:55,455
and the words you said to His Majesty
in the palace last night?

100
00:07:56,215 --> 00:08:00,535
Is that how you should treat a benefactor?

101
00:08:01,575 --> 00:08:04,935
Princess said you and Shouyue will go westward,

102
00:08:04,935 --> 00:08:06,695
without knowing how many years will pass
before you can return,

103
00:08:07,215 --> 00:08:11,095
So naturally,
the properties in Luoyang have to be sold,

104
00:08:12,015 --> 00:08:14,895
But it's not convenient
to carry so much money and silk,

105
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:18,735
Princess is worried about you,

106
00:08:18,735 --> 00:08:23,015
so she has packed up a couple of boxes
of gold and silver utensils for you,

107
00:08:23,015 --> 00:08:24,215
making it convenient for you to carry,

108
00:08:24,815 --> 00:08:26,315
These boxes of gold and silver

109
00:08:26,315 --> 00:08:30,015
roughly worth over 10,000 strings of cash,

110
00:08:30,655 --> 00:08:32,375
Why don't you take it first?

111
00:08:32,935 --> 00:08:36,415
The rest can be given to you
after you return from Xizhou,

112
00:08:36,935 --> 00:08:37,935
What do you think?

113
00:08:39,015 --> 00:08:40,935
Princess's concerns are very valid,

114
00:08:40,935 --> 00:08:43,395
Shouyue and I are currently bearing guilt,

115
00:08:43,395 --> 00:08:46,295
Even 10,000 strings of cash, I'm afraid,
might bring disaster,

116
00:08:46,295 --> 00:08:49,175
Since you have not yet prepared the money,

117
00:08:50,535 --> 00:08:52,955
I will not trouble Princess then,

118
00:08:52,955 --> 00:08:55,175
It's okay not to sell this manor,

119
00:08:55,695 --> 00:08:56,975
Before leaving Chang'an,

120
00:08:56,975 --> 00:09:00,175
I will hand over the lands and stores
to the clan for safekeeping,

121
00:09:01,735 --> 00:09:03,015
What do you mean by this?

122
00:09:03,575 --> 00:09:04,695
Are you going back on your word?

123
00:09:05,575 --> 00:09:07,815
Liuli, I am warning you,

124
00:09:08,575 --> 00:09:11,615
Shouyue already offended His Majesty
and Lady Wu,

125
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,055
Since you no longer have a backer,

126
00:09:14,575 --> 00:09:16,495
you better be even more sensible,

127
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:19,395
If you comply with the Princess's wishes,

128
00:09:19,395 --> 00:09:20,975
in the future, Princess

129
00:09:20,975 --> 00:09:25,055
will not just watch you and Shouyue grow old
and die in that barbaric land,

130
00:09:26,215 --> 00:09:29,095
Otherwise, you'll both suffer the consequences,

131
00:09:34,215 --> 00:09:35,535
Shouyue,

132
00:09:36,495 --> 00:09:39,215
I forgive you for being irrational
in a thoughtless moment,

133
00:09:39,775 --> 00:09:44,095
If you're willing to make amends
before His Majesty for this matter

134
00:09:44,095 --> 00:09:48,115
and pave the way
for Lady Wu's elevation to Empress,

135
00:09:48,115 --> 00:09:52,855
Lady Wu and I will remain eternally grateful,

136
00:09:56,775 --> 00:09:58,775
Madam, please calm down,

137
00:09:58,775 --> 00:10:00,224
If it's a personal matter,

138
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:02,815
when Lady Wu needs my help

139
00:10:03,655 --> 00:10:05,295
I will definitely exert my utmost effort

140
00:10:05,895 --> 00:10:08,335
to repay Lady Wu's favor to me and Liuli,

141
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:10,015
But regarding the matter
of establishing the Empress,

142
00:10:10,855 --> 00:10:12,535
it's not a personal or familial matter,

143
00:10:12,535 --> 00:10:13,555
but a state affair,

144
00:10:13,555 --> 00:10:15,735
It's a matter of great importance
to the nation's foundation,

145
00:10:16,335 --> 00:10:17,415
I dare not

146
00:10:20,295 --> 00:10:22,275
and will not jeopardize public interests
for personal reasons,

147
00:10:22,275 --> 00:10:25,015
I speak to you with kind words and good intent,

148
00:10:26,415 --> 00:10:29,935
yet you respond with sanctimonious
and self-righteous reprimands,

149
00:10:31,015 --> 00:10:32,655
Your implication

150
00:10:33,655 --> 00:10:38,895
is that Lady Wu doesn't deserve
to be the Empress, right?

151
00:10:46,895 --> 00:10:49,655
I understand the Princess's meaning,

152
00:10:50,415 --> 00:10:52,215
Then, 10,000 strings of cash it is,

153
00:10:53,095 --> 00:10:54,095
But I need you to promise me one thing,

154
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,235
When delivering gold and silver

155
00:10:56,235 --> 00:10:59,775
my uncles and aunts from the Pei family
of Zhongjuan must also be present,

156
00:10:59,775 --> 00:11:00,775
Why?

157
00:11:01,655 --> 00:11:03,295
I swore an oath in public that

158
00:11:04,095 --> 00:11:06,495
the assets of Luoyang will never be used
for my own family,

159
00:11:06,495 --> 00:11:07,815
otherwise, I won't meet a good end,

160
00:11:08,775 --> 00:11:11,815
Therefore,
how much money Princess can gather right now

161
00:11:11,815 --> 00:11:13,295
is not important,

162
00:11:13,295 --> 00:11:17,135
but I can't let the aunts in the clan suspect
that I have embezzled it for my own use,

163
00:11:18,175 --> 00:11:19,655
It is better to do this sooner than later,

164
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,775
How about this?

165
00:11:21,775 --> 00:11:22,775
Tomorrow morning,

166
00:11:22,775 --> 00:11:25,535
I will then invite the aunts
to witness the transaction in the Temple,

167
00:11:26,615 --> 00:11:28,335
No matter if Princess takes it over

168
00:11:28,335 --> 00:11:29,635
or not,

169
00:11:29,635 --> 00:11:32,815
I will bring the contracts
for the fields and shops there,

170
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,055
If no one is willing to buy them at that time,

171
00:11:35,615 --> 00:11:38,615
I will just have them serve
as ancestral properties,

172
00:11:41,095 --> 00:11:45,335
Good, I will pass on your message to Princess,

173
00:11:58,055 --> 00:12:00,495
My lady, what do you plan to do?

174
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,544
No rush,

175
00:12:11,095 --> 00:12:12,175
Let me think it over,

176
00:12:25,415 --> 00:12:26,575
I want to ask you again,

177
00:12:27,255 --> 00:12:30,615
You might act ungratefully
and stand against Lady Wu,

178
00:12:31,575 --> 00:12:36,335
but are you not afraid
of the thunderous wrath of His Majesty

179
00:12:37,015 --> 00:12:39,255
and even disregard your own future prospects?

180
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,655
I receive the ruler's salary,
so I share the ruler's concerns,

181
00:12:44,255 --> 00:12:45,935
To make the country prosperous
and to safeguard people's peace life

182
00:12:46,575 --> 00:12:48,135
are all I ever wanted to achieve,

183
00:12:48,736 --> 00:12:49,815
I have no regrets,

184
00:12:49,815 --> 00:12:51,264
What about Liuli then?

185
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,735
She is your newly wedded wife,

186
00:13:01,335 --> 00:13:03,575
She wholeheartedly wishes
to spend the rest of her life with you,

187
00:13:05,455 --> 00:13:07,975
The environment in Xizhou is harsh and cold,

188
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:14,095
Could you bear to see her suffer with you

189
00:13:14,775 --> 00:13:17,495
and even lose her life?

190
00:13:21,055 --> 00:13:23,495
Considering the years of bonding
between our two families,

191
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:28,455
this is my last reminder for you,

192
00:13:28,455 --> 00:13:31,135
Thank you for your reminder, Madam,

193
00:13:47,815 --> 00:13:49,375
To be the Senior Official of Xizhou?

194
00:13:50,135 --> 00:13:52,295
Do you think it is a comfortable position?

195
00:13:52,295 --> 00:13:53,375
<i>[Su's Residence]</i>

196
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,255
The current situation there is complicated,

197
00:13:56,495 --> 00:14:00,575
Many previous governors have been there,
and none of them achieved good results,

198
00:14:00,575 --> 00:14:02,335
Shouyue knew this,

199
00:14:03,455 --> 00:14:05,088
Now,

200
00:14:05,895 --> 00:14:10,155
The Protector-General Qu of Xizhou is
from the royal lineage of Gaochang,

201
00:14:10,155 --> 00:14:11,415
He has deep roots,

202
00:14:12,615 --> 00:14:15,415
Shouyue's position, Senior Official,
ranks just below him,

203
00:14:17,535 --> 00:14:19,335
I fear that misfortune outweighs fortune,

204
00:14:21,855 --> 00:14:22,975
It's all your fault,

205
00:14:24,175 --> 00:14:26,935
Why did you ask for an imperial order
to go on another expedition to Western Regions?

206
00:14:28,855 --> 00:14:31,255
Shouyue is also as stubborn as a mule

207
00:14:32,415 --> 00:14:35,735
You, as a master, have gone to the West
on multiple expeditions,

208
00:14:35,735 --> 00:14:37,575
How can he just sit idly by?

209
00:14:39,135 --> 00:14:40,615
Even so,

210
00:14:40,615 --> 00:14:43,375
Shouyue is too freewheeling,

211
00:14:44,095 --> 00:14:46,815
Why doesn't he consider Liuli at all?

212
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:51,335
You men want to achieve success,

213
00:14:51,335 --> 00:14:53,015
so you can only see the advantages,

214
00:14:54,055 --> 00:14:55,855
Although Liuli is unyielding and staunch

215
00:14:56,615 --> 00:14:58,975
her body is actually quite weak,

216
00:14:59,495 --> 00:15:01,455
Shouyue knew this,

217
00:15:04,855 --> 00:15:07,975
All right, stop crying now,

218
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:10,175
In a while, Shouyue will come over
to bid us goodbye,

219
00:15:10,695 --> 00:15:11,995
Don't let him hear that,

220
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,695
I want him to hear that,

221
00:15:14,975 --> 00:15:16,735
Xizhou is windy and dusty,

222
00:15:17,535 --> 00:15:19,895
I'm afraid Liuli might be blown away
as soon as she steps out the door there,

223
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,435
Besides, didn't you just say

224
00:15:23,435 --> 00:15:26,635
there is more danger than safety
for Shouyue's journey to Xizhou?

225
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:28,935
What if Liuli gets implicated?

226
00:15:30,255 --> 00:15:32,175
We might as well let him go his own way

227
00:15:32,175 --> 00:15:33,735
and keep Liuli in Chang'an,

228
00:15:34,495 --> 00:15:37,055
At least we can keep her safe and sound,

229
00:15:38,055 --> 00:15:41,535
When Shouyue returns,
they can naturally reunite,

230
00:15:44,815 --> 00:15:48,015
But what if Shouyue doesn't return?

231
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,015
If Shouyue doesn't return

232
00:15:56,615 --> 00:15:58,935
he shouldn't even bring Liuli with him,

233
00:15:59,975 --> 00:16:02,335
General, have you forgotten about Luqi?

234
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:06,035
Do you want Liuli to become the next Luqi

235
00:16:06,035 --> 00:16:07,975
and die for Shouyue?

236
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:19,335
<i>The environment in Xizhou is harsh and cold,</i>

237
00:16:20,495 --> 00:16:25,575
<i>Could you bear to see her suffer with you</i>

238
00:16:26,215 --> 00:16:28,695
<i>and even lose her life?</i>

239
00:16:29,775 --> 00:16:34,095
You're the one who's dragging your family down,

240
00:16:34,655 --> 00:16:38,535
Liuli is not entirely innocent either,

241
00:16:39,895 --> 00:16:42,855
As husband and wife, you are one,

242
00:16:43,615 --> 00:16:47,015
Since you were the first to be ungrateful
and treacherous,

243
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:50,775
don't blame me for being ruthless,

244
00:16:51,895 --> 00:16:55,255
I've heard that His Majesty was furious

245
00:16:56,055 --> 00:16:58,735
and ordered you to assume your position
without delay,

246
00:16:59,655 --> 00:17:01,175
In my opinion,

247
00:17:02,215 --> 00:17:04,815
you need not prepare any other luggage,

248
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:10,215
just bring two coffins with you,

249
00:17:41,856 --> 00:17:42,975
Put it over here,

250
00:17:42,975 --> 00:17:44,855
Ni, pack all of these,

251
00:17:45,655 --> 00:17:47,360
Everything is packed,

252
00:17:48,975 --> 00:17:50,735
How did the books of Shouyue end up here?

253
00:17:52,535 --> 00:17:55,735
This morning, Lady Yu sent some herbal medicine
and tonics,

254
00:17:55,735 --> 00:17:57,595
all of which in your customary diet,

255
00:17:57,595 --> 00:17:59,535
Master has too many books,

256
00:17:59,535 --> 00:18:00,735
I have to clear out some of them to make room,

257
00:18:01,735 --> 00:18:03,355
I'm fine, I don't need to take medicine,

258
00:18:03,355 --> 00:18:04,415
Take all the medicine down,

259
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,535
Pack up these books,

260
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:07,584
Understood,

261
00:18:14,935 --> 00:18:16,075
Where are you taking me to?

262
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:17,635
There are quite many things left unpacked here,

263
00:18:17,635 --> 00:18:19,175
Just leave these small matters to them,

264
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,995
I've been busy
with official duties these past few days

265
00:18:20,995 --> 00:18:22,155
and haven't had the time to accompany you,

266
00:18:22,155 --> 00:18:24,495

00:26:24,475 --> 00:26:25,915
They will be sold to the highest bidder,

350
00:26:25,915 --> 00:26:27,135
That's only fair,

351
00:26:35,175 --> 00:26:37,675
I will hand over these documents to auntie,

352
00:26:37,675 --> 00:26:39,175
Auntie, please be a witness,

353
00:26:47,895 --> 00:26:51,295
Ideally,
these properties should be transferred jointly,

354
00:26:51,295 --> 00:26:54,095
But because they worth too much,

355
00:26:54,095 --> 00:26:55,995
I'm afraid that in a short time,

356
00:26:55,995 --> 00:26:57,935
no one can cough up with so much money,

357
00:26:57,935 --> 00:26:59,335
So, in my view,

358
00:26:59,335 --> 00:27:02,615
it is not implausible
to sell these twelve estates separately,

359
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:04,715
Just over 1,000 strings of cash

360
00:27:04,715 --> 00:27:06,955
could probably buy one of them,

361
00:27:06,955 --> 00:27:10,535
I wonder if all of you here would be willing
to help Shouyue out with this,

362
00:27:21,575 --> 00:27:25,095
Do none of you here want to lend a hand?

363
00:27:32,815 --> 00:27:36,935
It seems that apart from me,
there's really no one willing to help you,

364
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:41,175
Well, the household of Hedong Duke took care
of Shouyue in the first place,

365
00:27:41,775 --> 00:27:43,615
Considering the old times' sake,

366
00:27:43,615 --> 00:27:46,375
it seems like I have no choice
but to help you at this moment,

367
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:50,880
Bring it in,

368
00:28:01,455 --> 00:28:03,015
It's 2,000 taels of gold,

369
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,535
They worth over 10,000 strings of copper coins,

370
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:07,015
If you don't mind it being too little,

371
00:28:07,535 --> 00:28:11,055
just let me take over those manors
and shops to help,

372
00:28:17,055 --> 00:28:19,595
Princess,
for you lending a helping hand to Shouyue,

373
00:28:19,595 --> 00:28:21,015
I am very grateful,

374
00:28:22,055 --> 00:28:24,715
But if the fertile farmlands in Luoyang

375
00:28:24,715 --> 00:28:26,915
are transferred so cheaply,

376
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:28,935
I will feel so sorry for the clan,

377
00:28:29,535 --> 00:28:32,395
I wonder if the Princess can negotiate a bit,

378
00:28:32,395 --> 00:28:34,055
I don't understand what you're saying,

379
00:28:35,415 --> 00:28:37,295
I was born into the royal family,

380
00:28:37,295 --> 00:28:39,575
I have been used to a high standard
of living since childhood,

381
00:28:40,175 --> 00:28:42,575
The price is really something

382
00:28:42,575 --> 00:28:44,095
I don't understand,

383
00:28:44,895 --> 00:28:46,895
But since you were asking for my help,

384
00:28:46,895 --> 00:28:48,375
this was the best I can do,

385
00:28:49,135 --> 00:28:52,235
If anyone from Pei Family
of Zhongjuan feels my money is not enough,

386
00:28:52,235 --> 00:28:53,535
you can always raise the price,

387
00:28:54,415 --> 00:28:57,015
It is fair for the highest bidder to get it,

388
00:28:57,735 --> 00:28:59,915
Whoever wants to raise the price,

389
00:28:59,915 --> 00:29:01,495
say it now,

390
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:04,935
What does everyone here think?

391
00:29:06,735 --> 00:29:07,975
How hypocritical!

392
00:29:08,815 --> 00:29:10,175
If they are sold separately,

393
00:29:10,175 --> 00:29:12,655
we can naturally afford one or two
by pooling our money,

394
00:29:13,175 --> 00:29:15,435
But after we buy them,

395
00:29:15,435 --> 00:29:16,855
we might lose our life
before we can really own them,

396
00:29:32,335 --> 00:29:34,575
Liuli said the highest bidder gets it,

397
00:29:35,095 --> 00:29:36,575
If you're not willing to pay more

398
00:29:37,335 --> 00:29:39,055
then there's no need to waste any more time,

399
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:42,495
We'll settle the payment
and transact the estates,

400
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:45,775
Let's make the delivery clear then,

401
00:29:54,295 --> 00:29:55,392
Hold on,

402
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,335
I'll offer 20,000 taels of gold,

403
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,615
Miss Lu offers 20,000 taels of gold,

404
00:30:19,495 --> 00:30:22,015
I wonder what the uncles
and aunts think about this?

405
00:30:27,895 --> 00:30:29,915
Since it's agreed that the highest bidder wins,

406
00:30:29,915 --> 00:30:32,615
Then, this property will be valued
at 20,000 taels of gold

407
00:30:32,615 --> 00:30:33,895
and transferred to Miss Lu,

408
00:30:40,335 --> 00:30:41,728
Hold on,

409
00:30:48,255 --> 00:30:49,855
What instructions does Princess have?

410
00:30:52,695 --> 00:30:53,695
Madam Jin,

411
00:30:54,935 --> 00:30:56,215
20,000 taels of gold?

412
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,735
What a large sum to speak of!

413
00:30:59,655 --> 00:31:02,135
Lady Kudi clearly stated before that today,

414
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:07,775
the transaction must be settled face to face
in the Pei residence's Temple,

415
00:31:09,095 --> 00:31:11,415
Where is this 20,000 taels of gold of yours?

416
00:31:12,415 --> 00:31:14,215
You're not going to tell us that,

417
00:31:14,215 --> 00:31:16,815
upon receiving the sudden news,

418
00:31:16,815 --> 00:31:20,135
you can't cough up that much
in just one night, right?

419
00:31:20,135 --> 00:31:23,035
If you cannot pay today,

420
00:31:23,035 --> 00:31:25,935
an empty promise will not suffice,

421
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:31,135
Princess, please allow me to explain,

422
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,555
Although I am young,

423
00:31:33,555 --> 00:31:36,455
I wouldn't dare to brag about such things,

424
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:38,695
Since I promise the price,

425
00:31:38,695 --> 00:31:40,295
I will not pay a single coin less,

426
00:31:46,815 --> 00:31:48,375
I certainly trust you,

427
00:31:48,895 --> 00:31:51,555
But no one can break the rules, right?

428
00:31:51,555 --> 00:31:53,135
You can bid 20,000 taels of gold,

429
00:31:53,695 --> 00:31:54,975
I can also bid 30,000,

430
00:31:55,575 --> 00:31:58,135
Wouldn't it be a joke
if we just talk without proof?

431
00:31:59,015 --> 00:32:01,335
This is the Temple of the Pei family,

432
00:32:02,215 --> 00:32:04,735
The ancestral shrine of the Pei family is here,

433
00:32:04,735 --> 00:32:07,055
It doesn't matter if you tease me,

434
00:32:07,055 --> 00:32:11,255
but you cannot disregard the ancestors
of the Pei family,

435
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,695
What do you think, Liuli?

436
00:32:20,975 --> 00:32:22,955
Princess, you offered 2,000 taels of gold,

437
00:32:22,955 --> 00:32:25,055
Miss Lu offered 20,000 taels of gold,

438
00:32:25,055 --> 00:32:28,055
which is ten times the price offered by you,

439
00:32:28,855 --> 00:32:30,775
Since the Miss Lu sincerely wants to buy,

440
00:32:31,455 --> 00:32:34,915
I wonder if Princess could allow her
to pay a little later,

441
00:32:34,915 --> 00:32:36,135
To tell the truth,

442
00:32:36,695 --> 00:32:40,215
even if the Miss Lu pays ten times the offer
of Princess

443
00:32:40,215 --> 00:32:42,195
to buy the twelve manors in Luoyang,

444
00:32:42,195 --> 00:32:43,575
it's still lower than the market price,

445
00:32:44,135 --> 00:32:45,815
But for Pei family of Zhongjuan,

446
00:32:45,815 --> 00:32:47,835
that's a lot more profits,

447
00:32:47,835 --> 00:32:50,535
- Princess, please show mercy,
- No way,

448
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:52,875
So, Princess, are you're implying that,

449
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:54,815
at this moment, no matter who it is,

450
00:32:55,415 --> 00:32:56,735
as long as they can't pay immediately,

451
00:32:56,735 --> 00:32:58,695
then they can't purchase the manors in Luoyang,

452
00:32:58,695 --> 00:33:01,775
Even if they delay slightly,
it is not permissible, right?

453
00:33:01,775 --> 00:33:04,655
Not even a moment can be delayed,

454
00:33:09,135 --> 00:33:11,415
Since the rules are the same for everyone,

455
00:33:12,095 --> 00:33:14,735
then I will proceed according to the rules,

456
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:18,735
Summon the people to bring them up,

457
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:38,535
Here are a total of ten boxes of gold,

458
00:33:39,135 --> 00:33:41,175
each contains no less than 2,000 taels of gold,

459
00:33:42,655 --> 00:33:44,135
If there is even a qian of gold missing,

460
00:33:44,735 --> 00:33:46,455
I'm willing to compensate tenfold,

461
00:33:59,135 --> 00:34:00,224
Wait a minute,

462
00:34:02,615 --> 00:34:04,675
Miss Lu took out 20,000 taels of gold just now,

463
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:06,855
I wonder what opinions Princess still has,

464
00:34:08,415 --> 00:34:10,335
Who sent you here?

465
00:34:11,095 --> 00:34:13,395
Your husband is but a mere warrior,

466
00:34:13,395 --> 00:34:17,255
How could he raise 20,000 taels
of gold overnight?

467
00:34:18,215 --> 00:34:19,735
Please forgive me, Princess,

468
00:34:20,415 --> 00:34:23,015
I'm afraid I can't answer this question,

469
00:34:23,815 --> 00:34:26,275
The highest bidder gets it,

470
00:34:26,275 --> 00:34:27,955
As long as it's fair and just,

471
00:34:27,955 --> 00:34:30,255
it doesn't matter who gets it,

472
00:34:30,255 --> 00:34:31,895
This is Pei's property,

473
00:34:32,735 --> 00:34:37,115
Today, it is being transferred
in the Temple of the Pei family,

474
00:34:37,115 --> 00:34:38,855
If we don't even know who is taking over,

475
00:34:38,855 --> 00:34:40,615
that'd be ridiculous!

476
00:34:40,615 --> 00:34:44,855
What if the person taking over is a mean rascal

477
00:34:44,855 --> 00:34:47,415
or even a lowly person from the marketplace?

478
00:34:47,975 --> 00:34:49,455
If word gets out,

479
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:51,215
who can be held responsible?

480
00:34:57,575 --> 00:35:01,035
If the person who instructed you doesn't come,

481
00:35:01,035 --> 00:35:02,735
we shall drop the matter here,

482
00:35:06,175 --> 00:35:09,335
Let's discuss the matter
of dealing the Luoyang estates later,

483
00:35:18,295 --> 00:35:21,695
Princess, why bother?

484
00:35:22,215 --> 00:35:25,015
<i>Isn't this Madam Yang, the mother of Lady Wu?</i>

485
00:35:26,095 --> 00:35:27,175
How did she come here?

486
00:35:28,535 --> 00:35:32,415
I just wanted to be lazy today,

487
00:35:33,695 --> 00:35:38,095
yet you insult me so openly

488
00:35:43,215 --> 00:35:44,655
Greetings, Madam Yang,

489
00:35:45,215 --> 00:35:46,955
You have always enjoyed peace and tranquility,

490
00:35:46,955 --> 00:35:49,115
but today, you came here personally,

491
00:35:49,115 --> 00:35:50,575
I am filled with gratitude to you,

492
00:35:51,855 --> 00:35:53,568
Liuli,

493
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:02,855
more than a decade ago, Lady Wu saved your life
in the Wu's Mansion,

494
00:36:02,855 --> 00:36:06,375
At that time, you were just a little girl,

495
00:36:07,135 --> 00:36:11,895
Meeting you today can be considered destiny,

496
00:36:12,655 --> 00:36:15,055
Lady Wu sent someone to tell me

497
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:19,975
that you intend to sell the Luoyang estates
at a low price,

498
00:36:20,895 --> 00:36:22,055
She also said

499
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:25,495
Princess intends to help you,

500
00:36:26,095 --> 00:36:28,675
Unfortunately, she doesn't have enough money
at the moment,

501
00:36:28,675 --> 00:36:32,275
I have managed to gather 20,000 taels of gold

502
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:34,215
to help you out a little,

503
00:36:37,135 --> 00:36:38,775
With my status,

504
00:36:39,415 --> 00:36:44,055
Princess,
do you think I can take over this property?

505
00:36:48,615 --> 00:36:52,215
Madam Yang is
of distinguished and honorable family history,

506
00:36:52,215 --> 00:36:54,015
You are also the birth mother of Lady Wu,

507
00:36:55,015 --> 00:36:57,015
Who dares say that you can't?

508
00:36:57,775 --> 00:37:00,735
Even His Majesty would disagree
with that person if he knew,

509
00:37:02,335 --> 00:37:04,315
Pei Shouyue just offended Lady Wu,

510
00:37:04,315 --> 00:37:06,895
Why would Lady Wu help her? Is she mad?

511
00:37:07,535 --> 00:37:09,095
So what if there's a grudge?

512
00:37:09,095 --> 00:37:12,455
It would be crazy not
to take such a great advantage,

513
00:37:14,295 --> 00:37:17,735
Uncles and aunts,
thank you for witnessing today's transaction,

514
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,335
I am very grateful,

515
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:30,935
May all uncles and aunts bear witness,

516
00:37:32,015 --> 00:37:35,815
The appointment has been documented
before setting off,

517
00:37:36,735 --> 00:37:39,415
The border is now in emergency,
and military supplies are pressing,

518
00:37:39,415 --> 00:37:41,535
The assets of Shouyue in Luoyang,

519
00:37:41,535 --> 00:37:43,175
no matter how much money is sold for,

520
00:37:43,175 --> 00:37:46,035
must be offered to the court
in the name of Pei Family of Zhongjuan

521
00:37:46,035 --> 00:37:47,455
to be used as military funds

522
00:37:47,455 --> 00:37:49,535
to fulfill the responsibility of citizens
of the Tang Dynasty

523
00:37:49,535 --> 00:37:51,095
and share the worries of His Majesty,

524
00:38:00,015 --> 00:38:02,215
Pei Shouyue is really audacious,

525
00:38:02,895 --> 00:38:05,155
What gives him the right
to decide this matter by himself?

526
00:38:05,155 --> 00:38:07,495
Today has truly been an eye-opener for me,

527
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:11,195
Someone is selling his own private property,

528
00:38:11,195 --> 00:38:15,135
and donates it to the court
as a military fund in the name of the clan,

529
00:38:16,095 --> 00:38:19,655
But it's considered as audaciousness
by the court officials of the same clan,

530
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:24,095
If His Majesty hears these words,

531
00:38:24,855 --> 00:38:27,935
I wonder
what Lord Pei and everyone here would do,

532
00:38:31,735 --> 00:38:32,815
I certainly have no such intention,

533
00:38:33,495 --> 00:38:34,615
not even a hint,

534
00:38:36,095 --> 00:38:37,175
This money was well donated,

535
00:38:37,175 --> 00:38:38,415
Really well donated,

536
00:38:38,975 --> 00:38:40,415
Well donated, well donated,

537
00:38:44,775 --> 00:38:47,575
I might have to
shamelessly bother Madam Yang once more,

538
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:51,495
Please send someone to deliver the 20,000 taels
of gold to the palace,

539
00:38:57,455 --> 00:39:00,215
Lady Wu and I

540
00:39:00,855 --> 00:39:04,855
never want to take advantage of others' dangers
to covet others' property,

541
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:10,175
Lady Wu persuaded me to come here because

542
00:39:10,175 --> 00:39:16,695
she admired the loyalty Liuli and Shouyue have
towards their country and family,

543
00:39:18,175 --> 00:39:22,495
I originally planned
to do good deeds quietly today

544
00:39:23,335 --> 00:39:27,095
so as to prevent the rumor
of Lady Wu seeking fame and compliments,

545
00:39:27,695 --> 00:39:29,255
Unexpectedly,

546
00:39:29,255 --> 00:39:32,735
Princess is so considerate
of the reputation of the Pei family

547
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:35,975
that I have to step forward to explain,

548
00:39:39,135 --> 00:39:40,415
Princess,

549
00:39:42,135 --> 00:39:44,575
if I have offended you unintentionally today,

550
00:39:45,855 --> 00:39:49,375
please excuse me,

551
00:39:57,815 --> 00:39:59,328
You!

552
00:40:01,055 --> 00:40:02,415
Madam! Madam!

553
00:40:02,415 --> 00:40:03,655
Princess!

554
00:40:03,655 --> 00:40:04,695
- Madam! Madam!
- Princess!

555
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:22,049
<i>[Pei's Temple]</i>

556
00:40:32,575 --> 00:40:34,215
Liuli,

557
00:40:34,215 --> 00:40:38,735
the 20,000 taels of gold today was donated
in the name of Pei Family of Zhongjuan,

558
00:40:38,735 --> 00:40:41,235
but your credit

559
00:40:41,235 --> 00:40:44,575
will be remembered by His Majesty and Lady Wu,

560
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:48,375
I will find a way to have you entitled,

561
00:40:50,055 --> 00:40:51,655
Liuli

562
00:40:51,655 --> 00:40:55,735
Lady Wu has always liked your character
and talent,

563
00:40:56,655 --> 00:40:58,055
She wanted me to ask you,

564
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:00,495
now that Shouyue has gone to Xizhou,

565
00:41:01,095 --> 00:41:04,055
would you like to stay in the palace
to accompany her?

566
00:41:06,975 --> 00:41:08,775
She also said,

567
00:41:08,775 --> 00:41:11,655
if you are unwilling to be
in His Majesty's presence

568
00:41:11,655 --> 00:41:13,335
it's also okay not to stay in the palace

569
00:41:13,335 --> 00:41:15,375
but staying in Wu's Mansion,

570
00:41:18,255 --> 00:41:20,135
Liuli,

571
00:41:20,135 --> 00:41:21,775
you are a woman,

572
00:41:22,615 --> 00:41:26,695
but if you can stay by Lady Wu's side

573
00:41:26,695 --> 00:41:28,055
and help her,

574
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:31,095
your future prospects

575
00:41:32,175 --> 00:41:35,775
may not be less bright than Pei Shouyue's,

576
00:41:37,615 --> 00:41:40,655
Do you understand what I'm saying?

577
00:41:47,295 --> 00:41:48,375
In reply to Madam Yang,

578
00:41:49,015 --> 00:41:52,515
the gracious help and favors from you
and Lady Wu

579
00:41:52,515 --> 00:41:54,015
will never be forgotten by me,

580
00:41:55,255 --> 00:41:56,935
However, I've already made up my mind,

581
00:41:56,935 --> 00:41:59,095
I will leave for Xizhou today,

582
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:02,695
Madam, please convey my gratitude to Lady Wu,

583
00:42:12,535 --> 00:42:14,575
Having you as his wife

584
00:42:16,695 --> 00:42:18,655
is the greatest fortune of Pei Shouyue,

585
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,335
Let me tell you the truth,

586
00:42:22,695 --> 00:42:26,375
if it wasn't for your decent action of

587
00:42:27,375 --> 00:42:30,235
organizing the Pei family's property

588
00:42:30,235 --> 00:42:32,775
to earn a good reputation for Lady Wu,

589
00:42:33,415 --> 00:42:36,015
I wouldn't let you all off like this,
