<i>[Weaving A Tale of Love 2]</i>

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,456
<i>[Episode 13]</i>

3
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,040
If the first thing you do as the Chancellor

4
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,280
is to reduce the already meager treatment
of your subordinates,

5
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,280
aren't you digging a hole for yourself?

6
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,032
Can't it be done without reducing it?

7
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,976
Probably not,

8
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,080
Since this matter has been notified to me,
and I was asked to make a decision,

9
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,340
I guess that Minister Qu has his own ways

10
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,600
to compels me,

11
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,360
If it's merely about cutting expenses,
it's not like there are no solutions,

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,040
It's just that
I feel there's something else going on,

13
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,536
Liuli, are there any paper and ink sticks

14
00:02:13,536 --> 00:02:16,160
in the cargo of our sister's caravan?

15
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,560
Of course there are,

16
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,680
I remember we had two autumn rains
when we just left Chang'an,

17
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,840
What our sister worried about the most

18
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,320
was a cartload of yellow hemp paper
from Yizhou,

19
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,120
They said there were 300 collections,
which is a total of 30,000 pieces,

20
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,660
I also asked our sister

21
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,980
what's the point of transporting so many papers
thousands of miles away?

22
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,440
She said…

23
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,256
Indeed, it is,

24
00:02:55,392 --> 00:02:56,440
Sanlang, how was it?

25
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,040
Pei Mansion is just so so,

26
00:03:01,956 --> 00:03:06,080
<i>[Protector-General's Mansion]</i>

27
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,960
The human resources spending of the office
has been reduced to the utmost extent,

28
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,620
However, there's room for discussion

29
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,280
regarding the miscellaneous expenses,

30
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,840
For example, for items like ink, paper,
ink stones, and mats,

31
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,060
although they seem simple,
there's much that can be done with them,

32
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,960
I wonder how much this expense is going to be,

33
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,620
Nearly 600 strings of coins,

34
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,680
600 strings of coins,

35
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,080
Indeed, The paper in Xizhou had to be imported

36
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,840
from Dunhuang in the early years,

37
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,560
Over the years,
the Minister has opened workshops in Xizhou

38
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,440
to improve the circumstances,

39
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,080
However,
the incoming and outgoing official documents

40
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,160
still use Yizhou's yellow hemp paper,

41
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,480
If they could all written
with local coarse paper,

42
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,320
it could save us two to three hundred strings,

43
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,720
Yes, If the high-quality ink can be
replaced by the low-quality ink,

44
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,360
and we stop replacing supplies
like mats and blankets,

45
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,200
do the math, it'll save us
over three hundred strings of coins,

46
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,520
Out of all miscellaneous expenditures
from Protector-General's Mansion,

47
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,080
the largest amount is paper expense,

48
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,072
The documents used by our official government
are all written

49
00:04:11,072 --> 00:04:13,440
with high-quality paper made with fine hemp
from places like Yizhou and Hangzhou,

50
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,008
The same for Xizhou,

51
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,320
Based on what was recorded
in the account books,

52
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,600
a large quantity of high-quality hemp paper
is being used every year,

53
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,680
There're 300 collections,

54
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,680
The price per collection is 800 coins,

55
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,120
This is twice as expensive
as the price in Chang'an,

56
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,620
<i>[Compensation for Official in Gaochang County]</i>
If I'm not mistaken,

57
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,480
Qu Chongyu wants me to propose this idea
in the next couple of days,

58
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,760
When the sister arrives in Xizhou,
I can only go and beg him,

59
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,320
In this case, firstly of all,
I'll lose credibility for being inconsistent,

60
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,160
Secondly, I'll owe him a favor,

61
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,520
Therefore, I have no choice
but to ask for his help,

62
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,980
If I don't go and beg him,
I'll offend you and the An family,

63
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,200
I'll be completely isolated and helpless,

64
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,880
When the time comes, he'll have a backup plan
that will make me reliant on him,

65
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,960
Okay, then we'll listen to Senior Official Pei,

66
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,224
Okay,

67
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,840
I think that Pei Xingjian has nothing special,

68
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,000
Look,
we've just finished digging a pit for him,

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,720
and he jumps right into it himself,

70
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,680
Things are progressing too smoothly,

71
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,440
I suspect there must be something fishy,

72
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,760
Chongyu, you're overthinking it,

73
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,180
In order to cut the budget,

74
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,020
there are merely two ways,

75
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,680
The first one involves reducing the salary
of officials,

76
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,080
But by doing so,

77
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,400
it would offend all the officials in Xizhou,

78
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,460
Henceforth,

79
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,800
he'll find it difficult to make any progress
in the political arena,

80
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,040
The second way is to start from small things

81
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,600
like controlling stationery consumption,

82
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,520
However,
all of these are properties of the An family,

83
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,360
He practically cut off the financial source

84
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,000
of his own family and relatives
with his own hands,

85
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,880
He'll inevitably have disagreements
with the An family, right?

86
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,320
Disagreement with the An family

87
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,880
equates to having disagreements with Liuli,

88
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,040
He had just arrived in Xizhou,

89
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,560
and he'll be filled with internal troubles
and external challenges,

90
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,920
This move is clever,

91
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,200
By the way, how did you come up with the idea
of sending people from Bai San

92
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,360
and placing them beside him?

93
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,400
This move is smart, very smart indeed,

94
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,880
Give me some peace for a while,

95
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,360
You can go back now,

96
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,160
Chongyu, call me if anything comes up,

97
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,800
<i>If what Bai San reported is true,</i>

98
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,720
<i>then Pei Xingjian would have known
my intentions already,</i>

99
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,200
<i>Then why would he agree so easily today?</i>

100
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,080
<i>He must be doing something I don't know about,</i>

101
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,120
<i>In Xizhou,</i>

102
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,640
<i>I don't allow things that I don't know about,</i>

103
00:07:30,724 --> 00:07:32,960
<i>[Liu's Residence]</i>

104
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,320
Senior Official Pei took the trouble
to come today,

105
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,200
and I truly have something to ask for,

106
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,360
I've searched all over Xizhou,
but I still have no news of my brother,

107
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,320
Therefore, I can only bother
Senior Official Pei,

108
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,200
Good move,

109
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,360
You shouldn't play this move,

110
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,920
If I capture a piece here,
you will lose this game

111
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,640
I just realized the most boring thing
in the world

112
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,200
is playing chess without the right opponent,

113
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,080
No matter, you can just change your move,

114
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,080
The water from Xizhou is indeed clear,
as it originates from the snow mountains,

115
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,120
However,
quality tea in here is somewhat lacking,

116
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,600
There is some good tea in the temple,

117
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,340
Xizhou is quite peculiar,

118
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,920
The best things are kept in the temple,

119
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,500
I noticed
that some families can't afford cooking oil,

120
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,080
yet they donate money for incense oil,

121
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,800
Many people in Chang'an believe in Buddha,

122
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,520
but it has never come to this point,

123
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,320
Does Lady Liu also often go to the temple?

124
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,840
I'm now searching for my family everywhere,

125
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,880
Of course, I have to pray to Buddha
for granting my wish,

126
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,760
Being a devout believer

127
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,440
is a lot easier
compared to being a chess-loving talented lady,

128
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,480
I appreciate this, Lady Liu,

129
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,640
No way,
Without the powerful help Senior Official Pei,

130
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,240
how could it be possible for me
to find my cousin

131
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,280
in Xizhou?

132
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,320
I won't play anymore today,

133
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,300
Senior Official Pei,
you are not only proficient in board game,

134
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,120
but your chess skill is even more profound,

135
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,680
Even if I play white and move first,
it's still hard for me to pass the mid-game,

136
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,640
It's better to admit defeat gracefully,

137
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,720
If it weren't for Lady Liu's help,

138
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,360
it's hard to deceive people's senses

139
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,320
when I do things,

140
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,120
I will leave the city tomorrow,

141
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,960
I'll visit the nearby stronghold and pastures

142
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,280
to search for your cousin Fang's whereabouts,

143
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,160
Thank you for your efforts,
Senior Official Pei,

144
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,940
Senior Official Pei said he'll leave the city
tomorrow to look for Master Fang,

145
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,400
There are only so many people in Xizhou,

146
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,160
My lady, there is no need to worry too much,

147
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,560
I think this Senior Official Pei
is a man of integrity,

148
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,840
He must be a man of his word,

149
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,160
This Senior Official Pei, well,
he's a gentleman for sure,

150
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,360
But a man of integrity? Not necessarily,

151
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,720
Minister,

152
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,760
How did it go?

153
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,800
He went to the west of the city to play chess
and chat with a woman,

154
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,064
They were talking about finding someone,

155
00:11:16,064 --> 00:11:17,140
Is there anything else?

156
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,240
That's all,

157
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:22,640
Right, he said he would leave town tomorrow
to help the lady find someone,

158
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,680
Keep a close eye on him,

159
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,760
Alright, then I'll be going back first,

160
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,392
<i>[Jinse Cotton]</i>

161
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,600
Does this lady want to see the cotton?

162
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,800
Do you have any better cotton?

163
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,820
My lady, what are you talking about?

164
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,580
This is the best white cotton,

165
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,220
If you don't believe it,
go and have a look elsewhere,

166
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,200
Where else can you find
such loose and large clumps?

167
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,000
Why don't you remove the seeds from the cotton?

168
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,480
My lady, you are not from Xizhou, are you?

169
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,280
Removing seeds from the cotton
is such a laborious task,

170
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,940
If I had that kind of time,

171
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,560
I would surely use it for weaving,

172
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,080
Why would I sell it like that?

173
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,240
How much do you sell it for?

174
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,920
Very cheap, It's top-quality white cotton
for eight coins per pound,

175
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,720
You can use it to make winter clothes
and quilts for your servants,

176
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,880
It's the best way to use it,

177
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,040
In Xizhou,

178
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,320
do you usually use this to make filler?

179
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,328
Yes,

180
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,260
White cotton without seeds,

181
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,800
The clothes and quilts which used this filling
must be quite heavy,

182
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,460
Storekeeper,
do you have any finished white layered cloth?

183
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,240
Of course, we have white layered cloth,

184
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,800
It's just that the price is a bit higher,
Fifteen coins per foot,

185
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,400
Fifteen coins per foot?

186
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,720
Fifteen coins per foot,
There's forty feet to a bolt,

187
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,840
That would be 600 coins per bolt,

188
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,320
That's significantly more expensive

189
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,640
than raw silk and satin in Xizhou,

190
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,320
Not to mention comparing it with Chang'an,

191
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,760
If you add the shipping fee,
such a piece of white layered cloth

192
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,440
would sell in Chang'an
for the price of a custom-made fabric printing

193
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,440
just to cover the overall cost,

194
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,080
My lady, you don't know,

195
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,560
This white layered cloth
is extremely difficult to weave,

196
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,000
Some nobles in Xizhou

197
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,040
love to use this white layered cloth

198
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,860
to make face towels and socks,

199
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,940
Therefore, only skillful women can spin it out,

200
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,300
That's why the price is so expensive,

201
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,000
Why don't come inside and take a look?

202
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,960
Please, come inside,

203
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,376
My lady, please have a look,

204
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,800
<i>This white layered cloth
is nothing like what I saw</i>

205
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,240
<i>in the palace back in the days,</i>

206
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,140
Shopkeeper,
why is this white layered cloth so rough?

207
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,240
It feels only slightly better
than ordinary hemp cloth,

208
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,220
Not to mention comparing it to silk,

209
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,420
Is there any better white layered cloth?

210
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,520
The better one would be
the fine white layered cloth,

211
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,280
However, the weaving method of such cloth

212
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,320
has been lost in Xizhou for many years,

213
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,480
In recent years, our Minister of Xizhou,

214
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,740
who has also been trying
to fulfill his mother's last wish,

215
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,800
searched everywhere
for someone skilled in this technique,

216
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,080
But no one has been found,

217
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,240
If you want to see
the fine white layered cloth,

218
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,480
I guess you'd have to go to
the Imperial Palace in Chang'an city,

219
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,680
What's here is all that remains

220
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,680
in Xizhou,

221
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,840
Why would you drink so much
under the broad daylight?

222
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,440
If you want to drink, why didn't you call me?

223
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,140
The weaving method
of the fine white layered fabric

224
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,400
is originally the secret craft
of my Gaochang country,

225
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,040
Along with that brutal war,

226
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:50,480
this secret technique has been lost,
Isn't it ridiculous?

227
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,800
I know you want to fulfill your mother's wish,

228
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,800
But it's been so many years,

229
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,260
after searching all over Xizhou,

230
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,120
we haven't found a single person
who knows this technique,

231
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,920
It's time to let go of this matter,

232
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,760
<i>Chongyu, you must fulfill this wish
for your mother,</i>

233
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,000
<i>You have to remember,</i>

234
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,940
If you can find the weaving technique
for the fine white layered cloth,

235
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,080
the life of people in Xizhou
will definitely get better,

<i>[Qu's Couryard]</i>

237
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,240
What are the triple boils?

238
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,720
When the bubbles are like fish's eyes
with little sound, that's the first boil,

239
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,760
When the rim of the pot bubbles up
like pearls, that's the second boil,

240
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,360
When the water churns with waves,
it's considered the third boil,

241
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,248
If the water has boiled for too long,
it is no longer drinkable,

242
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,184
Give it a taste,

243
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,312

244
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,160

00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,800
remind me over and over again,

When has she ever shown me kindness
all these years?

No, I won't,

The chronic problems of Xizhou over many years
lie actually in taxation and conscription,

00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,680
<i>[Village Mayor Zhou]</i>
The city, markets, and villages are all fields,

313
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,520
Report such political achievements
will certainly delight the Emperor,

314
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,840
but the people of Xizhou are suffering
unspeakably,

315
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,160
Chancellor, this way please,

316
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,160
According to our system, each household' male
is granted a hundred acres of land,

317
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,040
Each year, two dan of grain are paid
as rent along with two lengths of silk as tax,

318
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,640
In addition, there's land tax
that each household has to pay,

319
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,120
By calculation, each year's total payout is
four dan of rice and two lengths of silk,

320
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,928
In fact, it's not really considered much,

321
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,120
But do you know
under the so-called equal field system here,

322
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,080
how much land
does each registered male actually get?

323
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,080
I look forward to the village chief's guidance,

324
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,820

is only several acres at most,
and about ten acres at the least,

327
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,800
Why is it so little?

328
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,400
Chancellor, you should know

329
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,800
that our dynasty's land-granting system
is divided into wide and narrow townships,

330
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,920
The less land in a narrow township,
the lower the tax,

331
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,320
That Officer Qiao has a strong desire
for accomplishments,

332
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,300
The land includes barren hills and sandy lands
to make up the numbers,

333
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,640
He has turned Xizhou into a wide township,

334
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,040
Just now in Lady Jing's kitchen,

335
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,940
I saw so many delicacies,

336
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,200
and I felt hungry too,

337
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,600
Liuli made a pot of porridge

338
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,220
Lady Jing, now I have it for you to taste,

339
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,440
Consider this as Liuli's apology
for using the kitchen,

340
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,360
It seems that you're not only good at painting
but also understand cooking,

00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,880
I just know a little about cooking,
please forgive me, Lady Jing,

343
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,000
Do you really think I'm complimenting you?

344
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,736
Isn't it?

345
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,080
I was curious before about

346
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,360
what kind of person made my father
and brother so anxious,

347
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,920
Indeed, you're not simple,

348
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,712
This taste…

349
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,160
When I was a child, I always hoped to get sick,

350
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,560
Because when I got sick,

351
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,200
my mother wouldn't mind the trouble I caused,

352
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,080
and she would even personally make porridge
for me to eat,

353
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,320
I can't express how happy I was,

354
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,520
Later on, I would always ask her

355
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,920
why the porridge she made smelled so good,

356
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,960
Only then did she tell me that

357
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,200
the secret was this unique ingredient from
Xizhou:

358
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,720
Dayun and Yibeimu,

359
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,600
I guess since your mother is from Xizhou,

360
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,720
she would also add some to your porridge
when you were sick,

361
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,320
Jing, be a good girl,
is the porridge made by mother tasty?

362
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,200
Come, finish the porridge
and you'll get better,

363
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,040
My mother grew up in Xizhou
since she was little,

364
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,080
What she told most to me during her lifetime

365
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,120
is the vast scenery of Xizhou,

366
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,240
She always says that when I grow up,

367
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,020
she would bring me

368
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,560
to Ride horses and herd sheep
on the grassland of Xizhou,

369
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,760
and to living a free and easy life,

370
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,560
I have done it now,

371
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,600
I have returned to Xizhou with my husband,

372
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,120
but she isn't by my side,

373
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,960
Even if I'm truly ill,

374
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,000
I can no longer taste the porridge
cooked by my mother,

375
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,480
Xizhou has always had scarce arable land,

376
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,480
Furthermore, during the Zhenguan era,

377
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,560
a large influx of border soldiers
and refugees migrated here continuously,

378
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,560
This made the land ever more precious,

379
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,880
And it is not easy to cultivate silkworms
in Xizhou,

380
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,800
Weaving tax is challenging enough
to make up for,

381
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,000
We always spend extra money
to buy expensive cotton and silk elsewhere,

382
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:49,120
So, the debt of weaving tax in Xizhou is even
more serious than the debt of farming tax,

383
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,640
Why didn't Protector-General Qiao ever
fall behind when he was in office?

384
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,800
Protector-General Qiao
had extremely cruel means,

385
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,960
In those years, the people of Xizhou
would rather sell their lands and houses

386
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,280
rather than default on debts,

387
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,960
After Protector-General Qu assumed office,
he showed compassion for the people,

388
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,920
and adjusted the annual tax to thirty percent,

389
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,040
Under these circumstances,

390
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,480
he also built workshops
to accommodate traveling merchants,

391
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,620
By increasing income and reducing expenditure,

392
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,160
we have just barely managed
to maintain the current situation,

393
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,800
Senior Official, I shall escort you up to here,

394
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,560
Okay,

395
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,580
Dr, Han, I beg you, please save our cow,

396
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:39,280
Please, save our cow,

397
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:44,120
Dr, Han, please, save our cow, please,

398
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,880
I beg you,

399
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,720
Please, save our cow, please,

400
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,736
Master,

401
00:30:54,368 --> 00:30:59,320
Forget it, kid,
Don't make it difficult for Dr, Han,

402
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,040
We have no money
to pay for the medical fees for the cow,

403
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,960
No, I don't want my cow to die,

404
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,080
Even we cure it today,

405
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,460
we still have to sell it for tax payment,

406
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:17,240
But we only have this one cow left now,

407
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,080
There's nothing I can do,

408
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,240
In Wucheng Township,
eight out of ten households are like this,

409
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,120
If they are made to continue to pay the taxes,

410
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,480
isn't this driving people to their deaths?

411
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,600
Master, shall we…

412
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,960
Dr, Han, I beg you,

413
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:57,408
<i>[Simple and Aspiring]</i>

414
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,600
No need to see me out,
I will come tomorrow to do the carving for you,

415
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,680
Alright, then I won't see you out,

416
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,368
Liuli,

417
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,880
Lady Jing, is there anything else?

418
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,360
No need to say more,
Your kindness is well received by me,

419
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,060
There's not much that I can do for you,

420
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,360
You should be careful yourself,

421
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,720
This is Xizhou, No one can stop
what my father and brother want to do,

422
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,280
No one has ever been able to stop them,

423
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,820
If you want Pei Xingjian to live a long life,

424
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,360
just tell him to stay away
from political affairs,

425
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,920
Xizhou does not need a capable Chancellor,

426
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,800
I understand, thank you,

427
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,960
<i>[Simple and Aspiring]</i>
It's about to snow, Go back early,

428
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,480
- Thank you, Dr, Han,
- The cow is better, thank you, Dr, Han,

429
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,200
- Thank you, Dr, Han,
- Thank you, Dr, Han,

430
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,560
Thank you, thank you, Dr, Han,

431
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,080
That person really has some skills,
That was unexpected,

432
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,680
Zhou, do you recognize this person?

433
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,740
His name is Han Jingzhi,

434
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,960
We all call him Han Si,

435
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,840
He is considered a prominent figure in Xizhou,

436
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,440
He comes from a family of doctors,
but sadly his parents passed away early,

437
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,480
On regular days, he works as a veterinarian,

438
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,720
His medical skills are surprisingly good,

439
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,920
but he is surprisingly odd,

440
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,280
and he is extremely poor,

441
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,460
He's all by himself,
and he doesn't care about daily appearance,

442
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,900
He doesn't interact with the neighbors either,

443
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,480
If people from Xizhou invite him
to treat their cattle and sheep,

444
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,220
he tends not to go more than half of the time,

445
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,720
If we poor villagers invite him,

446
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,240
He picks up his medicine box and go right away,

447
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,080
Of course, almost every visit's fee

448
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,760
is not recovered,

449
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:22,440
Twice a day, once in both morning and evening,
Should be recovered in three days,

450
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,200
But this…

451
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,016
Owe it then,

452
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,400
Thanks, thank you, thank you, thank you,

453
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,840
- Thank you, Dr, Han,
- Thank you,

454
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,440
- Thank you, Dr, Han,
- Thank you, Dr, Han, Thank you, Dr, Han,

455
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,520
Han Si, this's the newly appointed
Senior Official Pei,

456
00:35:39,232 --> 00:35:41,220
- I don't know him,
- You!

457
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:44,880
The cow is fine now, that's great!
The cow is fine now,

458
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,940
Senior Official Pei, please forgive us,

459
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,440
He's just like this,

460
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,800
It's all right, Cheng, Let's go,

461
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,576
Okay,

462
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,840
What a beautiful picture
of a lady leaning against the window,

463
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,880
I really want to look longer,

464
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,800
It starts to snow today,

465
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,080
Why aren't you wearing a coat?

466
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:02,440
Yes, it starts to snow much earlier in Xizhou
than in Chang'an,

467
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,520
I hadn't even noticed,

468
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,880
My mother only spoke of the vastness
of this grassland,

469
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,120
but she never mentioned about the coldness
of Xizhou,

470
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,280
I'm sorry, It was my oversight,

471
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,000
Why are you apologizing for no apparent reason?

472
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,520
After settling in Xizhou,
we should have mourned for the mother-in-law,

473
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,320
This is the place she dreamed of all her life,

474
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,320
Bringing you back to Xizhou
was also her last wish,

475
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,864
We are home now,

476
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,360
but it was wrong of me to delay
due to official duties,

477
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,848
This is all my fault,

478
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,000
You don't need to blame yourself,

479
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,640
My mother will certainly understand
your difficulties,

480
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,312
Shouyue,

481
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,640
Will mother be happy

482
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,400
that we came back?

483
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,400
Yes,

484
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,040
As long as you're safe and happy,

485
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,680
that's what she wanted to see the most,

486
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,080
My mom always says Gaochang is her hometown,

487
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,700
and it's the most beautiful place in the world,

488
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,400
Only in Gaochang can one live a carefree life,

489
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,920
Mom, you better hold me,

490
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,952
Come on,

491
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,180
My lady, take a look at our pears from Xizhou,

492
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,720
It's sweet and crisp,

493
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,160
Thank you,

494
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,720
You don't want? Well, please take care then,

495
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,720
I saw you were chatting with the shopkeeper,
What were you talking about?

496
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,280
Just chatting casually,

497
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,260
The price of cotton and silk here
is about twice the price of Chang'an,

498
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,780
Same for sauce and vinegar,

499
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,600
However, salt is much cheaper than in Chang'an

500
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,180
Besides, there are price differences
in things like millet, rice, and flour,

501
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,120
Of course, these fruits and wild flavors

502
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,480
are quite good and inexpensive,

503
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,600
The new official is taking office and
looking into people's livelihoods,

504
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,200
Come on, follow me,

505
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,840
Fresh fruits,

506
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,000
Come, take it slow,

507
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,920
- Thank you, shopkeeper,
- Take care,

508
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,840
What would you like to have, sir?

509
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,280
Do you have any fine hemp paper please?

510
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,680
You may not know,

511
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,900
<i>[Mahayana Awakening of Faith Shastra]</i>
The local coarse paper is cheap and durable,

512
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,440
One collection only costs fifty-five coins,

513
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,420
One piece of pen costs fifteen coins,

514
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:42,240
<i>[Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā]</i>
High-quality ink, 140 coins, Low-quality ink, 10 coins,

515
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,000
All are affordable and practical,

516
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,960
Owner, how much is the Buddhist scripture?

517
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,520
They vary in thickness,
from three to ten strings of coins each,

518
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,180
That expensive, huh?

519
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:59,560
These scriptures are all
made from fine hemp paper,

520
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,700
Nowadays, scholars are indeed precious,

521
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,440
<i>[Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā text]</i>
It requires so much time and effort

522
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,300
to copy this Buddhist scripture down
word by word,

523
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,120
This price is already very fair,

524
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,560
Turns out, the characters are valuable,

525
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,080
<i>[Hui Bao Pavilion]</i> Why did you bring me here
to buy this Buddhist scripture?

526
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,040
It has a great use of course,

527
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,820
If all goes well,

528
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,360
Lady Sanniang's load of paper
will end up on it,

529
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,940
I understand,
So, you had a plan in mind all along,

530
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:43,000
You were so confident yesterday,
and yet you kept me in the dark,

531
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,280
I only had this idea yesterday as well,

532
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,780
First of all, I don't know the price
of Buddhist scripture yesterday,

533
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,800
Secondly of all, I'm not sure how many scribes

534
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,080
could the An family find,

535
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,040
I could only figure out

536
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,300
after paying a visit to the An family's elders,

537
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,620
Anyway, according to that store's prices,

538
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,500
if we can sell a small half
of that cart of paper,

539
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,680
Sanniang would not suffer too much loss,

540
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,480
If not, then I will think of another solution,

541
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,320
However, this scripture will probably require
a dozen sheets of paper,

542
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,160
According to your calculations,
at least a thousand copies need to be made,

543
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,280
Each scripture must have over 3,000 characters,

544
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,180
It will take a month's time to transcribe,

545
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:21,200
At least twenty people are needed for the job,

546
00:42:29,856 --> 00:42:30,960
Please take your time as you go,

547
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,180
What do I have to hide from you?

548
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:34,480
Then why don't you tell me when you have ideas?

549
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,440
You'll know when the time comes,

550
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,820
Mr, Pei and Lady Kudi,

551
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,680
you two have time
to come to the market again today, huh?

552
