<i>[Weaving A Tale of Love 2]</i>

00:01:32,224 --> 00:01:35,904
<i>[Episode 9]</i>

3
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:47,491
Mr, Pei, good morning,

4
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:50,528
The young lady who lived in this room

5
00:01:50,528 --> 00:01:52,160
set out early in the morning
with their trade caravan,

6
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,191
So early,

7
00:01:53,191 --> 00:01:56,251
Indeed, It's always hard for the caravan,
leaving early and returning late,

8
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:58,531
That young lady is probably
in good relationship

9
00:01:58,531 --> 00:01:59,531
with her fiancé,

10
00:01:59,531 --> 00:02:01,171
Otherwise she wouldn't have come
such a long, difficult way

11
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:02,571
with her fiancé on a business trip,

12
00:02:02,571 --> 00:02:03,651
Fiancé?

13
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:05,411
Yes,

14
00:02:05,411 --> 00:02:07,051
I heard the people in the trade caravan
call him

15
00:02:07,552 --> 00:02:08,611
Mu Sanlang,

16
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:10,231
The two of them have not lived together yet,

17
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:11,491
They must be the couple-to-be,

18
00:02:12,051 --> 00:02:13,051
Don't talk nonsense,

19
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:14,931
Mr, Mu is that lady's cousin,

20
00:02:15,651 --> 00:02:17,371
I misunderstood,

21
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:18,371
I see Mr, Mu

22
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:21,111
is very attentive and caring
to that young lady,

23
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:22,131
Both of them

24
00:02:22,131 --> 00:02:23,291
are good-looking,

25
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,051
So I assumed they were engaged,

26
00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:26,631
It was my fault,

27
00:02:26,631 --> 00:02:27,931
How long has their caravan departed?

28
00:02:29,091 --> 00:02:30,571
About one hour,

29
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:31,584
Cheng,

30
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:33,871
Please go and invite Mi Dalang to the hall,

31
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:35,271
Tell him I need his help,

32
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:36,791
And then we will set out immediately

33
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:37,971
to chase after their caravan,

34
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:39,072
Okay,

35
00:02:46,848 --> 00:02:47,872
Dalang,

36
00:02:47,872 --> 00:02:48,960
Mr, Pei,

37
00:02:53,411 --> 00:02:54,411
What can I do

38
00:02:54,411 --> 00:02:55,651
for you?

39
00:02:55,651 --> 00:02:58,351
Yesterday you said you would give Hong to me,
does it still count?

40
00:02:58,351 --> 00:02:59,351
Of course,

41
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:00,451
I'll bring her here right away,

42
00:03:00,451 --> 00:03:01,651
Then I'll take the lady,

43
00:03:02,331 --> 00:03:03,491
But I can't take her on the road,

44
00:03:04,011 --> 00:03:06,291
I wonder if it would be convenient for you
to take this lady

45
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:07,371
to General Su Dingfang's Mansion

46
00:03:07,371 --> 00:03:09,731
at Changxing Workshop
after arriving in Chang'an,

47
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:13,331
And give him this letter too,

48
00:03:14,811 --> 00:03:16,191
After you return to Xizhou

49
00:03:16,191 --> 00:03:17,651
with General Su's letter,

50
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:19,591
come to me,

51
00:03:19,591 --> 00:03:21,291
You deserve a reward,

52
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:24,271
I'll definitely follow your orders,

53
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:26,251
As for the reward, it's no need,

54
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:29,051
You saved me,

55
00:03:29,691 --> 00:03:31,511
I'll repay you by doing everything for you,
let alone trivial things like running errands,

56
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,691
I would not hesitate to lay down my life
if need be,

57
00:03:34,251 --> 00:03:35,551
A heavy thank you is still necessary,

58
00:03:35,551 --> 00:03:37,931
I will prepare some jars of wine at my mansion,

59
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:39,851
Dalang, do me the favor,

60
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:42,231
You can drink a lot,

61
00:03:42,231 --> 00:03:43,791
I feel ashamed,

62
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,531
But I still have the guts to drink with you,

63
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:51,291
Are you going to
chase after the An family's caravan?

64
00:03:51,971 --> 00:03:53,056
Exactly,

65
00:03:54,091 --> 00:03:56,091
I urge you to set out early,

66
00:03:56,731 --> 00:03:58,491
When I passed through Liangzhou before,

67
00:03:58,491 --> 00:04:00,491
I was given all sorts of trouble
by Advisor Su from Liangzhou,

68
00:04:01,251 --> 00:04:03,251
Not until I gave him
two beautiful female slaves

69
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:05,331
did he let me pass,

70
00:04:06,051 --> 00:04:09,291
I fear this time the An family's caravan
will not escape trouble either,

71
00:04:09,931 --> 00:04:11,531
Besides, that Advisor Su from Liangzhou

72
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:13,088
is a greedy and prurient man,

73
00:04:13,088 --> 00:04:14,112
I'm worried…

74
00:04:14,112 --> 00:04:16,691
That Advisor Su you're talking about
is Su Nanjin?

75
00:04:17,251 --> 00:04:18,304
Exactly,

76
00:04:32,331 --> 00:04:33,851
Your lord, the criminal has been brought,

77
00:04:36,211 --> 00:04:37,331
Isn't this Advisor Liu?

78
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:39,651
How did he end up like this?

79
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:42,491
These cruel officers…

80
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:44,811
They were a bit too heavy-handed,

81
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:47,611
You're despicable,

82
00:04:48,211 --> 00:04:49,891
I feel sick at the sight of you,

83
00:04:51,051 --> 00:04:52,451
I'm blind,

84
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:53,891
I was wrong to trust you,

85
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:56,331
It's my own fault

86
00:04:57,491 --> 00:04:59,211
to end up in such a plight,

87
00:05:00,171 --> 00:05:02,771
But don't get too excited,

88
00:05:03,731 --> 00:05:05,511
All the schemes you've been involved in,

89
00:05:05,511 --> 00:05:06,891
I'm well aware of all of them,

90
00:05:07,731 --> 00:05:10,011
You will certainly not die well,

91
00:05:26,731 --> 00:05:28,411
May you not die a good death,

92
00:05:41,971 --> 00:05:43,611
That Advisor Su from Liangzhou, Su Nanjin

93
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:45,811
is the son of Su Haizheng,
Prefectural Governor of Shazhou,

94
00:05:46,771 --> 00:05:49,171
The Su family has always been attached
to the Grand Princess,

95
00:05:50,091 --> 00:05:52,431
I'm worried that if Liuli arrives
in Liangzhou first, she will be in danger,

96
00:05:52,431 --> 00:05:54,291
We have to get to Liangzhou before Liuli,

97
00:05:55,051 --> 00:05:56,128
Giddyap!

98
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:57,760
Giddyap!

99
00:06:06,931 --> 00:06:07,968
Madam,

100
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:12,451
What is the use of taking medicine?

101
00:06:13,211 --> 00:06:14,240
Where is Lu?

102
00:06:14,971 --> 00:06:16,211
The tasks I gave to her

103
00:06:16,731 --> 00:06:18,551
weren't finished for so many days,

104
00:06:18,551 --> 00:06:20,371
Was she dead?

105
00:06:23,651 --> 00:06:24,711
Your Madam,

106
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:26,511
According to your orders,

107
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,651
everything in Liangzhou
has been properly arranged,

108
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:30,531
Not easy for you,

109
00:06:31,211 --> 00:06:34,531
I thought I need to go to Liangzhou in person,

110
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,491
Madam, it's my fault,

111
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:38,531
Madam, calm down,

112
00:06:39,712 --> 00:06:46,848
<i>[Liangzhou]</i>

113
00:06:48,211 --> 00:06:49,280
What is this?

114
00:06:53,851 --> 00:06:54,944
Next one, Next one,

115
00:06:54,944 --> 00:06:56,451
Come here,

116
00:06:58,171 --> 00:06:59,200
Open it and have a look,

117
00:07:01,771 --> 00:07:02,816
Alright, Go,

118
00:07:04,051 --> 00:07:05,120
Everyone, keep up!

119
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:09,571
Sanniang has been in there for quite a while,

120
00:07:09,571 --> 00:07:10,771
She hasn't come out yet,

121
00:07:10,771 --> 00:07:12,531
Did she run into trouble?

122
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:13,600
Hopefully not,

123
00:07:14,691 --> 00:07:15,771
That's it,

124
00:07:16,611 --> 00:07:17,911
Please take this money,

125
00:07:17,911 --> 00:07:19,531
Not much, but it's a token of our appreciation,

126
00:07:19,531 --> 00:07:20,651
Please, take it,

127
00:07:21,611 --> 00:07:24,011
We are all standard caravans,

128
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:26,171
I've been here for many times,

129
00:07:26,171 --> 00:07:27,731
There definitely won't be wrong,

130
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,711
Something must have been wrong,

131
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:32,731
Or could I explain it to Advisor Su?

132
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:36,960
No need,

133
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:39,251
We have received accurate intelligence,

134
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:41,211
The spy from the north

135
00:07:41,731 --> 00:07:43,611
is hidden among your caravan,

136
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:51,911
How could it be? A misunderstanding,

137
00:07:51,911 --> 00:07:53,711
It must be a misunderstanding,

138
00:07:53,711 --> 00:07:55,051
That northern spy

139
00:07:55,051 --> 00:07:57,131
Is a young and beautiful Hu woman,

140
00:07:57,131 --> 00:07:58,891
She fled from Chang'an

141
00:07:59,611 --> 00:08:00,931
under the guise of an official's wife,

142
00:08:01,571 --> 00:08:03,851
carrying a great deal of military secrets,

143
00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:06,691
If she gets away,

144
00:08:07,851 --> 00:08:10,411
who do you think can bear the responsibility?

145
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:14,431
It sounds like

146
00:08:14,431 --> 00:08:15,811
talking about Liuli?

147
00:08:17,491 --> 00:08:18,691
Yes, this…

148
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:20,291
- Search,
- Yes,

149
00:08:21,611 --> 00:08:23,551
No, no, there's nothing,

150
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,571
Stop, stop,

151
00:08:26,491 --> 00:08:28,051
There really is nothing,

152
00:08:32,131 --> 00:08:33,231
What happened outside?

153
00:08:33,231 --> 00:08:35,751
They said there's a northern spy
in our trade caravan,

154
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:37,611
They are inspecting our carriage and personnel,

155
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:39,328
Civilians should not contend with officials,

156
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:41,411
As long as they don't arrest people
arbitrarily,

157
00:08:41,411 --> 00:08:42,531
let them investigate then,

158
00:08:42,531 --> 00:08:44,291
But their description of this northern spy

159
00:08:45,251 --> 00:08:46,368
is extremely in line with…

160
00:08:47,331 --> 00:08:48,352
What?

161
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:50,528
you, Liuli,

162
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:51,611
Me?

163
00:08:51,611 --> 00:08:52,704
Yes,

164
00:08:57,091 --> 00:08:58,131
Search thoroughly,

165
00:09:00,371 --> 00:09:02,391
They say it's a young and beautiful Hu woman

166
00:09:02,391 --> 00:09:03,520
coming from Chang'an

167
00:09:04,091 --> 00:09:05,631
under the disguise of an official's wife,

168
00:09:05,631 --> 00:09:06,851
Really?

169
00:09:06,851 --> 00:09:08,000
Indeed,

170
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,151
But rest assured,

171
00:09:09,151 --> 00:09:11,011
Gu and I will definitely stop them,

172
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:12,551
As long as I'm still alive,

173
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:13,931
I will certainly not let them do
as they please,

174
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,611
Nothing,

175
00:09:19,611 --> 00:09:20,704
Search that carriage,

176
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:24,171
The one sitting in this is not a spy,

177
00:09:24,171 --> 00:09:25,216
- Go away,
- She's my younger sister,

178
00:09:25,984 --> 00:09:27,776
- Your sister?
- Yeah,

179
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:30,211
Perhaps your sister is that young Hu woman,

180
00:09:35,171 --> 00:09:37,891
No, my lord, the one sitting in the carriage is
indeed my younger sister,

181
00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:39,491
Not a spy from the north,

182
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:41,011
My lord, please listen to me,

183
00:09:41,011 --> 00:09:42,171
- What are you going to do?
- Go away,

184
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:43,712
Lady,

185
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,371
Didn't you say it was your sister?
How is she a Han woman?

186
00:09:58,011 --> 00:09:59,331
She is my foster sister,

187
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:01,191
initially from Chang'an,

188
00:10:01,191 --> 00:10:02,711
But she appreciates the scenery of Xizhou,

189
00:10:02,711 --> 00:10:05,131
- so she begged me to take her there,
- You…

190
00:10:05,131 --> 00:10:06,231
Although my foster sister

191
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:07,411
comes from Chang'an,

192
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:09,191
her family background is absolutely pure,

193
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,651
She is definitely not a spy from the north,

194
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,251
Keep searching, Search thoroughly,

195
00:10:21,651 --> 00:10:23,371
What happened? I don't know,

196
00:10:27,851 --> 00:10:29,691
Break up, Break up,

197
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:32,411
Have they found anything at all?

198
00:10:33,568 --> 00:10:34,688
Sister,

199
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:36,571
I'm afraid if I stay, I may implicate
all of you,

200
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:38,591
Perhaps I should go into the city first
by myself,

201
00:10:38,591 --> 00:10:40,531
Then we can meet up in the mansion in the city,

202
00:10:41,451 --> 00:10:43,951
Alright, be safe on your way,

203
00:10:43,951 --> 00:10:45,391
I will accompany Liuli,

204
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:46,651
Don't cause trouble,

205
00:10:46,651 --> 00:10:48,031
This is Liuli's first time in Liangzhou,

206
00:10:48,031 --> 00:10:49,251
She's unfamiliar with this place,

207
00:10:49,251 --> 00:10:50,491
If I don't accompany her,

208
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:51,931
how could she find the mansion?

209
00:10:52,731 --> 00:10:53,991
What if she gets lost then?

210
00:10:53,991 --> 00:10:55,311
Wouldn't that be even more troublesome?

211
00:10:55,311 --> 00:10:58,211
Fine, then you go with Liuli,

212
00:10:58,211 --> 00:10:59,331
Be careful on the way,

213
00:11:00,611 --> 00:11:01,696
Go,

214
00:11:04,128 --> 00:11:05,280
You two,

215
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,331
My lord,

216
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:08,011
My lord,

217
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:10,891
- My lord,
- Go away,

218
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:12,851
I am from a reputable family,

219
00:11:12,851 --> 00:11:15,691
I'm not a spy from the north,

220
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:16,771
Go away,

221
00:11:16,771 --> 00:11:18,771
Please, I beg you to let me go,

222
00:11:18,771 --> 00:11:19,851
Lady, Lady,

223
00:11:19,851 --> 00:11:20,971
- Go away,
- Please,

224
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,331
- Lady,
- Go away,

225
00:11:38,752 --> 00:11:39,776
My lord,

226
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,831
we brothers

227
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:43,191
are only entering the city
to look for relatives,

228
00:11:43,191 --> 00:11:44,851
We don't have any prohibited items on us,

229
00:11:48,448 --> 00:11:49,451
Come on,

230
00:11:49,451 --> 00:11:50,592
Thank you, thank you,

231
00:11:56,192 --> 00:11:57,216
You two,

232
00:11:59,456 --> 00:12:00,576
Don't run,

233
00:12:13,851 --> 00:12:16,011
- Let me go, let go
- You seem like spies, go,

234
00:12:16,576 --> 00:12:17,611
Let us go,

235
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:18,656
Let go of me!

236
00:12:21,091 --> 00:12:22,176
Let go!

237
00:12:25,632 --> 00:12:29,952
<i>[Hu woman, Yi Siduo]</i>

238
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,491
Please, would you mind?

239
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:40,731
Please, can you give me some?

240
00:12:40,731 --> 00:12:42,571
- What are you doing?
- Please be good, okay?

241
00:12:42,571 --> 00:12:43,840
Please be good,

242
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,851
Don't move, don't move,

243
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:46,611
- Please,
- For pity's sake,

244
00:12:46,611 --> 00:12:47,851
- For pity's sake,
- Make way, Make way,

245
00:12:49,171 --> 00:12:50,240
Stop,

246
00:12:51,264 --> 00:12:52,384
Move away,

247
00:12:53,531 --> 00:12:55,191
- Liuli,
- Please,

248
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,256
Stop,

249
00:12:57,451 --> 00:12:58,451
I have no money, Let go,

250
00:12:59,731 --> 00:13:00,736
Liuli,

251
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:04,480
Stop,

252
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,051
Put it here, put it here, put it here,

253
00:13:57,051 --> 00:13:58,191
Okay, here it comes,

254
00:13:58,191 --> 00:13:59,411
It's almost done,

255
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:00,512
Okay,

256
00:14:11,552 --> 00:14:12,611
Give me back my stuff,

257
00:14:12,611 --> 00:14:13,971
You say it's yours,

258
00:14:15,051 --> 00:14:16,128
What's your proof?

259
00:14:16,851 --> 00:14:18,031
You want proof, right?

260
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:19,291
One more step forward,

261
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,624
Hush,

262
00:14:32,192 --> 00:14:33,280
Sister,

263
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,304
Jiulang,

264
00:14:34,304 --> 00:14:35,611
What happened?

265
00:14:35,611 --> 00:14:37,291
Liuli just entered the city,
I'm afraid she might be in danger,

266
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:44,171
I hope nothing's wrong,

267
00:14:48,211 --> 00:14:49,216
Liuli,

268
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,331
Liuli, why are you running so fast?

269
00:14:57,131 --> 00:14:59,091
Don't be afraid, I will protect you,

270
00:14:59,971 --> 00:15:01,611
Two vs one, You don't stand a chance,

271
00:15:02,144 --> 00:15:03,311
Return my stuff to me,

272
00:15:03,311 --> 00:15:04,971
I'll just act as if nothing happened,

273
00:15:06,491 --> 00:15:07,584
Two vs one?

274
00:15:09,531 --> 00:15:10,931
You must've miscalculated,

275
00:15:21,051 --> 00:15:22,811
It should be five vs two, actually,

276
00:15:33,056 --> 00:15:34,091
Mr, Pei,

277
00:15:35,552 --> 00:15:36,608
Official,

278
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:38,351
It's indeed Mr, Pei,

279
00:15:38,351 --> 00:15:40,211
I didn't expect to run into an old acquaintance

280
00:15:40,211 --> 00:15:41,651
at this deserted city border,

281
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:52,608
Stop,

282
00:15:54,112 --> 00:15:55,151
Liuli,

283
00:15:55,151 --> 00:15:56,352
Don't touch her,

284
00:15:58,731 --> 00:16:00,731
Let her go, Come at me,

285
00:16:04,451 --> 00:16:05,811
Take Official to wait for me at the mansion,

286
00:16:06,752 --> 00:16:07,840
My Lord,

287
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,171
Where are you going?

288
00:16:11,648 --> 00:16:12,691
Leave the money,

289
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,791
Could you return the sachet to me?

290
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:17,071
If I tied you up,

291
00:16:17,071 --> 00:16:19,551
could there be more ransom?

292
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:21,211
Before I entered the alley,

293
00:16:21,211 --> 00:16:23,651
I saw a team of soldiers patrolling nearby,

294
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:25,331
If I shout out loudly,

295
00:16:25,331 --> 00:16:26,651
will they hear it?

296
00:16:29,731 --> 00:16:31,131
You scare me,

297
00:16:31,131 --> 00:16:32,331
Why don't we give it a try?

298
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:35,291
It seems they are arresting
the young and beautiful Hu woman,

299
00:16:35,891 --> 00:16:37,024
You look quite good,

300
00:16:42,411 --> 00:16:43,811
Sister, there are really soldiers,

301
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:52,864
Liuli,

302
00:17:10,752 --> 00:17:11,840
Shout out,

303
00:17:12,851 --> 00:17:15,211
The young Hu woman here has turned into two,

304
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:19,731
I'm just wondering

305
00:17:20,891 --> 00:17:22,771
what exactly it is,

306
00:17:30,611 --> 00:17:33,331
Pei Xingjian,

307
00:17:34,051 --> 00:17:37,931
I hereby set forth a divorce letter,

308
00:17:39,171 --> 00:17:43,491
Speaking of the marital bond,

309
00:17:44,211 --> 00:17:46,891
profound and great in kindness,

310
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:53,211
Talking about the reasons to get married,

311
00:17:54,411 --> 00:17:56,291
Is this stuff really that important?

312
00:17:57,472 --> 00:17:58,531
Keep the money,

313
00:17:59,051 --> 00:18:00,411
I guarantee not to alarm the soldiers,

314
00:18:00,411 --> 00:18:01,411
Return the letter to me,

315
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:03,611
How? Are you angry?

316
00:18:04,171 --> 00:18:05,216
Give it back to me,

317
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,808
Liuli,

318
00:18:09,051 --> 00:18:10,144
I'm going to fight you,

319
00:18:17,728 --> 00:18:18,784
Don't move,

320
00:18:21,651 --> 00:18:23,051
What are you doing?

321
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:24,851
We're being robbed by them,

322
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:25,920
They're bandits,

323
00:18:27,251 --> 00:18:29,091
If you dare come any closer, I'll kill her,

324
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,771
Catch both Hu women,

325
00:18:34,811 --> 00:18:36,251
If anyone dares to stop,

326
00:18:36,851 --> 00:18:37,851
kill without mercy,

327
00:18:38,592 --> 00:18:39,671
Behave yourself,

328
00:18:39,671 --> 00:18:40,871
Otherwise

329
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:42,211
your brothers

330
00:18:42,211 --> 00:18:43,571
will all lose their lives,

331
00:18:43,571 --> 00:18:45,051
Take them away,

332
00:18:45,051 --> 00:18:46,112
Yes,

333
00:18:46,651 --> 00:18:47,680
Wait a minute,

334
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:50,551
Why are you arresting people at random?

335
00:18:50,551 --> 00:18:51,751
Is there no rule of law?

336
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:53,691
We are the rule of law, Take them away,

337
00:18:55,611 --> 00:18:56,640
You,

338
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:07,591
You three, take them back to the prison,

339
00:19:07,591 --> 00:19:09,031
We will continue to patrol forward,

340
00:19:09,031 --> 00:19:10,080
Yes,

341
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,331
Make way, Make way,

342
00:19:23,331 --> 00:19:24,611
- Put it over here,
- Okay,

343
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,451
My lord, My lord,

344
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:47,971
My lord, give us water to drink, My lord,

345
00:19:47,971 --> 00:19:49,011
I beg you, my lord,

346
00:19:49,931 --> 00:19:51,651
My lord, we are innocent,

347
00:19:51,651 --> 00:19:52,851
My lord, let us out,

348
00:19:52,851 --> 00:19:54,931
Let us out, My lord, My lord, My lord,

349
00:19:54,931 --> 00:19:56,931
Don't leave, My lord, My lord, My lord,

350
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:26,611
We've searched everywhere
and found no Kudi Liuli,

351
00:20:28,211 --> 00:20:30,051
Could the news from Princess be incorrect?

352
00:20:34,571 --> 00:20:36,011
It shouldn't be,

353
00:20:40,371 --> 00:20:41,851
Are you sure you've searched thoroughly?

354
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:44,371
We've searched the An caravan up and down,

355
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:46,771
and we did not find the Hu woman
described in the letter,

356
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:01,051
Something's wrong,

357
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:05,491
Sister, Liuli has been arrested
by the soldiers,

358
00:21:06,171 --> 00:21:07,931
Calm down, Make it clearly,

359
00:21:19,051 --> 00:21:21,291
Go away, I have nothing to say to you,

360
00:21:22,851 --> 00:21:25,691
Regardless, we are sisters
who share weal and woe,

361
00:21:26,331 --> 00:21:27,451
Don't be so cold,

362
00:21:28,411 --> 00:21:30,171
Let's get acquainted, my name is Yi Siduo,

363
00:21:33,771 --> 00:21:34,771
Liuli, right?

364
00:21:35,411 --> 00:21:37,171
I heard that fool call you that,

365
00:21:40,891 --> 00:21:41,891
How?

366
00:21:41,891 --> 00:21:43,371
Thinking you're an official's wife,

367
00:21:43,931 --> 00:21:45,731
Disdain to associate with us lower class,

368
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:50,411
How do you know I'm an official's wife?

369
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:54,091
Oh yes, You might not be,

370
00:21:54,091 --> 00:21:56,371
After all, he has divorced you,

371
00:22:00,851 --> 00:22:02,851
Don't be angry, Don't be angry,
I was wrong, My fault,

372
00:22:08,611 --> 00:22:09,951
Is that Pei Xingjian

373
00:22:09,951 --> 00:22:12,171
a very high-ranking official?

374
00:22:13,091 --> 00:22:15,051
If he knows you are imprisoned here,

375
00:22:15,051 --> 00:22:16,811
do you think he will come to rescue you?

376
00:22:20,971 --> 00:22:23,331
Not a single man under the sky is a good thing,

377
00:22:24,091 --> 00:22:25,531
especially the Han men,

378
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:28,471
Rest assured, even if he doesn't come
to save you,

379
00:22:28,471 --> 00:22:30,091
I will try my best to protect you,

380
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:35,531
No discord, no concord,

381
00:22:48,931 --> 00:22:50,291
What else is there for you to ponder?

382
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:51,851
You are the Senior Official of Xizhou,

383
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:53,611
that Su Nanjin is merely a military advisor,

384
00:22:53,611 --> 00:22:55,511
If you ask him for someone,
he wouldn't dare refuse,

385
00:22:55,511 --> 00:22:56,631
Sanlang is right,

386
00:22:56,631 --> 00:22:58,191
However arrogant that Advisor Su is,

387
00:22:58,191 --> 00:23:00,411
he wouldn't have the nerve to wrong
the wife of Xizhou's Senior Official

388
00:23:00,411 --> 00:23:01,711
as the spy from the north,

389
00:23:01,711 --> 00:23:02,931
How could she be his wife?

390
00:23:03,771 --> 00:23:05,051
He has already divorced Liuli,

391
00:23:05,571 --> 00:23:06,592
She's actually his ex-wife,

392
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:12,571
Let us out,

393
00:23:12,571 --> 00:23:14,491
Please let us out, My lord,

394
00:23:14,491 --> 00:23:15,571
Take a look at this,

395
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:18,208
Let us out, please,

396
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:19,232
My lord,

397
00:23:19,811 --> 00:23:20,811
Please, I beg you,

398
00:23:20,811 --> 00:23:22,971
My lord, please let us out,

399
00:23:22,971 --> 00:23:24,051
My lord,

400
00:23:24,051 --> 00:23:25,091
My lord,

401
00:23:25,651 --> 00:23:26,971
Please, I beg you,

402
00:23:26,971 --> 00:23:27,971
Pei Xingjian,

403
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:29,291
Report to the Advisor quickly,

404
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:30,811
- Let's go,
- My lord,

405
00:23:30,811 --> 00:23:31,971
This is what was found

406
00:23:31,971 --> 00:23:33,251
on the two captured Hu women,

407
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:50,571
Go,

408
00:23:50,571 --> 00:23:52,371
Let's meet with this Senior Official's wife,

409
00:23:55,371 --> 00:23:58,371
My lord, I've been wronged, My lord,

410
00:23:58,931 --> 00:24:00,096
My lord,

411
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:08,251
My lord, we are innocent,

412
00:24:08,251 --> 00:24:09,831
Please let us out, my lord,

413
00:24:09,831 --> 00:24:11,811
Let us out, we are innocent,

414
00:24:11,811 --> 00:24:13,331
Please let us out, my lord,

415
00:24:13,331 --> 00:24:14,371
Let us out, please,

416
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:15,931
I beg you, my lord,

417
00:24:15,931 --> 00:24:17,251
I've been wronged,

418
00:24:17,251 --> 00:24:19,171
Let us out, my lord,

419
00:24:28,651 --> 00:24:30,491
You realized you've caught the wrong person
so quickly,

420
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,531
It's her,

421
00:24:32,531 --> 00:24:33,568
Everyone, go back,

422
00:24:48,736 --> 00:24:49,771
What are you going to do?

423
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:51,411
Let me tell you,

424
00:24:51,411 --> 00:24:52,771
I'm not someone you can mess with,

425
00:24:53,411 --> 00:24:54,811
Who is Pei Xingjian to you?

426
00:24:57,011 --> 00:24:58,016
He?

427
00:25:01,531 --> 00:25:02,571
He is my husband,

428
00:25:05,011 --> 00:25:06,491
My lord, it doesn't look so,

429
00:25:09,331 --> 00:25:10,531
Impersonating an official's wife,

430
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,431
Do you know what crime it is?

431
00:25:12,431 --> 00:25:13,891
I am not an official's wife,

432
00:25:13,891 --> 00:25:15,011
Why did you say I impersonate?

433
00:25:17,611 --> 00:25:19,171
Mr, Pei and I are old acquaintances,

434
00:25:20,091 --> 00:25:21,571
I don't know if he ever

435
00:25:21,571 --> 00:25:22,931
has mentioned me,

436
00:25:32,451 --> 00:25:33,691
I have already separated from him,

437
00:25:33,691 --> 00:25:35,691
His affairs have nothing to do with me,

438
00:25:41,371 --> 00:25:44,451
If you act rashly at this time,
I fear it may be inappropriate,

439
00:25:48,611 --> 00:25:49,991
Master Kudi has been arrested,

440
00:25:49,991 --> 00:25:51,411
There are no witnesses or testimonies,

441
00:25:52,011 --> 00:25:54,691
If you openly call at his doors,

442
00:25:54,691 --> 00:25:56,011
it seems to confirm that

443
00:25:56,011 --> 00:25:57,611
advisor Su arrested people randomly,

444
00:25:57,611 --> 00:25:58,931
and falsified political achievements,

445
00:25:59,584 --> 00:26:00,651
In this way,

446
00:26:00,651 --> 00:26:02,591
not only can advisor Su not earn merits,

447
00:26:02,591 --> 00:26:04,691
it would burden him with false accusations,

448
00:26:05,211 --> 00:26:06,391
So what then?

449
00:26:06,391 --> 00:26:07,611
How dare he?

450
00:26:12,192 --> 00:26:13,248
If so,

451
00:26:13,811 --> 00:26:14,991
will that Advisor Su

452
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:17,091
kill Liuli regardless of the consequences?

453
00:26:17,851 --> 00:26:19,051
In this way, no evidence is left behind,

454
00:26:24,691 --> 00:26:26,811
Does Su Nanjin have such courage?

455
00:26:26,811 --> 00:26:28,051
It is difficult to get justice,

456
00:26:29,408 --> 00:26:30,496
We have to be on guard,

457
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:43,251
I order you to capture the northern spy

458
00:26:43,251 --> 00:26:44,351
fleeing from Chang'an,

459
00:26:44,351 --> 00:26:47,011
How dare you capture
the Senior Official's wife?

460
00:26:47,011 --> 00:26:48,331
It was my fault,

461
00:26:49,051 --> 00:26:50,144
Open the door,

462
00:26:52,531 --> 00:26:53,691
You can't take her away,

463
00:26:56,131 --> 00:26:57,791
You despicable thief,

464
00:26:57,791 --> 00:26:59,231
How dare you steal my things?

465
00:26:59,231 --> 00:27:00,531
Do you think I'm easy to mess with?

466
00:27:14,691 --> 00:27:16,291
Just rot here forever,

467
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:41,651
Madam, have some tea and refreshments
to calm down,

468
00:27:55,811 --> 00:27:56,811
Madam,

469
00:27:57,531 --> 00:27:58,851
why are you dressed like this?

470
00:28:05,011 --> 00:28:07,091
Isn't that because of you?

471
00:28:10,051 --> 00:28:11,651
Madam, you don't know,

472
00:28:12,171 --> 00:28:13,431
Recently, there was a rebellion in the north,

473
00:28:13,431 --> 00:28:15,511
The court has ordered a strict investigation
on spies,

474
00:28:15,511 --> 00:28:16,771
That's why Advisor Su…

475
00:28:17,731 --> 00:28:19,891
So Advisor Su thinks I am a spy?

476
00:28:20,691 --> 00:28:21,728
Not at all, not at all,

477
00:28:24,131 --> 00:28:25,611
So, our misunderstanding is cleared then,

478
00:28:25,611 --> 00:28:27,091
I am leaving now,

479
00:28:27,851 --> 00:28:28,960
Madam, please wait a moment,

480
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:34,491
It is indeed my fault,

481
00:28:35,211 --> 00:28:37,191
If you leave the office like this,

482
00:28:37,191 --> 00:28:40,171
then I'll feel so ashamed,

483
00:28:41,691 --> 00:28:43,391
Take madam to take a bath and
put on clean clothes,

484
00:28:43,391 --> 00:28:44,851
Yes,

485
00:28:44,851 --> 00:28:45,931
No, no, no, no need,

486
00:28:47,131 --> 00:28:48,811
I've been captured for such a long time,
my family must be…

487
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:50,051
Madam, if you are unwilling,

488
00:28:50,611 --> 00:28:52,611
then it means you hold a grudge against me,

489
00:28:53,371 --> 00:28:55,251
How could I be at ease then?

490
00:29:00,931 --> 00:29:03,051
Well, thank you so much,

491
00:30:28,891 --> 00:30:30,971
This doesn't work, That doesn't do either,

492
00:30:30,971 --> 00:30:33,131
But we cannot just wait idly like this,

493
00:30:34,771 --> 00:30:36,000
What to do?

494
00:30:36,611 --> 00:30:39,111
Had I known Liuli would suffer so much
with you,

495
00:30:39,111 --> 00:30:40,731
I might as well have married her,

496
00:30:53,611 --> 00:30:56,171
Sanlang, I have a favor to ask,

497
00:30:56,171 --> 00:30:57,216
Don't come to me,

498
00:30:57,851 --> 00:30:59,051
I wish I could arrest you

499
00:30:59,051 --> 00:31:00,091
and release Liuli,

500
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:01,251
That's exactly

501
00:31:02,491 --> 00:31:03,584
what I want,

502
00:31:17,931 --> 00:31:19,171
It's you who said you know the spy, right?

503
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:21,051
Yes, It's me,

504
00:31:21,051 --> 00:31:22,331
How do you know he's a spy?

505
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:25,231
I've been watching this person for two days,

506
00:31:25,231 --> 00:31:26,651
He lives at Fuqing Mansion,

507
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,831
He uses Han identity as a disguise,

508
00:31:28,831 --> 00:31:30,491
Yet in the mansion,

509
00:31:30,491 --> 00:31:31,971
he colludes with the people from the north

510
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:34,471
in the form of secret letters,

511
00:31:34,471 --> 00:31:35,904
His behaviors are highly suspicious,

512
00:31:35,904 --> 00:31:37,251
- Lead the way,
- Okay, this way,

513
00:31:45,888 --> 00:31:46,976
It is he,

514
00:31:53,971 --> 00:31:55,971
Come with us to the government office,

515
00:31:59,411 --> 00:32:00,731
You all had better look carefully,

516
00:32:01,531 --> 00:32:03,811
The man you're going to arrest is me,

517
00:32:04,451 --> 00:32:05,991
Someone reported that you are a spy
from the north,

518
00:32:05,991 --> 00:32:07,040
The one we're arresting is you,

519
00:32:07,851 --> 00:32:09,211
I kindly remind you that

520
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:11,871
I'm not someone you can invite

521
00:32:11,871 --> 00:32:13,171
or release at your will,

522
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,104
Less nonsense,

523
00:32:15,651 --> 00:32:17,271
You'll behave yourself when you're imprisoned

524
00:32:17,271 --> 00:32:18,851
and see advisor Su,

525
00:32:22,131 --> 00:32:23,371
Will you go by yourself

526
00:32:23,971 --> 00:32:25,451
or shall we take you?

527
00:32:29,504 --> 00:32:30,551
Go,

528
00:32:30,551 --> 00:32:31,616
Go,

529
00:32:38,931 --> 00:32:40,991
Look, the soldiers are coming
to arrest people again,

530
00:32:40,991 --> 00:32:43,251
He looks quite good and doesn't seem like
a bad guy,

531
00:32:43,251 --> 00:32:44,320
Indeed,

532
00:32:49,731 --> 00:32:51,171
Where's the informer?

533
00:32:52,251 --> 00:32:54,351
He must be afraid of being revenged,

534
00:32:54,351 --> 00:32:56,171
Such a profit-happy villain,

535
00:32:56,171 --> 00:32:57,291
He must have gone to the office
to collect the bounty,

536
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,891
He won't be lost,

537
00:32:58,891 --> 00:33:00,431
Needless to say, Go,

538
00:33:00,431 --> 00:33:01,504
Go, go,

539
00:33:02,531 --> 00:33:04,531
Those soldiers are here to catch the spies,

540
00:33:04,531 --> 00:33:05,851
That person is a spy,

541
00:33:06,531 --> 00:33:07,731
Nonsense,

542
00:33:07,731 --> 00:33:09,171
I know that person,

543
00:33:09,691 --> 00:33:12,531
He is Pei Xingjian, the newly appointed
Senior Official of Xizhou,

544
00:33:13,411 --> 00:33:15,331
That advisor Su is trying to take credit

545
00:33:15,331 --> 00:33:17,431
for catching the northern spy,

546
00:33:17,431 --> 00:33:20,471
How dare he arrest the Senior Official
of Xizhou?

547
00:33:20,471 --> 00:33:22,651
This advisor Su should arrest people randomly
for the sake of taking credit,

548
00:33:22,651 --> 00:33:23,712
How could it be,

549
00:33:37,451 --> 00:33:39,811
My lord, let me out,

550
00:33:48,171 --> 00:33:50,891
My Lord, please let me out, I'm innocent,

551
00:33:50,891 --> 00:33:51,931
Stay still, Don't move,

552
00:33:52,611 --> 00:33:53,696
I want to stay inside,

553
00:33:54,731 --> 00:33:56,331
I never seen someone choosing the prison cell,

554
00:33:57,251 --> 00:33:58,272
Alright,

555
00:34:50,112 --> 00:34:51,168
Liuli,

556
00:34:54,491 --> 00:34:55,552
Liuli,

557
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:26,931
Liuli, are you okay? Have you not suffered?

558
00:35:27,968 --> 00:35:29,024
No,

559
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,024
You're injured,

560
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,971
It's nothing, just a small injury,

561
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:41,971
Liuli, you haven't revealed your identity,
have you?

562
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:44,131
No,

563
00:35:44,131 --> 00:35:46,071
The female thief who was captured with me

564
00:35:46,071 --> 00:35:48,371
assumed my identity,

565
00:35:48,931 --> 00:35:51,051
I had intended to stop Su Nanjin
from taking her away,

566
00:35:51,051 --> 00:35:53,091
But she mistakenly thought I was going to
expose her,

567
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:54,831
So she hit me,

568
00:35:54,831 --> 00:35:58,131
She's probably in great danger now,

569
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,112
Don't be sad,

570
00:36:02,691 --> 00:36:03,931
She got what she deserved,

571
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:07,451
I'm so relieved to see you,

572
00:36:08,771 --> 00:36:11,291
Don't worry, I will definitely get you
out of here,

573
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:20,128
Time is up,

574
00:36:29,931 --> 00:36:31,072
Where is the jailer?

575
00:36:32,211 --> 00:36:34,091
I am Pei Xingjian, Senior Official of Xizhou,

576
00:36:35,091 --> 00:36:36,491
Bring Su Nanjin to see me,

577
00:36:39,232 --> 00:36:40,320
Advisor Su,

578
00:36:41,531 --> 00:36:42,831
Advisor Su, Something's wrong,

579
00:36:42,831 --> 00:36:44,731
The jailer reports that there's a suspect
in prison

580
00:36:44,731 --> 00:36:46,571
claims to be Pei Xingjian,
Senior Official of Xizhou,

581
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:47,840
He's clamoring to see you,

582
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,851
Who?

583
00:36:48,851 --> 00:36:50,051
Senior Official of Xizhou, Pei Xingjian,

584
00:36:53,651 --> 00:36:55,491
Pei Xingjian?

585
00:36:56,691 --> 00:36:57,931
He was reported,

586
00:36:57,931 --> 00:36:59,471
Soldiers cannot distinguish the truth,

587
00:36:59,471 --> 00:37:00,491
so they arrested him,

588
00:37:03,451 --> 00:37:04,631
Where's the informer?

589
00:37:04,631 --> 00:37:05,664
Ran away,

590
00:37:08,704 --> 00:37:09,751
My lord,

591
00:37:09,751 --> 00:37:11,291
a man who claims to be Cheng

592
00:37:11,291 --> 00:37:12,931
says that the government officials
have arrested his master

593
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:14,251
Pei Xingjian, Senior Official of Xizhou,

594
00:37:14,251 --> 00:37:15,691
He has come to demand your release,

595
00:37:16,371 --> 00:37:18,771
He also said that many people
in Liangzhou City saw

596
00:37:18,771 --> 00:37:20,491
our soldiers took away Senior Official Pei,

597
00:37:20,491 --> 00:37:21,931
and framed him in public

598
00:37:23,091 --> 00:37:24,211
as the spy from the north,

599
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,211
Absurd!

600
00:37:37,331 --> 00:37:39,291
How dare you accuse our master

601
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:41,091
of being a spy from the north?

602
00:37:43,851 --> 00:37:46,491
Do you guys know who our master is?

603
00:37:47,291 --> 00:37:48,731
He is

604
00:37:48,731 --> 00:37:49,891
the newly appointed

605
00:37:49,891 --> 00:37:52,711
Senior Official of Xizhou, Pei Xingjian,

606
00:37:52,711 --> 00:37:54,411
Senior Official Pei,

607
00:37:55,251 --> 00:37:57,311
Advisor, Pei Xingjian

608
00:37:57,311 --> 00:37:58,691
suddenly showed up in Liangzhou city,

609
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:00,811
Would it have something to do with his wife?

610
00:38:02,912 --> 00:38:03,931
It should not be,

611
00:38:06,011 --> 00:38:07,951
Since he wrote the divorce letter,

612
00:38:07,951 --> 00:38:10,531
it indicated the relationship should be broken,

613
00:38:12,491 --> 00:38:13,568
What's more,

614
00:38:14,611 --> 00:38:16,251
in the Grand Princess's letter,

615
00:38:16,251 --> 00:38:18,091
only Kudi Liuli is mentioned

616
00:38:19,771 --> 00:38:21,131
and there is no mention of Pei Xingjian,

617
00:38:22,931 --> 00:38:24,000
Could it be that

618
00:38:24,931 --> 00:38:26,891
the Grand Princess is hiding something from us?

619
00:38:31,771 --> 00:38:33,571
Go, Let's find out the truth,

620
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:39,328
Be quick,

621
00:38:42,971 --> 00:38:44,064
Where is Shouyue?

622
00:38:49,491 --> 00:38:50,591
I'm too late,

623
00:38:50,591 --> 00:38:51,811
Sorry for arresting you,

624
00:38:52,451 --> 00:38:53,632
Be quick,

625
00:38:57,811 --> 00:38:59,731
Liangzhou's Military Warehouse Advisor,
Su Nanjin

626
00:38:59,731 --> 00:39:02,211
comes to apologize to Senior Official Pei,

627
00:39:06,891 --> 00:39:08,291
I have prepared wine and dishes

628
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:10,091
to quell your fear,

629
00:39:15,904 --> 00:39:16,960
Shouyue,

630
00:39:17,971 --> 00:39:19,251
I really did not know

631
00:39:19,251 --> 00:39:20,651
which idiot dared

632
00:39:20,651 --> 00:39:22,311
to have you captured,

633
00:39:22,311 --> 00:39:24,051
As soon as I got the message,

634
00:39:24,051 --> 00:39:25,291
I rushed over immediately,

635
00:39:28,571 --> 00:39:30,611
Advisor Su, you say it as if it's so easy,

636
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:33,251
In broad daylight,

637
00:39:34,131 --> 00:39:35,251
under the guise of catching a spy,

638
00:39:35,251 --> 00:39:37,631
you locked up a court-appointed official
in the prison,

639
00:39:37,631 --> 00:39:40,251
- And now you downplay it with an apology,
- I…

640
00:39:40,251 --> 00:39:42,671
What is the point of the Government Office
if apologies worked?

641
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,891
Well, It's my fault, My fault,

642
00:39:45,771 --> 00:39:47,071
As long as you can cool down,

643
00:39:47,071 --> 00:39:48,611
I will accept whatever punishment,

644
00:39:50,211 --> 00:39:51,491
You're the one who said that,

645
00:39:51,491 --> 00:39:53,091
Yeah, Of course I said it,

646
00:39:57,331 --> 00:39:59,331
The prison

647
00:39:59,331 --> 00:40:00,891
is truly not a good place for a talk,

648
00:40:01,531 --> 00:40:02,651
Shouyue,

649
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:03,671
Follow me out,

650
00:40:03,671 --> 00:40:05,171
We'll discuss it outside

651
00:40:05,171 --> 00:40:06,851
about how to compensate you,

652
00:40:06,851 --> 00:40:07,891
Just say what you want,

653
00:40:07,891 --> 00:40:09,171
As long as I can do it,

654
00:40:09,171 --> 00:40:10,251
I will definitely satisfy you,

655
00:40:23,931 --> 00:40:25,024
Senior Official Pei,

656
00:40:27,251 --> 00:40:29,231
I'm a mistakenly captured girl
from a good family,

657
00:40:29,231 --> 00:40:30,891
Senior Official Pei, I'm innocent,

658
00:40:30,891 --> 00:40:32,331
Please allow me to return to Xizhou

659
00:40:32,331 --> 00:40:33,611
and reunite with my family,

660
00:40:36,051 --> 00:40:37,311
Lady,

661
00:40:37,311 --> 00:40:38,411
are you also going to Xizhou?

662
00:40:40,211 --> 00:40:41,248
Exactly,

663
00:40:45,811 --> 00:40:46,811
What a coincidence!

664
00:40:47,371 --> 00:40:49,051
I also go to Xizhou,

665
00:40:50,091 --> 00:40:51,951
You and I are really something,

666
00:40:51,951 --> 00:40:54,251
But this is Liangzhou City,

667
00:40:54,891 --> 00:40:56,051
You're telling me you're wronged?

668
00:40:56,051 --> 00:40:57,211
I don't have a say here,

669
00:40:57,811 --> 00:40:58,912
The person in charge here

670
00:40:59,531 --> 00:41:01,011
is this Advisor Su,

671
00:41:06,251 --> 00:41:07,811
Senior Official Pei,

672
00:41:09,411 --> 00:41:11,491
The other day at Yunwei Mansion,

673
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,671
I encountered the human trafficker, Mi Dalang,

674
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:16,231
I had intended to buy a stunning female slave
from him

675
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:18,691
to alleviate my loneliness on the journey
to Xizhou,

676
00:41:19,891 --> 00:41:21,091
But Mi Dalang said

677
00:41:21,651 --> 00:41:24,411
all those stunning female slaves
have already been given to you,

678
00:41:24,971 --> 00:41:26,931
only some commonplace women left,

679
00:41:26,931 --> 00:41:28,011
What a bummer!

680
00:41:29,411 --> 00:41:30,491
It seems that

681
00:41:31,491 --> 00:41:33,091
Advisor Su indeed

682
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:35,211
strikes a good balance

683
00:41:35,851 --> 00:41:36,891
between making achievements
and enjoying pleasure,

684
00:41:43,131 --> 00:41:44,151
Senior Official Pei,

685
00:41:44,151 --> 00:41:45,451
Senior Official Pei, Don't leave,

686
00:41:45,451 --> 00:41:47,411
Senior Official Pei, Please save me,
Senior Official Pei,

687
00:41:48,531 --> 00:41:50,891
Advisor, I am wronged, Advisor Su,

688
00:41:53,131 --> 00:41:54,471
I am wronged,

689
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:55,531
Senior Official Pei,

690
00:41:55,531 --> 00:41:56,851
Since Pei Xingjian has taken a fancy to her,

691
00:41:57,411 --> 00:41:58,891
why don't we just fulfill his desire,

692
00:42:00,011 --> 00:42:01,651
As long as he benefits from us,

693
00:42:01,651 --> 00:42:03,651
he will certainly not tell others
about today's affairs,

694
00:42:17,811 --> 00:42:19,071
Our master

695
00:42:19,071 --> 00:42:20,791
is the trusted subordinate of His Majesty,

696
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:22,891
the beloved disciple of General Su Dingfang,

697
00:42:23,891 --> 00:42:27,091
If you suspect our master to be a spy
from the north,

698
00:42:28,451 --> 00:42:29,571
please ask for

699
00:42:29,571 --> 00:42:30,971
His Majesty's permission,

700
00:42:32,931 --> 00:42:36,771
Alright, tell Advisor Su

701
00:42:37,331 --> 00:42:38,711
to release our master immediately,

702
00:42:38,711 --> 00:42:40,091
Otherwise,

703
00:42:40,091 --> 00:42:41,371
just wait for the punishment,

704
00:42:42,971 --> 00:42:44,011
Where's the water?

705
00:42:47,796 --> 00:42:52,352
<i>♫ I write my longing for you in Spring ♫</i>

00:45:03,407 --> 00:45:06,767
<i>♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫</i>

734
00:45:06,767 --> 00:45:09,999
<i>♫ I look outside, like the poems asking ♫</i>

735
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:14,991
<i>♫ My love, have you
found someone good for you ♫</i>

736
00:45:14,991 --> 00:45:18,368
<i>♫ Remembrance of past things ♫</i>

737
00:45:18,368 --> 00:45:21,376
<i>♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫</i>

738
00:45:21,376 --> 00:45:24,815
<i>♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫</i>

739
00:45:24,815 --> 00:45:27,776
<i>♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫</i>

740
00:45:27,776 --> 00:45:31,599
<i>♫ Winter comes again, and flowers wither ♫</i>

741
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:34,447
<i>♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫</i>

742
00:45:34,447 --> 00:45:37,824
<i>♫ I look outside, like the poems asking ♫</i>

743
00:45:37,824 --> 00:45:43,375
<i>♫ My love, have you
found someone good for you ♫</i>
