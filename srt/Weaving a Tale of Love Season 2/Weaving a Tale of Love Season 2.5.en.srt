<i>[Episode 5]</i>

3
00:01:36,115 --> 00:01:38,115
In order to prepare sacrificial offerings
for Lady Lu,

4
00:01:38,115 --> 00:01:39,755
lady has been hard at work
for such a long time,

5
00:01:39,755 --> 00:01:42,655
embroidering her favorite scenes,
stitch by stitch,

6
00:01:42,655 --> 00:01:44,755
How could you possibly
understand these feelings?

7
00:01:44,755 --> 00:01:47,315
Do you think the lady is hiding
because she's afraid of you?

8
00:01:47,955 --> 00:01:49,024
What a joke!

9
00:01:56,595 --> 00:01:59,935
Yunu, you mention the late madam every day,

10
00:01:59,935 --> 00:02:02,115
But you've never even been to her grave,
have you?

11
00:02:04,315 --> 00:02:06,895
Today I will take you with me,

12
00:02:06,895 --> 00:02:09,155
So you can pay your respects

13
00:02:09,155 --> 00:02:10,635
and kowtow at the grave of Sister Lu,

14
00:02:40,675 --> 00:02:43,955
Liuli, so this is the place

15
00:02:44,955 --> 00:02:46,016
you wanted to come with me,

16
00:02:53,195 --> 00:02:54,595
Sister Lu is a person I deeply respect,

17
00:02:55,515 --> 00:02:57,355
<i>[Tomb of First Wife Lady Lu Qi]</i>
I've long wanted to visit her grave and pay my respects,

18
00:02:59,755 --> 00:03:02,395
Shouyue, I am not a petty person,

19
00:03:03,115 --> 00:03:04,395
Sister Lu passed away many years ago,

20
00:03:04,995 --> 00:03:06,915
but you still
have affection and righteousness for her,

21
00:03:06,915 --> 00:03:08,635
You're the husband I like,

22
00:03:10,115 --> 00:03:11,795
If you miss Sister Lu in the future,

23
00:03:12,475 --> 00:03:14,635
let's come and see her together, alright?

24
00:03:19,155 --> 00:03:20,795
Sister Lu was forced by the Princess Linhai

25
00:03:20,795 --> 00:03:22,075
and your clan to death,

26
00:03:23,155 --> 00:03:25,715
But she had grievances she couldn't express
and revenge she couldn't take,

27
00:03:25,715 --> 00:03:27,035
The most hateful thing is

28
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:30,035
that Sister Lu has already been dead
for many years,

29
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:31,875
Princess Linhai

30
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,715
still claims to have a deep mother-daughter
relationship with Sister Lu,

31
00:03:35,635 --> 00:03:38,155
continuing to frame and exploit you,

32
00:03:41,915 --> 00:03:45,395
Sister Lu, I know you were aggrieved

33
00:03:45,995 --> 00:03:47,008
and reluctant when you were dead,

34
00:03:48,115 --> 00:03:51,195
If you are aware in the afterlife,
please bless me and Shouyue,

35
00:03:51,755 --> 00:03:53,515
blessing us to avenge you soon,

36
00:03:57,315 --> 00:04:00,955
Over a decade ago, I married Qi
under my mother's orders,

37
00:04:02,195 --> 00:04:03,200
After my wedding,

38
00:04:03,835 --> 00:04:05,655
the Hedong Duke's family can only
keep their promise

39
00:04:05,655 --> 00:04:07,955
to return the Pei family estate,
which they've managed for years, back to me,

40
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,715
But at that time,
I had just taken General Su as my mentor,

41
00:04:11,555 --> 00:04:13,675
so, I entrusted the management of
the family property to Lady Qi,

42
00:04:15,035 --> 00:04:18,015
Unbeknownst to me, the Princess Royal
had employed tactics at the manor,

43
00:04:18,015 --> 00:04:19,136
resulting in significant losses,

44
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:23,175
Without telling me, Lady Qi used
the entire dowry to cover the losses,

45
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:24,195
but it was still not enough,

46
00:04:25,355 --> 00:04:26,955
The people of the Pei family joined forces,

47
00:04:26,955 --> 00:04:29,155
forcing Qi and her unborn child to death,

48
00:04:30,115 --> 00:04:32,235
Princess took advantage of the situation
to reclaim the family property,

49
00:04:34,195 --> 00:04:35,675
<i>[Tomb of First Wife Lady Lu Qi]</i>
I failed to protect them,

50
00:04:36,435 --> 00:04:38,115
It is the greatest pain of my life,

51
00:05:10,555 --> 00:05:12,995
Yunu, do you still remember that

52
00:05:12,995 --> 00:05:14,235
I'll take back your belongings?

53
00:05:17,075 --> 00:05:18,115
You forgot so quickly?

54
00:05:28,075 --> 00:05:29,675
<i>Could it be the indenture of sale
she's talking about</i>

55
00:05:41,835 --> 00:05:43,875
A few days ago,
while carrying out official duties,

56
00:05:44,395 --> 00:05:45,675
I found this in the thieves' den,

57
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,240
<i>[Slave Purchase Agreement]</i>

58
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,795
There's a matter in which I need to
make use of your dexterity,

59
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:24,288
<i>[Slave Purchase Agreement]</i>

60
00:06:28,315 --> 00:06:29,755
The Residence of the Hedong Duke
had reported a crime,

61
00:06:30,555 --> 00:06:31,755
They said thieves had struck the yard,

62
00:06:32,355 --> 00:06:35,275
<i>[Gold and Jade Fill the Hall]</i>
Among the stolen items is Yunu's slave purchase agreement,

63
00:06:36,235 --> 00:06:38,395
A few days ago,
I led some people to capture a big thief,

64
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:40,275
The thief has escaped from the den,

65
00:06:40,955 --> 00:06:42,155
Nothing else was left behind,

66
00:06:42,955 --> 00:06:44,515
Only this slavery purchase contract
was left behind,

67
00:06:45,355 --> 00:06:48,835
This slavery purchase contract
cannot be compared to gold and silver,

68
00:06:48,835 --> 00:06:51,995
There's no use if the thief steals it,

69
00:06:52,635 --> 00:06:55,815
It's also possible
that the thief intentionally abandoned it,

70
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:56,864
You're right,

71
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:00,395
<i>How is this possible?</i>

72
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:02,995
<i>My indenture of sale
was in the hands of the elder princess,</i>

73
00:07:06,315 --> 00:07:08,435
Even if the case is not solved,
you can still recover the loot,

74
00:07:09,435 --> 00:07:11,875
Shouyue, you have good methods,

75
00:07:13,355 --> 00:07:14,432
Just a fluke,

76
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,355
Thanks to the blessings of the eldest princess,

77
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:25,175
I told Shouyue about indenture of sale of Yunu,

78
00:07:25,175 --> 00:07:27,955
you were originally going to be given to us,

79
00:07:27,955 --> 00:07:29,775
Now that we have found it back,

80
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:32,775
It would be enough to send someone
to give a report to the eldest princess,

81
00:07:32,775 --> 00:07:35,215
Yet Shouyue insists on being meticulous,

82
00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:36,675
He thinks that indenture of sale of Yunu

83
00:07:36,675 --> 00:07:38,835
was lost by royal princess,

84
00:07:38,835 --> 00:07:40,615
so it must be returned to royal princess,

85
00:07:40,615 --> 00:07:42,995
Then, it should be handed over to us
by the royal princess,

86
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,555
Only then can it be considered
proper etiquette,

87
00:07:52,315 --> 00:07:53,376
Cui,

88
00:07:55,235 --> 00:07:56,435
Hand it to Lady Liuli,

89
00:08:00,675 --> 00:08:01,760
Yes,

90
00:08:06,595 --> 00:08:07,648
Yes,

91
00:08:12,395 --> 00:08:14,555
And thank you, Princess,

92
00:08:20,915 --> 00:08:23,035
There are two pieces of jewelry in this box,

93
00:08:24,275 --> 00:08:28,035
We have been master and servant,
These are for you to remember,

94
00:08:30,195 --> 00:08:31,595
Thank you for the grace, Princess,

95
00:08:32,235 --> 00:08:33,755
Take good care of yourself in the future,

96
00:08:35,075 --> 00:08:36,675
Don't forget, no matter where you go,

97
00:08:37,595 --> 00:08:40,755
you are a person
from my Residence of the Hedong Duke,

98
00:08:41,715 --> 00:08:45,515
Yes, Yunu will remember,

99
00:09:06,848 --> 00:09:07,904
Please calm your anger,

100
00:09:08,475 --> 00:09:11,255
Pei Shouyue and Kudi Liuli

101
00:09:11,255 --> 00:09:13,715
held a counterfeit agreement,

102
00:09:13,715 --> 00:09:15,456
The real one is indeed in my hand,

103
00:09:15,456 --> 00:09:17,156
But I have no way to refute,

104
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,235
And I can't take out the real one,

105
00:09:20,235 --> 00:09:21,995
I can only let them talk nonsense,

106
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,195
It really pisses me off,

107
00:09:24,555 --> 00:09:25,755
Madam, calm down,

108
00:09:26,555 --> 00:09:29,195
Pei Shouyue and Kudi Liuli
are really too cunning,

109
00:09:29,755 --> 00:09:32,715
But who could have imagined that Pei Shouyue,

110
00:09:32,715 --> 00:09:35,635
as an imperial court official,
dared to openly forge documents,

111
00:09:36,595 --> 00:09:38,875
He's audacious in the extreme,

112
00:09:43,395 --> 00:09:45,475
It has always been me scheming against others,

113
00:09:46,115 --> 00:09:48,355
But carelessly, I ended up being the one
schemed against,

114
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,795
I will absolutely not forgive them,

115
00:09:52,315 --> 00:09:54,595
Please calm your anger, The future is long,

116
00:10:03,355 --> 00:10:05,635
Go,

117
00:10:06,212 --> 00:10:08,484
<i>[Bei Meng House]</i>

118
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:13,875
Go,

119
00:10:16,555 --> 00:10:19,315
Shouyue, thank you,

120
00:10:21,675 --> 00:10:24,715
I really didn't expect you
to come up with this method

121
00:10:24,715 --> 00:10:26,395
making the arrogant eldest princess

122
00:10:27,435 --> 00:10:29,115
end up swallowing a bitter pill in silence,

123
00:10:30,635 --> 00:10:33,475
The bitterness and resentment accumulating
in my heart for many years

124
00:10:33,995 --> 00:10:35,155
have also been healed quite a bit,

125
00:10:35,915 --> 00:10:38,395
We are husband and wife,
there's no need for thanks,

126
00:10:40,035 --> 00:10:42,635
It is said that the hardest thing
between husband and wife

127
00:10:42,635 --> 00:10:44,475
is all about sharing weal and woe together,

128
00:10:45,315 --> 00:10:48,755
But I've never worried about these things
between us,

129
00:10:50,355 --> 00:10:55,475
You know, my only fear is
that you don't believe in me,

130
00:10:57,515 --> 00:10:59,235
When I first saw Yunu,

131
00:11:00,515 --> 00:11:01,632
I was scared to death,

132
00:11:02,355 --> 00:11:04,355
I was afraid
you'd fall for the Princess's schemes,

133
00:11:05,755 --> 00:11:06,995
doubting my love for you,

134
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,155
That time Yunu came to the county office
while you were away,

135
00:11:12,515 --> 00:11:15,695
I knew then that
Princess wanted to use her old tricks again,

136
00:11:15,695 --> 00:11:17,995
My Lord,
please drink this bowl of ginger soup first,

137
00:11:18,755 --> 00:11:21,275
Afterwards, Yunu will assist you
in changing clothes,

138
00:11:21,955 --> 00:11:25,275
Her attempt to divide us is to
disregard all means for the property,

139
00:11:27,155 --> 00:11:29,435
Don't you understand what I'm saying?
Hurry up and get out,

140
00:11:32,795 --> 00:11:34,595
Cheng, take her out,

141
00:11:34,595 --> 00:11:35,616
Yes,

142
00:11:37,028 --> 00:11:38,944
<i>[Qing Feng Pavilion]</i>

143
00:11:39,915 --> 00:11:41,615
Just now, I've asked someone
to prepare hot soup,

144
00:11:41,615 --> 00:11:43,355
Have a soak to ward off the cold,

145
00:11:44,715 --> 00:11:47,275
But I didn't bring a change of clothes,
what should we do?

146
00:11:52,355 --> 00:11:54,035
Why are you still here?

147
00:11:58,995 --> 00:12:00,955
My lord, you refuse to eat the food and drink
brought by Yunu,

148
00:12:01,635 --> 00:12:04,995
I'm afraid you also don't want to
wear the clothes brought by Yunu,

149
00:12:09,115 --> 00:12:11,275
Aren't these the clothes made
by the lady herself for my lord?

150
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,435
My lord merely refuses to eat the meals
you bring,

151
00:12:15,115 --> 00:12:16,755
But these clothes made by the lady herself

152
00:12:16,755 --> 00:12:18,355
are my lord's beloved possessions,

153
00:12:33,435 --> 00:12:34,695
I never would have thought that

154
00:12:34,695 --> 00:12:36,355
Yunu would have tampered with the clothes,

155
00:12:36,955 --> 00:12:38,275
You discovered it the next day,

156
00:12:38,995 --> 00:12:41,536
How can Cheng's little lies escape you?

157
00:12:41,536 --> 00:12:42,715
My lady,

158
00:12:42,715 --> 00:12:46,675
Shouyue, how did you change clothes
before you had bathed?

159
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:50,275
Madam, it was Cheng's oversight,

160
00:12:50,275 --> 00:12:51,995
I earlier unintentionally spilled tea on

161
00:12:51,995 --> 00:12:53,475
the Master's clothes,

162
00:12:53,475 --> 00:12:55,895
Hence, Cheng changed a set of clothes
for the Master,

163
00:12:55,895 --> 00:12:57,275
What did I tell you before?

164
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:00,315
Did you just let my words

165
00:13:00,315 --> 00:13:01,835
go in one ear and out the other?

166
00:13:01,835 --> 00:13:04,275
Hurry up and explain to your lady clearly
what exactly is going on,

167
00:13:04,955 --> 00:13:05,984
I'm sorry,

168
00:13:06,955 --> 00:13:09,795
Master told me that
if the lady asks about this matter,

169
00:13:09,795 --> 00:13:12,475
he must tell all without concealment,

170
00:13:12,475 --> 00:13:13,515
And he must not deceive,

171
00:13:14,555 --> 00:13:16,095
Cheng is indeed loyal to you,

172
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,075
Please, madam, calm your anger,

173
00:13:18,075 --> 00:13:20,935
I feared you might misunderstand your husband,
so I deliberately hid the truth,

174
00:13:20,935 --> 00:13:22,415
It was Cheng
who took it upon himself to decide,

175
00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:24,435
Then you put on the act of being angry

176
00:13:24,995 --> 00:13:26,155
for Yunu outside to see,

177
00:13:28,435 --> 00:13:29,440
But thank you,

178
00:13:31,555 --> 00:13:33,195
Thank you for believing in me
without any hesitation,

179
00:13:34,435 --> 00:13:38,395
Who just said there's no need for 'thank you'
between husband and wife?

180
00:13:40,115 --> 00:13:42,575
I trust you,

181
00:13:42,575 --> 00:13:44,355
But you never fully trusted me,

182
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:48,480
Otherwise, why would you want to
hide so many things from me?

183
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,515
I didn't want to see you

184
00:13:49,515 --> 00:13:50,915
suffer the slightest harm,

185
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:57,835
You are right, I was in the wrong,

186
00:13:59,195 --> 00:14:01,315
I apologize to you,
It won't happen again next time,

187
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:04,875
If that's the case,

188
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:08,835
then I'll take full responsibility
for Yunu's matters in the future,

189
00:14:08,835 --> 00:14:10,355
Don't take it to heart,

190
00:14:11,275 --> 00:14:12,315
I'm hardly heartbroken,

191
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:34,675
My lady, Yunu has arrived,

192
00:14:39,435 --> 00:14:41,595
Yunu pays respects to my lady and master,

193
00:14:42,195 --> 00:14:44,915
May I inquire why my lady has summoned Yunu?

194
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:49,515
Yunu, you still remember
what I told you before, right?

195
00:14:50,755 --> 00:14:52,895
Now I hold your indenture of sale,

196
00:14:52,895 --> 00:14:54,755
As long as
you remain well-behaved in the future,

197
00:14:55,675 --> 00:14:58,595
the promise I made to you before still holds,

198
00:14:59,995 --> 00:15:03,435
In two years' time,
I will find you a good family to marry into,

199
00:15:03,995 --> 00:15:05,315
Do you understand my meaning?

200
00:15:08,435 --> 00:15:11,155
You may go back and rest now,

201
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:24,275
My lady, the bath is ready,

202
00:15:24,275 --> 00:15:25,315
Please proceed to the bath,

203
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,995
My lady, didn't you promise Lady Yu

204
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:30,875
that you would send her new clothes today?

205
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,675
Oh yes, how could I have forgotten that?

206
00:15:34,315 --> 00:15:37,395
It's still time to make a trip
to the general's mansion before the curfew,

207
00:15:37,955 --> 00:15:41,475
But my lady, the bath will be cold
by the time you return,

208
00:15:41,995 --> 00:15:45,075
The matter of bathing is small,
but I can't let the mother-in-law wait in vain,

209
00:15:45,915 --> 00:15:47,935
The bath is ready, Shouyue,

210
00:15:47,935 --> 00:15:50,595
Can you take a bath first while I am out?

211
00:15:51,835 --> 00:15:54,275
You just go ahead, I will do as you said,

212
00:15:59,044 --> 00:16:02,016
<i>[Pei Mansion]</i>

213
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,760
<i>[Compose Poetry]</i>

214
00:16:25,732 --> 00:16:27,200
<i>[Compose Poetry]</i>

215
00:16:50,235 --> 00:16:51,755
What are you afraid of?

216
00:16:52,835 --> 00:16:54,195
The lady has gone out,

217
00:16:54,715 --> 00:16:56,875
Naturally, he won't be able to return
in a short while,

218
00:16:58,075 --> 00:16:59,595
Newlyweds,

219
00:16:59,595 --> 00:17:03,355
The lady left you alone for a bath,
isn't it lonely?

220
00:17:10,355 --> 00:17:14,035
Yunu knows
that you can't forget your first wife,

221
00:17:14,915 --> 00:17:19,235
Why don't you pretend
I'm your first wife tonight

222
00:17:20,235 --> 00:17:21,755
to soothe your nostalgia?

223
00:17:28,035 --> 00:17:29,056
Why are you?

224
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:37,275
You unrepentant thing,
Why aren't you kneeling down?

225
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:50,995
I once disguised myself as a man
in the palace for ten years,

226
00:17:50,995 --> 00:17:53,235
Even His Majesty and Lady Wu

227
00:17:53,235 --> 00:17:54,555
could not see through my male disguise,

228
00:17:54,555 --> 00:17:58,275
What's more, you were just drawing a screen,

229
00:18:00,595 --> 00:18:04,435
Yunu, considering that you are being coerced
by the princess,

230
00:18:04,435 --> 00:18:06,755
I tried to get back your indenture of sale,

231
00:18:07,355 --> 00:18:08,675
and gave you another chance,

232
00:18:09,435 --> 00:18:11,275
But you did not know how to cherish it

233
00:18:11,275 --> 00:18:13,835
but kept going your own way
and did not know to repent,

234
00:18:14,675 --> 00:18:16,395
I, as the mistress, have to

235
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,715
show no mercy this time,

236
00:18:20,835 --> 00:18:21,995
I am still very curious,

237
00:18:23,355 --> 00:18:24,955
Inside the box given to you by the Princess,

238
00:18:24,955 --> 00:18:26,195
what exactly is the treasure inside?

239
00:18:26,715 --> 00:18:29,275
You'll risk your life for it

240
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,955
and challenge my bottom line again,

241
00:18:34,035 --> 00:18:36,315
My lady, I found this in the

242
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,835
secret compartment of the wooden box
given to Yunu by the princess,

243
00:18:39,395 --> 00:18:40,480
Half of a land deed,

244
00:18:43,364 --> 00:18:45,824
<i>[Deed of Farmland]</i>

245
00:18:46,515 --> 00:18:48,075
This piece of land is truly not small

246
00:18:48,955 --> 00:18:50,835
The Princess has only given you half of it,

247
00:18:50,835 --> 00:18:53,995
She promised to give you the other half
after your task is complete, isn't it?

248
00:18:53,995 --> 00:18:55,595
Lady, your guess is spot on,

249
00:18:57,635 --> 00:18:58,915
But what can you do to me?

250
00:19:00,115 --> 00:19:03,275
Although I'm a servant,
I was given by the Princess,

251
00:19:04,315 --> 00:19:05,875
The Princess made it clear from the start that

252
00:19:06,435 --> 00:19:09,155
you're not allowed to sell, beat,

253
00:19:09,155 --> 00:19:10,515
scold, or abuse me,

254
00:19:11,035 --> 00:19:12,615
Otherwise,
it would be considered insubordination

255
00:19:12,615 --> 00:19:13,955
and against the goodwill of elders,

256
00:19:18,715 --> 00:19:23,195
Indeed, there are not many methods
I can use on you,

257
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,995
You can't be sold, beaten, scolded, nor abused,

258
00:19:29,915 --> 00:19:31,835
But you are so likable in appearance,

259
00:19:33,835 --> 00:19:37,475
If I were to bring you into the palace
to present you to Lady Wu,

260
00:19:38,115 --> 00:19:39,435
Lady Wu would surely like you,

261
00:19:40,235 --> 00:19:42,035
Considering Lady Wu's status and position,

262
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:46,055
she has taken a liking to the maid
that Princess Linhai gave me,

263
00:19:46,055 --> 00:19:49,355
If she asks for it,
there is absolutely nothing wrong,

264
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:53,275
This way, I wouldn't offend the Princess,
and it wouldn't be unfair to you,

265
00:19:54,035 --> 00:19:56,395
Don't you think so?

266
00:19:57,115 --> 00:19:58,235
You want to send me to the palace?

267
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,955
Once you're in the palace, I'll ask sister Wu

268
00:20:06,835 --> 00:20:09,115
to transfer you to the Forensic Bureau,

269
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:12,035
My grandfather is in charge of
the Forensic Bureau in the palace,

270
00:20:12,675 --> 00:20:15,355
I will definitely ask him
to take good care of you,

271
00:20:15,955 --> 00:20:16,992
The Forensic Bureau？

272
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:20,715
What is the Forensic Bureau?

273
00:20:22,195 --> 00:20:23,795
Haven't you heard of the Forensic Bureau?

274
00:20:25,115 --> 00:20:27,635
The Forensic Bureau is the place inside the palace
where funeral affairs are handled,

275
00:20:28,275 --> 00:20:31,035
There, one only deals with the deceased,

276
00:20:31,835 --> 00:20:34,515
From now on, you will be dealing with those
who have died from old age or disease,

277
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:39,755
Tell me,
is this arrangement considerate enough for you?

278
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:43,795
Spare my life, My lady!

279
00:20:43,795 --> 00:20:46,195
It was all Yunu's fault before,
please spare me, My lady!

280
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,275
I won't do it again, Please, mercy,

281
00:20:49,955 --> 00:20:51,355
I gave you a chance before,

282
00:20:51,355 --> 00:20:53,715
It was you who were greedy for
wealth and glory,

283
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,715
My lady, please set me free,

284
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,795
If you would let me go,

285
00:21:01,555 --> 00:21:04,315
I swear that I will never appear
in Chang'an City again,

286
00:21:06,235 --> 00:21:09,315
Let you go free? This matter is controlled
by the laws of our country,

287
00:21:09,315 --> 00:21:11,035
It's not that I can let you go
because I want to,

288
00:21:12,235 --> 00:21:13,395
My lady, there are things you don't know,

289
00:21:18,315 --> 00:21:19,755
I was originally a respectable family child,

290
00:21:20,395 --> 00:21:23,155
Although in Pingkang Fang,
I was carefully nurtured by my stepmother,

291
00:21:23,155 --> 00:21:25,155
I had never been enrolled
in an education square,

292
00:21:26,315 --> 00:21:27,835
The princess took a liking to me,

293
00:21:27,835 --> 00:21:30,595
She said that
I somewhat resemble the late first wife,

294
00:21:30,595 --> 00:21:32,435
Hence, she forcibly bought me to be a servant,

295
00:21:33,715 --> 00:21:35,435
My lady, please believe me this time,

296
00:21:39,555 --> 00:21:40,835
My lady, if you agree to release me,

297
00:21:41,915 --> 00:21:43,995
Yunu naturally has a way
to return to being a good citizen,

298
00:21:44,755 --> 00:21:47,015
Residence of the Hedong Duke bought me,

299
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:48,975
Therefore, the matter of
changing the slave status

300
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,635
absolutely won't involve you, my lady,

301
00:21:51,475 --> 00:21:52,595
Please, mercy,

302
00:21:56,715 --> 00:22:00,915
Ni, let Cheng go to the yamen for a trip,

303
00:22:01,555 --> 00:22:03,355
Just say we only came to know today

304
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:06,355
that Yunu was originally a good citizen,
please let them check it out,

305
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:07,936
If there is no mistake,

306
00:22:09,475 --> 00:22:10,955
please cancel her lowly status,

307
00:22:38,755 --> 00:22:41,995
My lady, I am eternally grateful
and have no way to repay your kindness,

308
00:22:42,835 --> 00:22:46,155
Please, my lady,
do take good care of your health,

309
00:22:49,315 --> 00:22:50,555
If Yunu does not die,

310
00:22:52,035 --> 00:22:54,755
I will surely make a grass knot or champ a ring

311
00:22:57,635 --> 00:22:58,688
in order to repay kindness,

312
00:23:07,635 --> 00:23:11,355
Yunu, if you sincerely repent,

313
00:23:12,675 --> 00:23:13,995
that would be enough to do right by me,

314
00:24:11,835 --> 00:24:13,515
Cheng has found a new residence,

315
00:24:14,155 --> 00:24:15,675
Let's move there together next month,

316
00:24:16,395 --> 00:24:17,472
Why move?

317
00:24:27,515 --> 00:24:28,835
I really like this home,

318
00:24:29,955 --> 00:24:31,275
Can we not move?

319
00:24:53,795 --> 00:24:56,435
So this is the clever person you picked for me?

320
00:24:56,435 --> 00:24:57,675
She is worse than rubbish,

321
00:24:58,315 --> 00:25:00,515
I hope she would sow discord
between the Shouyue couple,

322
00:25:00,515 --> 00:25:03,415
It cost me so much money and thought,

323
00:25:03,415 --> 00:25:06,835
As a result, Yunu went to the county office
to ask for her release,

324
00:25:06,835 --> 00:25:09,475
Pei Xingjian directly stamped and approved it,

325
00:25:14,915 --> 00:25:16,995
How many more years can I live?

326
00:25:18,115 --> 00:25:19,955
I have racked my brains so much,

327
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:22,875
With so much preparation,

328
00:25:23,435 --> 00:25:25,835
isn't it all
because I'm worrying about your future?

329
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:29,715
- I'm incapable,
- I'm incapable

330
00:25:29,715 --> 00:25:31,275
- I was wrong,
- I was wrong,

331
00:25:34,395 --> 00:25:38,675
If you make mistakes in the future,
you must accept the punishment

332
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:43,435
Don't blame me for not warning you beforehand,

333
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:45,152
Yes,

334
00:26:33,155 --> 00:26:35,115
My lady, this dough has been leaven so well,

335
00:27:16,555 --> 00:27:17,824
Why are you cooking again?

336
00:27:18,435 --> 00:27:19,968
Didn't I tell you

337
00:27:19,968 --> 00:27:22,055
I forbade you from working
so hard day and night like this?

338
00:27:22,055 --> 00:27:23,155
Why don't you listen?

339
00:27:24,035 --> 00:27:27,195
Making soup for you is my favorite thing to do,
How could it be laborious?

340
00:27:35,035 --> 00:27:36,096
Here you go,

341
00:27:41,435 --> 00:27:43,955
Today, the princess Linhai

342
00:27:43,955 --> 00:27:45,955
brought all the property deeds from Luoyang,

343
00:27:46,675 --> 00:27:48,355
I have no idea
what bad idea they are concocting now,

344
00:27:49,995 --> 00:27:51,040
What are your thoughts on this?

345
00:27:51,675 --> 00:27:54,115
This Luoyang family's property is
a thorn in the side of the Pei Family,

346
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:56,635
It's also a piece of meat
in the mouth of the princess,

347
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:59,295
If it always remains in our hands,

348
00:27:59,295 --> 00:28:01,355
then our struggle with the princess

349
00:28:01,355 --> 00:28:02,475
will be endless,

350
00:28:03,555 --> 00:28:05,595
It really has become a hot potato,

351
00:28:06,115 --> 00:28:09,795
So unless this family property is owned
by someone

352
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,355
that Princess can't offend,
the matter can be finished,

353
00:28:14,835 --> 00:28:16,515
That slave Yunu was freed by me,

354
00:28:17,315 --> 00:28:18,435
Does it bring you great pain to leave her?

355
00:28:22,675 --> 00:28:23,776
What do you think?

356
00:28:25,755 --> 00:28:27,075
My wife is astute and capable,

357
00:28:27,075 --> 00:28:28,475
How could she fall for someone else's schemes?

358
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:33,195
Liuli, I've made up my mind
about the family property in Luoyang,

359
00:28:34,635 --> 00:28:37,675
I've written a document for you,

360
00:28:38,475 --> 00:28:41,675
I entrust the document to you for your use,

361
00:28:43,195 --> 00:28:46,955
Rest assured, I will never sit back
and let anyone bully me,

362
00:28:46,955 --> 00:28:49,995
I will protect myself and our home,

363
00:29:11,395 --> 00:29:14,755
What a great post!
How come I've never seen this post before?

364
00:29:16,515 --> 00:29:18,635
Your calligraphy,
though not as good as your painting,

365
00:29:19,195 --> 00:29:20,755
but your judgment is quite sharp,

366
00:29:22,075 --> 00:29:23,875
Take a look, whose handwriting is this?

367
00:29:24,755 --> 00:29:28,615
The cursive script flows with a rhythmic grace,
The strokes are bold and unconstrained,

368
00:29:28,615 --> 00:29:30,195
Truly the style of a master,

369
00:29:32,035 --> 00:29:35,335
But I just can't make out
whose handwriting this is,

370
00:29:35,335 --> 00:29:36,995
This is the authentic work of Zhang Boying,

371
00:29:37,555 --> 00:29:38,875
The authentic work of Zhang Boying?

372
00:29:41,475 --> 00:29:42,795
This is truly a rarity,

373
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:46,395
I have heard the Servant Wang say
that the emperor greatly adores calligraphy,

374
00:29:46,955 --> 00:29:50,475
searching everywhere for
Zhang Boying's authentic works, but to no avail,

375
00:29:52,515 --> 00:29:54,355
Zhang Boying's authentic works
are indeed very rare,

376
00:29:56,035 --> 00:30:00,055
Despite all my efforts,
I have only seen four or five pieces,

377
00:30:00,055 --> 00:30:01,555
That was all due to rare good fortune,

378
00:30:02,075 --> 00:30:03,995
Today, Chu Suiliang found me,

379
00:30:04,835 --> 00:30:06,475
He let me identify this calligraphy piece,

380
00:30:08,555 --> 00:30:12,955
But look at this calligraphy, this paper
and this aura,

381
00:30:13,515 --> 00:30:14,635
It can't be counterfeited,

382
00:30:15,595 --> 00:30:17,395
Even if it were
among Zhang Boying's authentic works,

383
00:30:17,955 --> 00:30:19,040
it is considered top notch,

384
00:30:19,595 --> 00:30:23,155
If it's an authentic piece,
why did Chu Suiliang let you take it home?

385
00:30:23,835 --> 00:30:24,975
Your husband's writing,

386
00:30:24,975 --> 00:30:26,955
in Chang'an city, is somewhat famous,

387
00:30:28,595 --> 00:30:30,435
Chu Suiliang brought the calligraphy piece
to me,

388
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,995
Of course, he wants me to help him by copying,

389
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:36,315
Yesterday, I went to visit my foster mother,

390
00:30:37,355 --> 00:30:41,155
My foster mother said
that His Majesty intends to depose Queen Wang,

391
00:30:41,155 --> 00:30:44,315
To replace her with Empress Lady Wu,
is this matter true?

392
00:30:46,795 --> 00:30:49,475
Exactly, led by
Chu Suiliang and Chancellor Zhangsun,

393
00:30:49,475 --> 00:30:51,275
the senior officials
at the forefront are vehemently against it,

394
00:30:51,795 --> 00:30:53,795
It seems His Majesty has no choice,

395
00:30:54,675 --> 00:30:56,875
But a lot of effort has been made
both openly and behind the scenes,

396
00:30:57,675 --> 00:31:01,195
This time, the emperor
has made a firm decision,

397
00:31:02,475 --> 00:31:03,835
His Majesty has been enthroned for many years,

398
00:31:04,435 --> 00:31:06,755
But he is still controlled by the ministers
in the court everywhere,

399
00:31:09,035 --> 00:31:10,995
You are the emperor's intimate minister,

400
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:13,235
His Majesty wants to make Lady Wu his queen,

401
00:31:13,755 --> 00:31:16,475
Depending on your and my relationship
with His Majesty and Lady Wu,

402
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:19,635
everyone is convinced that
you will advocate for the deposal of the queen

403
00:31:19,635 --> 00:31:21,635
to help Lady Wu ascend the throne,

404
00:31:22,435 --> 00:31:24,915
But Chu Suiliang and Chancellor Zhangsun
are on the same side,

405
00:31:24,915 --> 00:31:28,395
In theory, they will guard against you,

406
00:31:29,315 --> 00:31:30,336
You're overthinking it,

407
00:31:30,336 --> 00:31:32,635
I will return this calligraphy copybook
sooner or later,

408
00:31:32,635 --> 00:31:34,635
Should we return it to him tomorrow?

409
00:31:36,475 --> 00:31:38,115
No need to rush to return it,

410
00:31:38,115 --> 00:31:40,435
In the next few days,
I want to seriously copy it several times,

411
00:31:50,115 --> 00:31:52,075
Nice,

412
00:31:56,435 --> 00:31:57,915
This is the summer harvest
supplied by the Luoyang farm

413
00:31:57,915 --> 00:31:59,575
to the Pei family descendants,

414
00:31:59,575 --> 00:32:00,835
So much!

415
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,975
<i>[Pei]</i>
Look, So much!

416
00:32:02,975 --> 00:32:04,235
What a huge industry this must be!

417
00:32:24,555 --> 00:32:28,032
Ni, where is the outfit I made
for my mother-in-law?

418
00:32:28,032 --> 00:32:29,075
Remember to bring it,

419
00:32:29,075 --> 00:32:30,176
Yes,

420
00:32:33,795 --> 00:32:36,315
My lady, the manor heads from Luoyang
have arrived,

421
00:32:36,315 --> 00:32:37,615
They've pulled in many carts of silk and cloth,

422
00:32:37,615 --> 00:32:38,995
They are shouting at the gate that

423
00:32:38,995 --> 00:32:41,555
it was the Princess
who sent them with this summer's harvest,

424
00:32:41,555 --> 00:32:43,575
As if
they were afraid others wouldn't hear them,

425
00:32:43,575 --> 00:32:45,695
The neighbors were all bluffed by them,

426
00:32:45,695 --> 00:32:48,115
Everyone is talking about
how extensive our family's assets really are,

427
00:32:48,955 --> 00:32:51,415
Outsiders do not know
how much wealth Shouyue has and

428
00:32:51,415 --> 00:32:52,955
how vast the estates in Luoyang are,

429
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,455
Seeing only these few large carts of things,

430
00:32:55,455 --> 00:32:59,415
they will praise Princess
for her generosity and integrity,

431
00:32:59,415 --> 00:33:01,375
Words fly from mouth to mouth quickly,

432
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:03,015
I'm afraid it won't even take half a day,

433
00:33:03,015 --> 00:33:06,035
The relatives of Pei
should have heard the news,

434
00:33:06,555 --> 00:33:09,755
The day before yesterday,
Lady Lu sent a message from the princess,

435
00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:14,115
She will hold a banquet the day after tomorrow
to alleviate the lady's shock and apologize,

436
00:33:14,115 --> 00:33:16,875
She also wants to invite the female relatives
to the banquet as company,

437
00:33:17,515 --> 00:33:18,995
If this is not a Hongmen Banquet, what is it?

438
00:33:19,795 --> 00:33:22,835
Now they have blatantly sent
over the harvest from the manor

439
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:25,395
in preparation for the Hongmen Banquet
the day after tomorrow,

440
00:33:26,035 --> 00:33:27,595
It's impressive how clearly you see,

441
00:33:28,915 --> 00:33:31,835
If so, respectful obedience is the best course,

442
00:33:31,835 --> 00:33:35,795
Tan, tell them that I have already left,

443
00:33:35,795 --> 00:33:37,095
I went to General Su's residence,

444
00:33:37,095 --> 00:33:39,035
Tell them to just leave the things here,

445
00:33:40,155 --> 00:33:41,184
Yes,

446
00:33:42,155 --> 00:33:45,595
Wait a moment,
tell Gu to prepare the car at the back door,

447
00:33:45,595 --> 00:33:46,656
I'll leave from the back door,

448
00:33:55,204 --> 00:33:58,752
<i>[Su's Residence]</i>

449
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:03,995
I heard Shouyue
that General Su will be back soon,

450
00:34:05,035 --> 00:34:07,835
Liuli specially made this outfit for you,

451
00:34:07,835 --> 00:34:10,995
So, you can greet General Su's return home
beautifully,

452
00:34:12,555 --> 00:34:14,875
Why bother dressing up
when we're old husband and wife?

453
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,895
I heard that the princess

454
00:34:18,895 --> 00:34:22,795
wanted to hold a banquet for you
and the women of the Pei family, is that true?

455
00:34:22,795 --> 00:34:24,895
Stepmother, how well-informed you are,

456
00:34:24,895 --> 00:34:26,195
You heard it so quickly,

457
00:34:27,995 --> 00:34:31,115
It seems that Princess Linhai
deliberately spread the word,

458
00:34:32,835 --> 00:34:34,915
You might as well decline this banquet,

459
00:34:35,435 --> 00:34:37,475
Let her perform a one-woman show by herself,

460
00:34:41,515 --> 00:34:44,355
Even if it's a banquet at Hongmen, I must go,

461
00:34:45,475 --> 00:34:46,560
Why?

462
00:34:47,115 --> 00:34:48,435
Because the princess

463
00:34:48,435 --> 00:34:50,875
deliberately chose the twelfth day
for the family banquet,

464
00:34:51,635 --> 00:34:55,375
The twelfth day? What about the twelfth day?

465
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:57,635
The princess is throwing a family banquet
on the twelfth day,

466
00:34:57,635 --> 00:35:00,635
She didn't just invite me, but also the elders,

467
00:35:01,555 --> 00:35:04,555
Firstly, all of them are elders of Shouyue,

468
00:35:05,195 --> 00:35:07,475
If all of them are going, I must go,

469
00:35:08,355 --> 00:35:12,275
Secondly, the day after the family banquet
is the day of my temple visit,

470
00:35:12,995 --> 00:35:14,555
According to the rituals
of our great Tang Dynasty,

471
00:35:15,075 --> 00:35:18,655
three months after getting married,
the couple should go to the ancestral temple,

472
00:35:18,655 --> 00:35:20,115
After completing this,

473
00:35:20,115 --> 00:35:22,935
I can truly be considered
part of the husband's family,

474
00:35:22,935 --> 00:35:26,075
Only then can I be acknowledged as
the chief wife of the Pei family,

475
00:35:28,995 --> 00:35:30,475
How could I have forgotten this?

476
00:35:31,875 --> 00:35:35,475
The Princess arranged the family banquet
the day before the temple visit,

477
00:35:35,475 --> 00:35:37,555
There must be a crafty intention behind it,

478
00:35:38,195 --> 00:35:39,275
Stepmother, please be at ease,

479
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:43,395
Even if the princess doesn't cause trouble
right now,

480
00:35:43,955 --> 00:35:47,075
she will still continue to plot
against me and Shouyue in the future,

481
00:35:48,075 --> 00:35:49,555
Better a short pain than a long one,

482
00:35:49,555 --> 00:35:51,755
I would like her to give it her all

483
00:35:51,755 --> 00:35:53,375
and use all her dirty tricks,

484
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:56,715
Only then
can I follow the vine to find the melon,

485
00:35:56,715 --> 00:35:59,355
and find a permanent solution to restrain her,

486
00:36:00,715 --> 00:36:03,035
You are still so bold,

487
00:36:13,395 --> 00:36:15,515
The banquet today is indeed sumptuous,

488
00:36:16,155 --> 00:36:18,175
The princess has always treated us well,

489
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:19,595
Yes,

490
00:36:22,195 --> 00:36:24,035
This headpiece
you're wearing is really beautiful!

491
00:36:24,035 --> 00:36:27,155
- Really?
- Yes, it's truly beautiful,

492
00:36:27,155 --> 00:36:28,995
If you see something good next time,

493
00:36:28,995 --> 00:36:30,835
share it with us,

494
00:36:34,955 --> 00:36:36,515
Greetings to all the ladies,

495
00:36:45,315 --> 00:36:48,595
You should sit at the head,

496
00:36:50,515 --> 00:36:52,595
All of you are elders of Liuli,

497
00:36:52,595 --> 00:36:55,035
Isn't it frivolous
if Liuli takes the seat of honor?

498
00:36:56,595 --> 00:36:58,075
The princess is here,

499
00:37:11,115 --> 00:37:12,224
Please, take your seats,

500
00:37:16,635 --> 00:37:19,675
I feel relieved that Liuli comes today,

501
00:37:20,595 --> 00:37:23,035
It's clear she holds no grudges against me,

502
00:37:23,835 --> 00:37:26,115
The princess has really baffled Liuli,

503
00:37:26,795 --> 00:37:28,955
I heard that
the princess has been ill for a while,

504
00:37:29,475 --> 00:37:31,815
I should have come to pay my respects
to the princess earlier,

505
00:37:31,815 --> 00:37:33,515
But I was afraid to disturb your rest,

506
00:37:33,515 --> 00:37:35,035
So I delayed until now,

507
00:37:36,635 --> 00:37:40,155
It's human nature
that you couldn't come over for a visit,

508
00:37:41,315 --> 00:37:44,195
I was momentarily negligent
at the Lotus Banquet,

509
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:46,995
letting you suffer such an injustice,

510
00:37:48,035 --> 00:37:52,515
This cup of wine is
my face-to-face apology to you,

511
00:37:53,235 --> 00:37:56,915
What happened at the Lotus Banquet
was just a misunderstanding,

512
00:37:56,915 --> 00:37:58,395
I have long forgotten it,

513
00:37:59,195 --> 00:38:03,035
This cup of wine,
I should toast to the Grand Princess instead,

514
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:16,315
Today,
I have invited you all here for two matters,

515
00:38:17,235 --> 00:38:20,475
Firstly, is to apologize to Liuli,

516
00:38:21,035 --> 00:38:22,335
Secondly,

517
00:38:22,335 --> 00:38:25,875
there is something
that was not clearly communicated to everyone,

518
00:38:26,395 --> 00:38:29,115
I want to explain its details to you all,

519
00:38:30,155 --> 00:38:33,595
You all know Emperor Gaozu

520
00:38:33,595 --> 00:38:38,335
once entrusted the Luoyang Pei family's property
to Minister Pei,

521
00:38:38,335 --> 00:38:40,075
After Minister Pei,

522
00:38:40,075 --> 00:38:44,075
Hedong Duke and I had no choice
but to manage it for a few years

523
00:38:44,835 --> 00:38:49,635
Over a decade ago, Shouyue finally settled down
and established a career,

524
00:38:50,395 --> 00:38:53,735
Then, I returned this property to Shouyue,

525
00:38:53,735 --> 00:38:58,035
Today, I want to make this clear one more time,

526
00:38:58,995 --> 00:39:03,395
This property was granted by the former Emperor
in honor of Shouyue's father and brothers,

527
00:39:03,395 --> 00:39:06,795
who are loyal to the country
but dead unfortunately,

528
00:39:07,355 --> 00:39:09,955
which was specifically returned to
Shouyue and his mother,

529
00:39:10,475 --> 00:39:13,355
It has nothing to do

530
00:39:13,355 --> 00:39:15,715
with you,

531
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:20,075
In the future, you

532
00:39:20,595 --> 00:39:24,755
can't freeload Shouyue,

533
00:39:26,035 --> 00:39:27,915
How can it be considered freeloading?

534
00:39:29,675 --> 00:39:30,688
But…

535
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:34,695
Princess, you must understand
that we and Shouyue

536
00:39:34,695 --> 00:39:36,755
are all from the Pei of Hedong,

537
00:39:36,755 --> 00:39:40,115
As we share the same roots and lineage,
there is no distinction between you and me,

538
00:39:41,075 --> 00:39:42,915
So how can there be talk of infringement?

539
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:48,675
Liu, do you have something to say?

540
00:39:50,715 --> 00:39:52,995
Princess, as you know,

541
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:56,895
that year, Shouyue's father and brother,
along with those of Zhongjuan, started a rebellion,

542
00:39:56,895 --> 00:40:00,695
The uprising failed,
and Wang Shichong exterminated three clans,

543
00:40:00,695 --> 00:40:02,155
Countless clan members were implicated,

544
00:40:02,795 --> 00:40:06,275
My aunts, uncles, cousins, and my eldest son
who was still in swaddling clothes

545
00:40:06,275 --> 00:40:07,475
all met with a tragic death,

546
00:40:08,355 --> 00:40:11,675
Later, the former Emperor ascended the throne
and gave Shouyue family fortune,

547
00:40:12,235 --> 00:40:14,455
Since Shouyue was the head of
Pei family of Zhongjuan,

548
00:40:14,455 --> 00:40:16,235
He should use this family fortune

549
00:40:16,235 --> 00:40:17,675
to take care of us,

550
00:40:22,355 --> 00:40:24,915
How could I not know what Liu has said?

551
00:40:25,755 --> 00:40:29,455
Back then, I felt that you were truly innocent,

552
00:40:29,455 --> 00:40:33,515
It was only a moment of softheartedness
that I did not disclose this matter,

553
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:36,635
Years have passed in a vague and unclear state,

554
00:40:37,195 --> 00:40:42,375
But now my kindness has not been rewarded,

555
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:45,795
It has even implicated my residence,
as well as all of you

556
00:40:45,795 --> 00:40:47,715
subjected to gossip,

557
00:40:47,715 --> 00:40:51,695
If that's the case,
I'd rather play the villain to the end

558
00:40:51,695 --> 00:40:53,675
to avoid any future entanglement,

559
00:40:54,995 --> 00:40:56,355
Let me repeat it again,

560
00:40:57,995 --> 00:41:01,795
The industry in Luoyang belongs solely
to Pei Shouyue,

561
00:41:02,715 --> 00:41:04,835
It has nothing to do with your clansmen,

562
00:41:07,235 --> 00:41:09,595
If you think my handling is incorrect,

563
00:41:10,355 --> 00:41:12,195
feel free to ask the emperor for a judgment,

564
00:41:13,995 --> 00:41:15,515
If none of you have any objections,

565
00:41:16,195 --> 00:41:17,955
then, don't say that

566
00:41:17,955 --> 00:41:20,135
it's the family property
of Pei family of Zhongjuan,

567
00:41:20,135 --> 00:41:22,315
So as not to be laughed at by others,

568
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:34,395
You had already received the harvest
submitted in Luoyang

569
00:41:34,395 --> 00:41:36,315
the day before yesterday, right?

570
00:41:37,635 --> 00:41:43,675
This summer's earnings are said to
amount to several tens of millions of coins,

571
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:47,195
- That much?
- That's way too much,

572
00:41:47,195 --> 00:41:48,395
Several tens of millions of coins,

573
00:41:49,035 --> 00:41:50,635
- Several tens of millions of coins,
- Exactly,

574
00:41:50,635 --> 00:41:52,755
Wasn't it said
that the past harvests were poor?

575
00:41:53,275 --> 00:41:55,955
It turns out that
Shouyue has been making excuses to us

576
00:41:55,955 --> 00:41:57,435
and monopolizing all these assets,

577
00:42:00,475 --> 00:42:04,055
As expected, you're different from
my adopted daughter,

578
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:05,395
Lu Qi, who is not versed in worldly affairs,

579
00:42:06,435 --> 00:42:08,075
You're smart and quick-witted,

580
00:42:08,715 --> 00:42:10,795
You just took over the family property
of Shouyue

581
00:42:11,475 --> 00:42:13,995
but managed it very well,

582
00:42:14,795 --> 00:42:16,115
I can rest assured with this,

583
00:42:16,755 --> 00:42:19,435
How these properties will be handled
in the future,

584
00:42:20,195 --> 00:42:22,115
It's up to you and Shouyue,

585
00:42:23,395 --> 00:42:24,995
I won't interfere anymore,

586
00:42:25,715 --> 00:42:27,235
Princess, you are too kind,

587
00:42:28,035 --> 00:42:30,995
In the future, Liuli will learn
from the Princess,

588
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:35,035
I will also rely heavily on
all the aunts and sisters-in-law present here,

589
00:42:35,995 --> 00:42:37,395
You don't need to be modest,

590
00:42:38,075 --> 00:42:42,195
After tomorrow, you will become the matron
of the Pei family,

591
00:42:42,755 --> 00:42:46,595
All the ladies present here
are your aunts and sisters-in-law,

592
00:42:46,595 --> 00:42:50,475
I'm afraid they will have to rely on you
to take care of them,
